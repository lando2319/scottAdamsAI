bow
good morning everybody
and welcome
to the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and
there's never been a finer moment
would you like to take it up a level
yeah upper level
and all you need for that is a copper
mug or a glass of tanker cellist iron
again teen Joker flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure that dopamines of the day thing
makes everything better it's cold
simultaneous sip go
and the fed I'm seeing somebody say End
the Fed
well I'd be in favor of that if I knew
what it was
anybody know what the Federal Reserve
does and
[Laughter]
I managed to get a degree in economics
and walk away thinking I'm not entirely
sure what they do
well anyway
let's talk about some of the things in
the news
I was seeing a tweet from Adam Townsend
he was sending people to his blog
now Adam Townsend is another strong
follow on Twitter if you're not
following him you're missing a lot of
different stuff
there are some people on Twitter
who tend to be boosters of things you've
already seen and they're good too
but Adam tends to have completely
different takes on stuff
but in this case I think this is
something some of us saw but forgot in
2020 there was a hack on Twitter
I kind of vaguely remember that
but here here's a detail I did not know
until I read Adam Townsend's uh blog
that he tweeted at today
so apparently that the Twitter was
hacked by a 17 year old and some friends
the 17 year old
and if you wondered how did he crack the
uh the security for Twitter
because you know Twitter's major social
platform obviously obviously they've got
some pretty strong security going on
there
so here's how the 17 year old did it he
called some Twitter employees and said
he was Twitter I.T support and they
asked them for their passwords
[Laughter]
that's not even the best part
that's not even the best part
some of them actually gave gave their
passwords over the phone
foreign
that's not the best part that's not the
best part either the best part is the
best part is
that average employees you know just I
think they're just average employees
gave their passwords
and that was enough to acquire god mode
over the entire network
apparently you could have anybody's
password if they were in engineering and
they gave you God mode over the entire
network
now if you don't believe that's true
uh apparently there is testimony from
somebody who was hired to look into the
security
he testified to Congress this guy named
Mudge was his nickname
and apparently anybody who worked in
engineering had full access to Twitter's
guts
all of the engineers could change
Twitter
do you remember long ago
when I was speculating that the that uh
The Dorsey probably didn't know that
Jack Dorsey probably didn't know
who was doing what with Twitter
do you remember everybody laughed at me
do you remember how you laughed oh how
you laughed come on
Dorsey knows exactly what's going on
there no nope it turns out that every
engineer could have changed the guts of
Twitter had full access
and there's no log of changes
did you hear that
all of the engineers could change the
guts of Twitter
and there was no log of the changes
those are confirmed facts from somebody
whose job it was to look into that stuff
now did you know any of that
did you know any of that somehow I
missed all of that
but it's in the public record it's not
it's not subject to speculation
and apparently you know Twitter is
um built in such a way that it's really
hard to catch up and fix all the
security problems so Elon Musk has has a
big challenge a technical challenge
that's
almost unimaginable in its complexity
but
if anybody could could sort it out at
least the right people are working on it
so that's good
Texas
Governor Abbott is making a clear call
for Universal school choice in Texas
and he wants uh something with education
savings accounts Etc the the big story
here
is I don't think anything's going to
stop it at this point
I I believe that education will just
enter the
private sphere
and the free market will make it work
again
now there will definitely always be
people in public schools I think
but the public schools are going to have
to do something different
to you know to show that they can
compete with private schools but it's
happening
it's happening so it takes a while but
this is a positive trend
all right here's a
macro theme
every time I read a news story
that's really good
like it gives me stuff I didn't know and
it's pointing to actually Source
material and it tells a story that
really gives me the full Rich context
and I finally understand a thing where
did I see it
you tell me
I I saw something with great context and
really good sources where did I see it
Twitter threads by individuals
who are really good at it
why do we know that the Twitter files
because of people like mad type right
individual citizens who look into stuff
and find out why do we know as much as
we do about
you know the real situation with energy
and homelessness and stuff like that
Michael schellenberger Michael
schellenberger is unambiguously
unambiguously the best
I guess you'd call him an individual
who's doing uh journalism
uh for the most breadth of you know
different important topics and the
greatest greatest depth of research
and there's another and I'll talk about
that in a minute Kyle Becker
do you follow follow Kyle Becker
Eddie of Kyle Becker's threads are
better than the news that night
and and it's not just that he's good
he's very good by the way you should
follow him but he's one of now
I would say
close to a dozen
there may be a dozen individuals who
will do
fairly frequent Twitter threads they're
just far better than anything in the
news now some of it
um
yeah anyway
um got distracted there by comment
so let me read you some of these the
things which we're finding all right
this is from Kyle Becker's Twitter
thread
and I've seen this before but Kyle does
a good job of putting it in a real clean
package here
so you all know Bob Woodward right
so Woodward and Bernstein were the two
reporters for the Washington Post who
broke the Watergate story it was a story
that brought down Nixon
and it was Nixon got some burglars to
burglarize a Democrat office in the
Watergate Tower
and got caught and then that brought
down Nixon so
here's an interesting thing we find out
about Bob Woodward right so Bob Woodward
one of the two important people in this
story
interesting
uh this is from Kyle Becker's tweet
Tweeter Twitter thread soon after
leaving the Navy
Woodward was hired by the most powerful
news outlet and given the biggest news
story in the country
so he wasn't a seasoned reporter
but he got a job at the most important
news Outlet or one of the two
and immediately was given one of the
biggest most important uh stories in the
country
how did he get his sources for for that
well the source for the Watergate
um stuff was the deputy directory of the
FBI Mark felt
who also was known to run the FBI
co-intel Pro program
which was designed to discredit
political actors and the federal
agencies that they want to destroy
such as Richard Nixon
um
and by the way there was a lawyer who
was working on the staff of the
Judiciary Committee during the Nixon
inquiry do you know who that was there
was an attorney working on that
it was a Hillary Clinton
it was Hillary Clinton
um
and then Kyle sums it up this way so he
goes so if you watch the Deep State
Panic during the Trump years the Russia
hoax orchestrated by Hillary Clinton
two Trump impeachment hoaxes January 6
charade fbra mar-a-laga raid and now the
Biden classified document scandal don't
be surprised
they've been doing this for a very long
time
it's all true the Watergate was
Watergate was just an FBI deep state
project to take Nixon out now Nixon
probably you know did it in fact
authorize it so he committed a crime but
my current belief
subject to you know I suppose I could
change my mind later but I always
believed until maybe a year or so ago
that Watergate was just what it looked
like
two and two Intrepid reporters
you know dug into it got this scoop took
down the president
turns out it was actually a deep State
operation
the whole thing was
it was a deep State operation and
Hillary Clinton was right in the middle
of it and it's apparently what there's
just a pattern that they just do over
and over again they create hoaxes and
they have enough power in the media to
sell them now do you remember all the
time that Bernstein became just a joke
because he would come on CNN and say
that anything Trump did was worse than
Watergate
and I thought to myself
how could this guy who seems so dumb and
so biased have been one of the crack
reporters that worked with Woodward
because I thought well it must have been
Woodward who was the smart one
because the other guy is obviously an
idiot like when you see him on TV he's
just
it looks like he's just working for a
treat or something it doesn't even look
like you there's a functioning brain
going on there
and
and when and now when you see that
there's uh let's say some interesting
history to the other one you can see
that the two of them
we're just part of some deep State
operation apparently apparently now it
turns out that Trump is suing Woodward
for 49 million dollars
for using Trump's audio tapes out of
context apparently Trump says he'd only
authorized the audio tapes for the
purpose of writing the book but when the
audio tapes are shown on their own
and out of context because they always
would be having context they're
misleading and make them look bad now I
don't think he can win that case
probably not but it does show you that
Woodward is
sketchy
because I do believe without even
hearing the audio tapes
I I feel a high level of confidence with
no knowledge
that they're misleading and that they're
designed to make Trump look bad do you
have any doubt about that
do you have any doubt about that
I don't think so
all right um
here's uh
here's my take on the cartels and what's
happening with fentanyl and all that
stuff
go into the Whiteboard
so we're sort of in an interesting race
here
so I would say if you look at you know
uh the odds of going to war with the
cartels well the more people who die of
Fentanyl
and the fact that politicians on both
sides bipartisan are both talking about
it
the odds of War are going to go to 100
percent unless something intervenes
would you agree
that if there's no other outside forces
the odds of war and direct attack of the
cartels is a hundred percent now we're
not there
we're probably down here
probably down and around I don't know 25
percent
but that will grow the more people who
die from Fentanyl and the more military
militaristic the cartels look but the
trouble is one assumes that the cartels
with their tens of billions of dollars
are already buying up our politicians
because why wouldn't they
what would stop them
seriously what would stop them
they know that the United States is
going to come for them the only way they
can stop it because they can't beat us
militarily is to stop us politically
so you don't think that they're already
building an entire base of bought off
politicians now they may be starting at
the state the city level you know like
Council people and stuff and trying to
like get control of them and then later
they become you know higher up in
politics
so it could be what China's doing
you know China would find a Eric
swalwell
and then they would say you know I think
this person might get elected to higher
office so they make friends when he's
he's still at the city level right you
don't think the cartels are doing that
with tens of billions of dollars their
biggest mortal risk is not Mexico
because they already control Mexico
their biggest risk is the United States
do you think they're just waiting
do you think the cartels are just
waiting oh we'll just keep making money
nothing will happen to us no they know
we're coming for them
they know we're coming
so they've got to buy our politicians as
quickly as possible my estimate is we
have three to five years
in three to five years the cartels will
effectively control our government
because that's their only play
and there there's no level of risk they
wouldn't be willing to take to get that
done
am I right
there's no level of risk that they would
they would walk away from this is a
mortal risk this ends them completely
they have to buy their way to control
the government they have to
you don't think they know that
of course they do
the mafia knows it they but they already
bought the government of of uh Mexico
do you think that they bought the entire
government in Mexico and it never
occurred to them maybe by a little bit
of the government of the United States
with their billions of dollars they
never thought of it
of course I did and of course they're
doing it and they're doing it as fast as
they can if we don't beat this window
and take him out before they have too
much control of the government we'll
never be able to do it
so
when you see when you see Dan Crenshaw
say we should go in militarily the one
thing I can know for sure
no matter what else you want to
criticize Crenshaw for he's not been
bought off
would you agree
he clearly he hasn't been bought off
because he's he's going after him
likewise there are a number of other
people you can say have definitely not
been bought off right Trump has
definitely not been bought off yeah you
can call it Crenshaw whatever you want
I'm not I'm not in that conversation I'm
just saying there are some people
at least on the Democrat side for sure
I'm sorry on the Republican side and at
least one Democrat who have definitely
not been bought off
definitely not
but that's not going to last
you know I I don't believe that Biden
I mean do you think Biden hasn't been
bought off
look look at what Hunter's been doing
collecting money from other countries
you don't think that Hunter found a way
to make some cartel money
man I don't have any evidence to suggest
he did but wouldn't that be the most
obvious place to get your money and
wouldn't it be the only thing to explain
why
um
why Biden seems to be doing whatever the
cartels want because he's not really
taking the Border seriously and he's not
taking the cartel seriously he's not
taking him even a little bit seriously
the the evidence would strongly suggest
that Biden's been compromised
via Hunter
now here's the here's the world we live
in
I just gave her this whole long list of
all the hoaxes if you've seen my list of
you know over 20 hoaxes
and we know the pattern and how things
are done
shouldn't you assume
with no evidence whatsoever
just based on what you can see this not
in question it's not in question that
Biden is doing a poor job of border
security there's no question about that
some people think it's a preference but
there's no question about you know that
a lot of people are coming across the
border
you have to assume at this point that
that the cartels have some kind of
Leverage on Biden
is that is that fair or unfair now again
when you talk about a government the
government is guilty until they can
prove through
some kind of transparency that they're
not guilty they're not people
if it were if we're people they're
innocent until proven guilty
if it's a government and they have a a
multi-decade pattern
of being corrupt
which is well demonstrated
from Watergate all the way to through
you know Google and Twitter ringing the
last election
so there's no question about whether
this is a group of people who do corrupt
things on a regular basis Democrats
now I'm not I'm not going to say that no
Republicans done anything corrupt right
but but I'm just looking at this
particular pattern the Democrats have
been running hoaxes and
and plans and Ops against the American
appeal public for decades
and we know it we're not guessing we
know it
so you have to assume that the only
reason that Mexico is not being handled
is that it's got to be
and I'm open to be proven wrong
but my assumption is
since it's obvious
assume the obvious
assume the obvious
and by the way that would be an amazing
thing for Trump to say
Imagine This
you know the cartels are trying to bribe
American politicians
would everybody say that's true
they would right you know they are at
least at the local level
so here's something Trump could say you
know the cartels are trying to bribe
people
you know that there's no explanation for
why Biden is doing so poorly on the
border and against Fentanyl
assume the obvious
just imagine Trump saying that
assume it's exactly what it looks like
that's all he has to say
just say assume it's exactly what it
looks like
and he's done and walk away
just say here's the setup
just assume it's exactly what you see
and vote accordingly
you know I'll take on the cartels he
isn't
and there's only one reason
there's only one reason
and his name is Hunter
now I don't have proof of it but you
don't need it he's demonstrated that
this is how they that they've
demonstrated that this is how they act
just assume is true you don't even need
evidence this is so obviously
you know the pattern that they follow
it's up to them to prove it's not true
right
you can't take on the cartel money
all right uh next story uh British
Columbia
they're they're going to change the law
so that they're not arresting anybody
for heroin cocaine meth fentanyl or
ecstasy
now Elon Musk actually responded to that
and he said all things considered this
is uh the better approach in my opinion
do you think it's a better approach to
decriminalize
all of those hard drugs and and The
Possession so I think dealing is
probably still illegal about ordinary
possession would not be in fact they
won't even take it off you they won't
even confiscate it
so here's the problem with this issue
the problem with this issue is that we
we have a binary brain
we all have binary brains and the things
we understand are it's illegal it's
illegal or
it's not it's not illegal
and then our brain stops
so since you've seen examples where
legalizing things totally didn't work
and you only have two buckets you'll uh
don't give me any Nuance there are only
two buckets
so if you know that there are there
definitely are examples where
legalization totally failed well that's
all you need to know
only two buckets
but of course in the real world how many
different ways would there be to
change the drug laws
without screwing the pooch
probably lots of ways
who knows if this is a small part of
something bigger or it's just one thing
they're doing
now I do agree that putting these people
in jail doesn't make any difference
I don't think that that they go to jail
clean up and then go to go on to live
good lives
but if that is true that'd be
interesting
you know I could be convinced I don't
believe that's true
but I also don't believe any data on
anything anymore so if you had data I
wouldn't believe it anyway but it seems
to me that if you put somebody in jail
who had not otherwise been in jail
now they have a jail record
on top of their addicts even if they
stopped they're still you know that
right just because you stop using
that doesn't make you not an addict you
always have that problem forever
so it seems like you're taking one
problem and turning it into two problems
one is you're a drug addict and now
you've got a criminal record so good
luck do you know what I would do if I
were a drug addict and I'd cleaned up
and then I tried to get a job with my
criminal record and I couldn't you know
what I'd do I would deal drugs
that's what I do
no I'm not joking
absolutely I would go to the criminal
side I would sell drugs because that
would be my best career move
and I'm already living this risky life
and I take drugs to make me feel good so
now I've got money
I don't care about the ethics of it I
just go sell drugs and to me that's what
I would do
literally that's what I would do
literally that there's no hyperbole here
if I had a criminal record because of
drugs I would become a drug dealer
I would wouldn't you
it's just the rational choice so
I can see Elon musk's point
they're taking somebody who's got one
crushing problem in life and adding a
second crushing problem
logically that
that doesn't seem to read the right
approach now suppose
suppose you legalized it so you'd at
least remove the one crushing problem
but you did more about helping people
have treatment or even living maybe
helping them live somewhere where
they're away from the rest of the public
so you don't want to do what San
Francisco did to create an actual
physical Zone where you can all go in
and shoot drugs maybe the worst idea
ever
possibly the worst idea of all time and
let's put it right in the middle of our
beautiful city
that depends on you know tourism
worst idea
best idea
might be
we're going to legalize it but we're
also going to legalize ketamine and
mushrooms and other treatments
you go to a
H you want to hear something about rehab
that I heard the other day
I heard this from a reliable source
uh apparently the government will pay
for your rehab did you know that if
you're poor I'm not sure if it's
Medicaid or
whatever it is but you know the
government will pay to put you in
Medicare if you don't have money right
now I didn't know that either but
apparently and I don't know if it's just
California I don't know the details
might be just California
but
is it Medicare or Medicaid
is one of them but it's but it's a real
medical problem
and we do give medical treatment to
people in medical problems
right even if they don't have insurance
so
here's what's happening and I'm told
this is widespread
a rehab will of course want people to go
there and the government will pay
so there are there are body people
people who go out and find addicts and
they talk them into going to rehab
so far so good right
no problem with that go get some go go
talk the the addicts into rehab they go
into rehab and then the government pays
the bill and the rehab is happy
right and then the person who went in
there presumably they would be happy
wouldn't you say because they got free
rehab pretty good deal
except
the people that are gathered up are
people who do not want to be straight
they're paid
to go to rehab
yep they pay them to go to rehab
with no expectation that anybody will
try to fix them as soon as they're out
if they do their two weeks or whatever
it is
do you know what the body person does
scores them some drugs right away
so they can be the person you bring back
in again
you if you get them high as soon as
they're out
you already have their contact
information you know who they are you
know that they've said yes once to
taking a check to pretending to be in
rehab so they go and they pretend to be
in rehab again
it turns out there's some large part I
don't know the percentage Yeah I'm sure
there are also plenty of completely
ethical rehab places but the whole
industry has got a problem
that it looks like the way the money
Works they don't have an incentive to
fix anybody they have an incentive to
pump the same addicts through their
system as often as possible
now I'm also not aware of any rehab that
works
I'm just I realize that's controversial
I'm not aware of any of the work
and in California anyway there's a lot
of belief that there's some kind of
support services for addicts there
really isn't
you can look as hard as you want there
won't be any there's nothing you're
pretty much on your own
so
imaginative British Columbia did the
following things and I'm not saying they
will I'm just making a larger case that
there's a right way and a wrong way to
do stuff
the wrong way was
um I think some European countries did
free needles and stuff didn't work out
as well as they wanted San Francisco did
the free needle Zone totally disaster
right so there are lots of bad ways to
legalize drugs
but imagine a good way
just imagine
that they said we're not going to arrest
you and in addition
for free we could put you through one of
these uh
psychedelic
facilities that will give you different
drugs
and make you not care about
taking drug hard drugs later
so compare these two things
hey I'm going to take you to rehab let's
let's see put your self in the mind of
an addict for a moment and I come to you
say hey addict I got a deal for you
we're going to take away the thing that
you care about the most your drugs
but we're going to replace that with a
sterile environment in which we take
away all of your other forms of
entertainment
and it's really going to hurt
but on the plus side we'll talk to you
we'll do some talking
and that talking might help but probably
not
so you're going to go to the worst place
in the world while you'll feel worse
than you've ever felt before how about
that huh huh sign up everybody good come
on come on it's going to be terrible
it's going to be hell on Earth come on
in
all right now compare that
compare that
to I got another option
instead of taking the Fentanyl and the
cocaine
how would you like to try this thing
called ketamine
or this thing called mushrooms oh you've
done mushrooms okay so so you're already
comfortable with that I'll tell you what
we'll do
we'll take you from the drugs you're on
which are awesome
but we're going to put you on some other
awesome drugs pretty awesome
these might be so awesome that you won't
even need those other ones anymore yeah
I've been here about this thing called
ibogaine but I don't know what that is I
don't know anything about that but I've
heard it a few times
now which one do you take you're an
addict
does the addict take hell on Earth
or I guess some other good drugs you're
going to like them a lot
seriously
have I made my point
we know that we know the drug
intervention is very strong
we we know the drug intervention you
know using psychedelics very strong in
terms of cure rates and fixing people
and this sounds like fun frankly
if I'm an addict and you tell me I can
do these other drugs and it might make
me not even care about the ones I was
doing
I'm all about that I'd be all over that
wouldn't you
remember you're already a drug addict if
you're already a drug addict you're not
saying no to ketamine or or mushrooms or
Ayahuasca or whatever they're going to
use DMT I don't know
so
all I want to make I'm just going to
make one point if you're still living in
the world of two buckets you know this
is the Greg gotfeld point the the was
the prison of two ideas if you're in the
prison of two ideas then legalizing
looks like the worst thing anybody ever
thought of because it never works
but the very moment you say well what
would work
and why don't we add that to the
legalizing part
it starts getting easy
am I wrong
that the solution is sort of easy
you just have to make it voluntary and
offer a drug related
course
that we know works
so I think we might be closer to
something but I'm not in favor of
turning drug addicts into criminals
for some purposes of our own I guess I
don't know why we do that
all right here's another great Thread
about Google
this is from kanakawa and then from his
sub stack now I've I've mentioned him
before if you want to look for him in
Twitter so he would be one of the long
Twitter threads this is useful you know
as a like a Adam Townsend or Michael
schellenberger Matt taibi so you know
it's that level of high quality
uh journalism I guess but Twitter
journalism
and I won't read it all but basically
um we know for sure that Google
manipulated search results and
manipulated things to her job
so there's a long body of evidence
that's you know incontrovertible at this
point so we know for sure
that the 2020 election and presumably
the others maybe were subject to huge
manipulation by both Twitter and Google
now does anybody anybody have any doubt
that manipulating those two platforms
changes an election
does anybody think oh that won't change
anything
there's nobody believes that right then
there is a professor I can't remember
his name
but uh
we figured out you know the ratio of how
much
a biased search platform would change
your outcomes it would be a lot you know
there are things that have just
disappeared
you know they just they just can't find
them if you look for them
so here's what I think Trump should do
if you're talking about the platforms
Twitter and Google and you could extend
that to some others is there any
question that the that the elections
recently have been rigged
uh if he if you take out of the mix the
ballot counting questions
and just say
you could just even forget that do you
know why I think there's a good chance
that the elections were not rigged in
terms of the vote counting in the
ballots do you know the best argument
for why the election probably wasn't
rigged
here it comes
the best argument for why the actual
vote counting was straight
is they didn't need to
because they had already rigged the the
law fair
right they changed the rules
they had already rigged Google they had
already rigged Twitter and they rigged
the entire media
they probably didn't need to
because all of those ratings are
apparently legal
Am I Wrong everything we found out about
Google everything we found about Twitter
nobody's going to jail
those are just things we wish hadn't
happened so I think I think Trump his
strongest play would be you know we
should always we should be working hard
toward more transparency in the
elections but you know what the question
of whether they counted the votes right
probably doesn't even matter
because
Twitter and Google and the the media
they largely moved the needle more than
some cheating would have because you I
don't think you can cheat enough
in an election
to you know move the needle that much I
mean you'd have to perfectly cheat in
just the key areas where everybody's
looking for the cheating it's kind of
hard
it's kind of hard
but the stuff they did with the social
media platforms was easy
and legal
and the stuff that the the News lies
about every day is easy lying is easy
and and legal the news can lie to you
all day long but it's not even illegal
right so
I cope
so I think
I think Trump should say that the
elections have been rigged by the social
media and and the media
and then say you know we're still
looking into whether the election itself
was rigged but we need more transparency
there all he'd have to do is tone it
down
and and emphasize the part that
everybody can see with their own eyes is
is definitely in evidence
that it was rigged if rigging doesn't
mean miscounting the votes and it only
means rigging the brainwashing
so I think you can use the word rigging
without any
um explanation beyond that
what do you think
yeah and we we expect more rigging in
the future
so Google actually have a list of things
that they were suppressing at the same
time that their CEO was saying oh we
don't do that they actually had a list
of websites and individuals that they
suppressed
absolutely did the thing they said we
absolutely don't do and they were doing
it really hard
well I'll say they don't do it
all right
um
so
uh Rasmussen says that a majority of
people want to see a lab leak
investigation about the
about the virus so two-thirds of likely
us voters want to want to see some kind
of a investigation
um and let's say 49 say it's very likely
that the virus came from a lab leak 49
percent
um
what do you think would be uh
roughly the percentage who don't think
it's likely the virus came from the
Chinese land
anybody want to take a guess at that
before I tell you
I'll bet you could get it within five
percent
let's see if you can do it I'll see if
you can get it within five percent
that'll be your
test
looks like we lost comments here on the
locals platform we got a little bug
which will now be corrected
I think
nope
apparently not
so it looks like locals is not working
at the moment comments
all right
sorry locals the locals app has
crapped out so the videos here but I
can't see your comments for some
reason
God damn it
all right
um
they're so annoying
that yeah it's funny that there's so
much live streaming and podcasting and
there's still no platform
that can just
live stream and just work
it just doesn't exist yet it's amazing
all right
um I did a deep dive into long covet to
see what the latest is and here's what I
determined because you know some people
say long covet isn't real some people
say it's not only real it's huge
but I did a deep dive and here's what I
found
um
in one movie uh long covet is totally
real and ruining lots of lives
and many and many studies support that
view
so that's in one movie so if you do a
Google search you'll find that
that
long covet is real it's it's affecting a
lot of people and it's ruined in their
lives you can also find
studies that say long covet is imaginary
and that when you test people's vitals
they say they have long covered it kind
of looks like the average person
so it's probably all in their minds
so
um
these two movies will never be
reconciled do you know why
do you know why we'll never know if long
covid was devastating a generation of
people
or absolutely imaginary why will we
never know that
because we don't have to
those two those two movies can live
forever
because they're both consistent and you
can live within them without any
problems
so if you get sick and you believe it's
long covered
it doesn't matter if it is or not
you'll just go along with your life
you'll tell your friend it was long
covered but you'll treat it
based on the symptoms
whether was long covered or not long
covered you'd probably treat it the same
way based on the specific symptoms
so the people who will believe they have
long coveted
will go through life
they can interact with you there's no
penalty
if they were wrong and likewise the
people who say there's no long covet
they get sick they go to the doctor
the doctor says I think you have long
covet
and the other person says or just a
headache
and then they treat you for the headache
or whatever it is
and then you never need to know if it
was long covered
long covet never needs to be solved
because everybody can live in a in a
complete movie
where it's devastating or it's a nothing
and
and somehow we still can procreate and
have babies which is all Evolution ever
cared about
anyway so
um and this dovetails with uh one of my
critics who was right about everything
Mike Hart and he he told me that when he
looked into the
situation of getting vaccinated or not
he said quote
it was Sybil it was a simple decision
it was simple because he looked at the
government not testing the thing as well
as they could
and then the coercion
if you take those two things not tested
you know it's a novel thing hasn't been
tested enough and they coerce you to
take it
it's a simple decision
what do you think
agree
it's simple I mean those two things tell
you everything you need and I would
agree
because uh long covet seemed complicated
to me because it was either the biggest
factor or no Factor at all
but my car handled that by simply
ignoring it
and that turned out to be the right
answer
so if you simply ignored the biggest
variable that mattered to the decision
because I don't think any of us were too
worried about dying you know the odds of
dying were actually pretty low for most
of us so I wasn't worried about dying
but the biggest variable this long covet
if you just act like it's not even there
it simplifies everything
does it
wouldn't you agree
and that's as simple as you can get
you know just ignore the biggest
variable and if you did that for every
decision
imagine how easy it would be
just ignore the biggest factor in every
decision
and that would simplify everything
it's a good recommendation and
importantly people like Mike Hart need
to simplify the following which is you
look at the vares report
and you'd see there's just way tons of
people complaining about theirs which
would suggest that the the vaccination
itself
is causing damage that's higher than
usual
so it's really simple you just look at
the Vera's report
but you can simplify it even more by not
looking at all the studies about long
covet
and that simplifies it so if you look at
the various report and you don't look at
the
counterbalancing risk of long covet just
ignore it
everything's simpler and that gets you
the right answer so that's not the way I
would have necessarily known to go I
would have looked at all the variables
especially the biggest one
but ignoring the biggest variable did
get you the the best answer and the
right the right answer
very non non-obvious and that's why I
got it all wrong
herd immunity
now this is something I'm hearing for
the first time
wait are you saying that a previous
infection to a virus could give you some
kind of natural immunity
I'm hearing this for the first time is
that is that true
because I need somebody to tell me that
every five minutes for the rest of my
 life
because I just can't remember it for
five minutes
wait I'm forgetting it again
somebody needs to remind me
is natural immunity real
all right
yeah I I so my bottom line on all this
is it does appear that the worst
conspiracy theories about big Pharma
were probably true
would you agree with that
would you agree that your conspiracy
theories about big Pharma they look like
they were completely true
that there wasn't enough not enough
safety and maybe too much about money
totally true so pretty much all of our
everything you suspected
except maybe Chemtrails I'm not so sure
about Chemtrails but it feels like
everything you suspected was true
yeah it's not literally true that
everything you suspected but it feels
like it doesn't it actually feels the
depopulation for it
sure sure and the wef is
trying to
track you and control you let's accept
it all
right
um
that is all for now and unfortunately I
can't spend time with the locals people
because the comments are broken I
haven't seen any of your comments in a
while I don't know if you can see them
actually I'm going to sign off on
sign off on YouTube and then I'm gonna
see if I can get my comments back
and thanks for joining bye for now
