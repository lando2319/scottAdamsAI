okay everybody
it's time it's time for coffee with
scott adams
and i think you know it's the best part
of the day
sometimes you'll say to yourself hey i
think this part of the day is a little
bit better than
no no you catch yourself don't you you
just catch yourself and say no it's not
better than
coffee with scott adams that that
doesn't even make sense
in what world could that be true and if
you'd like to take it up a level
to see what it's all about because a lot
of you are just lurkers
and you don't do the simultaneous sip
and you're thinking i
i don't see what this is all about i
don't understand it
but if you did the simultaneous sip oh
you'd be plugged in
you'd get it then and all you need is a
couple of margaret glasses tanker
chelsea's dinah canteen jogger flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes
everything better yeah it's called the
simultaneous sit but it's gonna happen
right now go
wow so good so good
yes we've got lurkers and we've got
slurpers as pointed out in the comments
know which one you are be it be a
slurper not a lurker
that's a bumper sticker we can all
believe in
all right i'm going to add a couple of
flags for cognitive dissonance as you
know
i've told you a few things that people
say that they consistently say
when they're experiencing cognitive
dissonance
and so for example i've told you before
when somebody starts a sentence with
so you're saying that snow
is made of metal you probably never
said snow is made of metal it's that
so you're saying that's always the tip
off
that somebody's starting to hallucinate
but here's another one i saw today on
twitter you've seen it too in various
forms in various places
and it goes like this quote the data
is very clear now i will allow
that there are situations in which the
data is very clear
does smoking cigarettes cause lung
cancer
yes the data is very clear
but there are some situations in which
the phrase
the data is very clear is nothing but a
big old signal
that you're having a mental breakdown
you might not know it
but you're hallucinating so if you're
talking about
the pandemic and you're talking about
any data about anything
the effectiveness of vaccinations the
risk of the vaccination itself the mass
the the rates of infection the testing
any of it
any of it at all if you're willing to
look into that big old mess
and say the data is very clear
i'm sorry yes you pedantic
the data are very clear
yes data data is plural
so the data are very clear so all of you
pedantic
you're right yeah you're right but
may i make a plea from those of us in
the
writer author class which i put
myself in do you know how
things become common usage it's because
people like me
make them common usage if you don't have
a professional writer who's willing to
write
something that isn't quite perfect
grammar it's never going to become
common usage
it'll just be incorrect speech until
somebody like me
endorses it so i
uh i hereby endorse
the data is and now
it enters common usage that's a power
that you don't have
because you're not a famous author but
if you were a famous author
you could take things which are
incorrect grammar move them into common
usage
simply by using them let's see if that
works
all right but anyway if you think the
data is very clear
on anything in the coronavirus world
you are experiencing cognitive
dissonance now here's the fun part
you could be right in other words your
opinion of whatever is
true could be totally right but if you
think the reason you're right
is because the data is
very clear that's
not even thinking there's something else
going on
some kind of a hallucination you're just
joining your team or something like that
and you could be right by coincidence
but it's not because the data
is very clear that's certainly not
happening
all right um
here's a tweet i said yesterday i said a
reminder that the courts have found no
evidence of widespread
voter fraud in the 2020 election you'd
all agree that's true right
the courts have now found that but
here's a second reminder
if an election system is designed
intentionally designed such that you
can't complete an audit
meaning that there would be elements
that can't be audited
if you design it that way
you're designing it for widespread fraud
would anybody disagree with that
statement if you design a system
and you know by the nature of your
design before you've even implemented it
you know that it will be unauditable
what is what kind of thing have you
created well you've created something
that has either the intention of being
fraud
or the inevitable outcome
so here we have a system that apparently
can be audited
because we're learning that as there are
attempts to do it
specifically i'm talking about the
electronic part you can't really audit
some of the things that have been
deleted you can't audit
the software that was actually running
at the time of the election
you just basically can't get into the
proprietary stuff
of your own election it's your own
election
and you can't look at how it was done
because it's proprietary
right if you design the system that way
you're designing widespread fraud
you only don't the only thing you don't
know is if it hasn't happened yet
right because it's going to happen you
designed the system to get that outcome
so um
let's always keep those two things in
mind the courts have found no widespread
no widespread fraud in the election
none they have found no widespread fraud
but it is a system designed to create it
either already or fairly soon
there's no way around it really
bjorn lomborg who is a famous uh
name in the climate change world
i don't want to say he's a skeptic
because he believes climate change is
real when
humans are causing it but
he is skeptical of some of the doom
projections and he points out that did
you know this
that even according to the ipcc the most
official climate change people
that even according to them the
hurricanes are not getting stronger
or at least they can't detect that they
are
did you know that that they can't really
find that in the data
because you know the data is not very
clear
yeah the data is not very clear
as uh bjorn points out now maybe someday
that will happen
now i believe that also he said
somewhere that something like
the death from natural disasters have
decreased
something like 99 percent that's right
the things we're most worried about from
climate change
are things that have happened for
natural reasons forever
and we're so good at mitigating the risk
by building our air conditioning and
learning how to build
buildings that don't fall down in
earthquakes and survive hurricanes and
all that
we're at the point where we've reduced
the risk by 99
from some historical high
so keep that in mind
the data is not very clear
all right um let's talk about uh
hunter's laptop
tucker carlson was going after him again
and he said uh so were the huge number
of emails and texts from hunter biden
explaining how he was selling access
to his father now is that
true i've seen some of the emails but
not all of them
would you conclude that it is a true
statement with no ambiguity
that hunter biden's emails explained how
he was selling access to his father
would you say that they say that
directly
yeah selling access is
sort of a hyperbolic way to say he was
well he was selling access
and then there's something yeah
something about 10 going to the big guy
um so there are really
some things happening there that appear
to be crimes
to my you know non-legal mind they
look like crimes to me but
what's going on there like why is it
that
you know we're in a situation where you
know trump
is in legal jeopardy for something
that's a
employee benefits tax issue that
normally would be a fine and probably
not that unusual in corporate america
but joe bohanja biden not even
not even investigated or anything
marushi says i often argue that people
can't be that dumb when it comes to
crimes and such but there are lots of
examples where people are that dumb
all right i'll take that comment um
so here's the thing what would happen
let me give you a hypothetical
what would happen if ex-president trump
gets indicted or prosecuted
for these financial crimes alleged
financial crimes that normally would
just be a fine or something like that
what if he got jail time and what if
hunter biden was never even indicted or
investigated
like what would that do to the country i
feel as
if the legal system just can't give us
that result
because it would be too destabilizing
so i don't feel as if the legal system
has
anything to do with these two cases do
you
do you think the legal system will be
who decides if trump gets prosecuted
not really i mean it's going to be a
political process
even if there's a jury they're going to
be just acting politically
and then the hundred biden thing is just
purely political so
we have these two high-profile cases
that may or may not be any crimes
involved in either one so
let me give the let me give the
presumption of innocence
to both entities presumption of
innocence to president trump
same same extended to hunter biden
because we we want to live in a country
where the presumption of innocence
is still meaningful but i don't see that
the legal system is going to make any of
these decisions it just looks like
the political system will decide who
gets investigated and who goes to jail
so there's your country right there all
right let's talk about
vaccine misinformation as it's called
jen saki
talking for the white house said
and you've heard this story of course
there's about 12 people she says
that are producing 65 of anti-vaccine
information and they remain active on
facebook
who are the 12 people and i'm very
curious
is alex berenson one of the 12
or are his takes not considered
you know the the crazy ones because i
think
for example the claim that the
vaccination could make you
unable to have children or something i
don't know that
somebody like alex berenson's ever said
anything like that
because i don't think the data suggests
that but
so i know he's still on he's still on
twitter
but what would it take to get into that
category of the 12 people who who the
white house thinks should be banned from
facebook
oh i am on facebook but i don't really
use it i just use it to
look at some family pictures and stuff
um
i think twitter suspended it i think
alex berenson got maybe
temporarily suspended but he's there
today
and i'm just wondering where they're
going to draw the line
because i think we would all agree that
there are people spreading
misinformation about vaccines right
would anybody disagree that that exists
that it's a thing that no matter what
you think to be true about vaccinations
would you also agree that there are
people spreading misinformation
does anybody disagree with that i mean
that's just basic right
it's the internet so people are
spreading misinformation
but we really need a list of those 12
people
has anybody produced that yeah who are
the 12
because we're talking about it in the
abstract and we shouldn't be doing that
i mean it's okay to talk about the
abstract but we have
you know 12-ish specific names
somebody says it has been published the
list was published on local oh here we
go
i'm seeing somebody post the uh list on
uh okay here we go youtube i'm gonna be
reading this from a comment
over on the locals platform subscription
platform where you can
follow me and other people for a
subscription
um they can post images in the comments
which is a big advantage over youtube so
i'm looking at one of the images
um it looks like the names are uh
joseph mercola robert f kennedy jr
a democrat okay uh ty and charlene
bollinger
sherry tenpenny rizza islam
rasheed batar aaron elizabeth
sayer g j.i kelly brogan
i've heard of her christian northrop
ben tapper and kevin jenkins
all right uh
ben tapper that's interesting no
relation to
anybody we know i'm sure so
some emma says nope it's all truths so
i've only heard of
a few of those names and i don't know
how much of their information i've seen
i feel like none i don't feel like i've
seen any of their tweets or anything
have you
all right so thank you for pasting that
in there that was really helpful
all right so those are the 12 people i'd
love to see what they're saying
or what their specific misinformation is
but i don't know that the internet is
going to miss any of them
right now as i've often said critics
are are a national asset
right so i talk about alex berenson
fairly often
because i feel like i disagree with him
a lot more than i agree
and yet you need him
right you need you need somebody to do
what he's doing
which is to be super skeptical about
everything
because you just need that some somebody
has to occupy that space right
and he does that so i'm glad he's not on
the list
even though i find myself disagreeing
with him more than agreeing
all right let's talk about persuasion
and how the bind administration is doing
on the vaccinations
are you ready to be deeply offended
because that's coming up there are some
things i do
which i know in advance aren't going to
go down well with my audience
but on the other hand it is why you come
here
all right if it hurts a little bit
it's probably you know what you signed
up for okay
and here's what's going to hurt i'm
going to
disagree with what the biden
administration is doing
but i'm going to complement them for the
the leadership and the technique can you
handle that
can you handle that i don't like what
they're doing but the
mechanism they're using the skill that
they're using
it's pretty good let's talk about that
so cdc director walensky said and
apparently this is going to be sort of
their their branding
message that this is becoming a pandemic
of the unvaccinated
does that sound familiar
do you ever wonder if the democrats ever
watch
the communicators that are more
associated with the right
and i would say i'm in that category
even though i don't associate myself
with the right
but in terms of my audience yes
do you remember i got in trouble for a
tweet saying that if you're vaccinated
or if you're unvaccinated you're in a
pandemic but if you're vaccinated
it's just wednesday you remember i did
that tweet and it got a lot of attention
and i did hear from some people at let's
say senior levels
not democrats that that tweet got a lot
of attention
and today i'm saying that the main
message coming out of the
the biden administration is basically a
rewording of that idea
that this is a pandemic of the
unvaccinated
so i didn't do that intentionally
and as i've told you and i mean this by
the way i'm
i'm deadly serious about this i am not
trying
to persuade anybody on vaccinations that
would be completely unethical
i'm not a doctor but i certainly can
talk about it
can't i is it unethical for me to simply
give you my opinion
or to tell you that i'm vaccinated or
what set of
uh risks and risks and benefits i
considered
because my risks and rewards are not
yours
so i can say well i thought it made
sense from my
psychology and all things considered but
that's not a recommendation for you
if you're 20 years old and healthy
your situation isn't mine you're in a
different state your situation isn't
mine
so don't take my example as
as persuasion but i am also aware of the
fact that it has that effect
but it's not intentional seriously it's
not intentional
it would i would consider it deeply
unethical and inappropriate on every
level
if i were trying to influence you on you
know a
medical decision that's way beyond my
you know
my expertise so
you can look at my decisions and you can
say with what you like about them etc
and make your own decisions
but we could also talk about what's true
and try to figure that out
now i'm not going to get it right every
time right i i'm not your
live streaming host who gets everything
right
but wrestling with it i think has some
value you know i would
i feel that but i am aware that i
influence
accidentally so here's the question do
you think i influenced this
do you think that the democrats are
smart enough to
at least watch the messaging coming from
people who are trained to do this stuff
because if they're not watching me by
now
they're sort of missing a big
opportunity
because i at least explain things in a
way that would help them create
better strategies you know even if they
disagreed with me on everything
it would still be useful for them to see
how i frame stuff
so probably an accident i'm going to say
it's more likely to be an accident
than an influence but i complement it
it's really good framing all right so
can you handle this
can you handle me complimenting
technique
but still thinking maybe maybe they
shouldn't be forcing people to get
vaccinated
are you all good with that can we do
that i'm sure we can handle that
all right um
and this is really going to kill you
joe biden is showing impressive
leadership
on the vaccination stuff
oh don't sign off yet there's more to
say
it's just true now do you want to be led
to get the vaccination oh that's a
separate question
the question of whether you should be
vaccinated or anybody
individually should be that's a separate
question
just hold that for a second right we'll
talk about that separately
but is he is he showing
leadership the answer is yes
right i'm not not the big joe biden fan
i don't think his capabilities are
anywhere near what we need for a
president
but let's let's define leadership
is leadership telling people to eat
cookies
when they were already hungry and they
love cookies
no no telling people to eat cookies when
they're hungry and they really enjoy
eating cookies
is not leadership because they're just
doing what they want to do
how about telling people to
go to war when you know that some of
those people
specifically the people in the battles
will get killed
but it's bad for those people who get
killed and wounded in the families etc
but the idea is that it might be good
for the greater you know national
interest
is that leadership yes yes
leadership is telling individuals
i've decided you're going to get killed
for the greater good that's leadership
right
otherwise you're just telling people
what they want to hear and that's
you know that could be lots of other
things but it's not leadership
leadership is getting you to do
something you really don't want to
 do
because you think it's good for the
whole
now is that true is it good for the
whole is it good for the whole
if everybody got vaccinated
reasonable people could disagree right
i'm not even going to have that
conversation today reasonable people
can disagree on that and so
that's why you need leadership right
leadership
is the tiebreaker leadership is the one
who says yeah
that's a reasonable view and the other
side is a reasonable view
we're going to do one of those two
things and at least
the people with the other reasonable
view well you're screwed
i'm we're i'm going to push this through
that's leadership
so you could certainly argue and i won't
give you any pushback to this
that he's leading us in the wrong
direction
right and and certainly you could argue
and i'm not saying that i'm just saying
you could argue that very easily
and secondly it could be terrible for
you individually
right very much like being drafted
and being sent off to a war maybe a war
you don't even agree with
maybe it's vietnam wouldn't that be
terrible for the individual uh
you know patriot who went over there
joined the military was trying to do
something good
and you end up in vietnam doing maybe
nothing that's useful
that's leadership what have i
often said about leadership does anybody
know what i've often said about
leadership
it's evil it's evil
leadership even if you need it
and even if it's good for the country in
the general
it's evil because it makes you do
something you don't want to do
it makes some people go off and die who
weren't going to die otherwise
it's pure evil it's also why i can't do
it
a lot of people ask you know why don't
you run for office scott you're such a
critic
oh why don't you run for office and the
reason that i'm not
a ceo and the reason that or
wouldn't be a good one well i am a ceo
of my own corporation i guess
but i don't you know manage a large
group of people
and i don't want to run for office
because i can't do evil things
it's just hard for me to do evil things
and leadership is evil
because you're you're choosing who dies
for the greater good you know there's an
argument for it
but you're still choosing who dies and
i'm i don't like signing up for that
personally
so i would say that biden um when he
said the facebook
about facebook they're killing people
i'm sorry i like it for technique
only for technique doesn't mean it's
true doesn't mean you should take a
vaccination
just technique he says it directly
he says it simply and he says it with
authority
it's really good persuasion wise
but again make your own decision about
whether he should be persuading that at
all
all right um this won't be the first
time that the u.s government
has brainwashed the public on an issue
of
safety is it in the comments
i want to see how many examples you can
come up with
where the u.s government will just limit
it to u.s
to keep it simple where the u.s
government
brainwashed its citizens for something
you said was good for them
i see the war on drugs
i see helmets patriot act war on terror
uh japanese internment camps i'm just
reading what's going on
the food pyramid swine flu gun control
low-fat stuff sugar
drinking water quality fluoride msg seat
belts
littering electric cars war on terror
iraq haiti twice fluorided water
now i'm not agreeing with all of your
comments
meaning that i don't think these are all
examples of that
but there certainly is some
indication here that your government
routinely brainwashes you
wouldn't you say could could we could we
all agree on the following statement
some of the examples i don't agree with
but could we agree with the general
statement that your government
routinely routinely
brainwashes the public what do you think
the
pledge of allegiance is it's just
brainwashing
now it happens to be productive
brainwashing that i completely agree
with
we should definitely have the pledge of
allegiance it's good for the country
it gives us some cohesive unity etc but
it's brainwashing
your country brainwashes you all the
time for your own good
in their opinion now some of the stuff
like
weapons of mass destruction etc were not
in your best interest
but there are plenty of examples where
they do brainwash you for your
own best interest so the problem i think
is whether they get it right
much less so than the problem of whether
they're doing it
all right um
meanwhile meanwhile washington examiner
is reporting that
youtube was fined a hundred thousand
euros which would be about 118
000 um by german court for removing a
video
of a coronavirus lockdown protest in
switzerland
it's the highest on record in germany
so germany's laws and u.s laws are
pretty different but interesting there's
at least
one country's courts fighting back
against
i suppose what they would call
censorship
um
and my notes are a mess here
uh i i'll get back to the coronavirus
stuff i just have to
inject this did you see uh joe biden's
statements when he was with merkel
laura engram's show had some clips that
were just hilarious
one of the clips was biden trying to
form a sentence
and he just kept going and adding words
but it wasn't making any sense and he
finally just sort of
sort of gave up it was just a bunch of
babble words
in the end i i feel like maybe you could
tease out some
meaning from it but what i wondered was
how did the translator handle it and
on laura ingraham's show they asked the
same question and i thought
that's a really good question if
literally it's a good question
if you're an interpreter and you're
trying to translate biden
and he goes into one of his nonsense
babel sentences
what do you do do you wait
and see if you can figure out what the
main concept was
or do you keep uh or do you translate as
it goes
because if you translate as it goes
people are going to think you're a bad
translator
right because they hear you translating
and they say well that
translation doesn't make any sense so we
get a bad translator here that
clearly nobody would say those words
because they're a bunch of nonsense just
it's just words put together it's babel
but that's actually what he was doing he
was actually babbling
now and that's a serious question is
anybody a translator
has anybody done that job what would you
do like
literally a serious question do you
translate it
or just just wait and then try to
summarize it if he ever gets to a point
or do you just skip it
what the hell do you do with that anyway
my favorite part was
he he misstated something about
angela merkel and said that she was
the largest chancellor since helmet cole
who helmet cole was not a thin man
hell nicole was a sort of a large man
um angela merkel
nobody has called her felt in a few
years
the the the words that
the word she never hears is well you're
looking svelte today
and joe biden goes up there girls are
the largest chancellors
helmet coal now he didn't know that he
realized what he said and he corrected
quickly
so but it's still funny um
so apparently the la is
going to reinstitute a mask requirement
because there are more infections i
guess
and the la county sheriff just said
well this is the funniest statement from
an la county sheriff or any sheriff
he said the los angeles county
department of public health
blah blah has authority to enforce the
order
but the underfunded slash defunded los
angeles county sheriff's department will
not
expend our limited resources and instead
ask for voluntary compliance
he's basically telling you to go ahead
and
violate the law or whatever this is is
it a law
or is it a guideline what the hell is it
uh it's an order so it's called an order
i don't know do you have to obey an
order how does that work
do you have to pay an order from the
government if it's not a law
what does it even mean an order
who the gives me an order
i'll obey a rule i might even obey a law
but an order an order
really you could give me a order
to wear a mask
i don't think so maybe a suggestion
i'll listen to a suggestion and if it's
a law
i'll probably obey it but an order
no no thank you um
so then he said
to oh he said we encourage the dph to
work
with the board of supervisors to come up
with some mandates that are
that are quote both achievable and
supportable by science
because he pointed out that the cdc says
it's not science
so best la county sheriff ever
his response to this is just brilliant
it's just brilliant it's just the best
response ever
and so uh it turns out that my county is
one of the idiot counties that is going
to require masks again
will i be wearing masks in stores
well i think i'm going to go into the
the um what would you call it a
uh uh what do you call it when you
deny you don't follow the rules you're a
conscientious objector that's what it is
i believe i will be a conscientious
conscientious
objector and by that i mean if a store
in my local area is requiring a mask for
vaccinated people
which i am i'm going to enter the store
without my mask
and i'm going to make them ask me to
leave
if they do ask me to leave i will very
obediently
leave but also point out that the cdc
disagrees that there is any reason for
me to leave
now they won't get the benefit of my
money
and i'll be very polite about it because
the store owner is not my enemy
right remember the store owner is a
victim
just like you store owner is not your
enemy
so don't be an to the store
owner if they try to enforce it to try
to
stay out of trouble the the store owner
is not the
right so just be polite to them
but my personal decision
is that i will be a conscientious
objector
and i will enter without a mask and i
will politely explain why
and if there are enough of me it's over
because we can't let the government make
this uh decision for us
in the beginning of course because it's
you know emergency
and it's better to listen to the
government in an emergency than probably
not
in most cases there could be exceptions
but we're past that part
remember what did the white house just
tell me
the white house just said it's only a
pandemic for unvaccinated people
what am i vaccinated
i'm not in a pandemic the white house
told me
i'm personally not in a pandemic so i'm
going to act like it
right somebody says i just pretend i'm
deaf and keep walking
yeah i don't know what kind of
enforcement there is
so what would happen if you just ignore
it
that would be my recommendation for
those who are so inclined
uh here's a sign i'd like to see in a
california store window
i don't think this will happen but it's
what i'd like to see
and it sort of borrows the la county
sheriff's
concept here let's say it's alameda
county where i live
i'd like to see a sign that says the
county of alameda has reinstated
mass requirements we welcome them to
help us enforce that
that requirement this store is not
staffed for that function
do you know why stores don't have enough
staff
the government because the government is
paying people not to work
so how can the store have enough staff
to deal with
masks and also deal with the business of
the store
when they can't even hire enough people
because the government is paying people
not to work
so i think it would be perfectly fair
for a store to say i
fully support your master requirement
and i sure wish i could hire enough
people to help you with that
but i can't so i'm not going to we don't
have anybody in that position
the mask the position of mask
what would you call it proctor or
something the mask
proctor position is open you can even
put a
a help wanted sign mask mandate
enforcer wanted and just showed that
it's an open position
enforcers yes all right
people are asking there's a hashtag hey
tucker now for people asking tucker
carlson
to tell the public if he has been
vaccinated himself
what do you think of that do you think
that tucker carlson
a private citizen with a public job
do you think that he should violate his
you know
hipaa privacy rights and tell you if
he's personally
vaccinated what do you think of that
i would say he should not if he doesn't
want to
um meaning that
yeah it needs to be up to him of course
as it should be up to all of us
uh you saw me make my decision right so
my decision was that i'm a public figure
and i talk about this topic all the time
and it would be
in my view it would be unethical
not to tell you my own decision but
that's a very personal kind of a thing i
don't think it would be unethical for
anybody else
you know that that's just personally how
i feel about it anybody else that's fine
somebody says you are older exactly
exactly
this is why talking about it i think is
fair
um
i'm being begged to get off of this live
stream right now
for something important and i'll go in a
moment
yeah i can tell you what my situation is
my comorbidities and then tell you what
i did but that doesn't mean that's your
situation
it doesn't mean you should follow my
lead all right francis apparently
uh found a workaround where they got uh
apparently
macron got pushed through something that
says that you've got to have
some kind of a passport or vaccination
to do some public stuff
and it uh it pushed up their vaccination
rate like crazy
so a lot of people are getting
vaccinated in france so
let me reiterate
information is good if somebody wants to
tell you they got vaccinated
great but coercion
and persuasion on this topic i feel is
inappropriate and
unethical and i would avoid doing it
although i realize i do it accidentally
all right i do have to go
and so
i do have to go and thank you for
putting up with me again and i'll talk
to you again soon
