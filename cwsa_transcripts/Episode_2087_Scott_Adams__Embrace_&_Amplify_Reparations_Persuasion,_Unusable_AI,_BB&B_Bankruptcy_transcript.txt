dude
good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams the best
time in the world
yes your virtual friend is here you
don't need to pay attention every minute
you could just turn it on and exercise
you could have your breakfast or clean
your house yes you could do all of those
things
and if you'd like to take your
experience up to the maximum possible
potential all you need is that cover of
my girl glass of tanker chalices Diana
canteen jogger flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopapito of
the day the thing makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous Sip
and it happens now go
um
I've got a random observation
that will only apply to people of a
certain age
I don't think Dick Cavett was ever
clever
that's it
that's the whole comment
um I saw that Bill Maher had a guest on
Glenn Glenn Lowry
and his other guests and one of the
things that Bill Maher was talking about
on Friday was all the uh black on black
violence in Chicago and he asked why is
nobody talking about that
why isn't that the thing all the black
leaders are talking about is the black
on black crime
and Glenn Lowry who is black and has a
podcast popular podcast
was talking about how the crime is going
to chase out the middle class taxpayers
and then everything's going to be bad
and so
I feel as if
Bill Maher was tiptoeing into a topic
then I may have opened up
but wasn't quite ready to quite get into
it a little bit timid there
but it does feel like the conversations
at least being broached
now here's the weird thing
how do you have that conversation and
your Bill Maher and you're the the guy
who was the most famous canceled guy in
the world
and for two weeks I was the major
headline of the country for getting
canceled
and he never mentioned it it was never
one of the stories that he mentioned
and nor have I been invited to be on the
show not not that I need to be I'm just
saying it is it's obvious by its
Omission isn't it
doesn't it feel obvious by omission
I feel like there's a number of people
who want to weigh in on this but don't
know how
and and I feel like Bill Barr might be
in a fairly large group of people who
want to be more engaged on the topic
because they think it's important and
they think it's useful
but they don't know how without getting
super canceled
so we'll see if see if there's any more
movement there
well there's a story that I don't
understand at all but maybe some of you
can help me
so Elon Musk took everybody's blue check
away if they got it for free
but you had everybody had the option the
same option of paying their eight
dollars and getting verified so they can
get the check back they just have to pay
eight dollars now there were a number of
celebrities
who just could not imagine being treated
the way other people are it was
unfathomable I think Jason Alexander
was going to quit Twitter entirely if he
had to pay for his special blue check
because he got that special blue check
for being special and damn it you take
that away and why would he even use
Twitter at all or something like that he
didn't say that but sounds like
something he might have been thinking I
don't know I'm reading his mind now
but I thought some of the reactions were
just plain silly
and then a number of people just
magically got their blue check back
without paying
what happened
did Elon Musk
just sort of pick some people to give
checks to because they were complaining
and he thought it'd be funny
just to see what they do if they got a
check
because it was funny it was hilarious
just to see how they they would react
like first they complained for losing
their Jack
and then they complained more for
getting a free check that they didn't I
think Stephen King was trying to say
instead of giving me a free check why
don't you give eight dollars to some
charity
free Ukraine
do you know a musk said when Stephen
King suggested that they give eight
dollars to Ukraine
musk goes I gave a hundred million
dollars to Ukraine how much did you give
[Laughter]
and by the way
I would just need to explain to Stephen
King how economics works
if Elon Musk gives you a free check
that did not create eight dollars of
free money
everything about his suite was just
stupid
I said I'm pretty sure that Stephen
King's got some cognitive problems at
this point
am I wrong about that
I'm only based on his Twitter his
Twitter account but Stephen King looks
like he has some cognitive problems
that's what it looks like I mean I I
don't know it just it just it presents
that way
but I'm no doctor
um
I saw that musk also tweeted responding
to somebody else's tweet about uh fauci
should be in jail
but musk softened that by saying uh
you should be on trial
now what would be the crime
what would be the crime though that
fauci should be on trial for
the name of the crime
fraud well
specifically what
specifically what
lying to Congress
but did he lie or was he clever enough
to be technically true
in other words if he said I did not fund
it
is that true or false if he funded
somebody that went ahead and funded it
is it true or false I don't know
again to research
was that illegal
see there there's a lot of things he did
that we don't like but I don't know
which ones are illegal
suborning perjury somebody says
but did he I don't know
he certainly said things which are the
current reporting would suggest were
misleading
is it illegal to be misleading
I don't know where that line is you know
where is lying versus misleading
yeah where is lying versus being
technically true well being misleading
I have no idea
anyway I thought I'd see if you do
you know there's some specific crime
that he's clearly guilty of according to
you I don't know what it would be
but
just to be clear I share all of your
suspicions
so you you can't get on the other side
of me of suspecting there's something
corrupt there I do suspect there's
something terrible there I just don't
don't know exactly what or exactly what
the the law would treat as a crime
there's definitely something bad there
that's all I know
all right
here's my uh current prediction on AI it
looks like it will be way too hard for
people to use
meaning
people will use AI for searching for
simple information
but it won't be that different than
searching for information now
here here's what I keep seeing uh all
these tweet threads about
here I used AI to build an app just from
describing what I wanted it built the
entire website and then it launched it
so uh do you think you can do that
do you think you could do what the
person who did that tweet did
try it try it go get your AI so the
first thing you have to do is you have
to figure out which of the 10 000 new
apps that were launched in the last
month
so first you have to sort which one of
the ten thousand apps but let's say you
could do that using a Google search
[Laughter]
then you figure out the app
do you think when you used it it would
create a working app
and it would open up a website
and it would just sign you up and then
suddenly you'd have a website and
no it's not the slightest chance that's
going to happen
I'm pretty sure that you would run into
real world problems such as oh the AI is
trying to sign up to I don't know
GoDaddy or some website to register my
domain
because they would need to do that and
then when it tries to register the
domain it finds out that uh
is taken
so now there are several choices so now
you have to get involved because you got
to pick among the several choices or it
tells you your credit card that I used
um has been stolen
so your bank won't process the
transaction
or or or or or in the real world nothing
works the first try if you knew exactly
how to build a website and launch it
yourself without any AI
it still wouldn't be easy because the
ocean would go wrong every minute you
you'd plug in a new plugin for your
website and it just wouldn't work
why well because
some software version changed and
somebody didn't test it or wasn't tested
for your specific thing yeah you might
have a website
but it will be illegal and it will you
know and nobody will be able to figure
out where the buttons are and
something tells me that this whole
AI situation is going to look like you
have to hire a lawyer because it's too
complicated to figure out the law
yourself you know it would be really
easy to figure out
the law
in theory imagine if every law were
taken out of legalese and just written
in English just think about it just all
the laws are just written in English
you wouldn't even need lawyers
it would be so obvious you probably
wouldn't even have to hire any but
because the law is complicated
for no good reason except paying lawyers
I guess
ordinary people can't do the law
can I go to a website and just download
a form
that a lawyer would have done in the
past yes I can do you know why I don't
do that
because I wouldn't know how to fill in
the form
except for the simplest stuff you know
let's say a lease agreement you know if
you've got one one person renting a room
or something yeah I could do that but
once you get into any complication
whatsoever you're going to want the
advice of a lawyer and it's going to be
the same with AI
you get to say to yourself all right I'm
going to do this thing with AI
first you have to sort through ten
thousand different apps you have to
figure out why they're different which
one's better then you've got to sign up
and pay for it
right so you're only going to pay for
one so you got to really really do your
research to make sure you're not paying
for the wrong one
and then when it's up do you think
you'll be able to
manage all of its questions and stuff
probably not
you probably need somebody who knows how
to do that stuff do you think you can
even ask it a question
nope because it turns out that you need
to use super props like a paragraph or a
page-long set of words that somebody's
tested to get you the best answer to
your simple questions
do you think you're going to know how to
write a page of super props or do you
think you'll be able to go to GitHub or
wherever they're stored and you'll know
that oh that's where they store the
super prompts and then you'll be able to
shop from a million super prompts
there'll be a million of them and you'll
know how to find the one that works for
your specific question right
so now you've looked for one of ten
thousand apps that launched this month
and now you've got to look for one of a
million a million Super Chat suggestions
to get the right super prompts
there's no way this is going to be some
you know some kind of technology that
ordinary people use there's no way
now you can imagine the future
where there's an AI that helps you with
the other AIS right
yeah I know what you're thinking you're
like oh no I just use the AI that tells
me which AI to use and that helps me
when there's any hard questions
good luck waiting for that
if such a thing works were invented the
AI that can help you sort out the other
AIS what would happen on day two
and day one somebody events the AI this
solves all of those problems I just
mentioned
what happens on day two
on day two there are a million of them
because you couldn't copyright it
there's no way you're going to copyright
and AI that helps with other AIS
Le so there'll be a million of them
which one do you use
nine hundred thousand of them will be
frauds
I'm pretty sure that humans are going to
find a way to totally f up AI so that
the human part that didn't need to be
there
will just make everything too difficult
to use
that's what I think
in the same way that the fact that
photoshop is really really good for
artists
I'll bet Photoshop isn't helping you a
bit is it how many of you use Photoshop
it's really handy fix up your you fix up
okay a lot of you do because I get a lot
of Engineers on this live live stream
but just think about the number of
people you know who would never even
think of opening Photoshop
is exactly the same people you think are
going to use AI
they're not they're absolutely not going
to use AI not not the way you imagine it
on based on today's
model of things all right
um
here's something that makes me happy I
like it when some of the smartest
billionaires are on the same side
so here are the billionaires who are
are investing big on Fusion
all right so you got your Bill Gates
Peter Thiel
Jeff Bezos and Mark benioff founder of
Salesforce I'll tell you what all of
those people have in common and also Sam
Altman who's the chat GPT guy and I'm
pretty sure uh musk too
musk isn't mentioned but
I feel like a positive musk was in
Fusion as well
so how does that make you feel
just think about this for a minute
just think about the fact that there
absolutely our smartest billionaires
right I mean there are other Smart Ones
but if you put
this group of half a dozen people in a
room
if you let me stop something here
every one of you who say the AI stuff is
boring it's not going to stop
right AI is pretty much the future so
you can tell me in the comments all day
long AI stuff is boring you should just
go somewhere else that's not going to
change you're not going to change me to
stop talking about it it is the biggest
thing that's happening in the world it's
the primary source of news I'm not going
to stop talking about it there'll be
more there'll be a lot more so stop
complaining about it your only option is
to leave
and you're welcome to leave okay
so don't bore us with your boring AI is
boring
comments we don't want to see them
you're boring us just go somewhere else
um
so I love this because Fusion in theory
could be our free energy of the future
it could solve every problem in the
world it seems like
uh it could it could even solve
inflation can it
am I why is that stupid or is that smart
suppose suppose our energy costs dropped
to approaching zero
energy energy is the major cost behind
making or doing anything right
is one of the major costs so if you made
energy costs dropped substantially even
though monetary inflation still existed
the amount you paid for your stuff would
go down
right
so even though there's too much money
supply you can make out for that with
productivity
so it's huge I mean the the uh the race
diffusion is sort of a race to get there
before the economy crumbles from
inflation
or climate change kills us all according
to some
but that's the good news is that our the
smartest Among Us
are betting the same way
I like that I don't believe there's any
billionaire who's betting against it
at this point it looks like it's an
engineering problem do you remember I
told you maybe uh five years ago let's
see if anybody remembers this
that Sam Altman uh had had said
something like five years ago that
Fusion was already an engineering
problem
in other words it wasn't a theoretical
problem and they know the theory works
uh they just had to figure out how to
build you know how do you make a magnet
that's super strong well you just try
and try until you make one that's super
strong how do you make it you know
something that contains the reaction
well you just try and try until you get
something that works just like we invent
everything else so five years ago we
were already in the engineering phase
which meant that there was nothing that
would stop it once you're at the
engineering phase
it's going to happen
you just don't know if it's one year or
ten
so here we are I think Sam oldman's
prediction that it had reached the
engineering stage
feels exactly right and these other
billionaires are saying the same thing I
think
all right Bed Bath and Beyond is filed
for bankruptcy and I have a theory for
why that happened
and it's those 20 coupons that they send
out
all the time
so every few weeks you get the mail
these big 20 coupons
what was the first reaction when I got a
20 coupon do you know what I'd say
a string of
invectives
I would hate the store as soon as I got
it like oh you mother I would just start
swearing at it I say you're gonna make
me keep track of this piece of paper
the kid in the mail because otherwise
I'm going to pay too much 20 too much
which is substantial for the next thing
I buy at this store that I like to use
because I like the store it was a great
store
and so I'd say to myself all right all
right I'll put it in my car
right that's what you're thinking just
put it in your car
then you'll have it so I put it in my
car I go to the store and I'm like ah I
beat the system this time because I did
do this I did put it in my car
I hated it having it in my uh glove
compartment every every time I opened it
I'd be like damn it they're manipulating
me they're making me keep this in my car
I don't want to keep their paper in my
car just because that's their process
but at least I beat the system because
I'd keep the keeps it in my car and so
then I go to the Bed Bath and Beyond and
whip out my coupon
which had expired a month ago
they expire
they expire
so now now I've got to build a system
just to shop at one store
I have to design a system in my house
where the mail comes in then I take the
new one
I go out to the garage
I go into the glove compartment I switch
out with the expired ones but first I
check maybe I build a Tickler well this
would be better I'll build a Tickler on
my calendar so they'll enter the
expiration date of the one that's in the
glove compartment so then when I drive
to the store oh let me short this story
to you Bed Bath and Beyond you
deserve to be bankrupt more than any
store I've ever experienced I hate hate
hate your store I hate it
there's no other store I hate
and and think about this I love the
products
the products are excellent the shopping
there was a good experience I hate them
hate them because of what they would try
to make me do to buy their products do
you know what I usually did
I usually did not have a I usually I'm
driving driving by and I want to get
something and I'll I'll say oh
I'll do one of two things I'll say oh I
don't have my 20 coupon so I go home and
I buy it on Amazon
right
because you still need the thing and
you're going to forget about it you know
if you don't do something so you go oh I
forgot I need like those little pump
soap things for the bathrooms I'll just
Amazon it or this is worse I'll go I'll
go to Bed Bath and Beyond knowing I
don't have the 20 coupon and everything
I see in the store looks overpriced
because I'm going to pay more than the
person who's buying the same
 thing
in their basket right behind me
I hate that store hate them now it's not
again it's not the store
it's the management and what they're
doing to the customers absolutely
abusive psychologically abusive
that store and they need to be out of
business so badly which is terrible
because I love their store
except for the coupons
[Applause]
all right I saw a good example of
embrace and amplify
by the way I do I do that
screen that I just did
to to educate other management to not do
that
really don't do that just super don't do
that
anyway uh embrace the amplify there's
Ohio GOP Senate candidate
so uh Bernie Marino
and in public he is proposing
reparations for white people
uh he said quote you know they talk
about reparations where are the
reparations of the people in the north
who died to save the lives of black
people
so he said that to a group of people who
all look white to me
um
what do you think of that
now this is what I call Embrace and
amplify Embrace and amplify says you
accept if there's an idea that is absurd
just absurd but you can't make it go
away because somebody's going to argue
that it does make sense if you can't
make somebody understand that their idea
is absurd
instead what you do is you embrace it
and then you ask them to give you
details or or to actually calculate the
number or to make sure all the variables
are included
because that's why you do if you embrace
it yeah I like your idea yeah this
reparations is good let's make sure that
everybody who was hurt
by slavery let's make sure that they all
get reparations which would include
everybody in the north of course
oh well it's difficult to figure out who
is in the north well I mean it's
difficult to figure out who descended
for players but we can figure it out I
mean we'll figure that out let's let's
let's just table that for now but we'll
figure it out
all right and then what happens next
well then somebody else wonders and say
hey are you calculating reparations
all right so the way to do that it looks
like you're doing it wrong the way to do
it is to compare what you're doing or
what happened to the alternative that's
the only logical thing I've said this
before so you would have to compare uh
descendants of slaves in the United
States
to descendants of black people who did
not become slaves in the area of Africa
that was where the slaves came from
so if you found out that American
descendants of slaves were actually
doing better
than the Africans who were never slaves
in the first place
then they'd come out of the head there'd
be no no reparations in fact there were
no money
so if you did the calculation that way
black people would owe money
to pay for this better situation that
they came now you'd also have to
calculate crime wouldn't you
crimes part of it because the legacy of
slavery
created a economic situation which led
to a lot of crime High rate of crime in
the black community now that crime was
uh you know often imposed on lots of
different people
so shouldn't you figure out how much the
prison systems cost and and also the you
know how much the cost of crime is you
probably have to put
you know maybe a dollar amount on the
murder victims murder of activities
you'd have to put a dollar amount on
that say okay if you kill the parent
that's five million dollars or something
like that
so I think you'd have to figure out
um
Social Services payments
you know if if you'd have to calculate
how much welfare has been paid how much
uh prison Services Police Services you
basically have to figure everything
that's different
because slavery happened
and one of the things that's different
is a higher crime rate than would have
happened otherwise
but who's responsible for that
is that the plantation owners
or the people who are afraid well I
guess complicated now doesn't it because
we can't agree on that so if you wanted
reparations to go away all you'd have to
do is embrace it
just embrace it and say all right let's
get serious about calculating this thing
and as soon as you got serious about
calculating it you would realize you
couldn't it would just be absurd
right and if you did it would make
everything worse
it would just make everything worse
but you could
all right
so
um
is there anything I haven't talked about
yet
yeah let me tell you what you're missing
on
uh the Scott Adams not locals
subscription site
um
here's the robots read news comic that I
did yesterday some people said they
liked it I wasn't going to make it
public but I'll read it to you
so did you know that Biden has a new
department of environmental justice
have you heard of that
the government is going to have an
environmental justice department
do you know what happens when you add
the word justice
to anything that's not actually the
justice system you know the legal system
if you add Justice or anything what's
that mean
it's a grift
right if you had the word justice that's
like a big flag oh this is a grift and
it's just a political thing
so it looks like the Democrats would
like to use environmental justice as one
more way to punish people for uh big
racists
if they
allow too much CO2 into the air I think
right the idea is that climate change is
racist because it affects uh people of
color more than other people and
therefore if you're a person who
doesn't do enough for climate change
would you not be a racist
that right because the Democrats only
have one play
everything has to be attached to racism
or they don't have any leverage because
it's the only thing that they can make
work because they can still scare people
that they'll call them racists a need
for climate change or I'll call you a
racist now I can't think of any other
reason they would call it the
environmental justice department do you
it would just be called the
Environmental
you know benefit department or something
they would call it a justice department
unless they used plan to use it as a
weapon against white men basically
of course yeah it's racist so here's the
robots read news comic which is always
just one robot who always looks the same
reading the news and the robot says the
new department of environmental justice
convicted a Utah man for being a racist
for mocking client climate scientists
every time it snows the man was
sentenced to be tattooed with swastikas
and dropped off naked in Oakland
in his absence a backup priest will
handle someday's Mass
no one is above the law
so this by the way is my first comic
I've ever written
that only four sentences and all four
were punchlines
there are four punch lines in one comic
I've never done that before
stop
all right
um
so weirdly
believe it or not well that's a weird
coincidence
a weird coincidence I'm not going to
tell you about
too boring all right
um
I feel like there's some other story oh
I saw this tweet by the ethical skeptic
if you follow the ethical skeptic on
Twitter
uh he has you know tons of data
arguments and graphs and stuff that I
usually don't understand
so I don't know what to make of them but
he also uh
he also had a a PC wrote
scientific sort of a skeptical piece in
which he pointed out that
what do you do I'm going to simplify a
much more elegant argument so don't
blame him if I mischaracterize it but
one of the questions was why did CO2
keep going up during the pandemic
have you ever asked yourself that
is a little bit unexplained you know why
why did CO2 not change when human
activity completely changed now so the
hypothesis
the hypothesis is for that and lots of
other reasons that you points out that
there's some third source of heat
that is
on let's say unexplored
now you're thinking it's the sound it's
the sound right now I'm not talking
about the sun yes there are a lot of
people who say it's the sun it's
sunspots
you should know that the scientists have
looked into the sunspots and whether
they're right or wrong they've looked
into it and decided that's not that's
not where the uh the action is
but yeah the the other hypothesis is
coming from the Earth itself
and that there are normal natural
processes in the earth that are warming
the oceans in other words deep in the
earth there's something going on yeah
maybe an underwater volcano or something
like that but there's something going on
that's just warming the oceans and
that's mostly what you're seeing
it has nothing to do with humans
what do you think of that I'm not going
to claim that's true
I won't claim it's true I'm just going
to claim
it's not bad
you know if you were going to say name
another hypothesis that could explain
our observations
name one
I can't think of another one can you
I can't think of anything else that
would fit the observation
unless it's all made up I mean that
would fit the observation too
but it's very unlikely it's unlikely
that the entire the entire field is just
made up but you know it's possible it's
actually possible it's just unlikely
I don't know I I kind of like the
hypothesis now I'm sure there are other
scientists who are going to tell you
that there's a reason that you should
not look at that hypothesis
but on the surface
it would seem to explain a lot
all right
so uh
well it's cooler lately but that doesn't
mean anything necessarily
hmm
your failure of imagination is funny you
mean
I'm not sure if you're talking about me
well I think the problem is that the
the advanced aliens from Atlantis
when their Island was destroyed their
island of Atlantis I think they took
their advanced technology and they bore
into the center of the Earth
and they've got a big construction
project going on in there and it's
warming our oceans or not or not or
lizard people possibly lizard people
all right
um
one other little minor potential
announcement
so there's a
there's a topic I'm considering never
talking about again and I want to get
your thoughts of it
and I'm going to spell it
because I get I'll get
demonetized on YouTube if I say it or I
put it in the title
t-r-a-m-s
apparently that word makes you get
demonetized because YouTube and for good
reasons for good reasons actually since
YouTube can't tell in advance if you're
going to be anti or Pro
or neutral they they just put a hold on
it until a human has a chance to review
it which is not crazy that's not crazy
you know because it's a it's a heated
topic there's just as much anti as Pro
or at least there's a lot of both
so YouTube maybe wants to just make sure
it's not a some kind of a hate speech I
don't mind that but
I'm not going to talk about it if
they're going to punish me
now it's not their intention to punish
me it's their intention to do a good job
for their advertisers and their their
public and I'm okay with that but
I'm done with the topic
is anybody okay with me just never
talking about it again
or do you think is still too relevant
and too important
yeah well if I do talk about it I
probably will break that but if I do
talk about it it's not going to be in
the title
okay and I might have to use code words
to talk about it but I'm not I'm not
contributing to anybody's hate
you know I'm pro-trans adults you know
living out their best life
and I'm also confused about the uh the
data
I don't really know what's true and
what's not with the data frankly
all right so I probably will break that
vow but I think I will keep the vow of
not putting it in the title
so it's probably probably picking up the
title more than anything
all right
yeah
I I think that topic is super boring at
this point
can we just be bored about it
the other thing that I thought was
interesting is if is if the trend for
women transitioning to no if the trend
for men transitioning to women
continues because I think there's more
of it in that direction right I'm not
sure if that's true I think there is it
should close the gender pay Gap though
so the gender pay Gap should be
shrinking quite a bit
if you get enough men turning into women
so that's good
all right
um
can't buy hot dogs anymore
uh
uh I just said that yesterday I know but
it was fun so I said it again
all right well
here I was mentioning that I'm not going
to mention it and it sparked like this
whole deep conversation in the comments
about the topic
like there's nothing you can do it's
just it's just people want to talk about
it because there's nothing more basic to
your your personal situation than
something like that it's just so
personal
all right
now did I hear that the vice president
of Bud Light got fired
but maybe it's a leave of absence
did you hear that
do you think that that's
see I think that could be a little bit
of fake news
like half true half fake here's what I
think is true it's probably true that
she's not doing the job
is not necessarily true that she was
fired it could be true that she couldn't
take the Heat
it might have been just too much heat
and she just needed to get away
so that doesn't mean she's fired
and I haven't seen any data on
Budweiser sales I think their stock went
down five percent for about a minute but
that no nobody thinks that means
anything it's just a fluctuation
uh
well you know I think the way the people
on the right are interpreting it
is their interpreting it as Budweiser
knows they made a mistake
and they are punishing the person who
made it but I don't know if that's true
and apparently a man has been put in the
job they put a man in the job so
uh
I don't know what to believe about that
story but unless you hear from her the
actual vice president who's not in that
job anymore unless you hear from her I
think there's a gap in that story I
wouldn't assume it's what what it looks
like on the surface that somebody made a
mistake and the corporation punished her
for it because I don't think the
corporation could get away with
punishing her
for doing something positive for the
trans community
I don't think they can do that
it feels more like maybe a decision that
she made
but we don't know so don't make any
assumptions because we don't know
yeah I mean you you could obviously say
why it looks like a mistake
but do you really think it affected
their sales
I mean they're coming into the summer
month I'm going to guess this summer is
their big sales period right
you think so we haven't seen a reporting
on it yet right
yeah I assume there's some impact but
if it were your favorite beer
and it's not Bud Light and let's say you
just liked Budweiser regular Budweiser
that was your favorite beer
do you think you would change Brands
because of this or would you just say Ah
that's Bud Light that's that's not my
brand
they never mess with my brand they only
mess with Bud Light I won't buy that Bud
Light anyway
uh probably it'll probably be some
people who do make the decision but I
guess we'll wait and see if their sales
have been affected
I would yeah there's a lot of sub Brands
right
a lot of people don't know what
Budweiser owns though
so it's going to be hard to boycott the
the other products they own
uh
yeah I don't know
I just don't like boycotts but I see why
you do it I get it I get it
it's down 11 now
somebody said I don't know if that's
true 11 would be something I'd worry
about five percent
five percent of fluctuation 11 sounds
pretty serious if that's true
somebody says the stock is five which is
what I thought I thought the stock was
fine
all right uh ad age reported 11 percent
down three percent since the campaign
started all right so probably it depends
when the article got written
if if adage wrote the article at one
point in time it might have been just a
fluke
oh sales down 11 percent
no we don't know what is 11 we don't
know what that is
all right we don't know if that's the
stock or the sales or the sales of Bud
Light or what
why do I care well I only care in the
business sense not a product sense
11 is decimated and that's that's true
um
I always said the champagne appears so
the Europeans didn't like it
all right
at age article was from Friday okay so
it was current ish
all right you may have noticed that
today was a slow news day
and
so let me ask you a few questions
how many of you saw RFK Juniors
announcement speech or announcement
video
announcing his run
and what did you think about his
um speech just the content of his speech
let's say the the words he spoke about
unity and
getting stuff done
I I feel like he's picking up free money
all over the place
don't you don't you feel that America
had this gigantic table full of free
money in the middle
but nobody nobody had the balls to run
in the middle
you know everybody had to bow to their
Extremes in their party
so it looks like he's doing the the Bold
move of being running as the president
that everybody wanted which is somebody
who would actually try to bring us
together
and
not be crazy
just don't be crazy you know it's not
hard to support the other team
if they're not being
am I right
it's not Thou Art like I think that it
would be easy for Democrats
to go along with some Republican stuff
not all of it but some of it
except for you know the attitude and you
know the team play and all that so if
you give somebody who could take the
energy out of the fight and just say all
right there's some stuff in the middle
we just have to be reasonable about and
just get this middle stuff done
and maybe he's got the message that
we'll get that done
now do you think that um
the Democrats are panicking
because
RFK Jr is not part of the deep State we
assume I mean it doesn't look like it
and that they have a deep State play
that they're readying but we haven't
seen it yet don't you feel that the
Democrats have a backup plan to Biden
they haven't ruled out yet
and they're just waiting for Biden
himself to say he's not running
because here's here's what it feels like
right this is just what it feels like
it feels like the Democrats know that
Biden's a liability
but they can't tell him he's a liability
because he's still president
and there's you know you're still as
supporters and you just can't go on
record you just can't push too hard he's
got too much power even though he's
demented
uh so I feel like they're waiting
because they think he will make the
decision on his own or maybe they're
whispering to Jill you know Jill
he's uh he's looking a little tired
lately I'm not saying he shouldn't run
but you're the one who's closest to us
and then it seems like Jill you're the
only one who can tell us if he's not
ready I mean I feel like he wouldn't
tell us because he wants to serve the
country but you could tell this Jill and
Jill do you think you could talk him out
of it if it seemed like a bad idea so
don't you think that there are forces
that are trying to reach all of his
inner circle to see if the Inner Circle
will talk about it running and that
they've got somebody ready to go
and it won't become
does it feel like that
it just feels like that like that
they're waiting as long as they can to
see if his inner circle will talk him
out of running
now
now before RFK Jr announced
almost anybody that they had substituted
for Biden would be
probably had a real good chance of being
president but now what happens if they
bring in a new name a name that has not
been you know at the top level of
politics yet
and that person has to run against the
Kennedy for the primaries
RFK Jr is really throwing a a gigantic
variable into this deal yeah so Newsome
everybody says Newsome's The Heir
Apparent
and nuisance playing the no I'm all for
Joe Biden which does suggest he's the
airplane apparent
that the
the Vigor with which he says he's not
running because Joe Biden is going to
run
suggests he's supporting Biden which
suggests
that he probably has some kind of a deal
worked out that he's the heir apparently
if
if the Insiders can be convinced Biden
not to run
or or maybe it's just some legal
Jeopardy that causes him not to run so
it could be that the Democrats think
that the bidens are in such legal
Jeopardy
but they don't want to mention it
so they're just hold on wait see what
happens
to the last minute
all right
um
yeah they've got to get rid of Kamala
obviously yeah Kamala can never be a
candidate for president
that would be crazy
uh
close your eyes and hear Catherine
Hepburn yeah
well
um I was just listening to RFK Jr's uh
video in which he's announcing his
presidency and I would say his voice on
the video is
way way better than it was last year
way better it's not where it isn't to be
but the thing we don't know is if it's
continuing to improve
because so far it's continued to improve
since he had whatever procedure he had
and I don't know where the end of that
is because what it looks like to me
is that as he learns to control his
voice production you know just his
natural voice production he needs to get
that compatible with whatever the
procedure was
like those two need to come in
compatibility and it looks like he's it
looks like he's zeroing in on it
so
he could be speaking almost normally
well into the the primary
so that's a big big variable right
because if because there are a lot of
people who just have trouble listening
to him and I get that because I had I
had a similar voice problem
so
if that goes away
and it's well on the way to going away
or at least minimizing its importance
that's a really big variable very big
you think the Dem operatives are going
to take out Biden somebody says
he could use some Scott Adams support
you know what's fun about this election
cycle is how many people would be pretty
good
the the there are a number of people who
were considering that I would say both
left and right I would say well I might
not agree with all those policies but at
least that's a serious president
I think RFK Jr would be a serious
president
that you could be
proud of
even if you hated some of his policies
uh I think Vivek is super strong
I think that DeSantis is super strong I
think Trump is Trump
yeah you you like what you get you hate
what you get it's always going to be a
mixed bag
in fact there's only
I would say there were only two people
considered for the presidency who are
unambiguously unqualified
Kamala Harris
well three if you can't Buddha judge uh
cobbler Harris and Joe Biden
they're by far the least qualified
people in all of government
would you agree in fact I doubt there's
anybody in congress of the entire
Congress I doubt there's anybody as weak
as either one of them
probably the weakest politicians we've
ever received at the same time
that's my bat
all right
um
the Peter Principle yeah I think Buddha
judge is not
he's not winning too many friends there
as Transportation secretary
all right
um
Vlad is asking me Scott persuade my wife
Monica who is watching you right now to
actually like your show and stop
complaining
all right excuse me I've got to take a
moment Monica
Monica Monica
come over here
I know you're distracted but listen to
me
Monica
this show
is a virtual bonding experience
the only way you're going to get your
husband to not love this show and maybe
ignore you a little bit is
lots of oral sex
so Monica you're better up your game
because right now this is competitive
with you
that's not good that's not good look at
this watch this Monica
hey everybody let's have a sip of a
beverage that's competitive with you
right now Monica you have to up your
game you have to say to your husband
dear
I know you love this show I know you
love it
but if I got something for you that
you're going to love even more so Monica
up here game
and I know what you're thinking right
now
Scott up yours
but here's to everybody up everybody
well Jake demonica
and her happy marriage
that's good
that's good yeah I I upped my game up
ears
all right
so
I hope I didn't break up your marriage
is there are there any other marriages
you need me to to disassemble
before we're gone before we go is there
anybody else who needs to break up with
their spouse
all right
I think we've uh
RFK is anti-vaxx but is he
is he yeah the the whole vaccination
question
would have been a
a complete
you know it would be you know
non-starter five years ago
but I think people so distrust experts
that RFK Jr can make his case and people
may agree or disagree but they're going
to at least agree with the following
that there's risk
and they're going to at least agree that
the experts
in big Pharma have lied to us
so I feel like he can sell that
I think he can sell it
we'll see
yeah I don't think that's his appeal I
don't think it's about vaccinations
you do have to join locals for the man
cave that's correct
do we know why the Starship disassembled
yet well I don't know but I heard there
were some engines that didn't fire
so whatever causes some engines to not
fire I guess that was the problem
uh is it persuasive to say that fauci
incited a virus he incited a virus it's
funny
I don't know if it's persuasive
um
all right
so ladies and gentlemen that is all we
have for today I'm going to say goodbye
to YouTube we will see you tomorrow when
there'll be lots of news because it's
Monday tomorrow that's when the news
happens not Sunday
's your day
