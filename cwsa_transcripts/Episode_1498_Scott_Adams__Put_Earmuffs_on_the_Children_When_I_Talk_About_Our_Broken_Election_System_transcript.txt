coffee with Scott Adams I know I know
it's the highlight of your day you're
already sad thinking about the fact that
it might end later yeah I know but don't
don't think that yet just enjoy it just
be in the moment
now
this one comes with a warning
because the California election is
happening right now the recall election
and I got a little bit triggered
so there will be cursing later
uh just warning you so
put the earmuffs on the children
and I think the rest of you adults will
be able to handle this but if you'd like
to get fortified so that the cursing
doesn't bother you what would be a good
way to do that yeah coffee that's right
and all you need is a cup of mug or a
glass of tanker Chelsea style canteen
chocolate flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine the
other day the thing that makes
everything better except our up
elections is called the simultaneous Sip
and it happens now go
ah
wow all right it's all going now
well Rasmussen uh asked people what do
they think about celebrity or external
politicians campaigning for a candidate
do you think it helps do you think
people think that makes a difference
when the celebrities and the external
candidates are are helping out well most
people say no but shockingly 30 percent
say it's important or somewhat important
the celebrities and outside politicians
help campaign
now I don't think I've ever been
influenced by a celebrity endorsement
I don't know if I've been influenced by
a politician endorsement although those
seem more weighty
but
um I feel like it works
I feel like it works because
if if Newsom is campaigning with a
celebrity or with you know Kamala Harris
or Biden he just gets more attention
and the tension is the thing that gets
you elected right the more attention you
get the better so I think that these
celebrity endorsements do work just
because they draw people and they draw
attention I don't think it has anything
to do with the endorsement per se
well you do you remember most of you who
watch this recently I think it was
yesterday I was talking about what yes
the pre-print paper about young boys
getting some myocarditis
from the vaccination itself
and I said to you do not be too
confident that this is correct because
even peer-reviewed studies
or you know half of them turn out not to
be right and this is before it's even
peer-reviewed
so a pre-print should be your lowest
level of credibility within the
scientific realm and I I warned you that
maybe these initial
findings might not hold up
Well that took about 24 hours
and uh Aleister
McAlpine MD so he's a doctor
he says of this major study that showed
that young boys were having heart
problems from the vaccination
he points out that it's
non-peer-reviewed it's an unpublished
preprint it's based on data dumpster
diving
through a non-verified database that
once listed becoming the Incredible Hulk
as a side effect
and it uses his outdated statistics to
paint a false picture
so that's one opinion all right so one
one knowledgeable opinion is it's a
garbage study
uh and Andres backhaus is also warning
us it's going to fall apart
so
if you're worried
about uh young boys having little heart
risk with the vaccination
the first thing you should do is compare
it to the risk of getting coveted itself
because I think it was uh Scott Gottlieb
ex head of the FDA who is now calling
this an endemic meaning you're gonna get
it
you get that right so we used to think
well maybe we could keep some people
from getting covered
nope not anymore apparently you're all
going to get it
uh it's just a matter of when maybe you
won't be this year could be five years
from now but it's gonna be around you're
all going to get it
and if that's the case
then you have to compare the vaccination
to getting covet
not a percentage chance of getting
covered you're not a not a 10 chance of
getting covered but you're going to get
covered so now if you know you're going
to get it even though there would be a
timing difference
you can basically now compare the risk
of heart problems from covid
versus the risk of heart problems from
the vaccination
it turns out that covet is worse
so
at the moment
I would say there is zero credible
evidence that young boys have extra risk
zero credible evidence it could still be
true
right because when I talk about
credibility that doesn't mean true or
false that just means do you have
evidence that's the kind of evidence
they should convince you or not
we don't we don't have the kind of
evidence that should make you make a
different decision based on that factor
maybe later we will but we don't know
all right there are two things we know
for sure
and I tweeted this and I'm going to read
it because
I tweeted it so well
that I can't improve upon it so I'm just
going to read it
I said there are two things we know for
sure
number one we must use good science and
good data to make decisions absolutely
number two we know for sure we wouldn't
recognize good science and good data if
it showed us three IDs and made a scream
its name while ass us at his
home address
I'll just let that sit there for a
moment
now here's a humor writing lesson you
ready
humor writing lesson
what makes this sentence funny we
wouldn't recognize good science and good
data if it showed us three IDs and made
us scream its name while ass us
at his home address
what makes that work
well it's visual right it's also it's
cruel it's bizarre you know these are
the dimensions of humor if you get any
two of The Six Dimensions of humor in
there it's gonna be funny so you got you
know cruelty bizarre it's clever it's
got basically three or four but here's
the technique I want to share with you
is that third and last clause
at its home address
right so if you're going to exaggerate
something
this is you know a simple humor
technique you just say okay something's
bad let me describe how bad it is in a
funny way
now if I said
we wouldn't know good science and good
data if it showed us three IDs is that
funny
we wouldn't know it if it showed us
three sources of identification no not
really just sort of sits there makes a
point you know in an analogy kind of way
but it just sits there right if I say we
wouldn't know good science and good data
if it showed us three IDs and made a
scream his name while ass us
well now you're talking
now it's getting a little funny because
we got the we got the naughty part in
there and it's bizarre and you know it's
it's got everything
but here's the part I want to teach you
it's the third thing that sells it right
the second part part you know the first
part is just a setup
we wouldn't know if we wouldn't know
good science if it showed us three IDs
not funny yet it's just a setup but then
the the payoff is making us scream its
name while ass us
but then the real dessert you know the
thing that ties this together makes it
work is the third thing
because it's hard to come with with
three things that fit
three things that cause you to be able
to positively identify it and the third
thing was it's we're at its home address
which took a little work to come up with
that third thing so that's the technique
if you're going to exaggerate
have three levels of exaggeration first
one okay it's just setting me up
second one you need to get the laugh
second one needs to make them laugh all
right all right I see where you're going
you're done now right
as soon as they think you're done
that's where you add the third one the
third one is what puts it over the line
and makes it you know one for the ages
two could be funny if you could get that
third one in there
people will remember that right so
that's your lesson for the day on humor
well apparently CNN is already worried
about Trump he is the top the top story
today
can you believe it Trump is the top
story on CNN
do you know what made Trump the top
story on CNN
he talked
he just opened his mouth he just talked
and he's the biggest story in the world
and what he talked about was that he's
reminding people that he believes the
election was rigged
and that that might be a major theme of
is reelection
now
do you think Trump could get reelected
making the election itself a major theme
would that be strong enough
to if he just said hey I got robbed I
got robbed let's do this right re-elect
me it was rigged
I say no I say no yeah and I'm seeing
more no's in the comments no way right
because it's whiny it's small
right it's small
it's whiny and you just think maybe if
he tried already could have won
right so even if you think it's true
it doesn't work does it because you feel
like he should win anyway right if
you're complaining about the referee
well maybe you should have shot better
baskets
right if you think you lost the game
because of the ref
well maybe you should have played better
I mean that's sort of automatically what
we think complaining about the rules
it's too small
that's about him right that's not even
about you
you don't want your president running
for him
or her you want you want the president
running for you well when Trump ran the
first time he said make America great
again
that was about you when he said build a
wall
that was for you
and people recognized it but if he runs
because he's got a personal gripe about
the election
that's not going to work that's not
going to work this is not strong enough
I mean he could he could win it anyway I
mean maybe he could make that work
because people just are sick of
whatever's happening but it's not a good
approach
even if even if he got elected anyway
but here's what would be
you ready
let's take Trump's complaint that really
is all about himself
and now let's turn that into a winning
campaign formula you ready
I'm going to give Trump
the winning formula
this is the campaign issue that would
work
we can't know if I won or not I happen
to think I did
but we have to make elections auditable
make elections fully auditable you
should know if you voted the moment the
elections close
at the moment the votes close you should
get a text to say yeah we got your vote
here it is
or or some kind of a system I'm not
saying that that would be the system but
if president Trump
runs for re-election
and makes his main Campaign theme I'm
going to fix elections
now could he do that because the federal
government has limited capabilities when
it comes to the states
yeah you could be good he could make
money available he could threaten the
states with losing money he could do a
lot I mean I don't know if he could fix
it in one term but he can do a lot I
think now I need a fact check from
smarter people to tell me if that's
practical but I think it is
um
and if he does that then it's about us
right I don't mind his complaint that he
thinks he won despite no proof of that
at the moment
I don't mind that complaint because
that's an opinion
he's you know he gets to have an opinion
but if he tells me he's going to fix the
system or work hard at it or at least
work as hard as he did on the wall even
if it didn't work out we need somebody
who cares
to make our system auditable again
if Trump wins I'm sorry if Trump runs
with a main theme of fixing our election
system
I'm all in
so let me say that again
um like most of you I haven't made any
decision about who I would support in
2024. I don't even know who's running
but
if Trump makes this a major theme
to fix the elections to make them
auditable
I'm all in
because you know what
I don't care about anything else
so uh oam is reporting uh that some
Republicans are being told when they go
to vote in the election recall which is
happening right now
they're being told that they already
voted
now it's on oan so you can reasonably
ask yourself is that accurate how many
people is this is this one person or
more we don't know all right so because
it's in the media you have to say to
yourself is it true I don't know doesn't
mean it's true just because it's
reported
but
uh and also project Veritas I saw their
their asking Californians if they see
anything that looks sketchy to let them
know
I can report that I have heard reports
of something very sketchy I'm not going
to mention it yet
but personally I've heard anecdotally
a report that sounded sketchy as hell to
me
don't know if it's true so I'm not going
to repeat it now
these the fact that we have these
reports anecdotal and not 100 reliable
does that mean that the election is bad
does that mean that this election is is
corrupt or rigged because we hear these
stories no it doesn't mean that I mean
there's we don't have anything that's
like some kind of proof of that
but here's what we also don't have
we don't have an election that we could
audit fully
so when it's done we won't know if we
voted or not
and we no longer live in a world in
which trusting our officials
makes sense at all
now as I was looking at this I thought
to myself you know this is a bad
situation
that you've got elections that people
don't trust in a way that our system
requires them to trust it in order to
work
and I thought to myself that's bad and
that makes me angry
but not as angry as this
we had two years to fix this
right and we've also got time to fix it
for 2022
but as far as I know nobody's working on
it
and we have maybe Texas made a made a
step but even they don't have an
auditable system
yeah maybe they have a system that's
just captured by Republicans instead of
Democrats right so you know maybe
different states are captured by
different parties
but
2022 is coming
in 2024 is coming
and nobody's working on fixing the
problem
I'm going to lose my
is one thing to have a problem and you
know you can complain about it but
the people in charge
have not even made this a priority
it's not even mentioned
and so I'd like to say to all of our
elected officials and even those running
for election who are not talking about
this as their top party
 every one of you
 your
goddamn useless piece of
you need to give us a election
system that we can trust
I don't even give a who gets
elected
give us a system that is compatible
with democracy and the Republic give us
a effort I don't even care if
it's hard and you can't figure out how
to do it tell us is your top
priority
because you know what my top priority is
this
everything else matters less
if we don't know who was in the country
or how they got elected it doesn't
 matter what your policies are
right because you lost your country
we need to get the country back
and the only way that's going to happen
is to fix the election process so it's
fully auditable and instantly somebody
needs to be working on that if nobody's
working on it we don't have a
government
we don't even have a government
if nobody's working on that we don't
have a government that's on our side
we don't we have a government that's I
don't know working for itself or not
working or
I don't know what the they're doing
but they're not working for us this
needs to be our number one
number one topic
needs to be bigger than climate change
because how are you going to change
climate if you can't even run your
government right it needs to be bigger
than the defense budget it needs to be
bigger than everything bigger
than Afghanistan bigger than
wall
bigger than all that
there is no bigger problem in
the country than the election
system not being credible to the public
and if you give me a politician
who will say that out loud
with some kind of an effort towards
fixing it that looks credible I will be
fully behind that politician and I'll
give a what part either in I don't
give a what their other policies
are
if they can get that one thing done for
me
I would even sign up to vote for the
first time
all right
so
how about
um hey tell us about your fiscal policy
Joe Biden no you your fiscal
policy your infrastructure
your immigration plan your
vaccinations everything about you
 your goddamn dysfunctional brain
that's basically a bowl of oatmeal at
this moment everything
about you
fix the election
or at least work on it at least tell us
it's a priority
president Trump
I got some tough love for you too
if you run for election and all you're
doing is complaining about the election
was rigged
that you don't have as your top priority
some way to fix it don't run
don't run you're no good to us
you have no value
Mr Trump who I liked by the way I like
him personally
but tough love
right
tough love if this isn't if this isn't
right at the top of your
priorities and all you're doing is
complaining about the last time I don't
care
I don't care if you run I'm not
going to support that
all right it's just going to make things
worse
wouldn't it I mean it's just going to
make a what a revolution or something
um so no Trump
no Biden
we won an election system I don't care
who it is it runs on that platform
Andrew yang
Andrew Yang looks like he might be
joining a third party or something
if you come up with a plan to fix our
election system I don't even care what
the other stuff is
don't even care just fix the election
system
and I will give you my full support
if you can have a credible idea and you
know some actual chance of doing that
so
here's where I am on all that
nothing else matters
and you're doing this right in front of
us politicians so yeah I guess that's
maybe that's the part that made me snap
it would be one thing if things happen
and you go oh God I didn't know that was
happening man that happened without me
noticing Afghanistan for example
snuck up on me right if you had asked me
hey Scott you know a month ago do you
think that's going to be a disaster the
withdrawal I would have said I don't
know and maybe maybe not who knows it
was just sort of opaque
but the election problem is not opaque
I know exactly what the problem is the
problem is it can't be audited it's very
objective
and you're not working on it
and it's our top problem number one
problem and you're not working
on it nothing
all right well I'm disgusted
Here's a thought experiment
I'm changing topics a little bit here
um Suppose there were two groups of
humans
and the only thing you knew about them
that was different is that one group was
told they're valuable just by existing
hey you group you are valuable you just
have to exist just be healthy
be whatever you are just exist you are
valuable
now there's a second group
you're told that their value is only
from what they do
they have to perform
they have to they have to be useful they
have to make something work they've got
to build something they gotta make some
money they gotta go do something
then he checked back in 20 years
which of the two groups
excelled at making money and success was
it the group that is told that they are
valuable just the way they are you don't
need to do anything
or would it be the group that's told
they're worthless
unless they do something succeed
so which ones do better
well as I've said before women are
biologically more valuable just by
existing because they could have babies
and men can't
and you'll need you know one man to
impregnate lots of women so we're not
very valuable men
from a biological standpoint
unless we do stuff
and
Mark Schneider
who had this very interesting tweet I'm
just going to read it to you he said the
fact is that as men we are expendable
until we can prove we are not
my father stepfather and grandfathers
instilled this in me
and I thought to myself
that sounds about right
I remember being
told quite explicitly that I had to like
do something you know I had to succeed
by doing something I'm not exactly sure
my sister got the same message
I'd love to ask you that I don't know
that she because I was told explicitly
that you know success
was my goal
I had to succeed
I don't know if my sister was told that
I mean not in direct language
I mean she did succeed you know she she
put together a very successful life
but
I don't know could be different I'm a
middle child by the way
um
and so I wonder if that's a part of the
difference in outcomes
you know obviously there could be
biological differences million other
social differences but I would think
that this would be at least one of them
that if you don't think that your human
value is much affected by accomplishment
why would you try
I mean
there's got to be a factor right
all right
um
China they've got this 21 day extreme
quarantine situation they use so if
you've been exposed or if you came from
another country it back into China uh
you'd have
[Music]
14 days
of compulsory Hotel quarantine
you'd have another seven days and some
kind of centralized quarantine that
designated locations
and then before returning home you'd be
Health monitored and then I think you
have to uh and you've got all kinds of
testing even before that stuff happens
and still an infection got into the
country
so they think they know who it was I
don't think so it doesn't sound like
they know who it was to me but they
think they know it was and they say that
this fellow had come in from
um I don't know Malaysia or Indonesia or
someplace and the attested negative for
the virus nine times during 21 days of
quarantine
before testing positive on Friday
37 days after entering China
you tested positive
what's going on it doesn't sound like
they know
exactly what's going on it sounds like
there's still mystery here but here's my
question
is any country
intentionally infecting any other
country
do you think that's a thing
because it would be horrible of course
but are you telling me that there's no
natural enemy countries
they haven't thought you know
it would be kind of evil but
if our rival were more infected than we
were
that might be good for us
does anybody think that way
I wonder because I think that way I mean
I'm not sure I'm not saying I would
Implement that plan
but I would think of it
I would certainly think of it
do you think that nobody is
intentionally infecting China
really
because that would be amazing restraint
you know maybe it's just hard to do
but it seems like it would be an amazing
uh expression of restraint
to not intentionally infect China if you
thought China was the source of it and
you thought China was evil and
everything else so China has this plan
of trying to basically you know stop it
stamp it out completely
and they've done impressive job trying
to do that but since we know it's going
to be an endemic and not a pandemic
isn't their strategy a failed strategy
because aren't they all going to get it
just the way we're all going to get it
just a matter of time
No it should it could be that the reason
China is taking an extreme position is
wait for it
that their Health Care system
wouldn't be able to handle any extra
stress
the way an American system can
because we we managed to expand and you
know do some impressive stuff
when we had to
but what happens if China's Health Care
System gets overloaded
I mean I assume that the cities have
pretty good Health Care Systems but in
rural China
what happens when you're sick
do they all have good health care in
rural China
I don't know so I would wonder if China
has potentially a gigantic problem which
is that they can't they can't handle any
level of infection similar to other
countries because it would crash the
country
right it might be just a way bigger risk
in China than it is in other places it
could even
um it could even threaten the government
I would think the stability of the
government would fall if their Health
Care System collapsed
am I right if China's Health Care System
collapsed right in front of the whole
world
even the leadership would be in trouble
right
so it seems to me that China is only a
few super spreaders away from falling
potentially I mean that's you know it's
not the odds on
but a non-zero chance there is a
non-zero chance that high infections in
China would crash the government
because I think the Chinese people would
start to see their government as the
problem you know if they believe it or
originated there the propaganda is
trying to tell the local citizens it
didn't originate in China
but if the Health Care System crashes
they're all going to know it
they're going to know their relatives
couldn't get that heart transplant and
everything else
[Music]
somebody says it's wild conjecture the
U.S has a worse Health Care system
um
here's my uh speculation so it is it is
conjecture you're right but the
speculation is this
that our rural Health Care is far better
I think if you looked City to City it
might not be that different maybe even
Chinese is better
but if you looked at rural
feel like we'd have a big Advantage now
that's the part you'd have to fact check
right
so we'll see
so um
China there's also a thought that China
might have to vaccinate the rest of the
world to protect itself
so imagine that the United States
continues on its current path
we should have enough
vaccinations plus herd immunity normal
infections that we're going to be
something back to normal
even though we might be masked and
boosted and that for years
we'll be able to have an economy in
something like a life
but China hasn't gone through this
and I don't know if there are low
quality of vaccinations are going to be
good enough if they have to go through
this
so what happens if we go through this
and get to the other end
turned it into an endemic where it's a
problem but you know doesn't stop
anything from happening
and they just started
and they just get taken out by the virus
I think that could happen and the only
thing that they can do
to try to prevent that is to try to
vaccinate everywhere else in the world
so that the that they can travel and do
stuff and not get it back in their
country
China
is going to have to vaccinate the rest
of the world
the United States apparently isn't
looking to do that
in our vaccinations are the good ones
so their vaccinations might not even be
good enough
so keep an eye on that so I would say
that China has at least
10
gigantic problems that don't even look
solvable uh China's in big big trouble
now what about the question of uh
business in China
I can't imagine that we're going to be
moving more American factories into
China
didn't that stop
can somebody tell me what was the last
time a major American company made a
decision to move into China with a
factory
as it happened in the past year probably
can't because of the pandemic but
but what Tesla's plans were older than
that but has anybody made a new plan in
the last six months or less year to move
into China
I haven't heard of any
yeah I think it stopped completely now
it could be the pandemic is what stopped
it because you can't you can't travel so
it's impossible to do that sort of thing
um yeah I think it'll end up in Vietnam
all right and China's stocks are getting
hit so there's a thought that
China's plan their Marxist planned I'd
never heard this before tell me if
you've ever heard this before
that Marxism
this doesn't make any sense I read this
but I it's got to be wrong so ignore the
next things that come out of my mouth
but the the idea is that Marxism
requires you to have money to do it and
you have to have some capitalism first
so that China's plan is to be capitalist
make a bunch of money
which will cause inequality and then to
introduce socialism
which will suck some of that money away
from the richest and give it to the poor
and then there's a third phase which is
communism which is apparently if you've
made enough with your capitalism you've
made it more equal with your socialism
that somehow there's this good thing
called communism at the end
I don't know how that could possibly
work but maybe somebody smarter could
explain the the details however it does
look like she is trying to rebalance
things and is trying to you know take
money from the elites and give it to the
public through various social policies
and that is a gigantic change
if it works so China's got another
gigantic challenge which is that
capitalism would destroy it
because the inequality would become too
enormous at some point and they would
fall just from the inequality some say
um
and tried to fix it seems like an
enormous problem too
so good luck to them
so do you think Texas's uh economy will
suffer because of the new anti-abortion
laws well Salesforce a gigantic company
is going to offer to relocate employees
and their families from Texas
if they want to move because of that
so does Texas win because the uh the
Godless liberals move out
and then you've got more Republicans
running things well
so does Texas come out ahead
because these mostly tech companies I
think decide to boycott it
or does Texas come out behind because
companies won't move there to do their
business
my my estimate is that Texas will come
out behind
now it's just a guess but here's why
if Salesforce did not already have
facilities in Texas would they move
there
no clearly
clearly Salesforce moved there because
they could move there when they did and
now you know they're there so it's too
hard to move out but they are moving
their employees out if the employees
want to go I don't think many will take
that
but I guarantee that the next big tech
company can't move into Texas
I guarantee it
I guarantee that no billion dollar tech
company will move into Texas while that
abortion law is happening
does anybody want to take that bet
so it's got to be at least a billion
dollar tech company
and I'm saying that not one of them will
move in that hasn't already made the
plans I know Tesla's made their plans
Etc
but people who have not made any plans
from this point forward no new tech
company will move into Texas now the
counter argument is yeah but Texas gets
to attract all these Republicans and
they manage things well and they'll be
fine maybe but I think if you um
if you make tech companies
if you make it too hard for tech
companies to move in eventually you're
going to suffer I think
and especially because Texas is a tech
state
um
Trump is saying that Democrats
disparaged the coveted vaccine while he
was president and now they wonder why
some are hesitant says Trump
do you buy that that the reason people
are hesitant may be in part because the
Democrats disparaged it
what do you think
I don't know maybe a little
but I can't believe that the Democrats
would have influenced Republicans right
Democrats influence Democrats but
Democrats are getting the shots
now the two populations the black
Americans and Republicans are the ones
that are having the most hesitancy
so it's in both parties
I'm not so sure that would have made a
difference
um
Business Insider
which is interestingly owned in part by
Jeff Bezos
is printing a leaked tax plan from the
Democrats so this is not official it's
just a leaked draft could be real
different and of course it's showing you
know gigantic tax increases on the rich
what are the odds that that's going to
get passed
do you think there's any chance that the
elites
who run everything are going to
massively tax themselves
because if you think the elites run
everything there's no chance that this
is going to happen right
no chance
so
I and I almost think that the size of
the plans that the Democrats are pushing
are designed to fail
right does it seem that the Democrats
are asking for so much in their spending
package you know that the trillions and
trillions it seems like they designed it
to ask for so much they can't possibly
get passed
because the elites
it's the last thing they want the last
thing they want is a giant spend and uh
and tax plan because they'll get taxed
so
I'm just going to put that out there
is Nancy Pelosi smart enough
to push a plan that can't get past
because she doesn't want it to get
passed or her backers don't want it to
get passed I wonder I doubt it
I doubt it
but you can't rule it out in today's
world can you
it's it's terrible that you can't rule
it out
but I'm going to predict that getting a
tax bill through that would rape the
elites who actually run the country
feels unlikely
unless they don't really run the country
I guess we'll find out won't we if you
believe that the elites are running
everything no matter what party they're
in it's just the elites then the tax
plan won't pass
right
because follow the money
the money predicts
totally predicts that that tax plan
won't be implemented it totally predicts
that
so how often is it wrong when money
predicts
not often money usually does predict
but we will find out if the elites are
in charge
because if the elites are in charge they
won't get passed
all right
at the press conference Rose McGowan
said she's uh she's no longer a Democrat
because they're the ones who harass
stalked and stole from her in her time
in Hollywood interesting
and
um
I would also add to that that
Republicans are better people
Republicans are well I'll say
conservatives conservatives are better
people
now
um that's just an opinion of course it's
subjective now I don't identify as
conservative I identify as socially you
know super liberal
uh not crazy liberal not not woke to the
point of crippled but
um socially liberal for sure so I'm not
a conservative but I can tell you that
if I have to spend time with a certain
group of people
that conservatives are just
on average
on average
they're just nicer people
now I'm not talking about anybody who's
like full out racist or something you
know both parties have you know people
who are just but on average
Republicans are nicer
they're just nicer
um that's my experience
now again it's purely subjective right
yours may differ all right
I believe
uh Scott do you think abortion at eight
five months is okay
um let me answer so I've been asked a
question about abortion
I'd like to answer that question by
dropping my pants and showing you my
penis
I won't do that
you're welcome I won't do that but the
point is I have a penis it does not
produce babies
if my penis produced babies and the
vagina did not
do you think I would care about a
woman's opinion
about whether I should be able to have
an abortion if only penises made babies
 no I don't want a woman's opinion
about my penis
at all
none I barely want a man's opinion but
at least there would be some credibility
if it came from a man likewise do you
think women
want my penis opinion about their vagina
I don't think so
it doesn't make the decision better
doesn't add any credibility to it
so
um it's not my question to solve and
whatever women as a as a group want to
come up with
make it legal make it illegal if women
are okay with it I'm going to back it
and I would ask that same standard in
reverse should there be a topic in which
it's really a man's question
because it doesn't apply to women for
one reason or another I don't want to
hear your opinion
at all I don't want to hear your opinion
at all unless you're an expert I mean if
a man is an expert on some element of
you know biology or abortion then yeah
but I'm not an expert
somebody says week it's weak
is it
I would say that's pretty subjective
fortified skins agree
abortion is a human rights issue
that's an opinion
because you you start with the answer
So when you say abortion is a human
rights I think what you're saying is
that the you know the fetus has a human
right I think that's where you're going
with that comment but you've you started
the argument with your assumption
if your assumption is it's human
well there's no debate to be made so you
you haven't really debated
you just put an assumption in there and
said you're done
and this is another another reason why I
don't get into the actual debate because
it's you can't win in the debate the
only thing you can do with abortion
is make sure that the right person makes
the decision
how many of you are fans of Thomas
Sowell
if I pronounce his right his name right
I hope I did Thomas you know the famous
uh black economists
and because it's 2021 and we're all
 I have to throw in the black
part
like that mattered
it didn't it didn't make any difference
to the point I'm going to make that he's
black but it's 20 21 so you have to
throw that in there
someday we'll just be able to say
economist
we're not quite there yet like we hope
we will be there but someday
anyway one of the things that Thomas
Soul says that I love is that it's not
so much what the decision is
it's who gets to make it now he's using
it in a different context
but same thing with abortion I'm less
concerned with what the decision is
because there's no right decision
it's awful either way it's just awful in
different ways to different people
so what I care about is the decision was
made by the right people and the only
thing I know for sure is I'm not one of
them
I'm not one of the right people so the
best thing I can do for the system is to
take a shower when you're deciding what
to do and then I'll back it now I'd be a
jerk if I say you make the decision but
I'll I'll criticize you for it
nope you make the decision you being
women or any men who want to because you
have a right you have a right to be part
of the decision I'm not arguing that all
men have a right to be part of the
process
um but after you make a decision
I'll back it Whatever It Is
yeah 80 year old women also have a say
women who can't produce children have a
say because they're all in the same pot
meaning that their lives are most
affected by this even if they can't have
children you know they're they're seen
as people who can have children or dead
or could
all right um yeah I don't care about
whether trans or part of it that's not
going to move the needle enough
all right that's all for now uh YouTube
I'll talk
