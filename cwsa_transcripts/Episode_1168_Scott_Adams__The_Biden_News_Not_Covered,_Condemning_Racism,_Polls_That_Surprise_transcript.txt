hey everybody
good morning now a lot of you were
saying yesterday that
youtube did not go live when periscope
did
but it did go live because there were
people on it and i was looking at
comments
and sure enough it posted like
everything else
so if there's anybody who sees some
issue with that
let me know but let me tell you
it's looking good today it's looking
good and by that i mean
everything's starting to turn positive
the economy
going up oh yeah everything but it's
going to get better with the
simultaneous sip and all you need is a
copper mug or a glass attack or chelsea
sign a canteen jug or flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
i like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine hit
of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous if it happens now go
ah i see
uh in the comments somebody's asking
about dilbert and masks
so i draw the dilbert comic strip
a month or two ahead depending on
whether it's the sunday or the dailies
the sundays
are more of a lead time and i had to
decide
if we would still be wearing masks you
know
in x days in the future and so i jumped
the gun a little bit it looks like we'll
probably be wearing masks
well into 2021 but uh the dilbert
crew will be doing lots of working at
home
lots of zooming not a lot of tubing
two binning a lot of zooming and
uh i took their masks off but i think i
took them off a little too early
so we'll see now there's there's a
little bit of a
a business problem if i take their masks
off or i leave them on leaving them on
is more of a problem and here's the
problem
the way my business model works is that
first the dilbert cartoon is published
in newspapers and websites around the
world and they get
they get first crack at it but after
that
we turn them into calendars and books
but the calendars and books are meant to
come well after the fact
and those masks aren't going to make any
sense in 2025
so i've got a whole bunch of comics that
probably we won't be able to use again
which is the first time that's ever
happened because if you look at any
dilbert comic from
10 years ago it probably works just as
well today
but that's a whole period it'll be like
a year
out of the dilbert universe that i can't
use for reprints or books because they
just
would look at a place so
that's all that
let's talk about some fun things i'm
going to start with a feel-good story
feel-good story okay there's a woman
that goes into a
i guess there are these stores called
wawa stores
some kind of grocery store that's uh not
where i live
and she was somewhere in the united
states i think and she went into a wawa
store
and there was a man in line ahead of her
who was having trouble
paying there was some trouble with his
credit card
so he didn't really have a way to buy
his stuff
so this woman in line had a sort of a
custom with her husband where they would
where they would sometimes pay for
people's purchases so if they saw
a veteran for example somebody in the
service sometimes they would just
buy that person's groceries and so she
sees this poor guy
kind of looks a little bedraggled and
you know maybe doesn't look like he has
a lot of money
and he's having trouble paying so she
she just steps up and says i'll pay for
it
so she pays for it and she's looking at
this guy and she's like
you know you look familiar
you know has anybody ever told you you
look like keith urban
and he says i am keith urban
and it was so it turns out that
she ended up paying for keith urban's
groceries somebody's telling me that a
wawa is more like a 7-eleven
uh so that's just a cool little
feel-good story you never know who
you're
you know if you do a favor for somebody
and i swear this is the secret of the
universe
it really is that i
and i think there are real differences
in how people are raised
to understand this little phenomenon
which is the the the good part of life
the part that's really meaningful is the
part where you're giving something it's
not the part where you're getting
something
and people who realize that the more
they give the more they get back
really have an advantage in life the the
people who think that
life will serve up you know little
delights
as long as they're just good people and
this was a cool example of that
all right the trump campaign has quite
wisely
very wisely done a little ad in which
they
count off the 38 times that president
trump has condemned racism and white
supremacy
now you've seen the compilation clips
before right you've seen a clip where
seven or eight times or whatever the
number is you'll you'll see a clip of
him denouncing racism
but what they did here was they put a
counter up in the corner
so that you would have to sit there for
all 38
and watch the counter click and they're
all modern well i think
a few of them go back a few years but
most of them are modern
times that he said he denounced these
and
what makes this better than the other
compilation clips
is it putting a specific number on it
and a big number
because 38 is a lot of times to say
anything
it completely changes the persuasive
power of it so just knowing that there
exists
a compilation clip is good
but compare compare these two thoughts
which one is stickier
there exists a compilation clip of the
president denouncing
racism all right that's one now here's
the second one
and compare there are 38 instances
on one video of president trump
denouncing racism and white supremacy
you see not even close you put that
number on it
especially when it's a big number and
the other compilation clips tended to be
you know half a dozen
clips or whatever but 38 times
i mean seriously have you ever denounced
anything
38 times so i sent that clip
off to my uh my somewhat infamous
democrat friend that i talk about all
the time anonymously
who is very smart but is in a complete
vacuum of information about anything
that
the conservative part of the country
sees he just doesn't see it
and so i've been trying to fill in the
blanks with some of this stuff i'd asked
him earlier
if he'd ever seen anything about the
tony bobolinsky
uh laptop story and he said well no i
i don't see much about that i i just saw
some reference to it
being completely baseless
so that's the kind of news that he's
getting
so i sent him the 38 times that the
president has denounced
racism because that was one of his
biggest issues
it was right at the top of the list why
can't this guy
denounce racism well he did
38 times why can't you see the news
it's because they don't let you you're
trapped in your little
news bubble dare i call it a cult
um because you can't get out and you're
not allowed to talk to the outside world
what do you call that let's see you're
in an organization
you you can't get out of it and you
can't communicate with the outside world
huh sounds like a cult
compare that to the republicans who can
uh easily leave how easy would it
be socially let's say socially and
economically
how easy would it be for you to leave
the republican party if you're in it
and become a democrat not only is it
easy
you would be rewarded people would pat
you on the back
and they'd invite you over and say
finally i'm so glad and you would just
be rewarded
and what would what would the
republicans do to punish you
to punish you for changing your mind
nothing a couple of mean tweets that's
it no penalty now suppose you went the
other way
you're a democrat and you tried to quit
the democrat party and come out
as a supporter of president trump well
we've seen a few people who have even
you know slightly slightly leaned in his
direction you know a kanye ice cube
and in the case of ice cube he's not a
pro-trump guy
but even having a conversation with them
big penalty right economically socially
and everything else
so i would say one of them is a cult
now what about the information so one of
them is easy to leave
and one of them is not what about
information well i'd say the
conservatives tend to see cnn's
news even if they don't think it's true
whereas
the people watch cnn primarily don't see
fox news
because they don't need to so
[Music]
which one's a cult all right
have you seen any polls because i know
they exist
but it's strange that i i can't think of
one so i don't know the answer to this
question
are the polls about american opinions
about
wearing masks and about reopening
the economy and about how frightened we
should be
of the coronavirus and you know how
aggressive we should be to
uh to battle the virus versus keeping
the economy open
have you seen any polls that would tell
you whether president trump
is closer to the public's opinion
or is biden does anybody know that
because why do i why do i not know that
why do you not know that isn't that
isn't that conspicuously missing
because the biggest thing we're talking
about before we go into the election
is that biden has a view on coronavirus
and trump has a view on coronavirus and
they're very different
which one matches the public and why do
i know that because i'm sure there have
been
there must have been polls that get to
that
but why isn't that reported every time
the news talks about their differing
views on the coronavirus
it seems like they would say and
president trump
has a view that is totally at odds with
the public
because if it were wouldn't that be the
headline
because this is life and death right
literally
life and death yeah lots of times you
say that and it's not
exactly true but this is life and death
real people really dying real tragedies
whichever way you go
it's a you know you have to choose your
choose your bad path
it's just too bad paths but
you know i'm not sure that in this case
i don't want to make the case that the
president whoever the president is
should just follow the public's opinion
on coronavirus
because that doesn't make sense right
because the public
they are not experts et cetera so i
wouldn't say
that it is automatically smart that if
president trump matches the public
opinion
that that's the best way to go because
the whole point of leadership
is to get you to do something you didn't
want to do
right you don't need leadership to tell
people to
eat candy because they kind of want to
eat candy they're going to do it anyway
you don't need leadership to tell people
to
i don't know wear clothes every day you
don't need to tell anybody
they're just going to sort of do it
anyway but you do need leadership
if you want somebody to let's say an
army to charge into danger
maybe those soldiers didn't so much want
to get shot at
but you need to tell them to do it
because you're the leader and it's for
the greater good so
i'm not going to say that matching the
public in this case
is necessarily the best leadership
decision
but shouldn't you know i mean it's just
this gigantic
gap of something terribly important you
should at least know
and then you can decide you know what
you think about the leadership
i'll tell you my gut feeling
my gut feeling is that there might be a
little difficulty getting an
accurate poll on this from the public
because if you call somebody at home and
say
do you think people should wear their
masks all the time
i feel like people are going to give you
the answer that you're looking for
right because posters have to adjust
with that they've got to figure out a
way
to tease out the real opinion when
people are likely to lie
and say what they think you want them to
say so i think people would say oh yeah
masks
wear those masks because it sounds good
i don't know if they would actually live
their life that way
here's what i feel i feel like the
american public
is very close to trump's opinion
do you feel that now you might be biased
because a lot of you are trump
supporters
if you're watching this periscope or
this live stream so
i don't know if we can ever know
who's closer to the public but i really
feel like trump is closer to the public
again that doesn't mean it's the right
way to go
you know just matching the public
because the public is not a bunch of
geniuses right it doesn't mean it's
right
it just means that it matches and
in terms of guessing who is going to do
better in the election
i feel like whoever is closer to the
public
you know matches their opinion is going
to have an election advantage
and i think that a lot of us have the
following opinion
that we're not allowed to say out loud
and that's really one of the problems
here one of the problems with the
coronavirus topic is you're not really
allowed
to say in public or out loud an honest
opinion
because if you did it would make you
sound like a monster
any honest opinion because here take for
example
you wanted to give an honest opinion
that matched joe biden
so you would say in opinion you'd say
yes i think we should
put maximum attention on wearing our
masks
and closing down businesses so sort of
matching the biden opinion but you can't
really say
the whole opinion out loud right because
the whole opinion is
yeah i think this will probably ruin uh
85 000 small businesses that will never
recover
and the families associated with those
businesses
will never be the same but i still think
on balance it's better that we do this
now and take some
take that pain because it might be
better in the long run that would be the
biden opinion
so you can't say that out loud all you
can say is pretend
that the masked part is the only thing
you're talking about you can't say
but i think if we do this 85 000
businesses will be destroyed or whatever
the number is i'm just making that up
likewise you can't say the other opinion
out loud
which is i think we need to really
protect the economy
because it's the engine that allows all
of us to thrive
it's what pays for our health care it
pays for our defense
it feeds us you can't ignore the economy
so i want to open up the economy but i
recognize
that this will cause a thousand to two
thousand americans per day
to die between now and vaccine time
or something like that right can you say
that in public
you cannot you can't say trump's
full opinion in public and you can't say
joe biden's
full opinion in public you have to leave
out the other half of the story
or you're not allowed to talk right you
can't say what i just said
and act like it's your opinion because
you would just be a monster
oh you're a monster you don't care about
85 000 whatever the number is
small businesses going out of business
you don't care
or you don't care that a thousand people
or 2 000 people a day are going to die
early so
we can't be honest about this stuff i
think the best you can do is
uh if you're lucky the president that
matches your opinion gets elected
um there's a second night of
looting in philadelphia
black lives matter protesters because of
the
fatal shooting of a man who had mental
issues
and came at police with a knife
i you know i want to give advice
to the black community but it's
obnoxious
you can't really do that either can you
because
how would that be received let me just
think about it
would you want somebody outside of your
community whatever you think your
community is
to be giving you advice not really
i mean you might want resources you
might want
support you might want a lot of things
but i'll tell you one thing you don't
want
usually it's just the way we're wired
you don't want advice
right if you're a woman and it's a some
woman related issue you don't really
want to hear from men
dia and and so on and so forth for every
every group but if i were to give
obnoxious advice to the black community
it would be very similar to what candice
owens gives which is
stop stop treating the people that you
don't want as your role models
as role models stop stop treating
the police as the bad actors in this
because the police are not happy that
they shot this guy
you know that right the the police
officers involved who had to shoot this
guy
and then you know especially when they
find out that he
has mental problems do you think any of
them are happy
do you think any of them got what they
wanted no
nobody's happy this is just a tragedy
definitely one we should pay attention
to definitely one that we should put our
best
our best uh efforts into making sure
doesn't happen
i'm no genius so i can't figure out what
they should have done
if somebody is is dangerous and has a
knife
is it really a mistake that the police
showed up before the social workers
can we really call that a mistake
because it's
a dangerous person with a knife
i don't know if the social workers
showed up first
would that have been better so i think
if i could give obnoxious advice to
people who probably don't want any bit
of it
if you take a loser strategy
don't don't blame me if it loses because
you know it's a loser strategy
right you know that you know that
putting your uh backing behind the
criminals and the mentally insane
is a losing strategy it doesn't make you
look
good to anybody else it doesn't get you
support
from anybody else doesn't make black
lives matter look good
it's just a bad strategy and
um and i mean it's a bad strategy for
you to get what you want
so i i don't think anything bothers me
about the whole
black lives matter protests and if i
don't think anything bothers me more
than the fact that the strategy is not
good
for getting what they want you know it's
not even a conversation of
should you have this or should you not
or what's a good plan what's a bad plan
but just the strategy is just so broken
and
i feel like it's i feel like it's a gift
to say that out loud because people got
to hear it
people with good strategies generally
end up okay
people with terrible strategies
generally end up poorly
and if you see a whole group of people
who are rallying
around an obviously bad strategy
obviously bad
it's worth it to point it out all right
trump is saying on the campaign trail
that the coronavirus
infections look bad because we're
testing more and the more you test the
more you find
and then his critics say but but but but
that's not the story because
hospitalizations and deaths
are also going up which is true um
but they're still sort of hovering in
the same range
right there they they might pop up a
little
percentage and we should certainly be
worried that yesterday's
pop you know might be the beginning of a
trend but we're not at the beginning of
a trend
it might be but we don't know that yet
so i feel like this one
the claim that the only reason we're
seeing these the
the spike is because of uh testing is
clearly untrue
would you agree with that two things can
be true at the same time
one is that the more testing you do the
more
infections you'll find so trump says
that and that is clearly
and unambiguously true that if you're
not testing you don't find it
if you are testing you do find it that's
just true
right if you're arguing against testing
finds more virus
i don't know how that makes sense but to
say that that
is a sign of or that that's a reason to
not be worried about the virus
that's a stretch
the deaths and hospitalizations are what
matters and i would say the deaths of
course matter more than
hospitalizations but they're related um
i here's my prediction i believe that
through the winter
although the number of deaths you know
may spike and fall
you know in smaller ways i feel like the
death
the deaths will continue on average to
trend down
because the our medical people
are just really good and they've they've
gotten a lot closer to figuring out what
to do
but the other factor that i think the
trump administration has
failed at just flat out failed at
and i say this for the benefit of all
those you who you say
scott scott scott you only say good
things about trump
you never criticize anything he does
which is not true because i do all the
time
so i'll do it again here's what i would
like to see
the president has made great claims
about regeneron
i think he's probably right i'm no
expert but it feels like
he's probably on to something the
regeneron seems to have scientific
backing etc
so we're not going to judge just on his
anecdotal
experience but it seems like the science
is there
and then the second thing we know about
the regeneron is that it's not
universally available there's a there's
a quantity
issue um there's someone watching this
uh this live stream or maybe recorded
right now who uh has been keeping me
informed about uh
her and her husband going through the
coronavirus
infection and in their experience the
husband
the husband did get hospitalized did
have a little uh
detectable lung
impact that showed up on x-rays i guess
and he did not get regenerate so imagine
a
senior citizen who went into a hospital
in the united states within the last
week had enough enough of an infection
that he had to be hospitalized
and and it showed up on the uh
when i say hospitalized i mean he went
in
to the emergency room to to get
treatment i don't know how long he
stayed if he did
but his lungs showed a little bit of
impact
and that wasn't enough to get regenerate
and i think the reason is
because of the supply my guess is
that somebody like him they're saying ah
99.9
chance you're going to be all right but
this one over here a little less chance
we don't have much regeneration we'll
give it to this one
but how far away are we from giving it
to everybody
how far away are we for that person i
just mentioned
gets a little regenerate on just in case
because i
i don't think it's unsafe and that
person might have worsened
quickly yeah and may have turned into a
bad case
so here's here's what i would like
from my administration as a show of
competence in managing the coronavirus
and it looks like this
you as a citizen should be able to very
easily google
a timeline that shows how much
regeneration we have
and how long it will take to make it
universally available
to anybody who needs it in the united
states
is that one month away
or is that six months away or is that
we can never get there between now and
the time that the coronavirus is gone
for other reasons
wouldn't you like to know that isn't
that like
maybe one of the most important
questions in
the world correct me if i'm wrong
tell me something that is more important
in terms of information that you need to
know
which is completely available you don't
think that we could go to the
the company that makes regeneron and i
believe there's another company
making something that's has similar
effect
are you telling me we can't go to those
companies and say we need your timeline
when you can have enough for everybody
and maybe you know also
some in-between steps so we'll know
where we are
somebody says it's on the web uh can you
tweet it at me
because if it's on the web and it's a
and it's
let me just give you a for instance if
we knew when everybody would have
regeneron
and let's say it was a month from now
how would you feel
in terms of your total worry about
coronavirus versus if they told you you
know
we're just not going to have more than
enough for 20 of our hospitals
all the way through next year
it's completely different right how much
you worry about the coronavirus would be
completely different
based on the availability of that
therapeutic and and mostly because the
president has talked it up so much
that your your mental model of you know
your uh
your risk has that big component now
because the president did that he put
that in your head
a real big part of the conversation is
this drug
you don't know you don't know if you
could even get it
i need to know and let me tell you how i
would act
differently i would act differently
if i knew that i could get that drug
tomorrow
if i could get it tomorrow i might say
to myself you know
i'll wear i'll wear my mask in all the
obvious times when you need it
but i might play a little a little loose
with it in those
less risky situations because well you
know i got my regenera
but if i don't if i don't have regeneron
if if i went to a local hospital
and i had a little you know lung impact
and i'm a certain age and i've got
asthma
i don't know if i'm coming home and i'd
like to at least know if i could get
regenerate
that's a big question and i don't know
the answer to it and that's just wrong
and i and i would say that that's a
clear
and obvious uh failure of the
administration
to get that information and get it to
the public
easy to fix though general flynn tweeted
today and this had a big impact on me
i want to see if it does to you so this
is from general flynn's
twitter account and he tweets the
following
quote over the next seven days leave it
all on the field
the enemy uses fear to decrease our hope
and limit our victories patriots and
freedom
will be victorious and then he has a
bible quote isaiah 43 1 quote you your
mind
now president trump used this exact
phrase and he said that his
strategy and he used the exact phrase
was to leave it all on the field
now when the president says it i like to
hear it
right because i made a big deal
yesterday about how when you see your
leaders working hard
um that means something it triggers your
your feeling of reciprocity oh he's
working hard
i feel like i can at least vote right it
inspires you to do a little
but when general flynn says over the
next seven days
leave it all on the field who is he
talking to
when trump says i'm going to leave it
all in the field he's talking to himself
he's talking to his campaign right leave
it all in the field
but when general flynn says it i feel
like he's talking to me
i feel like he's talking to voters he's
talking to
the base primarily and when a general
tells you to leave it all in the field
it feels different doesn't it doesn't it
feel different
and i feel like
um because of his unique situation
not only because he's a three-star
three-star general
i believe um or was retired
um but the fact that he has been
um i would say doing the same
general flynn is leaving it all on the
field in his own life too
i mean he's he's balls to the walls
defending his family and defending i
would say the united states at the same
time
because the united states does not
benefit if his family is victimized by
our own government
so he's fighting for the country ideally
he's fighting for his family fighting
for
for his own sense of life so his
credibility
is very high with us at the moment and
when he tells you to leave it all in the
field
you better vote you better vote
you got your orders all right
uh of course we're going to talk about
tony bobolinsky
the business associate of the bidens who
gave an extended interview on tucker
carlson's show
um so of course if it was on a major
news network on fox news and it was a
major piece in prime time
well that's big news so that'll be
that'll be on all the networks now
they're
they're going to have to cover it nope
nope they're not here here
here are the things that the other
networks have considered
not really newsworthy nothing like that
one is the brother of joe biden saying
that
they had plausible deniability
meaning that their activities with
foreign companies
especially china certainly
the implication is that they they look
pretty bad
or when you say plausible deniability
you're not just talking about the way it
looks right
plausible deniability assuming that tony
babilinski is accurately
relaying those exact words from
joe biden's brother plausible
deniability
says you know you're doing a crime or
something that you don't want to get
caught at
and you just have a way to deny it
now that doesn't hearing that report
from an
actual eyewitness who is willing to talk
to you that doesn't get your attention
so that's not news okay how about the
fact
that one of the emails that the bidens
do not deny israel
talks about holding money for the big
guy and tony babilinski has identified
with total certainty his certainty that
the big guy
is joe biden and if somebody is holding
money for him
in this case it would be hunter that he
would be implicated
in a you know pay-for-play influence
scheme might not be illegal because he
was not in office
but isn't that news that's not news
nothing nothing there okay how about um
how about uh what was the other thing oh
the fact that hunter biden referred to
their
business partner the person they're
actually doing deals with
hunter referred to him in an email that
again is not being denied as real
as a china spy chief
so the potential next president of the
united states his son
was doing business with somebody that
the son himself called a
china spy chief and of course
apparently there is a connection to
china's government
so he's not necessarily wrong about that
you know there's evidence that he's that
was an accurate
enough characterization nothing
no no interest there whatsoever
so if you want to have a good laugh and
i tweeted this
go over to ground news just
tweet it it'll pop right up ground like
the the ground you're standing on
news and what they do is they show how
each of the media outlets is covering a
story
so you can click on each outlet and see
their take on the same story
and what one of their primary graphic
will show you
that the entire middle and left of the
of the news industry
completely blank this story is just
doesn't exist and of course everyone on
the right
is covering it so i sent that to my
my democrat friend to show him the whole
in his news coverage
so so today my democrat friend received
the
the video of the 38 denials or
disavowing of racism from trump and
the ground news link that shows that
isn't
all the news sources that he uses
ignored
the story well all of the right the news
on the right covered it
i feel as though i feel as though that's
going to mean something
like i feel as though he's going to look
at that and say
maybe maybe i'm not getting all the news
maybe not we'll see
now the funniest part about this story
is how the left
the the story that they're using to
ignore it and
it's just laughable they're just saying
that there's no financial records to
show that joe biden was attached
to any of those deals now
that wasn't the claim the claim was
never that there would be
financial records that joe biden is
attached to a deal
was there anybody who ever made that
claim
so they've debunked a claim that nobody
ever made
the claim is very specific that it would
not be
on the financial records because
they got their plausible deniability and
you've got hunter biden
holding a share for the big guy right
so they managed to debunk a claim that
was never made
and then they just walk away and and
that's happening right in front of us
and it's just sort of wild it's sort of
wild yeah as somebody saying
in the in the comments the lack of a
record is the
is the story the story is that if you
look at the financial records you won't
find it
that's the story so they looked at the
financial records and didn't find it
and then said the story is false because
they found exactly what the story says
you will find
which is no financial record of course
there's the other part which is
verifying that there was anything
sketchy going on now here's the thing
i am certainly willing to believe that
nothing
technically illegal happened here
would you would you sign on to that now
that's not to say
nothing illegal happened there might be
a question about you know the
the forest off registering as a foreign
agent
so there might be some technical you
know thing going on here
but as others have said uh it's so
widespread a crime of not registering as
a foreign agent
that it would be is sort of a tic tac
thing to
pick one person and and go after them
for something that everybody's doing
so there might be a small technical
crime
one that the country hasn't cared about
too much
yeah the the logan act nobody's going to
care
technical violation so i'm completely
open to the idea that there's no
technical
real crime that anybody cares about
crime wise but how do we ignore the fact
that the sun would have potentially
large chinese connections
and is doing things that make him very
blackmailable
that's got to be a story the
blackmailable part
the good judgment part the connections
part
just the swampiness of it all all right
let's i'm preaching to the the choir
here
rasmussen uh had a poll on
um most likely voters and they're
asking uh about who knows about this
story or what they think about the
joe biden stories with hunter and
most of the likely voters actually know
about the story
so the story is actually getting out but
i think it's getting out
at least in many cases it's getting out
but it's paired with the denial
so i think a lot of people have heard it
if they heard it as cnn they heard it as
a fake news story
so the fact that they've heard it
doesn't tell you as much
as you think it does because they may
have heard it paired with it's not true
but here's the part that i found
fascinating
as with most polls different demographic
groups have different opinions
and here's the part that really caught
my eye
the among the ethnic groups
who most believe there's something wrong
with this
biden story meaning that there's
something to worry about
with the connection of hunter the the
people who
think that there's a problem here
black americans by far
black americans believe that the bidens
are up to something no good
compared to white americans
now did you see would you have seen that
coming
what group what demographic group is
least believing that biden's the biden
family was up to something
no good whether illegal or just swampy
what demographic group was most trusting
guess young people
young people so you can see how your
experience
uh influences things if you are young
you have seen you know almost by
definition
you've seen less of life and you've seen
less examples of bad behavior by
you know important people you might even
think that
the news is legitimate so young people
prove once again that they're the
dumbest
demographic and i can say that because i
was once
young and i was dumber than i am now
so it's the one group that you shouldn't
feel bad about mocking
because everybody was young and
everybody got smarter so
you can mock yourself it's you just
shouldn't mock other people and we've
all been young so i think that's fair
so young people sure enough the ones who
have seen the least of life
are the most gullible in the sense their
most
their most trusting of the of the
biden's
innocence black people who one could say
uh as a general statement that i don't
think anybody would argue with
right black people have seen more
am i right they've seen more bad
behavior by
more people including the police
right that would be high on their list
of of
groups that in their opinions uh has bad
behavior
so the people who have the most
experience of people acting badly in
life
in many cases against them as they would
see it
are the least trusting of the bidens so
you can see how your filter
on life has a pretty big impact
on your political opinions and should
why wouldn't it
um all right and i think that that might
predict where we're going here how are
you all feeling about how the election's
going to turn out
somebody in the comments is saying uh
blacks have a powerful detector
 meter that yeah that's what i'm
saying with
you know a classier language
because i'm so classy you know if you
want classiness
that's why you come here all right um
how are you feeling about the election
what do you think is going to happen
i can't explain this
but it feels like trump just has it
and i don't you know if my
my rational brain says yeah anything
could happen
you could be wrong polls can be wrong
your gut feeling can be wrong you got to
write in 2016. that doesn't mean you're
going to get it right again you're not
magic you might have gotten lucky
so that's my conscious brain that's
saying all those things
but every everything below you know the
the conscious part of the brain
wherever that is in the brain everything
below that says
trump already won
my body feels like it's over
my head is still asking all the right
questions
i was like well what about this what
about that that's what it's supposed to
do
but i gotta tell you you know
if you monitor your brain and your body
you find that there are lots of
situations in life
where they go in different directions
your brain is saying everything's all
right but your body is scared to death
very common right or your body is okay
but your brain is worried
and you're not sure what the hell is up
with that like why isn't my body worried
my brain is worried
so this is one of those so all of my
instincts all of my gut reactions
everything i know about life the
the sum of my experience over my
lifetime
my view from my skill stack
every bit of that says trump has this
locked up
like locked up but my conscious brain
says well maybe not you know never know
so that's where i'm at i just wondered
how how many of you
so i'm looking at your comments uh yeah
may silver still thinks it's
it's bidens to lose um
somebody says are you uh overestimating
how smart the american people are i
i don't know if i have an opinion about
their smartness i just have a feeling
i'm certainly not basing my opinion on
the intelligence of the american voter i
wouldn't do that
i'm basing my opinion on how everything
feels you know i suppose there's some
some knowledge and information and
experience that's informing the feeling
but i can't put my finger on it
somebody says it's not over vote yes
certainly there's nothing i'm saying in
my periscope that's going to cause
anybody to not
vote and if you don't vote obviously
that changes the
the outcome all right um
so it's looking good to me and uh when i
see the
people on the left who act just as
confident
that it's over the other way
somebody's in for a surprise a big
surprise
now and i'll say again if it turns out
that i'm wrong
it's not it's not going to rock my world
i'll just say oh i guess the polls
they adjusted they adjusted after 2016
and the polls were just more accurate
than i thought that's all
and you know i'll just go on with life
but the democrats are going to have some
serious mental problems if this doesn't
go their way
and it looks like it's headed that way
now let's talk about the
uh the revolution some of you are
expecting
there are very few things that i am
this comfortable saying with certainty
and i'm going to say this with complete
certainty and in this case my body
and my brain are completely on the same
side
we're not going to have a revolution
we will have our arguments and our
disagreements we might get the supreme
court involved
there certainly will be let's say if
trump wins
there certain will certainly will be
unrest in the streets
small businesses will be destroyed but
it will be
sort of a an increase of just our
baseline
you know this baseline protesting stuff
but it's not going to be it's not going
to be a civil war
and the reason it's not going to be a
civil war is there just
are not enough people who want one in
order to have a civil war
you kind of want to have some core
group of people who want a civil war
who who have a desire for that to happen
we just don't have
anything like that there are lots of
people who you know might
want to go out and protest but even
those people
even the protesters most of them don't
want a civil war
and if it happened it would be squashed
pretty pretty easily now the other thing
is that rich people
do not want a civil war that's the worst
thing that could happen to rich people
right
because they could lose everything they
kind of like things the way they are
and rich people probably have a lot more
control over the system
than we even understand and we
understand they have a lot
so as long as the rich people are
solidly against the civil war
and they are there are no there are no
rich democrats who want a civil war
there are no rich republicans who want a
civil war
and they have the power now even if you
imagine
okay it's not the rich people who are
going to hit the streets and all that
i feel like they control the
communication
so there will be billionaires who
control the news on the left
they'll be billionaires and other people
who control the news on the right
and none of those people who control the
message
are going to be saying grab your gun and
hit the street
none of them there won't be any the only
place it'll be coming from is
you know some leftists and some uh some
antifa people who are like ah it's our
time it's our time we'll strike all the
well the the mood of the country is is
all negative this is our time to strike
how many will there be in the whole
country
how many of those people will there be
10 000
spread across different cities you know
a few hundred in each
absolutely nothing if you add it all
up it doesn't add up to a drop in the
ocean
so there will be no civil war
there will be no civil war if trump wins
all right if trump wins there'll be no
civil war
uh if biden wins there will be no civil
war
because he won all right nobody's going
to go to the street just because the
election
went for biden but if he were to be
over-influenced by
his progressives and he actually came
door-to-door
trying trying to take your gun away okay
that would be a civil war
that would be a civil war if if biden
tried to take your guns away
uh no doubt about that one but you know
nobody's gonna there won't be a civil
war after the election
that just isn't enough reason um
there's a verdict in the nexium trial
nexium
which the press calls the cult the
members do not
um and he got 120 years
ouch now of course you and i
don't get to see all the evidence of the
trial so we you know we can't really
judge
was it a fair trial the the people who
support
the nexium leader keith rineri
they would say that the evidence is
sketchy on some of the claims etc
i did did read uh the statement from the
uh 15 year old who alleges that she was
groomed and and forced into
a variety of sexual and other things
by keith renery and i would say that the
statement is pretty brutal
pretty brutal and
certainly if if any of this stuff in
that statement is true
then you know uh then keith has to
answer for that
um but the other part
about whether the other members in the
the
the sub group the the dos subgroup who
had
some kind of a slave master fraternal
situation going on there the question is
whether
there was some kind of real brainwashing
or if they have free will
and i'll tell you this question is
vitally important
because we're a very unscientific people
meaning that we believe there is a thing
called free will
science can't find it right if you
believe in science
you can't believe in free will at least
the way i define it
you can certainly say we don't know what
we'll be doing you know there's some
uncertainty about how people will act
because we're not good at predicting the
complexity of the human mind
but cause and effect and the rules of
physics
did not stop at the outside of your
skull it also applies to
anything happening inside your inside
your brain
cause and effect so this issue of what
is
free will and what is not is just
um really important
because people will go to jail for stuff
that
may have been just an illusion and one
of the illusions is
that people who agree to do things that
you would not agree to do
must have been brainwashed or they
wouldn't have done it
and that's just not true turns out that
there are people who
do all kinds of things you wouldn't do
and they don't need to be brainwashed
because they're just different people so
the fact that a number of these people
voluntarily went into a situation that
involved
giving personal information that could
be used for blackmail
they went into a situation where they
were going to call somebody else their
master etc
the fact that you wouldn't have done it
doesn't say anything about brainwashing
because these are people who had their
reasons
you don't have to know their reasons
they had their preferences
you don't need to know their preferences
so to me this is a little bit
gets close to the lgbtq
kind of uh philosophical argument
which is you know does society have a
right
to discriminate against people because
of any sexual
i'll say orientation and or preference
because those get used differently
so i would say we shouldn't discriminate
for that reason but of course the trial
had you know they were talking about
actual crimes
as well so
keep an eye on that um
and then of course uh tomorrow there's
gonna be uh
there's gonna be the testimony
of the big social media heads so we're
going to see the ceos of facebook google
and twitter
talking to the senate commerce committee
about
allegations that they're moderating
content especially against conservatives
this is what cnn says about
the allegation that the social networks
are uh
are not favoring conservatives or
they're they're biasing against
conservatives cnn says and i quote on
their website
independent studies of social media have
found
little credible evidence to suggest that
the technology is biased against
right-wing viewpoints
what they continue but the executives
clearly expect to be pressed on the
matter
now i did not
look at all of their sources for this
claim this
that independent studies have found that
social media does not
uh is not biased against right wing
that is so ridiculous
on the surface i don't even know what to
say about it
i mean really it's just mind-boggling
the cnn could
put such disinformation on their page
uh i don't think there's anything that
has more evidence for it does it
show me the list of left-wing people
banned by twitter
i mean it's kind of ridiculous that i i
can't even believe cnn would have the
guts
to print that on their website but
um i also have not seen any study that
would uh
be credible that shows there's some
difference there all right
so uh just going to look at some of your
comments
as they go by yeah somebody says quote
independent studies how independent
would any study be of this topic
not at all there's no such thing as an
independent study
on whether the left or the right are
being treated uh the same
you can't have an independent study
because everybody in this country is
either left or right
there's no middle left all right uh
somebody says it makes you want to swear
the slaughter meter
is still at 100 i used to say greater
than 100
because it was fun but i'll just say 100
it's maxed out and as far as i can tell
the only thing that suggests biden could
win
is the polls that we don't trust the
ones that were wrong last time
that's it everything else seems to lean
toward trump in terms of enthusiasm
you name it all right
so that's where my gut says my gut says
it's all trump
i would give you the
i will give you the caution that i gave
in 2016.
some of you who have been with me since
then when i first started
periscoping you might remember that as
soon as the
uh the election was called for trump
in 2016. i got on a live stream
and i tried to appeal to
trump supporters to tone down the
gloating
because it doesn't make up for a better
country right it just causes trouble
so we don't know yet who's going to win
i think it'll be trump if it is trump
keep your gloating to a minimum sure you
got to enjoy yourself
i know you're going to have fun but you
don't have to
you don't have to be a dick about it you
don't have to be
because people's emotions are going to
be frayed and it's going to be
a little bit like that the gentleman who
got
shot by police was running at them with
a knife
you know even though the police
were protecting themselves there has to
be a better situation
than shooting people who are crazy and
you're going to see
if trump wins and it's looking like that
to me
you're going to see a lot of crazy
people like seriously crazy
and i'm not joking i mean crazy not in
the
oh your uncle is crazy i mean it's going
to be flat out
mental disease and it's going to be
pretty bad
you don't want to make that worse by
over gloating and i would say if you
could find a way
to let's say be kind
do it so if there's somebody in your
circle
who didn't get their way and you know
they're flipping out maybe just say
you know hope we can work together or or
just say something that doesn't sound
dickish
right because you don't have to be a
dick
oh you can enjoy it and if you see more
of those memes of the
of the woman screaming at the sky i will
forward those two
i'm not going to say we're not going to
enjoy it certainly among
you know among each other but just don't
be a dick you don't need to be a dick
about it
and if it goes the other way do not
expect
that the left will not be a dick about
it
this doesn't work both ways you should
have no expectation
that anybody will be kind to you if
you're a trump supporter and it doesn't
go your way
don't expect it to be kind it's going to
be brutal
so be ready ready for anything but be
kind if it's up to you
that's all i have to say for now and i
will talk to you
tomorrow
you
