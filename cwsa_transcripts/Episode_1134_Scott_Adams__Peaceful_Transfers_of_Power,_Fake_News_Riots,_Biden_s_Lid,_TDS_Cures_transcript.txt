hey everybody
come on in gather around it's time
time for the best part of the day the
part that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip do you
know what you need
to participate do you do you
yeah that's right you all got the right
answer at the same time
all you need is a copper mug or glass
attacker tells your sign a canteen drug
or flask of vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid i
like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine hit
of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous
but it happens now go
oh yeah that's good stuff
uh who says that that was uh johnny
carson yeah that's good stuff
that's good stuff
well um it's hard to evaluate the news
if you're not an expert yourself
on some things and there are a lot of
things i'm not an expert on
one of the things is political campaigns
i'm not an expert on political campaigns
so when i look at joe biden
calling a lid on his schedule meaning
that he will not appear in public
today whatsoever in any in any way
and when that lid is cold first thing in
the morning
i ask myself this because again i'm not
an expert on political campaigns but
if you're running for president and it's
40 days
or so before the election do you
not know what your schedule will be
tomorrow
do you not because it seems to me they
could have called the lid for today
yesterday because i'm pretty sure they
knew
yesterday that there would or would not
be any pull
any public appearances today am i wrong
wouldn't they know that yesterday but
they called it this morning
it sort of makes you think that maybe
sorted just possibly they make their
decision about whether there's going to
be a lid based on how he's doing that
morning
now you could tell me no no scott
you don't understand he's fundraising
needs a whole day to fundraise or or
he's fundraising and
he's preparing for the debate you know
you need to
clear your schedule and get ready for
that debate to which i say
have you heard a zoom because you can do
a national interview in 10 minutes
you could do it during break of your
preparations for other stuff
so it seems to me that there's no
legitimate reason
that a candidate for president would
just disappear for a day
this close to the election unless
they're trying to hint to us that the
cat's on the roof if you know what i
mean
the old joke that that is suggesting
that there's more trouble ahead but
we're going to break it to you slowly
all right the big big news of the
day well a couple of big news but one is
that
a reporter asked the president yesterday
the reporter says win lose or draw in
this election
will you talking to president trump will
you commit here today for a peaceful
transferal of power
after the election and trump in his
inimitable way
instead of saying the obvious thing
which is of course we don't want any
you know any violence and we're all
going to follow the constitution
and it'll all work out that's what you
expected it to say
but president trump does not say what
you expect him to say
sort of ever and so when asked if he
would commit to a peaceful transferal of
power after the election
trump says and i quote we're going to
have to see what happens
now
the reason i like that is that it's
transparent
and it's and it's honest that that was
the only honest answer
did you want him to lie did you want him
to lie because that would change
something
what would have changed if he lied what
if he said oh yeah
i can commit to that because you know he
can't commit to that
he doesn't have the ability to commit to
that because
he's only one person and while he has a
vast powers as the president
he doesn't control all of our actions
he doesn't control 330 million people
if 330 million people feel like they
want to get a little violent after
election day
what the hell is trump going to do about
it how in the world can he commit
that that's not going to happen when in
fact we've designed a system that's
guaranteed to make it happen
you know how you could uh and the
president
you know referred to the same thing if
you created
an election process that the entire
country
thought was a valid process
well maybe maybe in that case you could
come close to guaranteeing it
because you'd be you know at least
getting rid of the the primary reason
for any violence if you got rid of the
reason
you'd have a pretty good shot at having
no violence
but if you design the reason for
violence into the system
you actually create a system that
guarantees violence
how is the president supposed to commit
to it not happening
when you've designed it for violence
what i mean by that
is if you design a system that forty
percent i'll just
use a number pulling it out of my you
know what
but probably forty percent of the
country i'm guessing
you know could be 30 or 50 whatever but
in that range
let's say 40 percent of the country is
not going to trust the
the result if there is a mass mail-in
kind of a vote which looks like the way
it's heading now for those who are
new to this there are three separate
kinds of mail-ins
if you don't know that there are three
different kinds
and you just say to yourself they're all
reliable
or you say to yourself they're all not
reliable you don't understand the
question
there are three different kinds two of
them
pretty reliable i would be comfortable
with two of the three
the third one completely unreliable and
it's the big one
the reliable ones are
absentee ballots and they're reliable
because you request
the ballot so it's a little harder to
cheat if you've requested it you get it
it's got your name on it you send it in
we've done that for years people are
pretty comfortable with that that's one
of the three
pretty good second one is five states
have gone through the the history of
doing uh
you know generic mail-in uh ballots to
everybody but they've also had time to
scrub their databases and
figure out what their base is so if
anything is out of whack they'd say oh
this one's out of whack because you know
prior years it didn't look like that
so for five of the states pretty good
i'd like it to be better but pretty good
so that's two of the two of the three
types
the absentee balance very well tested
the five states that have been doing it
and had time to refine it
very well tested and then the third
category
which is the big one which is all the
other states
who haven't tested it they've never
they've never tested their databases to
know if they're going to send them to
the wrong homes
people are going to get you know massive
wrong mailings we don't know
now it could be good and it could be not
good but would you
trust it if it's never been tested and
let's say it gives you a result you
don't like
no no it's a system that's designed
to fail it's designed from the start to
fail
if you don't get that it's designed to
fail
you're not paying attention if you fall
for the the trick
that there's one kind of mail-in vote
and it's all
like absentee absentee vote ballots
therefore it's all good
you have fallen for the fake news there
are three different
situations two of them pretty good
pretty good the third one the big one
don't know so even if it were accurate
which is sketchy who knows but even if
it were accurate
who would trust it because it hasn't
been tested and
in our current situation that is called
planning to fail
you can't draw any picture where if we
do what we plan to do
it works out well can you
try to try to tell a story that includes
doing exactly what we plan
and then everybody's happy at the end
you can't do it
there is no story that ends that way you
can't even imagine one
like in your weird imagination
so when the president says he can't
commit to
a non-violent transfer of power
that's just honest how in the world he
can't even stop the
apparently he can't stop the riots in
the cities
why would they stop if trump gets
elected do you think
riots are going to stop let's say trump
gets
elected in a landslide and it's such a
landslide
that you don't even have any questions
about the vote
you might say to yourself yes there was
some voter suppression
and there was some voter cheating but it
couldn't possibly be big enough
to account for the landslide even with a
landslide
of that size do you think there would be
no violence
of course not of course there would be
of course there would be violence
because there's violence now and there's
nothing that will stop it
there's nothing that's lining up
there's nothing about the election that
would stop it of course it would be
all right so that's getting everybody
all worked out
and of course that plays into the uh
you're you're a big old ol
you know dictator if you're talking
about that but here of course is the
part that the
fake news doesn't tell their audience
and it goes like this there i don't
think there are any trump supporters who
want to violate the constitution
have you ever met one have you ever met
a trump supporter who would say
if we have an election that we can trust
and trump does not get elected we're
going to
take up arms to keep them in office
said zero people have you ever met
anybody who would say if trump loses
we want to keep him in office
i've never met anybody who has that
opinion in fact
i would argue anybody who has that
opinion is not a republican
anybody who has that opinion that the
election doesn't count and we're just
going to
keep him anybody would have that opinion
is not a conservative
they would not be somebody who believes
in the constitution and therefore they
would not be on trump's team
to begin with right that's pretty
fundamental
and the whole trump support thing is
that if he doesn't win
he's not president right
can we agree if you know if there's any
if any uh
left-leaning people wander in here to
see your comments
can you back me up in the comments is
there anybody
who supports trump who would support
keeping him in office if he lost the
election
no no that doesn't exist that's
completely imaginary
anybody who thinks that that's the case
uh has got a real
bad case of tds now um
we'll talk about that in a minute too
and then i guess president trump
predicted that the supreme court
may decide the outcome of the election i
would say that's
close to guaranteed wouldn't you among
president trump's among president
trump's uh predictions this one's a
pretty safe one
i feel as if no matter what the outcome
is the
the supreme court is going to get
involved it just feels like a guarantee
now here's the thing are are republicans
and conservatives
going to trust whatever the supreme
court says
if they have a 6-3 majority which
they might have right if conservatives
have a six
three majority and the decision doesn't
go their way
they are going to accept it oh they'll
complain
blah blah blah blah they might say hey
my justices are not as conservative
as i hope they'll have something to
complain about
but if a 6-3 conservative majority
you know says trump didn't win
you're not going to see a lot of trump
supporters marching in the streets
nobody's going to pick up guns over that
because that's their court you know
that's their court
that's the way it goes they're going to
take that so i don't think you have to
worry about
anything from the conservative side now
what if
what if the election is actually stolen
what about that what if the election was
like just
obviously stolen and it was just
you could tell that it was stolen
and let's say it was stolen by the
democrats
and trump's still in office what then
what that what would you support
if the election is stolen well i would
support it going to the supreme
court and if the supreme court said
we're going to have to do a do-over
i would live with that whatever the
supreme court says
as long as we're on the same page that
we can trust the supreme court
you don't have to worry about the
conservatives you do have to worry about
the liberals because they might not they
might not accept what the supreme court
says
they might say this court is rigged with
all conservatives we do not trust it
all right it looks like uh gun sales in
the in the swing states are up 80
percent this year
and uh is that bad or good
is it bad or good that gun sales are up
80 percent
i don't know i mean it's good in terms
of freedom
i suppose but will more people get
killed because there are more guns
probably we don't know could go the
other way maybe more
people will be protected hard to know
kevin mccarthy finally said something i
wish somebody had said a long time ago
he said that if nancy pelosi tries to
impeach president trump
just for trying to trying to get the
supreme court nominee that he wants
when he wants it that if she tries to
impeach him for just that
in other words doing his job uh
that uh that they'll try to impeach her
[Laughter]
now i feel like that's completely fair
don't you
if if pelosi tries to impeach the
president for simply doing what the
constitution says this
is job even if you don't like it
i think she should be impeached that
feels perfectly fair to me
all right what should
trump do or not do about all the
riots about the the police
violence against black people and the
black lives matter riots etc
why should he do at the moment
he's just milking it for political gain
and i have mixed feelings about that
right
if the pres the president was getting
some uh
some flack for not coming out and saying
hey calm down let's not have any
violence over the
brianna taylor thing and so the critics
are saying
that the president should be more of a
calming force on society
to which i say how would that work
how exactly is president trump
of all people going to make the riots
less rioty because he said something
is there anything that could come out of
his mouth
that would make the riots less likely to
be riots
i don't think so there's literally
nothing he can do
that wouldn't make it worse if all he
did was say
you know i call for peace you know we
should all come together
what difference would it make would it
make a difference if anybody said it
where where is obama calling for peace
and did it make a difference
if obama let's say retired obama
if him calling for peace doesn't make
any difference to the rioting
why would trump calling for peace make
any difference
it would make no difference it could
make it worse
but here's what he could do
he could call for all parties
to look to science
[Laughter]
which would be a very tricky play
he could say look there seems to be some
disagreement on the basic
situation meaning that the
the people have disagreements about
what's happening with these
protests and black lives matter etc just
seem to have
legitimate disagreements about what the
reality is
what causes what who is responsible for
what
what's the best solution for this so why
don't we just
call on science let's see if we can get
the best data we can
get everybody to agree are black people
being killed
by police in some way that is
statistically meaningful
versus any other group and find out
let's let's all get together
and really use our science what would
happen
well first of all they would say no they
would say get away from me with your
with your dictator ways or something
i mean they would have to say something
because it's trump but it would be
unassailable it would be completely
unassailable to say look
i think our problem is we're not
agreeing on the facts
so let's bring in the science let's
bring in the experts let's really
have a national national debate on just
the facts
how much of it is institutional racism
how much is it a training problem
how much is the behavior of the people
who are being stopped let's just put it
all out there
let's see what the truth is if the
president did that
it would be unambiguously
let's say productive meaning that who
would argue against having better
information
you really can't but where would that
lead you
well it would lead you to not
protest but they would know that and so
they would resist
so it would put the democrats in the
position of resisting
calls for better data and science
and that would be a good place to be for
the president
all right here's my filter on
the the riots and the brianna
brianna taylor stuff you all know the
story by now
the police officers were found not
guilty of any kind of murder in terms of
her death and therefore their riots
because of that now here's the central
magic trick
at play and or you could call it a
an illusion or a magic trick
i call it a magic trick because there's
somebody actually doing it
in other words there's somebody
perpetrating the trick
intentionally so that's more of a magic
trick
than a natural illusion that just
happened on its own so here's how i see
it
yes we're going to the white board there
are two views of reality here
the protesters are saying there's racism
everywhere
and there's racists and the cops and
because some of the cops are racist
they're more likely to murder black
people
in in routine stops than they would
other groups so so this is the protester
view of the world
there's racism there's racist cops there
are shooting people
and there aren't enough people doing
something about it
so therefore society needs to be really
stressed and pushed because it's just
not doing anything about
this problem here's
my view which is that
we are past the point where people make
their own decisions
for politics people largely are assigned
opinions
so there are almost nobody in the world
who just thinks up their own opinion
they look at their new sources and they
adopt those opinions that are assigned
to them
so if you're a democrat you're getting
some cnn opinions and some nms nbc
opinions
but what you're not doing not even close
to doing
is making up your own mind if you
believe
that you make it that people make up
their own mind about politics
you don't understand how minds work
how the news works or how social media
and ai works
so here's my here's my model of the
world
you've got artificial intelligence in
the form of let's say the algorithms
the algorithms are telling us what we're
seeing and what's important
right so that's the first thing the
algorithm decides
what you think is important you don't
decide what you think is important you
think you do
but you don't the algorithm decides that
based on what gets you the most excited
activists of course are goosing this so
they're
they're they're pushing wherever they
can push their you know
they're being opportunistic and saying
oh if people are already mad about this
let's let's pile on this a little bit we
we can we can move this a little bit
it's already moving on its own
so between the social media and the fake
news and by fake news i mean
if you had originally heard the brianna
taylor story
uh accurately let's say the first day
that anybody heard the story
it was completely accurate now in this
case i don't think there
were people lying about the story i
think just we didn't know the story
until
recently but suppose on day one you'd
heard
it was not a no-knock raid
so the the the core of the thing was
that it was a no-knock raid
but now we're told by the you know the
police
and by the i guess was the prosecutor uh
now we're told that there's a witness
and it is confirmed
that it was a knock raid so suppose
you'd heard that first
oh they knocked and then you heard that
the boyfriend is shot at the police
first
and then you heard that the police shot
back
and that there was an innocent person on
the i think on the other side of a wall
who got killed
and nothing about this story involves
race in other words you could tell the
entire story without mentioning
the ethnicity of anyone involved and
nobody would know that you had left
it out because it wasn't any racial
element to the story whatsoever
so imagine that that had been the news
tragic uh tragic accident the police are
investigating the officers to find out
you know was this purely an accident or
was there something
you know bad behavior here if you had
heard that version
first would there be riots
no if you if you knew that george floyd
had a fatal amount of fentanyl in him
when when all that went down would you
feel the same
about how he died now there's still
there's still
something that legitimate uh questions
can be asked about the police
performance
so did the police handle themselves
perfectly
right i don't know but did they kill
george floyd well certainly not in not
intentionally and
you know if you heard the story just
accurately from moment one you'd have a
very different feeling about it it would
be tragic
you would certainly think there are
questions to be asked but it wouldn't
look exactly like murder
and it wouldn't even look racial you
know
what was the racial element to that
if you looked at you can think of a few
other examples
where uh there have been riots over
something that turned out to be not
quite the way it was originally
portrayed
so in my view of the world you've got
the ai the activist pushing social media
the fake news is literally reporting
things that are not true
and these things collectively leave you
the impression
which would be a false impression under
this worldview
the false impression that black people
are being murdered by the police
now here's the problem how do these two
people have a debate
what's that look like it's impossible
these people can't have a conversation
with these people
they don't even live in the same reality
if you believe that this was true
you're not really even going to be able
to hear this
and if you think this is true you think
these people are just
under-informed and if you try to inform
them
how would that go you know some
somebody's like protesting out there and
they've
they've committed like a significant
part of their life to fixing this
problem of the cops murdering black
people
and then you come in and you say you
know you were just wrong about the whole
thing
you were sort of looking at the
situation wrong really
your opinion was assigned to you by
algorithms and
and the news so you don't have an
independent opinion it was actually
assigned to you and all the news was
wrong
so you started with completely wrong
facts that pointed in
exactly the opposite direction of truth
and that on top of those facts that were
completely wrong
you were assigned an opinion but in your
mind you think you had you came up with
it yourself
but you but you didn't you actually were
assigned this opinion
how's that go how's that conversation go
does this person say whoa
you're blowing my mind now i wish i'd
known this before before i wasted all
this time protesting the wrong stuff
no no it's not going to go that way
you can't convince anybody in either of
those realities
that they're in the wrong reality it
just doesn't work
so so we'll see more of that
so i was really curious and if you
didn't do this yesterday boy do you miss
a show
uh when i found out the verdict of the
brianna taylor thing
i immediately turned on cnn because if
cnn was a legitimate
news organization what would they have
reported
about the brianna taylor situation well
if they were legitimate news
they would have said uh gosh we were
the reporting was wrong about it being
no knock and that's really important
did they say that nope chris cuomo
actually said that's not that's a
question
so even though the official report is
that
there was a witness and there was an
announcement and knocking
chris cuomo says but there was somebody
who reports they didn't hear it
there was some other witness who said
they didn't hear any announcement
to which i say if there's somebody who
heard it
and then somebody who didn't hear it
which one do you think is more reliable
because it seems to me that the person
who clearly heard it
unless they're lying i mean why would
they i suppose they could
um yeah i guess anybody has a reason to
lie
but it's a little more believable that
there's a witness who has an
affirmative sighting of something
happening than it is somebody who didn't
hear it
because not hearing something is
a little bit ordinary there are people
who don't hear things that happen
but it's a little weirder to
specifically hear something in detail
and then have imagined it that would be
weird
yeah in this case uh this isn't quite
the
seeing the elephant situation i know
where you're going on this one but
it's a little different than that all
right um
so they would have reported that the
central claim
is at least at the very least
it's been uh credibly questioned at the
very least
then they would have said it was a
tragic accident
and it had nothing to do with race
there's no evidence
that race was a factor in any way and
there's no evidence that the police even
knew they were shooting in the direction
of riona taylor i think she was on the
other side of a wall or something
they thought they were returning fire to
the boyfriend
so it was sort of a perfect storm of
bad luck that the boyfriend who had the
legal handgun
thought that the ex-boyfriend who was a
drug dealer might have been the one
crashing in the door
so that's the first bad piece of luck
and the fact that he was there at all
so you know you had a lot of bad luck
that created a tragedy
if cnn had reported that that it was
just
turns out it was just a bad luck tragedy
situation
would there be more or less rioting
i think less imagine you were
you were a writer and you turn on the
news and you think it's your friendly
news source it's cnn
and they say oh it turns out this was
just a big mistake
you you should you know think about the
the families
you know the taylor family it's a
tragedy you know we can't
you know overstate how much of a tragedy
was
but it was just a tragedy it was an
accident
maybe we could do better in the future
but it was an accident
that would make a difference wouldn't it
but instead
um cnn played it
like maybe like maybe it was racial
there's no evidence of that there's
there's no
nobody's even offered evidence that
there was a racial component to it
and they still treat it like it is
that is so anti-social that i can't even
wrap my head around it i mean that that
is guaranteeing
that you have riots
so uh i would i would say that
the the riots i'm going to start calling
them the fake news riots
that might be misleading though the fake
news is is whatever sparks the riot
because the riots are almost all fake
sparked by fake news
cnn msnbc etc and
i don't think they can escape
responsibility for it
and the citizens believe it's because of
police actions
but that opinion was assigned to them
it's not their opinion
all right
i saw i i watched van jones come on to
talk about it on cnn and i like to use
him as my
example in a lot of cases because
there are a lot of people you you can't
quite tell okay
are you just being a liar because you're
you're a partisan
so you're just lying or do you really
believe what you're saying sometimes you
can't tell
and that that determines how you think
about them
but in the case of van jones my personal
opinion is that he's a genuine
and fairly transparent so even when he's
doing something that is
you know nakedly political he actually
will sometimes tell you that
i mean recently he made news by
saying that he would have complained you
know no matter which way something went
because it's political so he's fairly
transparent
about the fact that some of it's
political but i feel like
i feel like his actual emotion about
things is completely genuine
and he came on after the brionna taylor
thing
and you know you can't read people's
minds but his
face displayed
genuine pain genuine pain
you can't act that well like there
you there's nobody who can do that to
their face
to show that much pain unless it's real
all right nobody is that good of an
actor
so van jones i'm trying to figure him
out right
because you want to understand people
who have different opinions if they're
reasonable people
and i i hold him up as my reasonable
person so he's the one i want to
understand
trying to understand you know don lemon
is a waste of time
because he's not really trying to
present an accurate view of the world
but i think van jones for the most part
is
actually wants to live in the real world
with real solutions and stuff
so i want to understand him and i was
i was i was looking at the pain
and i was trying to understand that
because i said to myself
wouldn't he be happy that this was not a
case
of a racial murder by police shouldn't
that be cause
for at least a little bit of relief
that it wasn't what you thought it was
but instead
he was actually in just as much pain
as if it had been a racial murder and
and he said this directly he said would
this have happened
if brianna taylor was white
to which i say why wouldn't it
what what part of it would not have
happened if she had been white
would would they not have gotten the
warrant in the first place
now if that's if that's the um if that's
the uh
if that's the assertion that maybe that
it wouldn't even happen there would have
been no
no event maybe but i don't see any
evidence of that
don't the police pursue crimes no matter
what your races
i thought i thought they were pretty
good at that it's a crime or it's not a
crime
it's not a crime and what's your race
i don't think anybody says that do they
so i think the event would happened
and once the police
encountered gunfire you know
once people were firing at the police
once they they broke down the door
what exactly would the police have done
if a white person
was hidden behind a wall would they have
said hold
hold your fire hold your fire just let
this guy shoot at us
because there might be a white person on
the other side of the wall
or would they have said oh hold on hold
on the person who's shooting at us
at close range that we think might be a
drug dealer but we don't know
he's white it's okay it's okay guys yeah
he's shooting at us ow
ow i got shot in the leg but don't
return the fire
do you see he's a white guy everybody
don't shoot he's a white guy is it
would that happen what what do you have
to do to your brain
to imagine that police don't return fire
to white people or or is the argument
they wouldn't have shot
as many rounds now let me ask you this
given that the guy who had the gun
apparently
never got i don't think he even got a
shot right
correct me if i'm wrong but i don't
think he was even wounded
if the guy who has the gun
is still with a gun and he's still not
subdued because he was alive and he
still had his gun
how many bullets is the right number to
shoot in that direction
now one of the cops apparently did
something reckless
that is its own its own situation but
his his reckless endangerment had to do
with neighbors
apartments not not even what was
happening in that room
so should you stop at say
four bullets if you're the police when
there's an
armed man who just shot at you who's
still alive
still has his gun and he's still in the
room
he's in the room are you going to stop
shooting until you know that guy is the
subdued
is 10 enough i mean i would have shot
about 25
i mean i can't i don't see any way to
understand this situation as a racial
situation
i just don't see anything but
is it true that
the van jones let's say
he i want to use the right word here is
it true that he's processing it
as a genuine racial event i think so
because he looked completely sincere
so what do you do about that what do you
do about the fact
that it's not just liars and advocates
and political people
who are claiming this is a a racial
tragedy
what do you do when people who are
actually sincere
completely well informed smart
all right smart well informed
well-intentioned
has all the information still thinks is
racial
what do you do with that what do you do
with that
i don't know so
but um i think we ought to we got to
think about that
and i think that this it feels to me
like the unstated there there's sort of
an unstated thing here that there's
sort of a revenge element in other words
i feel as if
that you know some segment of the black
population
not all of course but some segment of
the black population
just wants something like revenge
against white people and i i don't think
it's based on a specific thing
rather it's a collection of grievances
that you know if you add them all up
it gets us to this place so
um i think we we need to call it what it
is
which is some kind of revengey kind of
uh
emotion all right um
here's what biden said now remember
biden is uh
he's the adult in the room right so if
there's a right thing to say
something that will calm down you know
people's emotions
you'd expect biden to say it because
that's that's his whole brand
so let's see what he said about it he
said quote in the wake of her tragic
death
we mourn with her mother and family okay
so far so good and um i would say that
trump should have done that too
so i would say if you were to compare
biden statement
to anything trump did or did not do
biden so far
is winning because you know
um giving giving um
giving thought and attention and respect
to the family
is just always a good thing to do right
so
so good good on biden for starting that
way everybody should do that
uh if i didn't do that that was my
mistake as well
because we always think about the
families you know they didn't do
anything
and brianna taylor didn't do anything to
to deserve getting shot but then he goes
on
and goes and we ask ourselves whether
justice could be equally applied in
america
what we ask ourselves whether justice
could be equally applied in america in
other words
even joe biden is not willing to say in
public
that this was a racial event because if
he was willing to say it
well you know he'd say it why would he
not say it
if you know if the entire democratic
field
thinks this was a racial thing of course
he would say it
if he thought it was true but i'm going
to give biden some credit here
and i always think this is useful to do
it it's useful to give credit
to you know an opposition character for
anything they do good
because it makes you seem more credible
that way i think
uh it's good that he you know cared
about the empathy for the family
first and i think uh it's good that he
did not say it was a racial murder
he could have he could have just gone
full
al sharpton right he could have done
that
and i think that would have been really
bad for the country
and he didn't and it might have even
helped him
politically you know it might have
actually been a little bit of an
advantage
so i'm going to give biden credit
because he he wasn't willing to tell a
direct lie
even even one that might have helped him
a little bit
but he did say we have to ask ourselves
whether justice could be equally applied
in america
which implies which implies
that maybe it didn't happen here so
biden is making it racial while
essentially admitting by not calling it
racial then it wasn't
he found a way to make it racial at the
same time
he called it basically not racial
so that was kind of a weasel thing to do
i would say on net this was
disastrously bad for the country so
biden i think this is net negative
because
just what he should have said
if he had only cared about what's good
for america
he would have said tragic death we're
thinking about the family
but let's not uh let's not turn this
into something we have enough real
problems
let's just deal with this as a tragedy
see if we can come together
that would have been useful but no you
didn't decide not to do that
there's confirmation now as i told you
remember i told you that one of the
hoaxes about biden was the hoax that he
was reading his answers from a
teleprompter
the answers to interview questions and i
told you no
that teleprompter was where there was
somebody who was asking a question
you know a citizen asked a question and
something got cut off on the tel on that
on that it wasn't it wasn't his answer
that got cut off it was the question
that got cut off
and sure enough the fact checkers have
confirmed that today
that's exactly what it was so if you did
not
know that was a hoax from the first
moment
adjust your filter because i i knew that
was a
hoax from moment one it was just obvious
so
adjust your filters
here's one um so i said yesterday
that the hunter biden stuff looked like
a whole bunch of smoke but maybe there
wouldn't be
any fire in in the specific sense of
something
illegal now there's a whole
bunch of stuff that looks swampy there's
a whole bunch of stuff that looks really
really bad
really really bad like as bad as
something can look
that's how bad it looks so i think i may
have misled you
yesterday when when i was saying that
you know there was a lot of nothing to
this recent
hunter biden story there were details
but they didn't really change what you
thought of anything and it didn't look
like any of it was
necessarily illegal and was not even
alleged to be illegal
as far as i know but swampy here
let me give you a specific example so
one of the
several allegations is that hunter's
investment company
got 3.5 million dollars from the ex-wife
of moscow's mayor
now any mayor of moscow duh is going to
be an
ally of putin that's that's a given
right
any ex-wife of an ally of putin
probably an ally of putin she is also i
believe the richest
woman in russia probably an ally of
putin
all right so someone who i think we
could agree
it seems beyond doubt
that she would be an ally of putin and
it's reported that she gave hunter biden
3.5 million dollars
but is that exactly what happened or
did she move 3.5 million dollars into
his investment
company in other words it's not hunter
biden's money
it would be money that he would be
investing because he's an investor
now again totally swampy i'm not saying
anything that's good
but would it be illegal
for an investment company to take an
investment
from somebody who has legal money
because i think all her money is legal
right if if she
well hold on if it's an investment it's
money she's putting in
which she would later withdraw i believe
it's being reported
and i'll need some fact checking on this
because i might be a little
i might miss a fact but i believe
that it is reported like he got 3.5
million dollars like she wrote a check
to hunter biden
i don't think that's what happened i
think she invested
3.5 million dollars of which if that's
what happened his investment company
would get
you know the the one or two percent
whatever from that
which would be kind of a small deal
yeah if it had been a payment that's as
swampy as you can get that would
obviously be a red flag
but an investment now let me ask you
this
if any billionaire russian invests
in your investment company
are you guilty of something let's say
you just
you just you're an investment company
you just
take investments you don't care where
they come from they could come from
you know south america they could come
from russia
and some russian billionaire who of
course is allied with
putin because i don't think you can be a
billionaire and not get poisoned
unless you support him so some
billionaire
puts money into your investment fund are
you guilty
are you guilty for a legal
free citizen who wants to invest
in your business and they put money
there
somebody says it was wired to his
account what does
his account mean right if it turned out
that she just gave him 3.5 million
dollars and it's unexplained
well that would be as bad as it could be
right
and do you think that they would allow a
digital record
a wire transfer of that big of a bribe
it seems like bad bad bribery uh method
if you if you were gonna do something
illegal wouldn't you send some bitcoin
let me ask you this uh
if it had been a pure bribe wouldn't
they just send bitcoin
anybody who bribes with a wire transfer
is not good at bribing
in my opinion because you got a digital
record there
all right yeah like donating to the
clinton foundation
so while while nobody is happy with the
situation
that uh you know russians might be
influencing hunter biden etc
uh so let me summarize this by saying
probably the way it's being reported is
completely misleading
that doesn't mean he didn't do terrible
things
okay so can we separate those
after this is done since i know i know
how this works
people are going to come to me
immediately after this periscope and say
scott how can you say hunter did nothing
wrong
and i'll go ah i didn't say that
i didn't say he did nothing wrong i said
i don't know
at least in terms of legally wrong i
don't know
swampy of course yeah what was it
inappropriate in my opinion of course
is it sketchy of course
so don't don't act like i don't know
it's sketchy okay all right
here's something that somebody said this
sounded smart to me
the president is being criticized again
for saying that the
covid the coronavirus will just die out
so he said it in the past i think he's
renewed saying it that at some point
it will just die out now the experts say
you fool it's not just gonna die out
and then somebody said this the spanish
flu died out
right why did the spanish flu die out
it wasn't because of herd hurt immunity
do you know why the spanish flu
died out and the answer is nope
nobody knows so would you bet against
this flu the coronavirus would you bet
against this
just dying out given that the spanish
flu
just sort of died out now i don't know
maybe maybe
we know something about the spanish flu
that makes it different
i don't know
but i wouldn't bet against
trump on saying that it might die out
and we might we might not know why
it might just die out it just won't do
it as fast as we want it to
um there is a jerry nadler video
uh that you'll see on on twitter and
i'm not gonna describe the video i'm
just gonna say that
uh there's something deeply wrong with
his health
and uh as much as i don't like
jerry nadler or what he's done to the
country
uh whatever whatever is happening on
that video with his health
is not funny all right it's not it's
just not funny
so um so i'm
i'm not going to retweet that and i'm
not going to
describe it further it's it's really
disturbing it's very disturbing actually
and i hope he's hope he's getting the
help he needs
um joy reid
asks this question and
it's just a head shaker so this is on
twitter she says
genuine question what will be the
relationship between the majority of
americans
and trumpets after this long national
nightmare ends
and it will eventually end do people
anticipate
simply letting bygones be bygones with
people who joined
the trump personality cult now that is
chilling isn't it because what it sounds
like
is that whenever trump is out of office
that they plan to retaliate in some way
for people who just wanted better judges
and lower taxes
they're actually going to retaliate for
political preference
that is so far over the line
does joy read not know how dangerous it
is to say stuff like this
here's what she should have said if she
wanted to be a positive force
positive force would be you know in the
end we'll always come together because
we're america first
how about that how about let's come
together over our common humanity
how about that that'd be good but when
you put this idea into the public
that maybe we shouldn't let bygones be
bygones because that's really the
suggestion
the suggestion is that anybody who
supported this republican president
has to explain it forever and that it's
a permanent stain on your life
that is the most un-american thing i
i've heard in a long time so
i i think that whoever employs
joy reid has some explaining to do
because this is just clearly a bad
a bad influence on america and when you
put
something this corrosive into the public
and you do it intentionally you're just
not a good person
here's something that surprised me
rasmussen did a poll
on whether people believe that the
forest fires
let's say the california forest fires in
the ones in the west in particular
um they asked ask the public whether
they think
they're caused by climate change or
caused by
other factors which would include human
as well as other natural factors
what do you think the public thinks
about the forest fires
do you think that they mostly think it's
climate change
or mostly bad forest management
maybe bad luck with lightning that sort
of thing
and the answer is this
that 38 of women think climate change
is what's the primary driver of the
fires
and 44 of men think so
so 44 of men but only 38
of women i would say that's a
significant difference right
which means that women uh
are better at science
because in this case women have by a
fairly healthy majority over men
women are less likely to be duped
by the climate change claim
interesting isn't it i and i wonder if
this kind of trend will
will continue to hold over time and i
wouldn't be surprised
because uh isn't it true that there are
more women in college than men now
right i think there are more women who
are lawyers
than men or at least in law school now
not not practicing
so should we see eventually
you know further differences between
women's opinions about factual
scientific stuff
and men's opinions because women will
just be better educated
it looks like that's where it's heading
because the women are
are closer to the truth on this anyway
those details will come out
from rasmussen a little bit later this
morning
all right that is just about what i
wanted to talk about
all right um
just looking at your situation here
giant bicycle freeway through the forest
exactly
yeah i've been calling for this so i'll
re
reiterate in a perfect world
good forest management would put sort of
a thick
crisscross through the forest so if part
of it burns it'll only burn up to the
you know the the fire break and then you
use those paths
for bike paths you could have these
amazing
california bike baths where you're going
through you know forests and mountains
and stuff on your electric and other
bikes
could be the coolest thing california
ever did
would be an entire new tourism thing
would create a lot of jobs because you
got to clear the forest and then you
would have
you know you just have this incredible
super highway of bicycle paths
through natural surroundings it would be
amazing
so all right on a different topic
i've been working on uh sort of mentally
and otherwise
on how to design a perfect small home
that's inexpensive and you think people
have done it
but they haven't because what people
have done is they've created
they've taken an expensive house that's
really awesome
and then they made it tiny and said oh
how about a tiny house it'll be
inexpensive
and it is inexpensive but it's also no
fun to live in
so what i've been trying to design for
years
you know on paper and mentally in every
other way is something that's
small and inexpensive more inexpensive
than small
but that would be better than an
expensive home and there's no reason you
can't have that
if you design it right so here's my idea
so far
the the foundation would be
pylons that would be adjustable so that
i think the cheapest kind of
uh foundation that you could do would be
four pylons
that maybe have a lever that you can
adjust them so that you get them the
right height
um and then i'm imagining that you have
uh uh ways to connect
little units so let's say every room
is pre-designed so that there is no
nailing and no
sawing and every part of the house can
fit into the back of a pickup truck
not at the same time but if you were
building if you were building your own
house
you go get a pickup truck full unload it
with maybe two people
and just clip it together until you have
a home
so if it doesn't clip together with no
sewing cutting
or nailing and you can't do with two
people
and you can't fit it in the back of a
pack a pickup truck
it's not quite there yet but the other
thing you would do is have each room
sort of sort of designed as a perfect
room so you don't have to guess what is
a good room
you just get the the package but each
room would have
uh two doors so
uh so if you only could afford one of
them
you'd have a front door and a back door
but if you were gonna buy
more than one unit either at the same
time or later
the back door would just be the entrance
to the next room
which would then have another back door
so you want
modules that you can buy as many of them
as you want they
they fit together people can assemble
them on their own
they're one story so that you don't have
as much risk of multiple stories
and there you go
all right and lots of natural light
right
if you get the natural light right and
you get the
the acoustics right you have a
very livable place so it seems to me and
by the way somebody can help me with
this
the the primary thing that you would
need to develop
to make these awesome homes that are
also small
is glass walls the the kind that open
and close
inexpensively if you could get custom
not custom but standardized
glass walls that are also the kind that
can open up like
like a hawaii lanai and and make them in
quantity so that they're all the same
and they're really cheap
you could have the most awesome little
homes with like say one total glass wall
looking out onto something attractive
all right yeah the trouble with having
something like an airstream or uh
or a trailer is that you don't have a
light
so you need more of a at least one wall
of light with a with a curtain over it
all right so there you go now the
the people who say no thanks you're not
really
understanding what i'm talking about so
anyone of you who says
i wouldn't live in that house you're
really missing the point
it's not for you it's not for you
we're not trying to build the super
inexpensive home for all
of you it's for the people who who
couldn't
find a better option you know
i could have a double wall in the middle
of the house well there are a million
design considerations that would be
one of them i guess
aerated concrete here's what i wouldn't
want to do
i wouldn't want to do anything you
couldn't pull apart with your bare hands
in other words i'd want a house that you
don't have to chip anything away or
scrape anything away
or even paint so if you're painting
scraping
you know chiseling to redo anything
later then you did it wrong
it should be just unassemble and
reassemble
all right um calling elon musk yeah
it does seem like it would be a a
high-tech thing not a not a build
i i believe the building industry will
never be able to do this
i think it's going to have to come from
a tech company
um somebody's talking about the boxable
houses uh
i think that's the name of them so
you've seen some that fold up
they somehow make the house fold up it's
a very small house
they can put it on the back of a tractor
trailer and they can deliver it
this is exactly not what i'm talking
about
so when you talk about those little you
know factory made
full unfolding houses could not be
further
from what i'm talking about so and
unfortunately
everybody's mind goes to those little
homes they are so
poorly designed it's not even in the
universe of what i'm talking about
if it isn't a cool great design
it's no good let me give you an example
uh i was in a two-bedroom condo in
hawaii so space-wise it was very small
it was just like a little vacation thing
and but because the entire front wall
was a nice view and that and it opened
up to to ill
and i it didn't seem like a small space
and in fact you we paid a great deal of
money
for this small space because the simple
the simple addition of a wall with a
good view
changes entirely the experience from
a thing you would never want to be in to
a vacation home it was literally a
vacation destination
just because of the glass wall that's
the only thing about it that was special
everything else was completely ordinary
and you know fairly pedestrian
uh pickup tries pickup truck sized would
suck
you are not understanding the pickup
truck concept
the the pickup truck doesn't mean you
put the whole house in the pickup truck
it means that you go to the you go to
the let's say lumber yard or whatever
and you get the components the pieces
then you drive there and you take each
piece and you put it together
so each piece might be something one
person could hold in their hands
yeah anything foldable is a problem i
wouldn't do anything foldable
uh interchangeable parts yeah and the
other thing the other thing you'd want
is that all of your interior and
exterior walls
it could be changed easily with facades
so imagine if you will
you had brick facades so they're thin
but from the outside it looks like a
brick and they just clip
to the front of your home or to the
inside walls and then if you say i'm
tired of a brick wall
you just take them off and replace them
with
some other kind of design
yeah every everyone wants to pretend
your ideas have already
been done you know i've i've
that's one of the things i always deal
with people will always say
that's being done and then they'll
describe something that's not even close
in fact they'll describe the thing i
said i want to not do this
i want to not do x so whatever i'm doing
don't do x that's the thing i don't want
to do
and then somebody will say
people are already doing x and they'll
say no
now i know people are already doing x
that's not what i want
i want to do something that's not x
but scott um there's already x
no no
you know what i mean all right
that's all for now if anybody if anybody
has a source
for a cheap window maker and i think
maybe a 3d printer might be the solution
let me know that's all for now
