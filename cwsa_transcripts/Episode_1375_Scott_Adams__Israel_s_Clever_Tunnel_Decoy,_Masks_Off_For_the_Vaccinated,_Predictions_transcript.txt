hey everybody
come on in come on in it's time yeah
it's time for coffee with scott adams
best part of your day
and today will be even better than usual
and
i know that's a pretty high bar but
watch me clear it
no problem and all you need to join me
clearing that bar and having the best
day you've ever had thanks to the
simultaneous zip all you need is a
copper marker glass a tanker chelsea
style canteen jug flask vessel any guy
and fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine of
the day the
thing that makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous sip
i think you've heard of it and it's
going to happen now
go
i think i added a little extra slurping
to that one just to get a little
little extra kick yeah well
how do you all feel today better right
yes for the fully vaccinated
you get to take off your masks
some places no when i say that your
fully
vaccinated people can take off their
masks
i don't mean in my state no no no
california isn't like other places
so just because the cdc finally said
it's safe to take off your mask
if you're fully vaccinated except in
specific cases
well that did not change the policy in
new york or
california in which the governors both
said
wait a minute can't take your masks off
yet
how does that make you feel if you're in
new york or california
i'll tell you how it makes me feel
i'm not going to listen to this anymore
now of course you have to listen to
businesses
or if you want to get on a plane and
they've got a rule you have to listen to
that
but i i just can't listen to the
governors on this
i just don't respect their authority and
would not
would not plan to obey it at all
so i'm a few days away from my second
vaccination
uh another week or so and
uh can somebody give me a fact check on
this
is a person considered fully vaccinated
at the moment they get their second shot
or is it another two weeks after the
shot can somebody give me a
ruling on that and is it the same for
all three types of vaccinations
well one of them has just one um
somebody says two weeks so what i'm
wondering is is the two weeks
uh also applicable to this
the two dose
so i'm seeing maybe a little different
messages here let's figure that out
before the end of today
seems pretty important doesn't it so i'm
seeing two weeks after
but i think there might be a difference
between
what the scientific uh peak is
and what the social legal
guideline peak is in other words maybe
you can still fly
if you just got your second vaccination
but maybe technically you're not fully
vaccinated
is it going to be something like that so
we need some clarity on that that's
pretty
important point and i'm not surprised
given how important it is i'm surprised
it's not a prominent part of the news
and it should be all right um so here's
the good news
uh a lot of people blaming the cdc for
being slow
to to do this but um i'm gonna i'm gonna
go against the grain a little bit
and say that the cdc does have
an obligation to be a little safer than
you and i might choose for ourselves
i don't feel like i can blame the cdc
for waiting for i guess they waited to
find out if the variants would be
handled by the vaccinations and
apparently they are at least so far
and i think there was some more
information they got about
vaccinations and transmission so they
did wait until they had
all the information
i'm not sure you would want that to be
different even if you and i would have
made different decisions
because you and i would just be deciding
for ourselves right
but if it's your job to make the
recommendation
i don't know that i care that they wait
a few extra weeks
you know i feel like that's responsible
so i'm
i of course am a critic of the cdc for
the things they get wrong but
i just can't i can't fault them for
being a little extra cautious
compared to what individuals would do
that's kind of where you want it
i don't think you'd want it the other
way i don't think you'd want the cdc to
take
more chances than an individual would
with their own life
i don't think you'd want that so we have
plenty to complain about with the cdc
but i'm not going to complain about this
one
i am going to complain about my governor
i don't quite understand why my governor
thinks
thinks the vaccinated people still need
a mask
as i said before the public will lead on
this
apparently we'll have to and i think
that when i'm fully vaccinated
i would certainly obey what any business
wanted me to do
because businesses can set their own
rules right private business
says you got to do this or you got to do
that you got to wear you know
a private business can tell you to wear
shirts a shirt and shoes
so i don't have any any problem with any
private business
but sure as hell the moment i'm fully
vaccinated
i'm not going to obey my governor who
tells me i've got to keep my
mask on if i what walk down the sidewalk
or something
there's no way i'm going to obey the
governor if he's if he opposes the cdc
recommendation
that would be dumb now i get that each
state is different
but not different enough yeah we're all
different
we're not that different so
there there has to be a point where the
public leads
because the government is not a good
entity to do it
the government's uh i would say the
government's incentive is
maximum safety whereas a human being's
incentive is maximum
life which might mean a little less
safety
cleverly chosen so
i don't think that we should depend on
our government or really even
force them to make the decision for us i
think we just make the decision now
is everybody with me that
that at this point now that the
crisis part is well not quite over
we're sort of on the border of the
crisis part being over
you want your government to be in charge
when it's a crisis right
you know they're not perfect but your
best bet
in an emergency is to listen to the
government
once the emergency is over and we all
have
kind of similar information their
incentives and yours might not be
aligned
and yours matter more right
once we're out of the crisis if your
individual citizen opinion differs from
your government
i back you this ism because your
government
is the wrong entity to judge whether
your
safety versus your life decisions are
right
once it's not a crisis if you're in a
crisis yes
let the government lead but now it's
time for the government to get out of
the way
uh or it's you know that we're on the
border of that point where the citizens
just have to take it upon themselves i
think i think we just have to make it a
fact
by the way we act so it wouldn't matter
if you had mask
mandates if if nobody put on a mask
it's not like they could enforce it if
everybody just threw off
threw away their mask all at once that
would be it
so don't imagine that the government has
control over this
you the citizens have complete control
from about this point on you did not
have complete control in the past
but from now on you do have control
i mean it's returning to you and those
people who this is another time to check
your predictions
were you one of the people who thought
that the government was going to make
you wear masks forever no matter what
did you ever think that because if you
did
i don't think that was a good prediction
and i i feel like a lot of people were
saying it
and i kept thinking to myself no i'm
pretty sure this is temporary
you know you still hear people saying uh
saying that
we'll have to wear a mask forever or
under certain situations forever
i don't think so so i think uh this is
going just the way we wanted it to
um now of course you'll still need masks
for travel
for a while um
and i guess there was a situation in
which a number of the
yankees baseball team got
got infected despite all being
vaccinated
so a number of the people who played for
the yankees
had the j and j one shot vaccination
but have since become infected
now there's no evidence that i think
most of them had no symptoms one might
have a little bit
so they're all they all seem perfectly
safe which is the whole point of the
vaccination
so the vaccination is working that's the
good news
but it is clear now you know all all
doubt has been removed
that apparently you can catch the virus
fairly
easily even if you have
the vaccination but
don't you want to know if that applies
to all the vaccinations
because the yankees all have the j and j
the one shot vaccination
which we know to be a little less less
powerful but powerful enough to keep you
from dying
so if the yankees had had the moderna or
the pfizer
would they have been just as infected
after getting vaccinated
don't know but every time we hear about
one of these people getting
getting infected after vaccinations such
as bill maher apparently bill maher
and and by the way is it possible to go
through
a friday without bill maher being in the
headlines
when was the last friday there was not a
headline about bill maher
what's going on with that i feel like
it's telling us something right
because there are a lot of political
pundits but why is bill maher
always in the news on friday i mean his
show comes on friday so
that's the the trigger for it but is he
is he so
newsworthy that every friday he's going
to be
like a political statement and here's
the answer
yes yes he is he is exactly that
newsworthy
because and the reason he's newsworthy
is that he's simply not easily
identifiable with
fully you know fully hypnotized on the
left
or fully hypnotized on the right he's
carved out a
unique position where he can follow the
science or the logic
you know as best he can now of course
i've disagreed with
bill maher on a number of topics over
the years so i'm not saying he always
gets it right
according to me you know as if as if my
judgment
is the final word on things but
i do think he's carved out a special
place
in america as a person who intends to
tell the truth
and has some capability to do it because
he does seem a little bit
resistant to cognitive dissonance not
completely
because none of us are completely free
from confirmation bias or cognitive
dissonance
it's not a thing a person can do you you
can't be free of that
but he is freer than most and i think
part of the reason you can be free is if
you have a little bit of history of
taking positions on each side
that your your cognitive dissonance
isn't going to be triggered by
being locked into an opinion you're
unwilling to change
so of uh
predictions i thought this would be a
good time
now that we've got a few months of biden
so that we we've got a sense of biden at
this point wouldn't you say
i don't know if what biden has done so
far
will be perfectly predictive of what he
does for the rest of his
presidency however long that lasts
but we've got a good sense of it now and
i would say this would be a good time to
go back and check
your trump-related predictions for how
he would do in office
then what would happen after he left
office
and then how biden would do in office
how are your predictions without even
talking about any details yet in the
comments
how many of you feel that your
predictions
were relatively accurate you know nobody
is going to get every topic
but do you think that what you thought
trump would do
he largely did and do you think that the
way
biden is performing is largely what you
expected
let's see your predictions my
uh my prediction about your predictions
is that cognitive dissonance
will cause everybody to believe they
were accurate
so so as you're all telling me how
accurate you
were oh actually somebody said 50 50.
so whoever just said 50 50
you might be the most aware person who's
answering this question
and not because your your predictions
were only 50 50.
but because you know that how many
people here were right half of the time
and are also aware of it
very rare so whoever said they were
right only about
50 of the time you're operating probably
at a higher level of awareness
than a lot of the rest of the public
because most of us
and i'm definitely in this category most
of us think we got it about 90
right and we even had different
predictions
i'll bet if you asked the uh the biggest
trump
hater were your predictions correct they
would say oh yeah
totally my predictions were correct he
he colluded with russia which didn't
happen
he said that nazis and charlotteville
were fine people
which literally didn't happen it was a
hoax
he told us to drink bleach which didn't
happen
so you see where i'm going right both
the left and the right
think their predictions are accurate
because the the fake news will tell
everybody they got it right
and then your memory will fill in all
this you know
will give you cognitive dissonance and
rewrite your memories
so but let me ask you this specifically
how many democrats believed that once
trump was out of office
there was one thing you knew for sure he
was in deep deep
legal trouble right was there anybody on
the left
anybody was there even one person
who was anti-trump literally even one
person
who believed that he would still be a
free man a few months after leaving
office
and indeed we heard today that
there was some move to get a hold of
let's say apparently i'm not good at
making notes because i didn't write that
one down but in the
trump world there's uh apparently
one of the employees of the trump
organization
they're looking into some payments about
a school or something
and i'm thinking to myself if we're
hearing a leak
about somebody who works in the trump
organization not trump himself and not a
family member
just somebody high in the organization
who's being investigated for some
specific things that they did
and maybe not even trump himself
but you've heard of it right but what
you haven't heard
is anything that sounds like a smoking
gun that would put trump in jail or
even in great legal peril have you
that doesn't seem to me that that it
wasn't long ago
that all the smart people on the left
were saying well there's this
banking thing and surely they will find
in his taxes
right how long do you have to wait
before before you know you can say
there's no legal
um you know at least no no fatal risk
for trump legally
i feel as if all of his legal problems
were either fake or there were things
that could be handled in the normal
course of a rich person defending
themselves against
legal claims
and don't you believe that you would
have heard a
credible leak by now if they had found
some kind of like really good stuff to
get trump in trouble
but you haven't have you now how long do
you wait
before you can conclude that mean
something
i don't know and in the legal world
maybe you have to wait a year
right but how long has the district of
uh
is it the southern district of new york
how long has the
state of new york been looking into
trump
a year give me an estimate it's been a
year right or more than a year
and not a single leak no arrest
and the and then when one leak does come
out
it's a leak about somebody else it's as
if they found
somebody else's problem but they didn't
find trump's although i think trump is
part of that story but
it's not clear how so there's something
somebody says at least two years
that they've been investigating did you
if you predicted he would be in jail by
now i guess you were wrong
and if you predicted he would be in deep
legal trouble
i don't know i feel as if we'd know
right if they were closing in on them
and
you know how the cnn always reports that
the walls are closing in
if any of that were happening they'd be
reporting it right
because they love that stuff they'd be
making it up even if
it were not happening all right
uh oh i did make a note of it uh so the
prosecutors the wall street journal said
the prosecutors subpoenaed a manhattan
private school for information relating
to
trump organization chief financial
officer
and his two grandchildren does that
sound like trump himself is in trouble
it really doesn't does it sounds like
they just found some unrelated thing
all right here's the big other story uh
israel
of course is responding to hamas's more
than a thousand
rockets fired out of gaza into israel
and i don't know if you saw this news
but
reportedly and i don't think you can
believe
any news that comes out of a war zone
but let's say it's true
for conversation as long as you accept
the premise
that all reporting during the beginning
of a
you know a military action the odds of
any of this reporting being accurate
kind of low but let's say it is
reportedly the israeli defense forces
tricked hamas
into believing there was going to be a
ground invasion
now apparently in the event of a ground
invasion
israel was aware that the hamas
militants would flood into this major
network of tunnels that they have
and that they would be able to come out
of the tunnels to attack you know any
tanks that were coming
on a ground invasion and so israel
faked hamas into filling the tunnels
with their fighters
and then they bombed the tunnels and
they didn't invade
so the invasion was a head fake
one of the better head fakes i've ever
heard of
in in the military world if it's true
again
i would i would assign a credibility to
this whole set of stories
about israel in the tunnels 50
maybe maximum 60
tops just because it's a war zone and
you don't get accurate information
but let's say it's true now here's the
uh morbid but
interesting facts about this number one
when you bomb a network of tunnels do
they all collapse
and then kill the people in them
instantly
i don't think so right isn't it more
likely that maybe
uh fighters would be trapped in a tunnel
that had been partially collapsed you
know maybe they couldn't get out
but they're not immediately dead
probably right
how many of those people who would be
presumably trapped in a
in a collapsed tunnel but still alive
how many of them had their cell phones
with them
and if they had their cell phones with
them they'd be using them
right as in hey get me out of here start
digging
at that point can israel just put some
surveillance
above where they think the tunnels are
and just watch where the digging is
or better yet can they just detect
exactly where the phone is
and bomb it again because i would you
know
it's um yeah they would suffocate
eventually
but they would still have time to use
their cell phones if they were alive and
if they had them
so it's possible that they don't bring
cell phones to war
right but i think even our soldiers
bring cell phones don't they
i don't know the answer that maybe they
don't maybe they don't
but you know obviously they use them off
duty
um now here's the other interesting
thing whenever there's somebody gets
killed
on the hamas side there's a big burial
and everything
but this is a real morbid thought if you
kill people in tunnels
if you kill people in tunnels there's no
body
israel found a way to kill mass
numbers of hamas terrorists
without ever anybody filming a body
i'm guessing right so
in terms of persuasion israel used
persuasion to get them into the tunnels
to bomb them and they get the second
benefit of persuasion that there are no
photographs of dead bodies
and if they ever showed their dead
bodies they wouldn't they would
necessarily probably look like
uh just somebody asleep because they
their all their body parts would be
intact
if they died in a tunnel so
this might end up you know i think we'll
learn more about this but this could
easily end up as one of the great
military
moves of all time
as morbid as it is
so rasmussen is reporting again
another situation in which watching cnn
and msnbc makes you dumber
now to be fair if they had asked about
other topics
such as let's say support for q anon
probably more republicans would have
support for q anon
than for democrats so you have to you
know just be aware that the questions
that are being asked
skew in one direction at some point
we'll probably see
some questions in the other direction
but here's the outcome
apparently nearly a quarter of cnn
viewers
um and 19 of msnbc viewers
think cops shot more than 500 unarmed
black
suspects last year but only nine percent
of fox news viewers think so
it's a pretty big difference so if you
watch the cnn or msnbc
you would have a something like a
ten times uh inaccurate
view of what's happening with police and
black
unarmed americans ten times
you wouldn't even be close but fox
viewers
pretty accurate um
think of that a quarter of cnn viewers
think that
cops are shooting 500 unarmed black
suspects a year
the number is closer to 50. so one tenth
of that
um
let's say and i was wondering
does the mental health industry
recognize journalistic abuse
as a sort of a victim category
you know a mental health problem imagine
you
imagine you're a viewer of cnn or msnbc
versus being a viewer of let's say fox
news
if you were to believe the opinion
people on fox news
that maybe george soros is you know
gonna have control of everything and
um it's all a big uh it's all a big plot
or something
you might be a little worried but you
probably wouldn't spend much of your day
worrying about it
like it wouldn't intrude on the rest of
your day you'd probably just be thinking
about it when you're talking politics
but if you watched cnn and msnbc
you would believe that you could be dead
any minute you would think that the
climate is going to kill you or your
grandchildren
you would think that if you take a ride
in your car
and your skin is brown your odds are
getting shot is pretty
pretty high so and of course you would
have thought that trump was going to
start a nuclear war
uh you would have thought he was going
to round up gay people and put him in
concentration camps i mean nothing even
close
to reality but you would have thought
that
and those are the kind of fears that you
actually fear day to day
you know i the world is surrounded by
white supremacists i think i see one
those are things you worry about in the
moment
i feel as if there's a difference in
what the and what conservatives worry
about
that isn't true so if we just take the q
a on example
or george soros but you don't like that
example probably
there are things that the right believes
that are clearly not true
but they also are things that don't kill
you immediately
they're sort of like conceptual system
shifts over time
and but whereas the left is worried
about stuff that'll kill you right now
or
or if not now it's going to get your
grandchildren but sort of specific
and dangerous that's got to be a mental
health problem there's no way around
that
there's news out of the arizona audit
that i don't yet believe
but the the report is that some major
database was
deleted before the audit people could
get their hands on it
now if that happened and if it was
intentional
probably means something but do you
think anybody would ever go to jail
for deleting a database
that shouldn't have been deleted
probably not
because the defense would be easy the
defense would be
oops right it's like oops
i forgot that this was one of the
machines that we were supposed to keep
the data on it
or oops i told bob to
take care of the machines but what i
meant was to keep them safe
when when he heard take care of the
machines he thought he would do the
normal maintenance
which included wiping the database so
nobody's going to go to jail right
there's no crime here
why wouldn't they delete it
right yeah if there if anything was on
there that might have looked suspicious
why wouldn't you delete it there's just
not going to be a penalty for it i can't
imagine
there would be enough evidence to put
somebody in jail for it i think they'll
just say oh
big mistake sorry oops
you know bureaucracy things things
aren't that clear
and then we have uh apparently the
auditors are also asking dominion for
their passwords to some machines
and dominion is saying no it says that's
you know too far
and they couldn't give them passwords to
machines to which i say to myself
there's something about this story i
don't understand
do all the machines have the same
password
somebody says you are so dead wrong
about dominion
i haven't talked about dominion yet
what do you think i'm wrong about come
back here
come back here all right el green says
you are so
dead wrong about dominion do you know
how often
people who tell me i'm wrong can
accurately describe my opinion
almost never almost never so el green
i will challenge you to describe my
opinion
in you know just a statement like you
believe x
and then tell me what's wrong with it
okay but start with
accurately describing my opinion you
can't do it
you know you can't do it right try
just give it a shot just in the sentence
or two
what do you think my opinion was that
you're disagreeing with
yeah i can't watch every opinion go by
but if anybody sees it
you will know that this is the normal
way people debate
they literally hallucinate my opinion
and then they get pretty worked up about
how wrong it is
when was the last time somebody
disagreed with me
who also understood what i was saying
not a lot i'm not a lot i'm sure it
happens
but it's very rare i would say at least
90 percent of all the people agreeing
with disagreeing with me
can't state my opinion because i tend to
have some nuance
that escapes you know most political
punditry and here's
james bond says scott's opinion is a
moving target now that's the other
hallucination
because um the way cognitive dissonance
works
and if you haven't seen it in in action
it goes like this
um i say the
the sky is blue and then you say
how can you say the sky is green
and then i say no i didn't say that i
said the
the sky is blue which you agree with
and then because cognitive dissonance
kicks in
and nobody can believe that they heard
green when i said blue
no but nobody can process that because
that would be their mistake they
immediately imagine
it was a different conversation oh
well yes maybe you did say the sky was
blue
but why are you saying it's raining to
which i say
rain was never even in the conversation
i just said the sky was blue
you heard it as green when i proved to
you it's blue and then i said blue let's
say i have a recording or something
you immediately hallucinated that i had
said it was raining
now does that example sound
like um you know not the specific sky
example
but you put different content in there
does that sound like something that
really happens
like in the actual world will somebody's
memory be rewritten
that quickly yes
yes and easily easily
routinely and continuously
right that situation is is more like the
operating system of humans
we do that instantly all of us
every one of us all the time
we don't know what other people said
because once we've disagreed with them
we either stay in our illusion or they
prove us wrong
and we just spontaneously create a new
illusion where we were right all along
that's how we're wired so
once you realize that the world is a lot
less confusing
so this question of whether
fauci supported gain of function
research at wuhan
and i tell you this is such a
frustrating story
because the way it's reported is so poor
that we consumers really don't know what
that's about
you kind of think you do but you don't
here's what i think is happening i feel
as though there is some evidence
that fauci or the nih or you know he may
have supported them
they did reportedly and again i'm not
the expert here so
put a put a little doubt about anything
i say on this topic
but reportedly uh there was some support
for a gain of function
but not for the coronavirus i mean not
for this you know covid
or whatever it is not for this specific
virus
um and it might not have been a gain of
function
for uh military use it might have been
gain a function just to improve it for
you know regular purposes or research or
something
so i feel as though uh the people saying
that fauci
did support gain of function are
probably
correct at the same time when he says
absolutely not he's probably correct
i believe we've hit this weird situation
where both sides are saying completely
true things
but they're not really on the same topic
and that's
i think that's the illusion i think the
illusion is they're on the same topic
and they're not really on the same topic
um so check that out for me to give me a
fact check on that i think that
uh that there was gain of function
for a different different virus so when
fauci denies it he's denying it for the
coronavirus
this version of it i think
which doesn't mean there's anything
wrong with fouchy so my hypothesis
would clear fouchy
while also making rand paul's accusation
true
it just they weren't on the same topic i
think that's my that's my working
hypothesis at the moment
uh and i see see some excellent comments
for example
wrong wrong
now you might be new to me but when
people's comment
is just wrong without any
any explanation or even detail of which
one is wrong
um i usually block you but i feel it's
fair to give you
give you a warning this time because i
don't mention it a lot
um somebody says no it's about funding
releasing the virus was perfectly timed
somebody says was it
i've heard some people say that the cdc
allowing the vaccinated to take off
their masks in most situations
was maybe a a white house trick
to you know to divert from some of the
other things they're saying
ashley you're correct
um
i'm a benevolent host
i suppose that means something
all right um
oh yes oh yes somebody says is curious
how the hong kong
uh protests were squashed by the virus
yes that is interesting isn't it um
was that china getting lucky
you know i'm not on the side that says
that china
intentionally released a virus it's
uh it's certainly interesting to look at
and you can make an argument that it
helped china in some way
and hurt other people so maybe it would
have made sense
but i just don't see anybody releasing a
virus on their own country
to take out in america i mean
maybe maybe
um
do you believe in luck well two people
ask me about luck
here's my take on luck is generally
believe that you can't change your luck
that luck is just luck there's nothing
you can do about it
but that of course is completely wrong
because you can go where your odds are
better
for example you have more chance of
getting a job
if you apply for one right
so you can't compare the luck of
somebody who didn't apply for any jobs
to somebody who applied for a bunch of
jobs hey the person who applied for jobs
got jobs
a person who didn't got no job so most
of the time
what looks like luck is just people who
have not taken the
the high probability path versus people
who took a low probability path and got
exactly what you'd expect
if you're building your skill stack and
you're networking and you're staying in
a jail and you're staying off of drugs
your odds of luck finding you
are really really good so i've told you
before that
one way to hack luck
is to do a lot of stuff just create a
lot of energy
because if you're doing a lot of stuff
and you're making noise and you're
creating energy you're drawing resources
to you
your odds of something lucky happening
in a in a situation where just there's
lots of energy
is very good your odds of getting lucky
sitting alone in a cabin in the middle
of a field in
montana very low
there's no energy there there's there's
no probability swirling around you
nothing there's no possibility so
although you can't directly control luck
as in controlling a coin flip you can
definitely go where there's plenty of it
and you can stay away from where there
isn't much let me give you a concrete
example uh and you some of you've heard
the example
but i'll put it in this context when
i was working on some startup stuff and
getting into the crypto world
i said to myself gosh i don't have any
immediate
need or purpose to know about crypto
nor do i need to necessarily be involved
in it
but i knew it was a high energy area
that was growing and there was there's
been lots of stuff happening
and the opportunity for luck was high
because there was so much energy so if
you just go where there's a lot of
energy
luck can sort of just find you because
it's swirling around all over the place
so i went quite consciously i went where
there
was all this energy in crypto and
some of you heard the story that um i
did a bunch of things
then i walked away from it and i had
forgotten that i'd left a small amount
of crypto in one of my
crypto wallets didn't even know it was
there
turned out to be ethereum and ethereum
went on a run
last i checked it i think it probably
started around five thousand dollars or
something
uh last i checked it was 349 000
complete luck i i never made a decision
to invest in fact i had bought the
ethereum
for transactions i was going to spend it
and
i just got diverted and forgot i had it
there so
this is a perfect example
of going where the energy is
flailing around and then getting lucky
and the number of times that that
the same person will get lucky it
happens a lot
because that one person is simply
following the energy
and going wherever there's a lot of it
and they'll get
lucky again and again and again but if
you're not doing anything
if you're not creating any energy any
activity
no luck's not going to find you so find
a high energy place and flail around
long enough
for luck to find you it's worked all of
my life
whenever i go to a high energy place
luck eventually
figures out where i am
um any chance of you writing another
novel
uh interesting so
the thing that's closest to a novel that
i wrote was called the religion war
which predicted 20 years ago when i
wrote it it predicted that
there would be armed drones
attacking cities and stuff and i think
we'll see that
but i don't think uh i don't have a
immediate
craving to write a novel fiction i just
don't like fiction as much
the ones i wrote were because they were
predictions
so they weren't just fiction they were
predictions wrapped up in fiction
um yeah i did make i mean so far
i did make something like 350 000 out of
5 000
um do i have any suggestions for who to
follow on twitter with more liberal
left-leaning views
um let me think yes um
fareed zakaria on cnn um
smurkanish on cnn
um i'll thank you some more you know
it's always hard to come up with
examples when somebody hits you up like
that
but um consistently uh jimmy dore
jimmy door would be a good one thank you
suggestion
um anybody else have some suggestions
uh the the weinstein weinsteins would
they do they identify
as liberal i actually don't even know
how they identify
uh yeah glenn glenn greenwald uh matt
taibi
uh those would be the best is is
tim of tim cast does he identify as
liberal
i don't know tim poole uh
i don't know i i feel as if he i
wouldn't want to
uh label him in any way he doesn't label
himself
somebody says liz cheney i get it
um anyway that's your starter set and
that'll get you going
um that's all i got for today and i will
talk to you
tomorrow
