so the the two sides it looks like the
two sides have been formed
on one side we have the people who want
to vote but can't get id
there are quite a few of them so this is
a pretty big force
then there are the people on the left
who want to be uniters and not dividers
so they're they're part of the imaginary
army
and then uh very importantly the army of
the dead
voters dead voters
so at the army of the dead voters the
people who want to vote but can't get id
and the people on the left who want to
unite
that's one side of the imaginary
war but on the other side they've got
some stiff competition
it's going to be a tough war because
here you have the magnafascists
those are the people who believe in the
constitution
but yet somehow are also fascists
i don't know
some would say that that can't exist
it's an imaginary category
because how could you be
a mega lover of a constitution
and a fascist
doesn't make sense in your mind
but
for the imaginary civil war it's good
enough
so you've got those then you've got the
people on january 6 who who believe that
they would actually take over the
country
without using weapons
so you got those
but
if i were going to handicap this war and
figure out who's going to win
it looks like the imaginary people on
the right have an advantage because they
also have the nuclear plans
that they captured from the mar-a-lago
boxes
so if you've got imaginary nuclear plans
and the imaginary insurrections have
that and they bind together with the
non-existent mag of fascists you have an
amazing fighting force
that i think
i think will be even stronger
than the people who want to vote but
can't get id the uniters on the left and
the army of the dead
voters
and obscene
