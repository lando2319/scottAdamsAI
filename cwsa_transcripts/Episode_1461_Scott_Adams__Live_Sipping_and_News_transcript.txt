to excuse me will i put my audio
devices on my shirt so that we're ready
to go here
well i'm a little beyond the time so i
didn't have time to tweet this show so
we might be a little
lightly attended today but
will that make it any less awesome no
no it won't because all it takes to make
a
good day great is the simultaneous zip
and all you need for that is a copper
marker glass of tango chelsea's diamond
canteen geoplastic vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dope meat here today the thing that
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip and watch it go
now
oh everything's going up now and i'm not
just talking about
ethereum either which is also going up
but let's talk about the news of the day
which i have sent to my other electronic
device
so that i would have me here for you
now how's how's the audio oh i don't
care so i've got a different audio
device going on here i got rid of the
splitter
and i'm just using two microphones we'll
see if that works
so here's your uh fake news of the day
i need to get these little audio stings
so they're going to have
recurring uh segments they have they
have a little lead in
like uh fake news of the day
all right here's uh these are mostly
tweets but they're fake news tweets
uh here's one that says from shannon
shannon watts tweeted today
the representative marjorie taylor green
suggests
gun owners kill people encouraging
vaccinations
now is it true that representative
greene
suggested that gun owners kill people
who are encouraging vaccinations do you
think that happened
well here's what she said this is what
representative greene said quote in the
south we all love our second amendment
rights
and we're not really big on strangers
showing up at our door are we
they might not like the welcome they get
does that sound exactly like suggesting
that they shoe people not liking the
welcome they get and
the fact that people are heavily armed
in this country
that's more like a statement of fact
isn't it
isn't that just a statement of fact we
have a lot of guns
people don't like it when people knock
on the door and tell them what to do and
people not
might not like the welcome they get i
don't think that sounds like
suggesting that god in order to shoot
people who want vaccinations
or are trying to encourage vaccinations
all right next story how would you like
to be
the recipient of the worst timing
of all time this should be another
recurring segment
called worst timing of all
time just imagine an announcer saying
that
well there's this recall vote coming up
for a governor of california
let me tell you the context in which my
governor
is going to be running for recall
election okay
number one they just required masks back
in public places
very unpopular very unpopular
so i can't go to my gym now because i'd
have to wear a bask in the gym
and i'm not going to do that so i just
can't go to the gym
under those conditions but i could
always go outside and exercise right
so maybe my governor has ruined my my
gym
but there's always outdoors
not really you can't go outdoors in
california
right now because as of this week the
air quality is unhealthy
because of the wildfires which the
governor has
yet again failed to control so i can't
go to the gym
and i can't go outdoors so
that's not so good at the same time my
electricity
is not even dependable i live in the
united states of america
in one of the biggest populated
technologically
advanced states of all time
and i can't be sure that i will have
either electricity or
water i don't have water or
electricity security in california
that's a real thing in a high-end
neighborhood i can't be sure i'll have
water or electricity and i can't go
outdoors
now is that
not the worst timing of all time
this this poor bastard's going to run
for governor
at a time when every californian is
is just
fed up i mean i don't even know how many
of these problems are actually his fault
you know it's always hard to to know is
it really the leadership's fault or is
there just some stuff that's going to
happen
but i'll tell you if if this doesn't
cause
larry elder to become governor
what the hell can
can you think of anything that would get
somebody else elected
i mean if this doesn't do it seriously
if this doesn't do it
can it get us a new governor what the
hell could
is there anything that could because how
could it possibly
be a worse situation than this it's just
mind-boggling that the timing is so
so bad so what's going to happen
if larry elder loses in a close election
let's say the recall is successful so
that then it goes to the
you know to the who won um
who's going to believe it because
apparently california just instituted
mail-in voting because of guess why
that's right the pandemic that's right
so do you think anybody's going to trust
the vote in california well do you think
any republican
in california will trust the outcome
if larry elder doesn't win under these
conditions
i don't know how you could now i'm not
saying that there will be any fraud
because once again there will be no
evidence of fraud that has been
determined by any court
now you can sort of predict that but
who's going to trust it
it's just going to look suspicious as
hell and by the way i'm not telling you
that i think it will be a
uh a fraudulent election i have no
reason to believe that no
no no evidence per se but who's going to
believe it anyway
this is one of those things where even
without evidence people can say well i
don't even need evidence for this
if larry elder doesn't win this
how the hell anyway but there could be
some oddities about
how the vote is distributed against you
know across people and stuff so we could
be surprised
anything could happen here's one of my
favorite quotes of all time
courtesy of elon musk who's who's one of
the
the best tweeters and uh interview
quotes of all time
but but i think this one's the best this
might be the best of all time
from at least from elon musk so far so
apparently uh
lex friedman was friedman friedman
i don't know how to pronounce his name
so i apologize for that so
lex once asked elon
what would be the first question that
musk would ask the world's first
general artificial intelligence system
so the moment you're you have your first
real ai what should we what's your first
question that you ask him
i'm seeing the it's pronounced friedman
thank you
and musk replied that the first question
he would ask
a real ai was quote
what's outside the simulation
talk about the most perfect answer to a
question
of all time what's outside the
simulation
i love that anyway
here's a segment that if i had segments
branded
i would call it two things we know
two things we know all right
and this will be my segment where i tell
you two things we know
that are opposites here's something that
all the smart people told me yeah scott
you might get some electric cars
sure you got your teslas and whatnot
you'll get some electric cars
but if there's one thing i could tell
you for sure scott and don't be a dope
because you know i know you're all an
optimist and stuff but
let me tell you for sure one thing we're
not going to get
because the physics just can't work
we're never going to get
electric airplanes right so no electric
jets no electric
aircraft right so that's one thing we
know for sure
the technology will never allow us to
have electric
aircraft here's the other thing we know
dhl has placed an order for 12 electric
airplanes
so those are the two things we know it
will never have them
and dhl just put it in order for 12 of
them
based on current technology so the
company building them says no we don't
need to invent anything we have all the
technology
we'll it just takes us a couple years to
build them they're
already bought well the payload is
apparently economically sufficient or
else dhl wouldn't be buying them
two things we know it's impossible and
it's already happening
here's one of my favorite twitter
moments
and it was based on my tweet from
yesterday i said yesterday that
on my live stream yesterday that i was
going to admit i was wrong about the
pandemic
now that's not the important part but
this encouraged
a comment from benjlessman on my twitter
account
her twitter feed he said
i bet you'd get much further in life if
you cared less about what other people
think about you
how do you like that advice first of all
do you think i should take that advice
should i take ben's advice i bet you'd
get much further in life
because this is me specifically if you
care less about what other people think
about you
good advice what do you think pretty
good advice
okay here's what user twitter user
absulas
said about ben's advice that i'd get
further in life
if i didn't care about what others think
about you he said yes
a person who makes money based on how
people think of him
should stop caring about what people
think of him
totally a winning move
that's what you call a conversation
ender
after this tweet things got really quiet
there there's nothing else left to say
we're done here
moving on just take your ball and go
home
there's nothing else to see well this is
similar to
the advice be yourself which i always
mock as the world's worst advice
be yourself that is the worst advice
ever given of all time to be yourself
because if you were to be yourself
nobody would want to be around you they
would not
because you'd be quite a bad person
here's what
maybe would be better advice
thank you it's already in the comments
you've heard me say this before
be a better version of yourself how
about
trying to stop being whatever the hell
that you were doing before
because it probably wasn't what you want
to be it's probably not the person you
want to be
whatever you've been doing before so how
about be a better person than that
about how about trying to elevate
yourself a little bit
don't be yourself try to make yourself
something better than that
for god's sakes so yes
never try to be yourself always try to
be a better version of yourself and
uh what do you think about the idea that
you shouldn't care about what people
think of you
completely wrong you should care
mostly about what people think about you
you would go much further in life if you
care deeply
about people what people think about you
well actually let me modify that a bit
it's not the caring about what they
think about you
it's the managing to it so let me make
that distinction
it would be better if you didn't care
because then it wouldn't bother you
but as long as you kept managing to it
as your your main requirement of how to
organize your life
your your entire happiness is going to
be based on what other people think of
you
i'm sorry that i'm sorry
that's just the fact your happiness
depends on what other people think of
you
because other people have to be your
mates other people have to be your
lovers they have to be your friends they
have to be the co-workers that want to
work with you they got to be the people
who want to invest with you they're
going to be the people
you see every day the other parents the
other the other peers
you need to find a way to get
some of them to like you otherwise your
life's going to suck
so you should be obsessed with getting
people to like you
now don't be stupid about it don't be
stupid about it
you know if you look great generally but
you got this one little thing about
yourself you don't like oh
my ear or whatever i've got a weird ear
don't obsess about that because there's
nothing you can do about it
so you don't want to spend too much time
worrying about things you can't do
anything about it
oh people make fun of me because i'm
bald why
what the am i gonna do about it
right i can't do anything about it
so i don't spend really any time
thinking about that
but if somebody said to me hey you know
i think
i think i might respect you more or like
you more or be more attracted to
if you were fit well i can do something
about that
i can become more fit so well
toupee i suppose yes but you know what
i'm talking about
so you should work hard on the things
that will make you a better version of
yourself and make people like you
it's the it's the main function of being
alive is making other people like you
so don't ever take advice about oh i
don't care what people think
but again you should manage to what
people think
but you should not don't let it chew you
up on the inside but you should
definitely manage to it
all right here's a more evidence of why
black lives matter is a sham
organization
great point just to be clear
we'd all like to make sure that black
lives
matter so everybody wants that to be
true
every all good people want that to be
true um
i say but
when you look at what they're actually
doing it doesn't kind of line up with
their
stated mission does it um
so for example the washington post is
reporting
in a tweet they said despite despite a
push since 2015
for police body cameras and the periodic
conversions of surveillance
footage of or bystander cell phone video
more than 80 percent of fatal police
shootings still were not
filmed according to the database
what
80 percent of fatal shootings
are not filmed either by a bystander
which makes sense
but there's no body cam on police who
might get into
shooting situations which is really any
police i guess
so let me ask you this suppose black
lives matter had said
you know one of the things we can do one
of the things that's controllable
is that we could work with a bipartisan
group
to make sure that there's enough funding
to get body cams
and and that whatever you know if
there's any
resistance to it we can push through it
do you think that
black lives matter would have met
failure or
success if they had said look there's a
lot of stuff we disagree on
but hey republicans let us work on this
one thing that we can agree on that the
body cams make a difference
right at the very least it's going to
reduce the number of cops who you know
flagrantly do something bad if
especially if there are other cops with
other body cams
so isn't this the easiest thing you
could do
and the one thing that you can get
bipartisan support
is there is there any reason
that both black lives matter and
republicans because you figure democrats
would be on board
i'm looking at your comments i don't
think i'm missing any
any kind of functional practical reason
why this isn't happening right
this has to be intentional doesn't it
well
intentional in the sense of it goes to
competence
or it goes to uh intention
because if black lives matter wanted to
solve this problem
remember early on when kaepernick was
doing his kneeling
and i said publicly and many times i
said well what do we do about it
you've got a problem i recognize it as a
problem too
um and i even i even talked to hawk
newsom about it
because one of the things i talked to
him i said well look if one of the
things we could do
that you wouldn't get much pushback from
is get more body cams
why don't you let me help you you know
i'll help
persuade you know maybe on the
my audience you know sort which sort of
lien's right
i'll help persuade them that if we had
funding for body cams
that that would be at least one thing
that everybody could agree on you just
need more funding so you could probably
get that
do you ever see that did you ever see
any national move to get
body cams everywhere and really after
after all this trouble
still 80 shootings are not filmed
so i think at this point you'd have to
say that black lives matter
is a fake organization and
if you want more evidence of it there's
been no change in police shootings
since ferguson or anything else is
basically the same pace
and yet there are no black lives matter
protests under the biden administration
let me say that again black lives matter
basically when quiet or at least maybe
it's just not being reported on which is
almost the same thing
under the biden administration what's
that tell you
what's it tell you that they went quiet
at the same time the problem was exactly
the same
and no progress had been made yet they
weren't quiet
it tells you that democrats can
turn them on and off with a switch yeah
it tells you it's a fake organization
at least in terms of what activates them
i'm not saying that the people on the
streets are not sincere
they probably are i mean almost
certainly most of them are
but in terms of the organization and
what motivates them what organizes them
what gets them on the street i think we
could say for sure now
well you know i suppose you could argue
nothing is 100 sure
but maybe i don't know 95
certainty based on what we know that it
wasn't ever a real organization it was
just
something that somebody was turning on
and off when they needed it
so another segment
that needs an introduction is ron
desantis news
because he's the only one doing anything
interesting that's not named trump
and he continues to be a populist
genius and i really am wondering who
is advising ron desantis because whoever
is advising him
i assume he has advisors you know if if
it turns out that all of his uh
you know populist decisions lately are
just completely his own
you know his own thinking well then he's
he's he's pretty amazing but i don't
believe it right i just assume that
there's
somebody advising him and in this case
somebody really good is advising him
because he's not missing a note here's
his latest
he's not missing a note in terms of
republican populism he just hits every
note
florida's board of education on friday
unanimously approved an emergency rule
that will allow parents to obtain
vouchers to move their children to
another school
if they perceive any type of covet
harassment against their children
as related to mass or testing mandates
this is from the tampa bay
times so no that's the board of
education
but desantis backs that
so once again
like what is going on there because he
is just killing it
in terms of hitting hitting just the
right populist republican note
time after time and he does it without
the you know without the provocation
no it could be that and i've often
argued this that trump's
provocations are a feature not a flaw
you know without that he wouldn't have
been president without being president
he wouldn't have made any impact
it was a feature it just grates people
when it happens but it's a feature
he does it intentionally it gets a
result just like he wants
so i call that a feature but desantis
seems to be getting pretty far without
doing the provocation part
and it makes you wonder if that's enough
would it be enough suppose you had a
choice
of uh let's say a boring but very
capable desantis
versus an exciting but maybe far riskier
trump which one do you want now i know
which one i want for entertainment
right for entertainment
i'm going to want trump every time it's
not even close
right so in terms of you know that
that's easy but what about if you just
want a good government without the drama
desantis looks like a strong choice and
it's going to be really interesting to
see if
trump goes ahead and runs because
he would i'm sure trump would um be the
nominee
if he runs all right um
i asked yesterday this question
whether the number of excess deaths
because of kovid
lines up with the number of people that
we say are dying from covet
so what would happen if the excess
deaths or the total number of deaths
was about the same as prior years at the
same time we're being told
we're in a pandemic like that wouldn't
make sense right
so what do you think happens on the
internet let's say on twitter
if you ask the public do the excess
deaths
match the number of reported cova deaths
you've been around a while what do you
think happened
and i'll tell you i'll give you a hint
many people provided
very very official looking
charts and data to answer the question
so there were many charts
that looked really official and much
data
so what's true is it true that they do
match up
that the excess deaths and the covades
look about the same and therefore we
don't have to worry too much about
whether it was a pandemic
because the excess deaths prove it was a
pandemic
and they kind of matched the covadas do
you think anybody gave me
data and charts to support that point of
view
yes yes they did so so there was data
very official with sources
showing that you know indeed excess desk
does roughly
match the coven number so you know it's
not perfect but
nothing to worry about right because
nothing's perfect when you count it but
they're in the same range so nothing to
worry about
that was one of the things happened do
you think that people
also gave me credible looking graphs and
charts
to show me that nothing like that had
happened
and that in fact there were no extra
deaths
yes yes that happened
so i have credible looking charts and
data
that say two opposite things that those
numbers match
and one that says no they're not even
close
was that a surprise no was not a
surprise
so what do you do it all looks about the
same to
to people like me right because i'm not
going to dig into every study
i wouldn't have the skill to unpack it
anyway
so what do you do well
uh i'll tell you one thing i do i go to
people who are better at looking at this
stuff than i am
so i went i looked at andres backhouse's
quote i always
recommend him as uh probably the best
person who's
evaluating studies that i've seen so far
and he basically says excess deaths and
confirmed covetas are pretty closely
aligned
over 2020 and he goes on to point out
that excess deaths
are even higher though
oh looks like my locals platform
just quit on me
so if you don't mind i'm going to see if
i can
call that back up while we're doing that
the the live stream on locals is uh
still in beta not everybody has that
so let's see if i can call that back up
without too much trouble
up oh actually it looks like it'll just
continue where it
left off if this works that would be
exciting
boom i'm back so it looked like uh
my browser quit but as soon as i got
back in the browser
the stream was still still live so
so we're good so we're back on both
platforms
all right so i asked andres and he said
that not only were the excess deaths
uh similar to the coveted account but
there were more excess deaths uh because
at least
worldwide i know this is true there are
more people dying of kova than they
count
because they die at home you know they
just don't
nobody bothers to test them they just
bury them basically
so certainly worldwide there are more
excess deaths than there are covet
counts because the way they come
so do you think that we can conclude
that the pandemic happened and is
happening
and that lots and lots of people extra
are dying
way more than normal seasonal flu what
do you say
which one do you believe do you believe
uh andres backhouse
who is way more talented than you and i
are
looking at data let me just say that
that's the thing i'm sure of the thing
i'm sure of
is that andres is better at looking at
the stuff that you are
and better than i am by far that doesn't
mean he's right
right so you don't just take somebody's
word for it because they're good at it
you don't take their word for it because
they showed their sources
and you don't take their word word for
it
because they made a good argument or
whatever we don't live in a world where
that's good enough anymore
but it's the best i have if i had to
uh you know bet all of my you know net
worth
on something i'd probably put it all on
andres's opinion in this case all right
so i think that the case of
whether the pandemic is real
in terms of the number of deaths is made
i would say that the case is made
that it's a real pandemic the numbers
show it clearly
the excess deaths make sense
compared to the covet count i think the
code of account could be off by 20
easily but that doesn't change anything
all right
lindsey let's talk about persuasion
persuasion lindsey graham says he told
trump to urge supporters to get coven
vaccines
because lindsay had the vaccine but he
also got infected
and looks like he's on on the mend so
good for him
and he told trump to urge supporters to
get
vaccinated now i feel like trump has
urged
people to get vaccinated he didn't
program
and he did get vaccinated himself but
it's sort of a republican thing not to
tell people what to do medically right
you know it like goes a little too far
into the
republican philosophy and takes too much
of a bite out of it to tell people what
to do
if you're the government so trump has
been um
let's say populist correct
as he almost always is he's he has his
finger on the pulse
and i think for political reasons
trump is playing it right for purely
political reasons
letting people make their own decisions
but telling you what he did and
making the vaccines available and
everything that was exactly the right
note
politically to get elected
especially in the primaries it was the
best thing to do but
is it the best thing to do for the
country
is it the best thing to do for the
health of the country well it depends
depends what you think about
vaccinations but
it does seem it's interesting that
lindsey graham you know a top republican
would be telling another top republican
to be more aggressive in the medical
recommendations
it's uh it's an interesting interesting
difference here
now let me ask you this if trump went
all
in recommending vaccinations would it
make a difference
would it make a difference now i i know
the answer to this question but i'm
going to ask in any way just because
it'll be funny to see your answers
how many of you who are resisting
vaccination
would change your mind because trump
suggested it
would anybody get vaccinated because
trump told them to
because you can really love trump a lot
and know he's not a doctor
you can love trump a lot
and think he might be wrong on this
particular question
you could love trump like crazy and
still make your own
you know medical decisions you're not
going to let the government make your
personal medical decision are you
so i asked a real question as to whether
trump's influence would
have any importance now all of you who
say no
you don't know how influence works
because remember early on when when
trump was first running for
office and his his approval was like
you're in the teens you know like
15 or something and i was telling you
that he was so persuasive that he was
going to talk you into
making him your president and then he
did because his persuasive powers are
just
insane they're just insane never seen
anything better
but it takes a while to work and it
doesn't work on every person you know
and eventually he took over the
republican party with his persuasion
so do you think that if he went full
balls to the wall
to persuade his supporters who were
already
sort of primed to be on his side to get
the vaccination
do you think he couldn't do it now
separate from the question of whether he
should
because i think that's a real question
should the government tell you to make
medical decisions a certain way but
could he
does he have the power to convince you
even when you saw all of you said no he
could not convince me
because when you said he would not
convince you you were talking logically
you said to yourself logically i know
everything that i know
he has no new information logically i
would not change my mind because he
would not be introducing any new
information
logically but that's not how it works
it doesn't work like that the way it
works is
persuasion is an irrational process and
if he changed your mind
you would think you did it yourself
that's how it works
you would say yeah yeah trump was saying
i should get the vaccination and
yes i did go from anti-vax to vacs but
not because of trump
i i just thought it through and i had
that new data
and then my neighbor my neighbor did
something and that anecdote really
moved me and now now yeah sure now i'm
on the same side as trump
about the vaccinations and yeah i got
one but not because he talked me into it
that didn't happen i just looked at the
facts because i'm a rational person who
does her own research
that's what it would look like it would
look like you made your own decision
let me give you my opinion
if trump went balls to the wall to
convince you to get vaccinated
a lot of people would get vaccinated
now i don't think he'll do that and i
also don't know that i would recommend
it
because again do you want your
government telling you what to do with
your personal
medical risks maybe not right it would
be a reasonable
a reasonable approach to say no i don't
need trump telling me what to do
medically
that just feels wrong but could he do it
does he have the skill
yes let me say it again as unambiguously
as he can
does trump have the skill to persuade
i don't know 10 million extra people to
get vaccinated
yes yes he does he has that skill
if he chooses to use it
there's a new let's say what would you
call this a
uh a new reframing of the attack on
trump
for the january six events and i guess
an attack on
republicans indirectly and eli honig
he's one of cnn's attack dogs one of the
people
they they pay to go after trump on a
daily basis
and um they figured out how to make the
fake
coup look like a real one
finally they were they worked and they
worked
and they tried to make it look like the
the people with the selfies and the
no major weapons but you know clubs and
bear spray and stuff
they they started with the ridiculous
belief that that was an actual
coup attempt now what it was was violent
and terrible and tragic and
shouldn't have happened and can't be
can't be supported in any way
but it wasn't a coup attempt i mean
we've been through this i don't have to
go over that
but i think cnn has been mocked
sufficiently
for trying to sell that as a coup
attempt because it was just absurd
i mean it's ridiculous and and that
claim can't stand if anybody is there at
the same time to talk against it
it just looks ridiculous so they had to
strengthen up their claim
somehow that trump was staging a coup to
keep the pressure on coup
on trump and here's the new information
so apparently there was this guy jeffrey
clark who worked in the trump
administration at the time
he was the attorney general for the
civil division
and who reportedly now what does
reportedly mean
very low credibility when you hear that
somebody
reportedly did something your brain
should say
reportedly do you have that on video
did the person who did it confess
are there other people who are reporting
it or is it one
anonymous source is it an anonymous
source
so what is the credibility of any of
this law the credibility
of this whole story that i'm about to
give you is low
because of the nature of it but
apparently this jeffrey clark
reportedly reportedly had secretly
expressed his support
for the bogus stolen election theory
uh directly to trump himself and he made
this straightforward proposition
reportedly reportedly from a source
you've never met
reportedly he made this straightforward
proposition
choose me and i'll deploy the department
to help you steal the election
yeah i'm sure that he made that
straightforward
offer if you if you put me in the job
i'll help you steal the election i'm
sure those were his exact words
or something just like that right
that that didn't happen people
people this didn't happen
i should have started off with this as
the fake news example
obviously this didn't happen now let me
tell you what might have happened i
wasn't there
so i don't know that this happened
either but i'll tell you what's
more plausible what's far more plausible
is that jeffrey clark
like lots of other people genuinely
believed that the election was stolen
and then offered to be a useful
um a useful uh
player in uh looking into it and making
sure that things were
were fixed is that a coup is it a coup
when somebody believes genuinely that
there was a problem
and that they're trying to make sure
that the election in the united states
was handled correctly do you think that
maybe that would be a way to
uh characterize what he did a genuine
belief that the election was stolen
followed by a sincere offer to help
the country get the result that they
thought they voted for
right couldn't you tell this story both
ways now in my version of it
the problem would be if he's wrong right
if he's wrong
that the election was completely
accurate as
no court has shown it was inaccurate if
he was wrong
then a bad outcome would have happened
but it wouldn't have been
bad intentions would it
is there any reporting that this jeffrey
clark
was didn't really believe anything that
happened with the election but he was
just going to let trump steal it anyway
no this is this is like
ridiculous fake news and so it's so
obvious too
it's like the most obvious fake news you
could ever have
so i guess the uh and here's how it's
being
um portrayed they said we were
we're really close this is the cnn's uh
framing of it
that we were really close to a proposed
coup no way we weren't really close to a
coup
we were close to a proposed coup
so we were never close to a coup we were
close to deciding to do a coup
but the only evidence we have is that
when trump was offered this
proposition he turned it down trump
turned down the guy who wanted to
overthrow the election
and instead kept in the guy who said he
didn't
rosen so trump knew that rosen was going
to play as straight
and go where the data took him and he
kept that guy
that's the opposite of almost a coup
it's the direct opposite and it's right
in the story you don't even have to
you don't even have to wonder if
something wasn't reported
it's writing the story the story says
that trump turned it down
trump himself picked the guy who said i
don't think there's any problem here
but you know obviously if the data is
different he's going to go with the data
trump picked that guy that's not almost
a coup
that's the president saying well we
don't want a coup
that's like opposite of almost the coup
and the
but they reported this oh so close we
were so
close to a coup when the only thing you
were close to
is another person who would look into it
and try to make
try to make what you thought was the
right thing happening i don't even think
trump
went that far anyway uh
here's a here's a rerun from the past
although it's new news
feels like a rerun so donald luskin was
tweeting this
he said here's another entry in the
hydroxychloroquine meta-analysis
sweepstakes now the meta-analysis is
where they look at existing studies
that are not high quality so they're
looking at studies that are not
necessarily randomized control
because they would be good enough if
they existed but looking at all these
low quality studies
and sort of looking at the big picture
and seeing if they can if they if they
tell the story
and one of the things they tested was uh
they gave
hydroxychloroquine to indian healthcare
workers
then tracked them to see if it prevented
them from getting infected
and the result was gigantic
gigantic effect according to a
meta-analysis
of low-quality studies now
there does seem to be some disagreement
among smart people
of whether a meta-analysis is really
really even a real thing
i mean it's a real analysis but how how
often is it right
well if you've got one or two trials in
there that are messing up the average
then it's not going to be right so you
got to do it right
but apparently the assumptions you make
when you do something like a
meta-analysis
will largely determine the outcome and
so if the outcome of a meta-analysis
is determined by the assumptions you
make
as opposed to the data is it really an
analysis
or is it just you made some assumptions
and then that determined the outcome
i'm not sure that's anything if the
outcome is based on the assumptions
you know and not the data
and you can make different assumptions
reasonably
do you have anything that's more like
having nothing isn't it than having
something
but as donald luskin
points out because his background is
economist
and this is how economist thinks the
evidence is
at least strong enough certainly not
proven
but strong enough that given the low
risk of hydroxychloroquine
one of the you know few drugs that have
been around forever and
you know we know it's risk profile that
giving it
prophylactically would make sense uh in
the context of this meta analysis
do you buy that does it make sense even
though
you can't be sure sure that given this
meta-analysis
that the risk reward looks good for
taking it
and do i get would i get banned from
google for this
or probably demonetized for saying this
now keep in mind
i'm not telling you that
hydroxychloroquine works in fact
my bet is still that it doesn't so
so if i had to put my actual money on it
i would bet
it doesn't but
if i had the option of taking it
prophylactically
i would if i were in a high risk
environment such as healthcare
not so much right now because i i'm i
can socially isolate pretty well
but those can both be true right
that if i had to bet i would bet against
hydroxychloroquine working
i'd bet against it because i don't
believe the meta-analyses
but if i had the option of taking it i
would take it
because that's where the math goes in my
opinion the math says it doesn't work
but the math also says it's worth it
worth a shot because the risks are so
low
so that's where i'm at so don't block me
youtube because i'm still betting that
hydroxychloroquine doesn't work
all right jennifer anderson made a
little news by
saying that she uh she uh let's see
lost a few people in my weekly routine
who have refused or did not disclose
whether they had been vaccinated so
she's making the decision not to hang
around with people who
are unvaccinated if any of you made the
same decision
is there anybody here who has made a
decision
not to spend time around people
i say yes yeah i don't think that would
be
too common but i'm actually thinking
about it
i'm thinking about not being around
any adult who's unvaccinated
because why should i be i don't need to
take that risk it would be an
unnecessary risk
and i was trying to think if i know any
adults who were unvaccinated and where i
live
i actually no i take that back i know
one adult
who is very young i know one adult who's
unvaccinated that's it
over 65 i think at least 95 percent of
californians or
my county anyway in my county 95 of us
over 65 i'm not over 65 but
those who are are vaccinated have at
least one vaccination
somebody says what is the risk to you
well there's some risk because i'm
vaccinated
and i'm a certain age and i have asthma
so i could get the
i could still get it and i can still get
it from a vaccinated person too
uh i think the numbers are less but we
don't quite know
um oh and also that you wouldn't want
them to get infected in case you had it
and you didn't know right so it wouldn't
be so much just being
selfish um
it wouldn't be selfish so much it would
be
maybe helping other people but it
doesn't look like that's going to be
i don't know if this is going to become
a thing this could easily become a thing
couldn't it
it would be easy to imagine that the
thing that gets people vaccinated in the
end
is that vaccinated people don't want to
hang around with them
actually i'm going to go out on a limb
and say there's going to be more of this
because if i think about it although i
haven't had to worry about it
i feel like i would i would be hesitant
to hang around an unvaccinated person
even though philosophically is their own
risk
but it's their own risk but i also am
part of it so i get to i get to make
decisions about
how much risk i put other people to
and how much i put to myself yeah this
might be become a thing i could imagine
that vaccinated people will not wanna
i here's here's what else i can imagine
i can imagine that people have
private get-togethers in which they just
don't invite
unvaccinated people people are gonna
notice
people will do a lot of things for their
personal
social uh decisions that they wouldn't
do for other reasons
you know you'll do things to be part of
your friend network
that you might not have done otherwise
it's a pretty strong
strong incentive all right
um we're also seeing cnn using what i
call the vaccination
anecdote persuasion vaccination
anecdotal persuasion what that is is
human interest stories
about the tragic case of the person who
was an
anti-vaccination activist but died
while his daughter was getting married
of covid
now i made that one off that's sort of
conflating a few stories
but you know what the stories look like
right so here's another one
the father of several children you know
can you play your little violin i mean
this is a real tragic story
but the way cnn tells it it's for
brainwashing all right so this is a
brainwashing story on cnn
about the father of several children
who's been in a hospital in bristol
since late july and has been has been
recording a video diary of sorts from
his room and he said quote
i messed up big time guys he said
through an oxygen mask in one video
posted to facebook i didn't get the
vaccine
i made a mistake i admitted
so that's one example so cnn now is
i think they've given up on data
changing people's minds
right they don't think the data is
changing minds
so they're going
oh gotta run i'll see you later
