dude
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams because
there's coffee and there's me and if
you'd like your experience to go up to
the levels that nobody's ever heard of
everybody's talking about how great that
it would be if you did all you need is a
copper mug or a glass of tanker Chelsea
style and a Kim team Jugger flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparalleled pleasure
Earth adopting the day thing that makes
everything better it's called the saute
you sip go
ah
they're so comment here let me let me go
back there it was it the midstep when I
thought
something about Vivek
yeah I can't find it now
there we go well let's talk about all
the news shall we
let's talk
so I saw a headline without reading the
story but have you noticed that the
headline
is as good as the story
usually the headline tells you
everything you need to know the headline
was fracking
could lead to Big advances in geothermal
power
and so the idea is that the whole point
of fracking is they drill a hole and
they they shoot water down there
and when they shoot the water down there
somehow they get a better bigger hole or
something so they use it for producing
oil and gas I guess
but
um
they could maybe use it to get deep into
the Earth and get some energy out of the
Heat
from the Earth
I have long been saying that the
greatest technology the earth needs is
holes
does anybody remember me saying that
if we could ever learn to build really
good holes we would solve basically
everything because if you could if you
could build big holes like the test like
Elon Musk boring company
that just makes tunnels yeah that's the
beginning but fracking
and boring
might open up the the interior of the
planet for unlimited energy because if
you could inexpensively dig a really
deep hole anytime you wanted free energy
you know after the expense of creating
it it's free
so
and then I also thought that farming
inevitably has to go underground
or at least indoors
because you want your farming to have no
no pests and no problems from nature
so I think inevitably that's you know
holes holes is where the future is
space and holes
um I don't believe I talked about that
Jason Aldean song in the detail that I
wanted to so you know there's a big
controversy country star Jason LD NASA's
Small Town song where he's saying that
there are riots in the the urban unrest
if it came to a small town those small
Towners would take care of it meaning
that they would at least use the threat
of violence to stop people from doing
bad things
now the first thing I'd say about is
having now listen to the entire song the
first time I mentioned it I heard it
it's actually a really good song
so so if I could just recommend it on a
purely musical basis
really good really good I was actually
surprised because country music is not
my preferred genre so when something in
that genre you know totally lights me up
it's it's pretty notable yeah if you can
give somebody from the wrong genre to
appreciate what you're doing that's some
good stuff
so talent wise a plus
um but the controversy is that some
people are listening to a song
and they think it's a racist and
promoting lynching
other people listen to the same song and
it's not so much the lyrics As the video
the video imagery
and they look at the imagery and they
say
where is any of that
I don't see I don't see any video that's
highlighting any racial group
in fact it looked like it was shot to
decrease that perception you know
there's a lot of a lot of vague images
and you can't really tell who it is
it'll look to me intentional that they
didn't want it to be about race it was
about Behavior but
uh and then what about the question of
lynching well that's not there either
there's just a suggestion that if
violence came to a small town the small
town people would react in some forceful
way to stop it nothing about lynching
all right so now I've now I've told you
that I saw Zero imagery
zero words
uh to suggest either racism or
um lynching now let me tell you what I
felt when I heard the song Totally
racist it looks like it's encouraging
lynching
are those two things out of whack
there's no evidence in the song
the song does not have racist imagery it
does not have racist words
it doesn't it's just not there
but I felt it why did I feel it
why did I feel this so strongly
so much South that I have to go back and
look at it a second time
to look for those things that triggered
me and guess what
there weren't any
there was nothing there
that would have given me the impression
that I got
so let me ask you this I legitimately
felt the same thing that the Democrats
presumably and the people on the left
are criticizing I felt it too
but it wasn't there
I mean I I can guarantee you it's not
there I looked very closely
and it wasn't there
so who do you blame do you blame the
artist
for making a song about you know the
point the artist wanted to make about
violence in small towns was that a
problem
I'm going to say no I'm going to say you
have to blame
well do you blame me
do you blame the people who interpret it
the same way I did the first time I
heard it no I think you blame the media
the media has primed us all
that violence equals black
did I come up with that on my own
no I turned on the TV and there's
violence and then I look at the
statistics and it seems to be highly
correlated with news reports the value
of BLM or urban areas where this is
violence and without without you know
any statement of what's true or wasn't
what's not true statistically that's not
my point my point is that I'm inundated
with things that that conflate black
people and violence
in the news
it's all over the place so when I see
something that sees this this vague
urban violence
what do you think of when you think of
urban violence
we've all been so triggered into seeing
it
that you just assume you're seeing
something you're not actually seeing
so I think this the the Jason Aldean
thing is
in some ways has nothing to do with
racism whatsoever
but it has everything to do with
explaining your current situation
it explains how you've been brainwashed
because you can't avoid it when I say
you this is no insult to you not
specifically I'm saying that you and I
and everybody we're getting the same
forces from the outside and they've
primed us to see something that wasn't
there
it's really freaky to see something
clearly
that you can confirm doesn't exist
it's it's quite shocking so I had that
experience and uh so but I recommend the
I recommend the song it's just good
music and I don't think the I do not
think that the creator of the song
should have any blowback but I get it I
mean I understand that what happened it
just wasn't his fault
definitely the media all right
um
let's see
I've said this before but this is the
most useful thing you'll hear it's good
to reinforce it if you use Twitter
you have to understand
that a fairly shocking percentage of the
trolls on Twitter are literally actually
drunk
or inebriated in some way and until you
understand that
it's a very like maddening place because
you'll end up doing things like why
can't you understand my point are you
are you intentionally missing my point
and yeah yeah you just go crazy because
these triggering tweets but the moment
you tell yourself they're probably drunk
it all goes away
all of your uh all of your like I don't
know stress or anxiety about somebody
tweeting evil things at you it just
completely goes away when you tell
yourself they're probably drunk
try it it's just a reframe for your
mental health right now with reframes in
general here's something you'll hear a
lot from me a reframe doesn't have to be
accurate
right it doesn't have to be true
it doesn't have to be true some of the
time or all the time it doesn't have to
have any semblance of reality to it a
reframe works
because it works
you just try it and you see what happens
it's free so just try telling yourself
they're probably drunk and watch what
happens it just changes your experience
totally
right
yeah that and I also wonder
how many of the celebrities that you
think just have opinions you don't like
are literally drugs
when you see a Ron Perlman uh you know
his Angry Video tweets
do you think he's always sober
I don't know
but he looks like an angry drunk to me
so if you tell yourself Ron Perlman is
an angry drunk even if he isn't I have
no evidence one way or the other it
completely explains how he's acting
look at Keith olberman
is he drunk when he does these greeds
well I doubt he's drunk all of the time
I'm sure he's not always drunk but does
he look like he might be drunk when he
doesn't and the answer is yes yes he
does which doesn't mean he's drunk I I
want to make a clear distinction between
people who act drunk
and people who are I can't tell if they
are but you can tell us they act drunk
and yeah and Rob Reiner was an expert
who's going to bring up you don't think
Rob Reiner has a little wine with dinner
I'm just wondering
Rob Reiner any chance at all he has a
drink of wine with dinner
Maybe
do you think he does any Tweeting after
a couple glasses of wine
ever even once
I don't know maybe
maybe so but even if you don't know
anything about the people who are
tweeting that are making you mad just
tell yourself they're drunk
and then look at the Tweet you'll be
amazed at how as soon as you tell
yourself they might be drunk the Tweet
looks like he came from a drunk it will
look like it immediately
and make you feel better
all right
um I'm loving the
the folks on Twitter who are finding all
the
the Democrats who had been pushing back
on the 2016 election and if you haven't
seen the cringy video of all the very
sincere Democrat celebrities saying that
the electors after Trump had been
you know elected at least by the vote
but the Electoral College had not done
its thing that they were actually
producing
you know major pieces to say that the
elect the electors would be more
patriotic if they did not follow you
know the this specific path that they
had been let's say chartered to take by
the voters
now
how do you watch that
if you're a Democrat and you're going
crazy about January 6 and Trump
did they just not remember that
I'm actually curious I don't know
because I don't think they do
and then the other question is was
either of them illegal was it illegal
for a bunch of actors to give you their
their opinion
of what electors should do
not really it wasn't illegal it was all
transparent it was Free Speech but what
did Trump do there was that different
what what was he plotting is that
different and what if you're plotting to
do something that you have an expert
tells you is probably legal
is it is it is it an Insurrection if the
only plans you have
to have some legal backing or you're not
willing to consider them
because I'm pretty sure that Trump
didn't do anything without at least one
lawyer who may or may not have been
right
but I don't think he did anything
without anything that was you know in
question without a lawyer saying that
there was an argument for it
doesn't mean it was a good argument but
you know that's how it works
so to me it looks like
in both cases
the Democrats and the Republicans were
exercising free speech and they were
trying to use the law as they understood
it
is it illegal to try to use the law as
you understand it
well you could end up running a foul of
the law that way but certainly there's
no intention
there's no intention of breaking the law
there's an intention of using the law as
it exists yeah maybe in a creative way
but using the existing law
so
so I don't know
I'd be amazed if Trump goes to jail for
any of that stuff but we're no longer in
a world where the actual facts will
matter
um
and it wasn't the real problem in both
cases that people believe the media
do you think that you would have had the
2016 people trying to overthrow Trump
now remember there are Arguments for why
the electors should pick somebody else
this is the part that's the most
mind-blowing the argument they made in
2016
for why the the electors should pick
something other than the one who got the
most votes
or at least most votes in the right
places was
that he was obviously unqualified
it's just obvious I mean just look at
them obviously and that was their whole
argument the argument is that any
reasonable person an elector could just
look at Trump and they could tell that
he was not
the right person to be a president
now
how in the world
do they still think that
after four years of him being president
what did he do
now let let's let's hold aside January 6
itself for a moment if you take January
6 out of the equation we'll talk about
it separately what did he do there was
an ordinary presidency
right the only things were things they
made up like the fine people hoax and
the drinking Bleak jokes a hundred
percent of what they thought about Trump
was just made up by their own newspeople
so much so that they thought he couldn't
even be president
but in fact he was he was such a
reasonable president that his own Side
by an overwhelming majority wants him to
try it again
right I'm pretty sure if he had done any
of the things that Democrats accused him
of you know the big stuff that even the
Republicans would be looking hard for us
another choice
so reality is quite weird but
I would also argue that uh January 6
was because people looking at certain
news sources got riled up in a way that
people looking at different news sources
did not
for example
I was only vaguely aware that there was
going to be some kind of protest
it wasn't even on my radar so whatever I
was watching on social media it did not
include calls to show up at the I mean I
was I just thought it was another one of
those everybody protests everything
that's the end of it
um but I was never activated like there
was nothing I saw in my news reading
that made me want to drive to Washington
and try to change everything so both
sides were got their opinions from the
new sources that they consumed although
there's a cause and effect thing there
you you tend to consume the things you
know you're going to believe believe but
there's a there's a two-way effect there
then we don't know the effect of the FBI
Etc on January 6th that's true
all right
so
um I'm going to tell you a story that
seems like it's on a different topic and
then it's going to weave right back here
watch this
so according to the New York Times
Google is pitching to the big news
entities like the Washington Post Wall
Street Journal and the New York Times a
new tool
an AI tool for making news or reporting
the news
now is that the funniest story you've
ever heard
if if you don't know why this is funny
I'll explain it to you
Google hires the smartest people
around wouldn't you agree
Google hires really smart people you
know the other companies do too but
Google is sort of famous
for hiring extra smart people
so imagine these extra smart people
they build some kind of an AI tool for
news and then they took it to the New
York Times Washington Post and the Wall
Street Journal it asked them if they'd
like to use them and maybe buy it
do you see anything wrong with this
story
the smartest people in the world who
work at Google were unaware that these
are not real news entities in the case
of two of them anyway they're not even
real news entities they think the
Washington Post reports news
in 2023
or the New York Times They don't know
that those are our narrative entities
now the Washington I would say the
Washington
um The Wall Street Journal The Wall
Street Journal was the third one
mentioned and I think they're in their
own category
I think the Wall Street journalist plays
a little bit closer to the middle of the
road but
um although there are opinion pieces you
could make you could make you know you
could make a case that their opinion
piece is lean right
um but they're very clear about what's
opinion and I always appreciate that
right they say opinion opinion abuse so
it's really clear
um but I would say that the New York
Times And The Washington Post are
narrative promoting entities that use
the news to launder their opinions
so wouldn't AI ruin your entire business
model
their business model is telling their
base what they want to hear which is
very compatible with what the
advertisers want to pay them to be
associated with which is very compatible
with what Democrats want none of that
has anything to do with the news
so AI is trying to solve a problem
that's totally not a problem in fact
it's a feature
the the the ability to shape the news
and manage the news
is the main thing that those entities do
they're not telling you full transparent
both sides of stories we know that
there's no there's no debate on that
so I just think it's hilarious that some
of the smartest technology people in the
world because their own news sources lie
to them
and they believe it
they thought that those news sources
might benefit from an objective tool for
figuring out what the news is
just think about that they actually
believed
that the news is real and developed a
tool to help
develop this real news a little faster
or or I don't know the details
what is what if the Google tool allowed
them to insert the narrative
what if it's the opposite of what I said
what if instead of you know being AI so
it's totally objective about what the
news is shows both sides what if it has
a feature where you can just push a
button and it gets rid of all one side
of the argument
how hard would that be it wouldn't be
hard to build it I mean you could design
that quite easily so it would be the
easiest thing in the world now how hard
would it be
for Google to sell a tool to the news
industry
and then they get addicted to it and
they say you know we don't even need
reporters anymore this AI tool is just
killing it getting all our news
organizing it putting it into stories
do you think that that tool would exist
only on the desktops of the people using
it or just putting this out there it
would actually be an application that
ran in the cloud
and you were just attached to it and
Google had full control of what that AI
did and which narratives is surfaced
which one of those do you think Google
was selling
the one who was totally objective
or were they selling something where
they Google could control what AI
decided was news you should see
do you think they would leave themselves
no option for for managing it on their
end secretly you think there would be no
way for them to do that time no way to
tweak that code just a little bit a
little bit
it would be the easiest thing in the
world if if they could get the biggest
entities
to accept their tool for news
they own the whole world
they would own the world now that
assumes that the entities used it as it
was provided and they would over time if
the tool was really really good and
saved them money
if they were really really good and it
saved them money they would move to the
Google tool and then Google would own
all the news
they would have any narrative they
wanted they could just pump it through
the system and people would think it was
the news
that's pretty weird and scary
all right so
how would it how would it cover a story
about Trump
how would Google's AI
compile a story about Trump would it
look like
let's say you might read in Breitbart
would it look like something you might
read in the Washington Post because
they're not the same they don't even
look similar
so what would it do how would it cover
the news
well let's look at the questions of the
possible indictments against Trump right
so we're the all of these topics are
going to be related so if it seems like
I'm changing topics
just understand it's all related we'll
we'll tie it all together with him
so Trump is being indicted the newest
set of indictments on three statutes
reportedly
all right so here so the charges would
pertain to these things reportedly we
could be wrong at this point but
something pertaining to deprivation of
Rights
so you all know exactly what that is
right we're all aware of exactly what
Trump did
that would be illegally depriving people
of Rights right
I don't I have no idea what that is no
idea but there's more it's not just that
it's also conspiracy to committed an
offense against or defraud the United
States
now is that what I said was him getting
a legal opinion that what he was doing
was legal
so getting a legal opinion and following
your legal opinion the way you're doing
is legally okay is that what they're
going to say is some kind of conspiracy
doing what your lawyer says would be
legal
maybe I don't know too soon to know
still fog of War
um how about uh let's see what else
um and tampering with a witness
tampering with a witness who
does anybody know what witness we're
talking about with the temporary
all right so at the moment it may at the
moment it makes sense
at the moment it makes sense that we
don't understand the story right because
it's new it's complicated as legal stuff
so we don't know the story let me ask
you this
at the end of it all
let's say Trump gets convicted
uh and let's say uh
he's taken out of the race
all right
do you think the public would understand
the charges
would they be able to repeat them back
and tell you why it was illegal and what
happened
no do you think that lawyers watching
this case even lawyers who get to hear
all of the evidence let's say the case
is public
for example
do you think if a bunch of lawyers
watched the trial and all the evidence
just the way the jury did the same way
the jury did do you think all the
lawyers watching it on TV seeing all the
evidence would all have the same opinion
that oh yeah those are you violated the
law got to go to jail
no probably not right
um too early to say but probably not
so what happens if you take the major
competitor around the race one whose
polls look pretty promising at the
moment
you take him out of the race based on
crimes that the public doesn't
understand
and lawyers observing it don't agree
even what happened
and what's illegal
is that a safe safe situation for the
country
that's where we're headed that that's
the current trajectory is that Trump
will be taken out by charges that the
public doesn't understand too
complicated
and lawyers disagree whether whether
Justice was served
that's that's where we're heading
it's almost unbelievable
that we could do it willingly we're just
sleepwalking right into the wood chipper
and we know it's happening well there's
a wood chipper walking right toward it
let's walk into that wood chipper
uh what do you mean it's a bad idea well
I know it's a bad idea but I'm going to
do it anyway walking into the wood
chipper
or
or as the public is so beaten down and
discouraged and demoralized that the
Democrats can literally do whatever they
want at this point because they've
already told you you'll go to jail if
you even protest
that's what January 6 was about in my
opinion
in my opinion January 6 was about
stopping the next protest I don't think
it was about the last one because nobody
cares about the last one it looked like
a one-off
right didn't January 6 look like a
one-off by Patriots who maybe were
misled about what information was true
and what wasn't or maybe they were right
and we don't know it that's also a
possibility
so
I think that the January 6 Hammer is to
make sure that the same people don't
complained when things get worse and
it's more obvious that they're being
abused
now I don't know that people actually
have that conscious thought
this would be a case of people just who
are on the same side would just
naturally know what's good for their
team so the collective actions look like
a plot but it doesn't need to be a plot
it's just everybody knows what's good
for their team now what's good for their
team is that anytime the other side
complains they go to jail
oh
that's pretty good for your team do you
think your team is stronger if one of
the other if the other team complains
about your cheating
that the team complaining about the
cheating goes to jail
not the cheaters
or potential cheaters because we don't
have proof of cheating
but no the people who complained about
it they go to jail
because of the way they complained would
be the argument right and of course
nobody's arguing about the ones who are
actually violent for the NPCs I'd like
to once again bring Dale in to just sum
this up
there were some people who were violent
on January 6.
deal we know we know we know we know
we're not talking about them we know
Dale
but did you know that there were some
that were violent no
no so I'll agree with people
just like the Matrix
all right Dale go back to your
hiding place
all right
now here is the interesting part
fake Vivek ramaswamy who's
again doing amazing in his job of
campaigning is there anyone who would
disagree with the statement the the
vague ramaswamy is showing Republicans
how to campaign
would everybody agree with that
or is this just my own am I biased
because even if you don't pick him you
know even if he's not your first choice
which I get I get that even if he's not
your first choice he's running a
campaign like I've never seen
to me to me this looks like the best
so far
best campaign I've ever seen
I would say
no mistakes
no mistakes
he gets in the news every day by being
provocative but he's provocative within
bounds right
like he can see the line and he walks
right up to the line and instead of what
Trump does which he'll stick his foot
over the line like repeatedly the vague
goes up to the line maybe he may try to
move the line
but you stay as very clearly
on the side of the line that keeps him
out of trouble and allows him to be a
credible president uh should it come to
that
so I can't say enough about how how
smart he is
in just pushing his campaign
um and I would say that others are
copying them I think he's already
setting a standard that others have to
look to to figure out what to do
but here's something you said
um that I thought captured it perfectly
so he's making the argument why he
should be president instead of trump
when it's obvious that more people like
Trump it's a tough argument right
why would you vote for him
if you clearly prefer chop you know
according to the polls and his argument
is this uh he that about 30 percent of
the country becomes quote
psychiatrically ill in response to
whatever Trump champions
and they will take a new Outsider
somebody like Vivek to further the
agenda
what do you think of that argument
I like the same things Trump does but
because he makes 30 percent of the
country psychiatrically ill he's simply
no longer practical you you need the
Practical alternative that gets you
trump-like results but without the
trump-like psychological damage
is very good
it's not good it's perfect
it's it's exactly the right argument
because it's not insulting Trump
because he's not saying that people go
crazy because of trump he said he's
simply noting a fact that we all see
you all see the same thing
we all say the 30 of the public goes
absolutely psychologically nuts now
would you agree that Trump makes it easy
right he gives them the material that
they can do it because he stays
provocative all the time
Vivek is a little bit more nimble so
he's not going into provocative
territory just to be provocative
like he he goes everywhere he has the
better argument and then he wins it and
then he finds another place where he has
the best argument and he goes and wins
that but he's basically winning
arguments
he's not just making your hair catch on
fire it's a very different strategy so I
would say that he perfectly framed it
I can I can give you similar results to
Trump who you liked
but I won't I'll do it without making
the other side mentally ill
that's a really strong that's a really
strong case because he knows and you
know that the only problem with Trump
in my opinion not the only problem
that's too much that's too far the main
problem with Trump
is that the other side goes crazy
and that causes trouble for you and me
and everybody else who might think that
his policies are good so it's a strong
Play Strong play and he's also being
completely respectful to Trump and his
accomplishments and his and what how
he's changed the country
so he could not be more on point on that
and he says I think it is unproductive
for a country to blame Trump for January
6.
because it exonerates everyone else from
introspection
uh on what actually led to the
frustrations of America that boiled over
that day
is that perfect
I mean that's that is just so perfect
communication skills are just just off
the chart
all right to say as unproductive is
exactly the right frame
don't say it's wrong
don't say it's true
don't say it's untrue
say it's not useful
it's unproductive
boom exactly exactly the right place
like he's finding the exhaust pipe on
the Death Star like three times a day
like I don't know if you're catching
that let me say it again
vivekis finding the exhaust pipe of the
Death Star
three times a day right in front of you
if you don't start noticing the pattern
after a while like that's got to be on
you
because there's a very clear pattern
developing which is Extreme skill
extreme skill like we've never seen
honestly
um you know Trump's in a category of his
own he's a one of a kind so there's
nobody who's uh more Trump than Trump
he's the best Trump
but if you want something else that
gives you maybe some similar outcomes
that's a hell of an option and I think I
think it's becoming obvious to all
observers too which is interesting are
you watching this like a slow
realization
that oh yeah his polling numbers are not
you know through the roof Vivek but
they're solid it does show that people
are paying attention and why is it that
every time we want to do a hit piece on
them we can't
ah if you notice that have you noticed
dog not barking people
here's the biggest dog that's not
barking
nobody's run a big hit piece on Vivek
yet
nobody do you know why
they got nothing
they got nothing
it's the same reason you haven't seen a
big hit piece on me
right I got a fully canceled globally I
got claimed I got canceled all over the
planet
what's the next thing that always
happens after you get canceled always
there are large articles showing that
the reason thing you did is Not Unusual
because you have a whole history of bad
things
did you see that with me
no
do you think nobody looked into it do
you think nobody scoured all of my old
tweets of course they did do you think
they didn't look at every blog post I
ever read wrote every every book I ever
wrote
you don't think they looked at all of it
looking for the supporting data to their
their theory of course they did they
looked through 30 years of my life and
they Define the thing that's why
that's the only reason and what do you
agree would you agree that if anything
was there there would have been a major
story about it because my cancellation
was a major story it's the obvious
follow-up oh my God he was always like
this and we just didn't know
and then turns out there was nothing
there because the story was you know 90
 the way it was framed
now there are still people who believe
the news so I feel sorry for you but if
you believe the news about public
figures then I'm doubly sorry for you
because that's just never true
now back to Vivek
Vivek is way too strong already and he
does have a path by the way if you think
he doesn't have a path the Democrats are
making the path for him
the Democrats are trying to take out the
only thing that stands between Vivek and
the white house because it's not
DeSantis
in my opinion in my opinion a straight
up contest between DeSantis and Vivek
would would go for vex way
and it would be just because if you put
the two of them on the stage together
yeah one's uh one's a nuclear power
plant the other is a
you know a lighter
yeah they're not really on the same I
don't think they're on the same plane
the the same way you'd expect you know
Trump would destroy you know let's say
patents in a in a debate
you can't imagine the desensis would be
able to be the fake in the debates
because he would have nothing to go
after you can't go after vivek's right
Vivek doesn't have a uh a history to go
after a political history
so that entire area of attack just
doesn't exist
nor does he have what Trump had which
were some businesses that had some you
know sketchy elements to them
he doesn't have anything there's just
nothing to attack so you would have to
attack with Vivek his current opinions
which match Republicans well all right
so desensis has no desensis has no
policy
uh or historical advantage over vivek's
argument nothing
so he would have to go against them as a
smart capable person which is right
DeSantis is very smart
very capable and has a track record of
proving that he is both smart and
capable and does things you like it's a
very strong package
but
The Fakes that you know oratory and his
communication skills his framing are a
whole different level these are not they
are not they're not verbally equal
you all get that everybody gets the
Vegas on his own level if you put him in
a contest where talking is the game
it's no contest
if you put him in a contest where they
both governed you know maybe DeSantis is
better
I I have absolutely nothing negative
about DeSantis
nothing
he would be just a solid solid president
in my opinion
but I just think he would disappear on
the stage next to vivek's Firepower
I think you just blown away
it wouldn't be instant I think what you
would see if you saw those two debate I
think you'd see
um you know DeSantis going from a
commanding lead to half of that lead
with one debate
and then the stories would be about
momentum and then it would be over
yeah if he could you know pull that
before the actual primary stuff
anyway so if you don't think Vivek has a
path the Democrats are trying as hard as
possible to make that path here's my
payoff for listening to all this
whether Vivek says it directly or not
and he probably wouldn't
if Trump gets taken down
you're going to want revenge
am I right
even if you didn't like Trump even let's
say you're a Conservative Republican and
you didn't like Trump you legitimately
didn't want him to be the next candidate
but if he got taken out
by dirty tricks in your opinion they
were dirty tricks
um wouldn't you want revenge
even if he's not your guy right just the
fact that somebody on your team got
taken out
by the other side you're going to want
revenge
who's going to give it to you
Pence
do you think
do you think DeSantis cares about
what happens to Trump
at the moment probably not right now
it's not just a question of who cares
about what it's also a question of
protecting the base and making sure that
one side is not a victim to the other I
think the fake would rip them apart
I think we're I think Vivek would would
take out the evil from The Roots
because that's what he's talking about I
mean he's talking about going after the
root system nobody's ever talked about
that the whole draining the Swamp Thing
wasn't even Trump I think that I think
the crowd said that he just embraced it
but Vivek is talking very detailed about
which entities are going to go
completely away
yeah pulling it up by his roots
is a pretty strong statement and it
would look like Revenge to Republicans
all right well how about your department
doesn't exist anymore that's how much we
love you
so here's the situation I see developing
the Democrats are going to try to take
Trump out or at least they'll damage him
so much that he looks less
like you could take on Biden uh if drum
goes down
and so far I would uh I'm predicting
against it
I think it's more likely Trump survives
all the legal challenges
but if he doesn't it's certainly not
guaranteed if he doesn't uh Vivek is
going to be the
sword of the Republicans
Vivek will be the sword of the
Republicans
because I don't think that the
Republican I don't think Trump
supporters would trust DeSantis to do
what needs to be done
is that fair you might even like
DeSantis you might even think he'd be a
great president I think he'd be solid
but you don't think he would necessarily
get you the Vengeance that you feel you
need
and I'm not I don't recommend Vengeance
as a policy preference yeah I'm not
saying you should be vengeful
I'm saying you're gonna feel it it's
just gonna be there you know whether you
like it or not I'd feel it I would
definitely want revenge even while I'm
telling myself don't be like that Scott
don't be that guy don't be that guy who
Wants Revenge
but I'd wanna
and I'd be happy if he got it
so CNN's reporting about uh
they're talking about a study from the
j-a-m-a
surgery Journal
I did some kind of a study or report or
something that said that mass shootings
and major metropolitan areas in the
United States
disproportionately affect black people
and structural racism may play a role
according to this study
that's right mass shootings
disproportionately affect the black
people
now there was no uh
there's no prescription given about what
to do about it
but
I'd say move away
I mean that's
just my first thought
I would uh
if I were black I would want to get away
from any place that had a high
likelihood of mass shooting
so shouldn't you just get away from
those places
now I don't believe that the problem is
that white people are coming into the
black neighborhoods and shooting a bunch
of black people the study doesn't seem
to say that it would seem like it's
black people shooting other black people
and that my guess is that that doesn't
happen in every town
I would think that might statistically
be more likely in places where there's
greater density
so if you wanted to get away from this
you should go get away from densely of
any kind any kind of densely
so that's my advice to black people who
are at risk of mass shootings because
they're in areas where they're more
likely to happen
you should get away from there
am I double canceled yet
do I get in trouble for giving
reasonably reasonable advice that
literally everybody agrees with
you all agree with that of course you do
but it's okay because I said I'm helping
black people
let me give you my current uh opinion on
things that are good or bad for black
people
things that are good or bad for lgbtq
things that are good or bad for other
groups I don't care
I I think it's stupid to look at group
performance in 2023. I'm all about the
individual
so if there's any individual
who's at risk of mass shootings and
wishes they could find a solution
I'd be happy to help I could advise
maybe if it's somebody I'd like to help
them out more directly
right so helping individuals
succeed I'm all about that and I'll talk
a lot more about that as the year goes
by but I'm kind of retiring from this
group is doing better than this group
and therefore I don't care
let me say it directly I don't care if
elbonians do worse in school than
albanians
I don't care
I don't care at all not even a little
bit
I care about every one of those
individuals though
and I'm pretty sure that they could all
succeed
despite racism if they all do the same
things that everybody does so here's the
thing I can't get past
no matter who you are if you do the
right things in America you get a good
outcome
stay out of jail stay off drugs don't
get married too early you know don't
have a kid out of wedlock
easy stuff develop some skills become
useful
right there's nobody who does it a
different way it's all the same way and
everybody has access to it
so if you tell me that black Americans
are doing poorly
I don't care
let me say it again if you tell me black
Americans are doing poorly I don't care
at all
I used to because I used to think that
was the right way to approach the issue
now I can see that that fails every time
because you end up just arguing about
statistics and it's just after
a while
because you can make any argument with
data and when you're talking about a
group of people it's always a data
argument right all data arguments are
false
in 2023
. so if there were a way to know the
data was accurate
then maybe I'd say okay maybe you should
look at groups because that data is
accurate and if you have accurate data
you might actually be able to figure out
things that make things better but if
you know you don't have accurate data
and never will
and you know that the the way Society is
organized is that helping classes of
people just creates more problems which
it does in 2023 then it only makes sense
to shift your frame from how to help
people who have something weird in
common
largely yeah it's largely a conceptual
thing they have in common you move from
that frame to do I have a neighbor who
needs a hand
is there somebody I know who's a victim
of racism
could I do something about it could I
teach them how to be immune could I hire
them and make sure that they had a job
and then they don't care so much yeah
they're probably a million ways you can
help an individual
and I'm all about that so if you're if
you're a white individual and you can
help a black individual or any other
kind of individual yeah do that do that
but if somebody says my group is doing
poorly compared to your group yeah
them
just don't even get interested
just say yeah that's interesting
philosophical point that has no interest
to me
you know it doesn't affect my life
so that's the the change I'd like to see
as we transition from the
um is really a scam
sort of a scam to imagine that you
should compare groups and then make
policy based on that in 2023. I do think
historically it always made sense
because the problems were the bigger
type where the Discrimination was you
know built into the legal system or it
was reverberated from the past in such
an obvious way but once you get to the
point where a hundred percent of
individuals can succeed
if they just do the basic things that
everybody who succeeds does
then stop talking about groups
at that point you're just making things
worse
so no interest no interest in what white
people or black people or any other
group is doing
so which part of that do you think will
be taken out of context
so somebody's already clipping this you
know it like oh I got that far I got
that part where he said he doesn't care
about black people
right of course that'll be out of
context
because I didn't say that
uh if you're listening
I said I care deeply about people
people like an actual human I care about
that I want them to all to do well
I don't care about an artificial
grouping oh my artificial grouping did
better than your artificial grouping I
don't care
how did any individual do
all right
too much on that
um
Jonathan Turley continuing to be a
National Treasure writing about legal
stuff the the stuff he writes I just
don't see anywhere else
it just I think I feel like all of his
takes are just better than
other people's takes
are you having the same impression
like I don't know why one person could
consistently say things that when I read
it you know I'm not a lawyer so I'm I'm
doing my best but when he talks I always
say oh that sounds totally right that's
exactly how you should look at this
thing
so he was talking about uh Democrat
representative Goldman
who is trying to make the hunter Biden
whistleblower from the IRS he was trying
to you know take the best out of him and
degrade his argument so there's a
whistleblower
who says that the name shapley who says
that the Hunter Biden investigations
were impeded and slow walked and he
gives specific examples of how it was
impeded and you know what what was
slowed down and it's very compelling
right is one person's testimony but it's
under oath
he's public
and he was exactly the right person to
see it firsthand
so as firsthand under oath
that's pretty strong
right yeah that is that's pretty strong
and also I believe
um backed up by other witnesses can
somebody give me a fact check on that
the the latest whistleblower uh shapley
or shapely uh is it not true that we
have other public whistled lowers who
say the same thing there's there's more
than one right
is that true
yeah okay I'm getting confirmation
there's more than one all right so
you're now at the highest level of
credibility the highest level
people who sought themselves have the
same story
put their own skin in the game became
whistleblowers this is not good for them
they're not going to benefit from this
and did it publicly
in front of the world
can you repeat that
that that's pretty that's pretty serious
but here's what uh uh Jonathan Turley
points out so Goldman was trying to get
to the fact that whatever Hunter did
business-wise there was no evidence that
he had talked to his father
all right so Goldman is trying to
establish in our Public's mind that yeah
maybe Hunter did some stuff but his
father wasn't aware of the business
dealings part of it
and then he asked that question and
shapley uh
tells them that no actually we do have
proof that the father knew about it
he had very specific evidence
of the father knowing about at least
some of the business deals which uh
which Joe Biden continues to deny as
Turley points out
and what uh Charlie was mocking Goldman
for was uh you know the you probably
know this the the lawyer
kind of code or rule is that you never
ask a question in court if you don't
know the answer have you heard that it's
like the number one rule of being a
lawyer
don't ask that question if you don't
know what the answer is going to be
because he asked the question think he
would go his way and it turned out to be
the most damning thing for Joe Bryden in
the history of the Republic
for the first time
a witness under oath
who was an eyewitness and had other
people watching who agree
said that Joe Biden lied and he was
aware of these dealings it's like the
biggest thing in the world and a
representative Goldman is the one who
surfaced it and he was trying to hide it
so the guy trying to hide it is the one
who surfaced it and probably blew the so
so Jonathan Jolie at the end of his
threat he's talking about this he puts a
picture of Dresden
now
I Dresden after World War II
now if you don't know the reference of
course this isn't funny but Dresden was
a German City there was fire bombed into
complete ruination it was just it was
just burned until it was just Rubble the
whole city and
uh that that was uh
that was turley's interpretation of the
Democrats uh case that Goldman had
turned their own case into Dresden
it was good writing so good writing good
imagery
I love Turley
all right Apple says they're coming out
with their own AI
um no surprise
one could assume that they're a little
late but they're Apple so you know Apple
can hire the best and
catch up pretty quickly I would think
but what do you think about the fact
that this would be in my opinion the
first big thing since jobs
uh there was the Apple watch and I guess
that's successful but it's not like you
know it's not like iPhone successful but
it's successful
so that was the best they've done since
jobs is the uh the watch
but now they're going to do AI
don't you think AI would disrupt their
entire business model
like I don't even know if the App Store
makes sense if you have ai if it's the
right kind
so
I think this is such a big
um moment for Apple
that I don't know if they have the right
people there but we'll find out
I mean jobs picked Tim Cook so I mean
jobs picked them so he must know
something that I don't know but we'll
see uh we'll see if Apple can pull off
turning AI into something you all want
without destroying their own company
uh because it looks like it would
cannibalize the iPhone but I don't know
and when I say that I mean that the
whole iPhone ecosystem is that third
parties make apps and you buy the apps
and use them on the phone but I think AI
is going to make apps
no longer necessary
because in theory you could just tell
your AI to become any app you wanted it
would just become it on the fly it could
code itself into that app
right yeah the the things that couldn't
do is maybe do a dating app because
that's more about the network effect so
there might be some Network effects that
can't copy but it could if you didn't
have an app on your phone for math
you didn't have a calculator you could
just say the AI all right give me a
calculator
the codes it and presents it on the
screen just because you wanted it right
because that's that would be like an
easy thing to code in real time so it
would just appear but there would be no
app
likewise if you want to do a spreadsheet
you just say uh all right do my do my
budget and a spreadsheet would appear
but it would have no app for a
spreadsheet it would just know that
that's what you wanted it was sort of
coded on the Fly and keep it live
so for anything that doesn't have a
network effect you say LinkedIn
something like that I would think those
apps will just go away
so what's that do to their whole
business model
I don't know so that's the sort of thing
I think is Steve Jobs might have a
chance of figuring out but maybe uh an
apple corporate you know just keeping
the model moving kind of people maybe
not the right people
but we'll find out
now I'm for the longest time I've been
confused as to why the s-i-r-i product
on the iPhone and I'm spelling it so I
don't trigger your your phones I've been
wondering why it's so bad
like it's really bad
I bet barely the the only thing I could
use it for successfully is setting my
alarm
yeah over time I used to try to use it a
lot because I thought I'd get the hang
of it and it would maybe understand me
better or I would give the better
commands and it would just get better
over time but it got worse
I I got to the point where the only
thing I'm willing to do is set my alarm
or my timer basically that's it
everything else I assume it's going to
take 15 tries it's not a good understand
me you know you ever try sending it
sending a voice text
it's just a nightmare because it's
writing stuff that you didn't want it to
write and then you're like oh God what
do I do
um
yeah timer that's about it
all right ladies and gentlemen
that
concludes my amazing presentation for
the day best live stream you've ever
seen in your whole life everybody's
saying it everybody say
is there anything I missed
proposed UAP disclosure
um I have no interest in the UFO stuff
because it's not real
so no I'm not interested in a new
hearing about a thing that isn't real
photographs
or it's not real no don't give me your
grainy photographs of a Tic Tac and a
and a fly on your camera
nope don't care
all right use AI to resurrect Steve Jobs
that would be funny
or if K is testifying on C-Span about
what big Pharma
oh uh threads have you spent any time on
threads
how many of you
um let me ask you this way how many of
you are using threads
more today than you were last week so if
you're using it is there anybody who's
using it more today than last week
foreign
I stopped even thinking I have it I
actually forgot I had it
it's completely
completely uh off my radar
I thought about using it just to promote
things on Twitter
but I don't have enough followers so
there's no point in doing that either
the one thing I thought I might use it
for just promoting my other things it's
not even that
oh you want oh I knew what I was going
to do
all right I just want to be I just want
to be a jerk
for entertainment purposes all right I'm
going to open threads now I told you
that when I brought over the people I
follow from Instagram
I did not get the Illuminati but rather
I got people who look good in pictures
but then they came over here and they
started tweeting
um
so I'm going to read you some of the
insightful
um tweets or here's one so here's the
here's the kind of uh thinker I was
bringing over from Instagram I won't
tell you who it's just you know some
attractive person
here's a here's a threads post
fun fact I love riding bikes what's the
hobby you love to do
so so I'm glad I signed up for threats
because I would have missed that one I
would have missed that one but there are
others
um actually Jordan Peterson's tweeting
there so some of these actually make
sense
uh or here's another one from one of the
influencers from Instagram over on
threads when in doubt eat chicken and
rice
okay you know when in doubt eat chicken
and rice that's a good post here's
another one
uh straight from the airport to the gym
just hitting the essentials today to
tackle the full leg day after this week
well you know I woke up this morning I
was wondering about this influencer's
leg day I was like what day of the week
is is leg day and and do you do it on
the way back from the airport
this is threads
that's threads now does anybody have the
same experience you go to threads and
it's just influencers who can't who
can't make sentences
all right now I'm going to do the same
thing I'm going to go to Twitter
yeah this is this will be a biased
presentation
all right so I'm just going to pick just
a random tweet all right just just I'll
just pick a random tweet on Twitter
um
AI progress doesn't sleep at night new
information about state-of-the-art
speech recognition
um
something about Rhonda santis you know
blah blah blah it was good stuff uh
something about
the century and records of you know heat
records basically it's all fun stuff
it's all like really smart people
saying really smart stuff all day long
on Twitter
and I go to threads as just it's all
your C plus students
who have been forced to write things and
they're not happy about it
that's what it feels like it feels like
the threads is all the C plus students
uh
what
DC's Union Station is empty
[Applause]
I can't be real
that doesn't feel real I don't know what
that's about
all right
um that's all I got for you today and I
will go
um would you trust a picture of a UFO if
somebody said they saw it now
I wouldn't all right YouTube thanks for
joining bye for now
