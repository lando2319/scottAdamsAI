good morning everybody and welcome

it's called the simultaneous Sip and it
happens now go
ah we are now bonded We Are One
whatever you think I think whatever you
feel I feel
ow stop it
all right now let's get on with this
um if you are not aware and you should
be there is an excellent podcast
featuring me as a guest with gnome
dwarman and Coleman Hughes
I think both of them are going to have
it available but if you look at my
Twitter feed you can find the link or
just go to YouTube and search for
Coleman Hughes and I think you'll find
it
people are saying it's good I'm hearing
good things about it so you might like
it you might also like at some point
today I'll give you a link to my
conversation with Mike Mandel
and his his partner Chris and we'll talk
about hypnosis no politics
it's my first podcast with no politics I
think I don't think I've ever done one
before but no Politics on that one just
talking about hypnosis
I think you're gonna like that one a lot
actually
so let's talk about the fake news
[Music]
so um
it's an article in Wall Street Journal
by Tim Higgins
and he's talking about how Tim Cook was
in a
in an awkward position
um
because uh the iPhone maker continues
to carry the X platform as an app and
people are saying hey why are you doing
that
but here's I don't care about that part
of the story so much as uh the
introduction says that
um
well let me read it let's say the uh
chief executive Apple chief executive
was asked on CBS News Sunday morning why
the iPhone maker continues to advertise
on musk's Twitter turned X
even as listen to this Jewish civil
rights organization raises concern about
hateful speech on the social media
platform
so if you saw the Wall Street Journal
that the acts platform was
um let's see even as a Jewish civil
rights organization raised concern about
hateful speech you'd be pretty worried
about that wouldn't you wow
how would you like the Wall Street
Journal to write that your product
is something that a Jewish rights
organization has raised concern about
all the hate that's pretty bad do you
know who the organization is
they don't mention that right away
they they start without mentioning the
name of the organization they do mention
it later
it's the ADL
now don't you think that a story like
this
should also include
that the ADL is being sued for being a
tool of the Democrat Party that they use
as a an attack dog
don't you think that's the biggest part
of the story the biggest part of the
story is that the ADL is a Democrat
attack dog organization that's you being
used to suppress free speech
how's that not the first paragraph
no the first paragraph is that there's a
a Jewish rights organization that's
raising concerns
yeah
I I'm pretty sure that if it were the
KKK they would have mentioned that right
away
oh there's a group that's protesting
who is it who is the group
oh we'll mention that later but we just
need you to know that there's a group
that's really against them there's a
group protesting but who who are we
there's a group protesting
the KKK
um if you don't mention that the ADL is
a thoroughly disgraced organization that
has a political motive first and
secondarily
probably trying to help some people too
that's complete fake news that's the
Wall Street Journal
all right
um
here's another story that I was worried
I might be in but I'm not sometimes I
have to read stories to find out if I'm
in them it's like oh oh I
might be in this one it's a weird part
of my life but anyway there's a story by
David ransomen in some publication that
I didn't care about I didn't care enough
about it to write it down was it
the guardian maybe I don't know but
since I'm in publication and what David
ransoman did was he followed the same
people that Elon Musk follows
so he wanted to find out you know who's
influencing Elon Musk what is Elon Musk
you know what is he interested in what's
he tweeting and stuff because that's
that would be like a way to get into his
head now apparently you can do this with
Elon Musk in a way you can't do it with
some other people because he only
follows 400 some people which is a
manageable number
uh Others May follow tens of thousands
so other famous people anyway
um
but one of the statements in here is
that David found out by looking at all
the people that Elon Musk follows that
Elon Musk is not following anyone who
and I'll put this in quotes makes a
serious case for liberalism
so musk doesn't follow anyone nobody
there's not a single person on that list
of 400 or more people who quote makes a
serious case for liberalism
do you know what other list
also does not include anybody who makes
a serious case for a liberalism
the list of all the people in the world
[Laughter]
one person who has an argument for
liberalism
I don't believe I've ever heard it
because
do you think Soros makes a case for
liberalism he's the he's the very person
who doesn't
he says what he's trying to do
but does he make an argument for it I've
never seen it he just says what he's
trying to do
I've never seen an argument
so I'm actually curious
no no Bernie doesn't make an argument he
just says what he wants
he says what's wrong with the current
system and then he says what he wants
that's not an argument
that's just what you want
I've never even seen an argument for
liberalism because in my view an
argument for liberalism would be an
argument against
A system that had human incentives as a
key variable
so who can how would anybody defend that
it's an indefensible position
because liberalism gets you to socialism
that gets you away from any kind of
competitive free market situation which
is the only thing that's ever worked
all right
so if you ever hear of anybody who has a
defense serious case of Defending
liberalism well I'd love to know who
that is I'll follow them right away
because I will be quite a feat to pull
that off
and by the way liberalism is different
from
you know wanting everybody to have a
good life I want everybody to have a
good life
I'm not sure that's liberalism
all right uh so apple is removing the
Andrew Tate app
called the real world portal
and they're removing it because somebody
complained
um I think some people who consider
themselves victims of him in the past
complained
that it the app encourages misogyny and
there's evidence to suggest it is an
illegal pyramid scheme
so they pulled it
they pulled it because someone else
thinks it encourages misogyny do you
think there were examples
do you know what else encourages
misogyny
every social media platform
can you name a platform that doesn't
encourage both misogyny misandry
misendrie you know discrimination
against men hatred against men and also
the opposite of those which is don't do
any of that
there are plenty of there are plenty of
places yeah PornHub
is that a reason to take a nap down
so all you have to do is accuse somebody
and they lose their free speech
so that the Tates can't have free speech
and they can't even have an app because
somebody complained that it might be a
problem then it might be a problem not
that it is
that this is an important distinction
nobody says it is a problem
they said it might be
and it got pulled
do you think that that's political or is
that just business
well
that doesn't look like business to me
it's business in the sense that they
don't want to Anchor their you know
Apple doesn't want to anger their their
customers
but I can't imagine that they would have
made this decision for
you know for safety reasons it just to
me it looks like it's political
because most things do look these days
um Andy no
uh was trying to do some speaking
engagements and got canceled first at
the Commonwealth club and then at uh I
guess the Marriott Hotel
in West forced the Westin Richmond I
guess that must be the parent company uh
to cancel the speaking event because
antifa complained
antifa complained
not because of what he said
but that they didn't like what he might
say
and then he got canceled
so Andy Noe doesn't have free speech
entertain doesn't have free speech
because people are afraid of what they
might say
yeah
so that's happening
um
let's talk about that F-35 pilot now
there's a
there's a 911 call which is pretty
fascinating if you haven't heard it
because I guess the downed pilot who is
uh sounds male
to answer one one of your conspiracy
theories was the pilot might be female
but it's a male voice so I'm assuming
it's a male
um
but claims he was flying at two thousand
feet
and was forced to eject to due to an
aircraft failure
so what makes it an aircraft failure if
it can still fly for 60 miles or 80
miles
what kind of so we we have more
questions than we have answers what kind
of failure is that now two thousand feet
is pretty low isn't it
is there a pilot there's always a pilot
watching
two thousand feet is kind of low right
you got three to five thousand would be
a pretty good altitude for a plane
so so that answers one question so one
of the questions is it might be that he
was more likely to eject
because it was low to the ground
relatively low to the ground
so I would I would re I would eject
faster
if I'm low to the ground on just a
little bit of trouble I wouldn't wait
for like I wouldn't wait for a
catastrophic trouble but if I were at
five thousand feet maybe I'd wait to see
if it's catastrophic see if there's
anything I can do to correct it so that
so so we're at least hearing things that
are starting to make sense
which is some kind of mechanical problem
and he wasn't flying that high
so getting out probably was the right
call I don't know for sure I don't know
what they're you know I don't want the
procedures are exactly but so far
so far it sounds like a mechanical
problem
that doesn't mean it was hacked it could
have been ordinary so we don't know that
yet
all right here are some things we've
realized lately
that now these are the things that make
me wonder how in the world
could Democrats win elections and it's
because they don't see the news but here
are some things we know
black lives matter was always a scam
would you agree it was a financial scam
at least by the leaders
now
I have to tell you I heard that early on
from members of Black lives matter so I
knew this
I knew this and I don't know
whenever it started practically
so we know now that although many many
of the people who marched were of course
sincere that the organization was a
Financial scam now we're hearing charges
that Ibrahim Kennedy and his anti-racism
Center might be also either poorly run
or a financial scam because there's
money missing and nothing good happened
uh we're also finding out that uh
Biden's relationship with Ukraine is
almost certainly the worst case scenario
that he was in fact crooked
um is still crooked and extracted a lot
of money through a sketchy situation
so that looks to be exactly what it
looked like
uh teachers unions we now know are not
for the benefit of children we can see
quite clearly that they're the benefit
of each other and the benefit of the
leader of the teachers union
being politically active probably
looking for higher offices my guess
so we know that the teachers unions are
not working for the benefit of children
or parents or families or anything like
that we know the ADL is a political hit
job and no longer no longer the
respected organization that they once
were
we know that all these cancellations
we're seeing are political
because they tend to be one-sided
so we've seen the politics take down
Tucker Russell Brand they're going after
Portnoy they went after musk they went
after Trump they went after me they went
after Roseanne
and we can see now that the pattern is
pretty clear
and we also know that the way the
cancellations work is that the Democrats
are very cleverly and I have to give
them credit for this put Democrats in
charge of all kinds of organizations
and they could be Watchdog organizations
or fact-checking organizations but they
were think tanks but it gives the
impression that there's lots of external
people who agree with the the Democrat
message
and maybe not
so that now the cancellation
um let's say
superstructure is designed to cancel
people on one side of the aisle and it
works really well
so they can they can you know use these
organizations to go after the platforms
the platforms cave and they just cancel
everybody that they need to cancel to
get on with business
so we know now that the cancellations
are part of a you know an organized
political
feature of our country and not not any
kind of organic anything
we know that the reason Tick Tock is not
banned is because there's a billionaire
donor
to Republicans
so that's on the Republicans
we know that there's no progress in
defeating the cartels or fentanyl
because apparently there's somebody
powerful in our country who doesn't want
the cartels to be defeated
presumably that's the CIA
don't know that but you know that's how
yeah if we knew it for sure then it
would be a bad job by the CIA I guess
but I evidently there's no interest in
closing the Border by somebody powerful
enough to keep it open
so we don't know who exactly but there's
somebody with enough power
to keep the American Border open
who the hell is that
who has that much power
I don't know
don't know
um we know from the Twitter files that
everything you thought about censorship
was real
that the platforms were in fact
censoring still doing it you know not
all of them but still doing it we know
that's real
and probably nothing you can do about it
ever
uh what else we know we know that this
Bob Menendez
who's now being charged with being a big
old crook
he had the committee job that Joe Biden
used to have
which is can you tell me the name of
Menendez what was his job it was a
Foreign Relations he was the chairman of
the foreign intelligence foreign
intelligence
so if you're the chairman of the foreign
intelligence group apparently it's
really easy to get other countries to
bribe you
because you're sort of the perfect
person to bribe
so Menendez is being accused of taking
gold bars and big piles of cash and
envelopes and for the benefit of Egypt
and maybe for the benefit of some
Egyptian American
um entrepreneurs
do you know what's wrong with that story
did you see all the obvious evidence
that Bob Menendez is bad it's like
really obvious
like super super obvious that it's all
true
here's one of the pieces of evidence
that we're told they found
not only did they find gold bars
in in the home in the safe that's pretty
damning
but they found cash in envelopes lots of
it like just all over the house big
piles of cash but the funniest one is
that there were two different
windbreakers that actually had Bob
Menendez name on it
and the cash was in the pocket in an
envelope
two jackets they had his name on it his
name on it
with piles of cash in them
does that sound real to you
I'm sorry you lost me on this one no no
there's no way that that they
found two jackets with his name
on it that had piles of cash in the
pockets
right now I'm no bribe taker but I know
if I were a bribe taker I would take the
big piles of money out of the pockets of
my windbreaker
apparently he has a safe
he has a safe but he keeps the big piles
of money and a thing with his name on it
in the closet that's what we're told to
believe
now I do believe that he's bad
I do believe that he's crooked
I don't believe that the evidence they
found was all real he looks like he was
set up but also crooked would you agree
does it look to you like the Biden
Administration took him out
it looks like the Biden Administration
took him out
why don't know
could have been any reason but he looks
like he is guilty but also set up to
make sure that there's no doubt about
him getting put away
do you also know that they've had the
goods on him for a year and he stayed in
his job
they've had the goods on him for a year
and he stayed in his job
they had a foreign intelligence the big
bribe job you stay there
well it could be that they were that
somebody was leaning on him and then he
wasn't doing what they wanted so they
said all right I guess we can't block
blackmail you anymore so we'll just take
you there that's what it looks like
there's no way to know what really
happened but this is what it looks like
so it looks crooked
it looks crooked
but so does he
now do you think
there's any chance that Biden wasn't
doing the same thing when he was in the
same job it was literally the primary
bribery job
no the Biden crime organization is
exactly what it looks like
and probably the Menendez operation was
exactly what it looked like
now do you think those are the two
crooked people in Congress and the rest
are pretty good
no it looks like maybe most of Congress
is taking huge cash payments
not not all
but maybe all the people in the key jobs
because most of the Congress people
don't really make any difference except
one vote
so it's probably the people in the key
jobs are all crooked at this point
probably all crooked both sides I guess
right um Berkeley Law School
um had hosted an author
and the big problem that Berkeley law
school is that they don't have enough
black
students or faculty
but the funny part is
that the administration is being blamed
for that
as if the administration were not the
most liberal and concerned about
diversity in the entire planet Earth
there was nothing that Berkeley could do
to avoid their own trap which is if
you're the complaining people
and you attract more complaining people
they're going to complain about you
that's unavoidable
if you if you're if your admissions
requirements are not Merit but rather to
bring in more complaining people
what do you expect is going to happen
exactly this
exactly this
what was the name of the author Heather
McDonald
no Heather
Heather McDonald right
and I guess she's got a new book out
this sounds interesting but she does she
does a good job of not walking into any
racist traps you know she doesn't say
anything that's obviously racist
um while explaining that how could
colleges possibly have diversity
when the pipeline is empty
so she says if you look at the people
that high schools are producing
where are all the applicants that we're
supposed to be pulling from to get us
diversity in college they don't exist
the mathematically you could not make
them diverse unless you lowered your
standards so much that it would destroy
the Enterprise
which is what they're choosing to do
they're going to choose to lower the
standards until the value of the
um the value of the degree is
basically worthless
that's the actual plan
because they can't drop they can't drop
their you know diversity standard so
instead they're going to destroy the
school
and it seems obvious and unavoidable
what else is going to happen what else
could happen there's no other
possibility
so liberalism is eating them from the
inside
um
let's talk about uh
Newsome Governor Newsom vetoed a bill
that came to his desk
so if he if he'd signed it it would have
been law but he vetoed it was the this
assassin double negative City it was a
law that would have said in California
if one of your parents does not affirm
your gender choice
that that would be taken into
consideration when custody decisions are
made
so if you had for example a divorce
couple and the father said I do not
accept your gender identification child
you are what you were born and the
mother says no no the child is what the
child says they are then the mother
would get custody in all likelihood if
all all other things being equal and
here's the story
news and feet of that
it was the most you know Lefty looking
thing you've ever seen in your life and
Newsome who many people say is eyeing
the top job knew that that was way too
far you wouldn't have a chance you
wouldn't have a chance of winning a
national election if you were to prove
that thing
now who knows why he really thought
about it but uh I'd like to think
that when it came down to politics
versus parenting that he is a parent
himself
I'd like to think
that he vetoed it as a parent
and it wasn't even political
I'd like to think that
but it also was conveniently very
political for running for higher office
all right let's talk about
backwards science
there's an article by Rebecca traister
in the
writing for the cut
cut c-u-t cut
don't add any letters there because
you're that's not funny no add any
letters to that it's just cut c u t and
um
she makes a case that I've made which is
that uh marriage is not the cause of
happiness happiness is the cause of
marriage and that once again we get
cause and effect backwards so this is
what I've been saying for a while
exactly if you had an e to cut it's cute
so don't add the E because then that
would change cut to cute so no added
letters
um
so what do you think of that
how many of you would agree
that happy people are more likely to get
married
and make it work because they're both
happy and that
unhappy people are less likely to get
married
because who wants to marry an unhappy
person
seems like a bad play
right yeah now here's my uh addition to
the conversation
I believe that word thinking which I'll
Define
is destroying civilization
word thinking now what word thinking is
is the way AI forms its simulated
intelligence it takes words that have
been spoken in some patterns before
and then it reproduces those patterns
and when we deal with it it seems like
intelligence to us you know but all it
is is word
you know frequency patterns
now I believe that that is also how
humans think mostly we use words in
place of reason
marriage is one of those words and boy
are we making a mistake with that
because a hundred years ago if you said
marriage
it meant something almost entirely
different than it means today
but we use the same word
it's the same word but it's a completely
different system
so if somebody says to you hey is
marriage good
your brain is already tuned from
hundreds of hundred years of
civilization that marriage is always
good it's the goal of Life get married
have kids right so the word carries the
reasons
do you understand that we we don't get
married because we thought it out we got
married because the word itself carries
the argument as soon as you're married
you're like well yeah that's good good
for civilization you know maybe I have
to find the right person but I'm
certainly not going to argue with the
fact that this word
marriage has been good for a hundred
years so it must still be good because
the word we have a word for it and the
Word was always good before
but what's happened
is that the system we call marriage is
entirely different
but we brought with it the things
associated with the word which is our
good feelings that that's how you
protect the world and civilization and
the economy and happiness and everything
else
now
many of you are going to say but but
Scott I know people who got married and
they're happy they did of course
because people are very different so you
could find somebody who's happy in every
system even the worst system in the
world you're going to find somebody who
likes it because we're all so different
my guess is no more than 25 percent of
marriages make sense
all right because you know you got that
rare combination of people married at
the right time you know they are the
right people they both were there for
the same reason there they have the
ability to have fights without making a
permanent you know very somewhat rare
qualities it's hard to find one person
who can do any of that
to find two of them
and that they're both attracted
is really hard so 25 is probably
generous so here's here's my take
I don't think we should be saying
marriage yes or no
that is word thinking
we should be looking for how to build a
system that does work produces children
produces love produces some kind of
commitment but also protects people if
they find themselves in an abusive
marriage or something so you've got to
have all the protections
of being able to leave but with all the
security
of knowing that you're not going to die
if you do
so I don't have a right answer I just
think that if we think of it as marriage
or not marriage we don't have a chance
because what used to be marriage just
doesn't exist anymore and pretending we
could go back to it is crazy in my
opinion this is the biggest blind spot
for conservatives
conservatives want to use wishful
thinking to take Society back to some
some time that doesn't exist and we can
never go back to it where marriage made
a lot more sense
is purely wishful thinking there's no
there's no mechanism to get there
there's no system there's no there's no
way to move backwards moving backwards
in that way I mean that would be a
radical move backwards there's no path
for that
you can't tweak the taxes to make people
get married
right there's so much that has changed
since marriage made sense
that the conservative view that you just
have to want to get married more and
everything will be fine
oh there's no problem with black America
they just need to you know stick with
their husbands it just needs to stay
married that is like the biggest blind
spot in politics to imagine that that's
a thing that you just have to want it
more oh I think I'll just think
differently and now I'll suddenly it
makes sense to get married
people don't get married because it
doesn't make sense
people get divorced because divorcing
does make sense in many cases
right
so as much as your wishful thinking
would like marriage to be a good
institution is not and nobody has an
idea how to make it one
so there you go it's the same problem
with antifa basically and antifa is a
word thinking organization
they get away with bad behavior by
saying but we're the opposite of a
fascists
so
so if you're action
all right was it because I mentioned
antifa is that why I disappeared
Maybe
could be
could be
um so anyway word thinking ruining
America
um
here's another
here's another sign of how corrupt our
media is
so
there are several tweets that are using
the exact same words today Jennifer
Rubin is one of them and the exact same
tweet says here's the deal colon
Menendez resigns Clarence Thomas resigns
one standard corruption is corruption
what is that
is that logic is it politics
here's the deal Menendez resigns
Clarence Thomas resigns one standard
corruption disruption
no it's word thinking it's word thinking
the word thinking is doing the work that
reason should be doing
so what's being done is they're
comparing Menendez who's a Democrat and
apparently literally just took bribes
that's the accusation they literally
just took gold bars and bags of cash now
I have some questions about whether it's
true
but that's the allegation
Clarence Thomas the allegation against
Clarence Thomas is that he took trips
with his good friend
who was going there anyway
like you know he was going to be on the
private jet and there were extra seats
and so he brought his friend
now both of them are conservatives
do you think they were going to disagree
on anything do you think that do you
think that Clarence Thomas had to be
talked into being conservative
because his friend was also conservative
like if you look at the Clarence Thomas
issue and you say this is just like the
Menendez one corruption is corruption
one standard you're substituting words
for any kind of intelligence we're
thinking about the topic
of course they should not be treated the
same because they're very very different
but if you're Jennifer Rubin you can say
one standard corruption is corruption
well but they're very different but what
about the word is the same yeah but you
know one of them doesn't even meet the
definition of that word in my opinion
you have a word I could use the same
word for both of them but how about my
argument that I could use the same word
and that's what qualifies
as political thought
tried to make people accept your word
do you ever see that ever see that
effect with the gender stuff
it's very simple people
uh our trans women women
and we're done
oh oh don't give me your details
hold on hold on
it's clear it's simple are trans women
women
yes or no yes or no and if you say no
you're a bigot and I have to cancel you
so is it yes or no yes or no
which is it yes or no am I going to
cancel you or do you just agree with me
because I'm a bully
yes or no
so you've seen that right you've seen
the people who try to win the argument
by making you accept a definition of a
word
that you think is absurd
right so when you see word thinking
don't participate
they're making you think past the sale
if you get into a conversation about the
definition of the word woman which by
the way Matt Walsh falls into if they
can get you to debate the word
you're in the wrong conversation
here's a way to handle that
well you know people use different words
for things but let's talk about the
things we all agree on
who who's going to say no to that no no
no you have to agree on the word well
could you agree that the word is sort of
the labels we put on stuff it's not
really the reasoning
yeah the word is just a label so let's
just not label it because we're looking
at the same thing
we're looking at the same individual and
we can describe that individual the same
so there's no disagreement it's just
let's not put a label on the person
let's just talk about you know what
works and what doesn't work
that's the way you deal with word
thinking if somebody's trying to win
with a word
just back off and say okay I don't argue
words now have you seen me do this
has anybody seen me do that in public
and how it just completely shuts down
the argument on the other side
you've probably seen me in podcasts when
somebody will say can you speak to this
or that and I'll say something like well
I don't argue about definitions
but we all see the same situation so
here's what I think about the situation
totally disarms anybody who's a word
thinker because they don't expect it
people expect you to take the bait and
argue a definition of a word and then
you're already lost you know you're
playing a game that you can't win
so just argue what makes sense not what
labels
all right
um
I made this tweet
that was one sentence and as of this
morning it had two million views
one of them included Elon Musk
um
who just had a one-word affirmative
statement about it but here's the
sentence
there's a generation of males coming who
won't put up with the
now I didn't really Define what the
 is but everybody knows I didn't
have to Define it because everybody
knows
and
the reason there are two million views
on this and so many likes and retweets
is that it's observably true
young men
are not falling for the brainwashing
yeah the rest of society either has to
fall for the brainwashing or they have
to pretend they fell for it so they
don't get canceled if you are an adult
male you are completely neutered by the
system
because the system
as I described earlier on has created a
whole bunch of organizations and domains
that are staffed by people who are
primarily political but they're going to
pretend that they're fighting for
justice and Equity but really it's a
political point of view and so they can
cancel any adult male
who calls on
so the system will punish all adult
males so that takes out of the
conversation any adult male who wants a
job
right
right people like Dave Portnoy
luckily he already has his money so what
you're finding is that the only people
who have free speech
are people who already made enough money
that they can take the hit
what do these people have in common
let me read those names again
Tucker Carlson Russell Brand Dave port
and I Elon Musk Donald Trump and me and
Roseanne what do we all have in common
we all had enough money
so that we could survive having free
speech
and boy did they come for us they came
for us hard it costs a lot of money
right it's very expensive
the average person cannot cannot afford
Free Speech not even close
and it's pretty expensive for me I mean
you know they they come at you pretty
hard
so
what what could save us
the only thing that could save us is
young men who do not already have
something to lose
young men who don't go to college
are the only way we get out of this
because the men are going to have to
call on it because they can see
his it's bad for them it's bad
for the world it's bad for the country
and they're gonna
they're gonna call on it and
here's the thing
if the Democrats are sure that they want
to raise your children let's say you are
because most of my most my audience
leaves right so would you agree that the
situation we're in is at the the left
the Democrats would like to have a lot
of control over how you most of you
being right-leaning over how you raise
your kids that's that's like the main
texture of
social anxiety right now is who's
raising your kids and the Democrats want
to raise your kids the way they want to
raise them they want to simonize the
boys and they want to basically have a
you know a female oriented Society
but I don't think it's going to work
because because young men are just not
going to put up with it
they're just not going to put up with
the
so things are definitely going to change
and it will only be because of young men
with nothing to lose
so that's coming
and here's the funniest part
are you ready for this here's the punch
line
the harder the left tries to raise the
children on the right
the more Andrew Tate will be raising the
children on the left
that's exactly what's happening
Andrew Tate is your daddy
and by the way I'm not a fan I'm not a
fan of Andrew Tate so I want to make
that clear I'm not a fan I'm just
calling balls and Strikes I'm describing
a situation it's not my preference
I'm not saying it's my first choice
I'm saying it's just what's going to
happen
if you keep with adult men
we do have reinforcements
the Cavalry is definitely coming
it won't be right away I might never see
it you know maybe we have to wait half a
generation before we see it but the
Cavalry is definitely coming
and they're not going to take any
so watch out for that they're all being
raised by Andrew Tate
good luck
all right
um
let's see
here's a story that is so outrageous
that your brain will explode and the
only reason that this can happen is that
the public can't handle the complexity
of all the criminal Behavior all the
criminal stuff is just sort of hard to
understand like you really have to you
know dive in you've got to sort out wait
was that this story was that the
menendous crime story was that the Biden
crime I'm getting all my crime stories
mixed up I I can't tell who did what
anymore
but so that so this just gets slipped in
on the weekend
the Clinton Global initiative announced
that they're creating a program to
rebuild Ukraine
so the U.S is going to send the World
Bank 25 billion
and then the World Bank distributes some
of that money
to the clintons
to help rebuild the Ukraine
yeah if you hadn't heard that story
until I just said it
is your head falling off did your head
just explode
the the level of obvious graft grift
graft corruption this is such obvious in
your face public corruption that I don't
even know what to do with it
yeah this is like the big lie it's it's
such a big
corrupt play that you you're shocked
into inactivity you're like I don't
think I'm going to work on this today
I don't think I'm going to form a
you know a protest I it's just so big I
don't know what to do about this it's
sort of like it's right to your face now
not only is Biden not going to be you
know prosecuted for any of his stuff
but we're gonna throw you Menendez
because he didn't play along probably
and then we're going to put the Clinton
Foundation right back on the gravy train
in the most obvious way
as others have asked why why did this uh
Clinton Foundation go quiet during the
Trump Administration
why weren't they just as active
well the obvious reason is they didn't
have the opportunity for corruption and
as soon as the opportunity for
corruption presented itself well looks
like you're pretty active again
it's exactly what it looks like
it's exactly what it looks like
and nothing will happen because it's
only people you know who are like really
news nerds who even understand what I
just said
I mean the the general public has never
heard of that the reason is a Clinton
Foundation or that there ever was or the
or even that Biden has some potential
legal risks the average person has no
idea any of this is happening the
average person has never heard of Bob
Menendez and never will
the average voter has never heard of Bob
Menendez
and never will
never
they'll never know this happened no
matter what happens with him
the average voter will never even know
it
yeah
so that's happening
um over in Ukraine if you're looking at
the risk of uh civil of uh nuclear war
so the ukrainians got some intelligence
that there were a bunch of commanders
meeting in this one headquarters in
Crimea I guess
and it was the headquarters for the
Black Sea Fleet the Russian Fleet
and the ukrainians sent a modern
I believe American missile into that
building and blew up some generals
they may have actually killed or wounded
the head of the fleet
so some would say uh-oh escalation
coming
to which I say now
you know if if escalation was going to
cause uh nuclear war I think it would
have happened by now I I feel like
I feel like we could escalate a lot
as long as it's happening in that
Battlefield I don't think we could
escalate on Russian territory much more
than you know the drones but probably
probably we could escalate a lot without
nuclear war I mean I wouldn't take the
chance I'm not I'm not recommending it
seems pretty risky but in all likelihood
there could be plenty more escalation
before
uh before there's a nuclear war so the
thing is that Russia knows that one nuke
is the end of Russia
would you say that's a fair statement
one nuke
one nuke is the end of Russia
now they don't know that for sure and I
don't know that for sure but that would
be the calculation they'd be looking at
so if you think that just because one
building in Crimea blew up and some
generals died
that that Putin who is completely
rational as far as I can tell you think
he would just destroy Russia
because Ukraine got one building with
some Generals in it
I don't think there's any chance of that
in fact I can't even imagine what would
make Putin want to die and kill
everybody he knows and all of his family
members because that's what would happen
if he used a nuke
well here's another surprising thing
Bill Gates came out publicly and said
that climate change isn't going to kill
you and that the news has gone too far
in the alarmism
Bill Gates
Bill Gates
yeah Bill Gates said the climate
alarmism is out of control but he also
says
to be fair he says it's out of control
in both directions he says the world
acts like it's either going to end or
there's no problem at all he says both
of them are stupid
because what we have is a manageable
problem
that we need to pay attention to
managing
now he might be a little bit wrong on
that too depending on who you're talking
to but at least he's in the he's in the
sensible range would you agree
would you agree that that opinion is in
the even if you disagree with it you can
disagree with it but it's certainly in
the sensible domain of reasoned people
now it could be also be as Investments
That you know push it in a certain
direction
yeah
he's big on fourth generation nuclear
which might be the entire solution to
everything
so he's got that going for him
so all right let's let's do a review
we have the Berkeley law school learning
that wokeness will destroy the Berkeley
Law School
right and I'm sure they've noticed
we we see that Berkeley in general their
entire value of their degree
will be destroyed by wokeness
we've seen that even Governor Newsom
cannot go along with taking the control
away from parents and putting it with
the state
over the control of your own children
even even Newsom couldn't go that far
Bill Gates as I just said does not join
the alarmists
he says let's let's shoot for this
manageable middle which is almost
exactly my opinion
that's pretty close to exactly my
opinion and I would say would be the
opinion of maybe close to like a Michael
schellenberger he's not that far off
from schellenberger they would have some
differences but in both cases they would
say let's manage it it's it's not in
it's not imaginary
but we can manage it
so that's good
um
I think that we all have seen at least
the people paying attention that the
entire news business is fake remember
when Trump started saying the news was
fake
and you thought to yourself well
some of it a little bit
yeah I could see that it'll light
they're biased So when you say fake you
mean biased right that's sort of what I
thought
but it turns out it's all fake
it's actually just made up you
know the the political stuff is all made
up
and at the very least it's spun in a
direction that makes it fake even if
even if the details are right
is still spun in a way that turns
correct things into fake things
so the news is fake
the major members of our government at
the moment are
demonstrably obviously and observably
corrupt like in the worst possible way
and that's all true
so the news is completely fake the the
entire constellation of entities like
the ADL and the splc and the think tanks
all fake
all fake
the cancellations all political meaning
fake they're not being canceled for you
know any reason and you can tell that
the cancellations are fake
because the entire right-leading part of
the country didn't cancel anybody
at least in terms of the individuals
people on the right boycott you know
like Bud Light but they're not canceling
people are they
so news is wrong the news is fake
the the border is open because obviously
somebody wants it open so we know that
basically the entire Gears of the
machine are obvious now we know that the
our politicians are selling their access
we know the news is fake intentionally
we know that the border is open
intentionally because whoever's in
charge could not be working for the
interest of the United States
um
and even the Ukraine war looks like a
money grab
I don't know if it is entirely
but based on all the other things it
would be hard to conclude that war is
anything but a money grab is it a
coincidence that Afghanistan wound down
at the same time Ukraine wound up when
Assange told us directly that the goal
is not to ever have peace the goal is to
have permanent War because that's how
you transfer money away from one class
of people to another
he told us that directly and because of
that you will spend the rest of his life
in jail
now you disagree with that I think I
think it's too much of an absolute but
it's directionally true
all right
um
so yeah everything you thought was was
uh
the case issue and
I think we've reached the point
where letting it play is the best play
I I think we have to let every bad
result
that came from the left just play out to
its maximum you want to you want to see
the the migrants all over the city
streets you want to see rampant crime
you want to see people moving out
because they can't stand it anymore you
want to see people not going to college
because
it's corrupt you want to see people not
watching the news because they know it's
not true
that's about where we are now
now how do you feel about the elections
integrity
given that we found out every part of
our government and our news
organizations are corrupt what do you
think about those elections pretty good
huh
all good
thank goodness the elections are all
clean
I don't know if you're watching but the
Rasmussen account
is tracking all of the allegations of
you know various uh election impropriety
now I'll I have my same opinion I've
always had which is the vast majority of
all claims will be debunked
so I don't know what's real and what
isn't but there are quite a few
interesting allegations floating around
out there that you might not be aware of
so if you're not aware of credible
allegations that if true
it would rip the lid off the whole thing
here's something that's the most basic
thing you think you would know
wouldn't don't you think you would know
if the uh if the election machines were
attached to a Wi-Fi somewhere
don't you think that's the most basic
thing you'd know hey were these machines
attached to the internet the whole time
and and there's evidence that there's at
least in one place the machines were
connected and we didn't know until now
so two years later we found out that at
least in one place there's an allegation
that machines were connected to the
Wi-Fi
how many other places could have been
connected to a Wi-Fi that you didn't
find out
yeah who knows it could be all of them
and you wouldn't even know
because nothing is true like there's no
news report you can count on there's no
news Outlet I would trust
um
so who knows who knows
so I don't think Trump could possibly
have been more right about more things
and the way they're going to take them
out is is with another hoax
if the if not kinetically
you know there's another hoax coming
it's going to be a doozy
probably about maybe some more about the
um
the the secret documents that were at
Mar-A-Lago
ask yourself this
why have we not heard
any general description of the domain of
information that was at Mar-A-Lago
why have we not heard one word about the
domain we don't need to know the details
we don't need to know the secrets
themselves
but wouldn't you like to know
if any of them had to do with say a
battle plan
or something that was current and useful
to an enemy
wouldn't you like to know that how hard
would it be to know that
it wouldn't be hard you could you could
take those documents you could put them
in a skiff
and you could say all right only the
people who have the right clearance can
see it but that would include
you know maybe a Thomas Massey
right if you let Thomas Massey look at
it and he says oh God there's some bad
stuff in there I'll believe it
I'll believe it if he tells me
right but if you just send Adam Schiff
in there and he comes out and says oh
it's nuclear secrets I'm not going to
believe any of that right but but if you
send both sides in
and at least one side says okay you know
or let's say both sides say it's bad
if you send Democrats and Republicans in
and they both say oh shoot this is bad
I'll believe that I will be willing to
believe that
but if the if the Republicans come out
and say you know it's all sort of dated
and generic stuff and maybe it was over
classified
well then I'd probably believe that
oh
all right uh
all right
both sides are against Trump well but no
matter if both sides are against Trump
there are some people that I would
believe if they told me they looked at a
document and it was or was not bad
that much I believe because even people
who are even people who are anti-trump
on the right
wouldn't lie like that
that's not exactly how somebody would
lie even if they're anti-trump that that
would be
that would be too far because someday
somebody would find out they lied and
that's that'd be pretty bad
uh
Joe Blow
yeah yes Joe Blow the the uh the one
thing that's important so Joe blow over
there on YouTube he wants to point out
that Adam Schiff is Jewish
so that that explains everything
how many people in that I talked about
today were Jewish Bob Menendez is he
Jewish the clintons I mean I just went
through a whole Litany of Bad actors and
I get I get one guy you know who
might have been to a temple once and and
you're you're all on that
your pattern recognition is
broken
um
I guess once once a day I have to go off
on the anti-semites it's becoming my new
pattern
by the way I thought it was uh pretty
smart of Elon Musk
to have met with Netanyahu
because they seem to get along really
well wouldn't you say
would you agree that Netanyahu and Musk
definitely seem like they have you know
they're on the same page right now
Netanyahu of course as one would expect
showed concern for any anti-Semitism on
the platform
which I completely agree with and but
musk agrees with him musk agrees with
them that that should be you know
something that should be against the
terms of service and should be tamped
down
so
consider the fact that the ADL
thinks musk is so bad that he must be
out of business they actually tried to
stop his business completely put him in
a business but the head of Israel
is fine with them
what does that tell you about the ADL
tells you the ADL is a is a hit group
and not representing uh certainly not
representing Israel and Israel which
should be on the same team of
representing you know Jewish people
so that should tell you something about
the ideal
and I was a pretty smart of musk to meet
with Netanyahu so publicly
so that people could observe than at
least Israel seems to be on the same
page with musk as much as possible
all right
Sydney Greenblatt is the poor man's Al
Sharpton
that joke always works
all right
um
you know somebody said something about
well I don't want to talk about that
never mind
BB graduated MIT in three years is that
true
Netanyahu is a MIT guy
really
that would make sense
he's one of the smartest people you know
one of the smartest leaders of all of
all time
let me just raw intellect he's he's got
a strong package
all right um
yeah and Massey is an MIT alum
I tell you MIT does not produce dumb
people
all right
um
he was in college when his brother was
killed
is that true not netanyahu's brother was
the only Israeli killed during the
entire raid
that's actually true
God history is weird isn't it
it just just doesn't feel like a
coincidence like that could happen
uh let me let me tell you one like that
um the town I grew up in had a ski slope
across the valley
and
uh one day when I was a teen you know we
would get discounts if you lived in the
town you get like a cheap townie ticket
so I went up there with my old wooden
skis to ski and one day I was up there
at one of the chair lifts uh broke
so I think it was the cable broke and uh
the the chairs didn't go all the way to
the ground they must have some kind of a
fail safe on them but they they dipped
drastically and then they swung back up
like a bungee cord
there was only one injury
so there was only one person on the
entire ski slope in the in that chair
lift
only one injury
it was the son of the owner of this ski
slope a friend of mine who badly broke
his leg
because he was the only one who didn't
have he didn't have the seat belt thing
on or the whatever that bar is everyone
else you know maybe got some bruises but
they were wrapped in so they just had a
ride he but he actually got thrown out
because he wasn't strapped in
so the only injury
was the son of the owner of the ski
slope
and that that always that always just
like blew my mind like what are the odds
of that
that just seemed weird
yep
also true I don't know if I ever told
you this I used to work at that same ski
slope
and I may be wrong about this but I
think RFK Jr's mother
had a house
like right on the ski slope you know
sort of walk to the ski slope kind of
thing
which means that he probably visited
which means there's a good chance
that when one of the days I worked at
the ski slope making hamburgers I used
to work as the fry the what'd you call
the fry cook
so I worked in front of a grill when I
was in high school
and I'd be cooking hamburgers and making
scrambled eggs and pancakes and stuff
for people
so yes I'm an experienced uh cook
weird I know you didn't expect that but
um so there's a non-zero chance
that sometime when I was a teenager that
RFK Jr was skiing because his mother's
house was right there one they had more
than one house
um and probably bought a hamburger
and I probably handed it to him
just just a weird small world now I'm
not saying for sure
but I did work a lot of weekends and
that's when he would have been there
so if he were skiing and if he got
hungry there was only one place to eat
so I probably handed him
you know
some mashed potatoes or something
all right
I burned the cheese
all right that's all I got for you for
today
um it's going to be an amazing day
and I think all of you are going to be
extra happy today
just because
all right that's all for now and I'll
talk to you YouTube tomorrow thanks for
joining
