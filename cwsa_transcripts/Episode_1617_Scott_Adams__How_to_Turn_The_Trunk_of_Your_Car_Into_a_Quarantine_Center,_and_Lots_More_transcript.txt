are you in for the best time
of possibly your entire life
this is called coffee with scott adams
and i can guarantee it's the best thing
that will ever happen to you
and
if you want to be sure it's the best
thing that will ever happen to you well
there is a little ceremony which
guarantees it it's called the
simultaneous sip possibly you've heard
of it and all you need is a copper
mugner glass of tanker charlestine a
canteen jugger flask a vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
don't try to read my whiteboard because
i move out of the way i'm not going to
be out of the way long enough look you
can try
you can try but you can't get it oh you
can almost see it it's so tantalizing
but you can't
join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine hit of the day
it's the thing that makes everything
better
it's called the simultaneous sip
and it's happening now go
i feel the public
coming together
like nothing has ever
happened before
well
let's get right to it we've got lots of
uh good news and interesting news today
so trump has announced that he's
launching his social network called true
how wonderful is it that his social
network will be called true
given that he's the
sort of the person who popularized
the name fake news now i don't know that
many people who are not trump supporters
will imagine that what is there is true
and so the question is
does trump have a way to beat
the curse of the alternate
social networks the curse of course is
that they only attract conservatives
how in the world
do you get a robust
twitter-like service if you only attract
one side
i don't really know how that's going to
work
will will enough
you know left-leaning trolls go on his
social network just to cause trouble
because i don't feel like they would
bother
so i don't i'm very curious what it
would take to make it successful
because you know fox news is hugely
successful
but
uh that's that's a media that you just
watch but if it's supposed to be
interactive such as a twitter
model
how do you have it interactive with just
people who agree with each other
so i don't know how that works exactly
but i'll be real curious to see if trump
has figured out a
workaround for that problem that nobody
else has figured out yet
now the most important story of the day
is that a texas woman
whose son had a positive cova test
and she was going to get another one but
she didn't want to be in the same car
with somebody who was covered positive
so she put her son in the trunk of her
car
and i guess he started yelling when he
got
near some civilization
and then the woman was arrested for
putting a child in the how old was he 12
or something
13 maybe 13 i think in the trunk of his
car
now
i don't know about you but i am just
about fed up
with all these government mandates
you know it's not bad enough that the
government's trying to make you get
vaccinated and make you stay home and
make you wear masks
but now the government is telling you
how to raise your children and
apparently one of the things you can't
do
is put your child in the trunk of your
car and start driving around
now i don't want to live in a world
in which the government tells me how to
use the trunk of my car
i think this government mandate if i may
call it that against putting your child
in the trunk of your car is
very overblown now in my experience
if you put a child in the trunk of a car
they uh
they do they don't like it
right away
but that's true of a lot of things right
kids don't like school they don't like
going to bed but you can make them get
used to it
in my experience if you uh put a kid in
a trunk of a car
and if you train them diligently in
about eight months they'll start to like
it
and and then you're then you're good
you don't even have to open the trunk of
the car the kids will do it themselves
they'll just
walk out and say hey kids we're going
somewhere they'll just open the trunk
and crawl right in there now this has
many advantages not just quarantine
when they're in the trunk of the car you
can't hear them
that's a bonus if you try to talk to
them
you will never be annoyed that they're
on their phone or their headphones are
in
and then you're like hey i'm trying to
talk to you hello hello hello back there
very annoying
but if you just put him in the trunk of
your car from the get-go
then you can just talk to him by texting
voice text only because you're driving
voice text only
so
if you don't text your teens in the back
of the car already
um
you may have
different teams than i'm used to
but
if you put them in the trunk of the car
like you said about eight months
of diligent
practice and they'll start to like it
um so there's that
am i going to get kicked off of social
media for that
the people who can't take a joke
probably
uh adam dopamine son tweeted around a
story
about this this is like a an
uninteresting story that's the most
interesting story in the world
to me
and let's see if i can sell it to you is
interesting
um apparently there's a chinese method
uh to make a greenhouse
that can work all year round no matter
how cold it is
so canada has started to adopt an idea
uh that works in china so in chinese
plate in chinese territories where it
gets really cold in the winter
they can still grow all year round
now are you saying to yourself uh
i don't think we just invented the
greenhouse
scott i'm pretty sure the greenhouse has
been here forever
yes but
this greenhouse uses no extra energy
what
they they grow vegetables
when it's basically you know below zero
without adding heat
i don't know how
like i
it doesn't make sense to me that you
could capture and store enough heat that
way but they figured it out so it's
something that's reproducible and very
approvable yeah it's not geothermal it's
it's literally they're just capturing
the sunlight but they're doing it so
efficiently
somehow they can heat it now i also
don't know how they get the right kind
of light
so that that was a little unexplained
because though you need a certain kind
of light for a certain length of time
but apparently no maybe they grow
different size vegetables and stuff in
the winter
but apparently they can build one of
these
and not add any energy ever
and just keep growing stuff
now the real cost is building the
facility itself
but
don't you imagine if there were a lot of
them
then it would
uh if there were a lot of these that the
price would come down
maybe you could get it down to kit sized
so you don't even need special equipment
or anything just buy it and put up the
frames and you know put on the plastic
or whatever the hell it is
you know i've got a feeling that this is
a big big thing i've i've long said that
growing indoors is going to be the way
it goes
because if you grow indoors you don't
need the pesticides you don't need
a lot of stuff you don't worry about the
the elements destroying things
etc etc you can recycle the water
basically
growing indoors is all the advantages if
you can pay for the structure
that's pretty much it if you pay for the
structure
and i think that you know we'll probably
have a robot that can build these things
pretty soon
imagine if you will
you build some robots that are special
purpose robots
and all they do is build these
greenhouses
now if you look at it it looks like it's
just a bunch of u-shaped
metal structures
like like an upside down
letter u
and they're just putting the ground and
then some kind of plastic covers them
i feel like
i feel like you could roboticize that
couldn't you
a robot at each side and just make these
as long as you want make it you know
make it to two miles long
just keep going
high tunnels
maybe
could be anyway
i think this whole indoor growing thing
is gigantic and it goes to everything
from climate change to energy use to
water to water use to
even co2 i mean you would want to use
the co2 and pump it into there
so there's just so many
ways that this could go right
it's definitely the golden age
all right there's a wonderful fake news
graph on twitter
that shows that biden has created like a
tremendous amount of jobs
and trump actually lost jobs during his
administration
and better than every president so far
biden has created the most jobs
is that true
is that true
the biden created the most jobs by far
well
it's true in the way that statistics lie
because we came off a pandemic
of course who whoever was president when
the pandemic started was going to lose
jobs
whoever was president when the pandemic
was starting to mature was going to gain
a lot of jobs and that's really the
whole story
and i thought to myself
there must be a lot of people
who don't know that the pandemic
happened
and so for them they need data that
conforms to their point of view
that no no pandemic happened
so apparently
somebody found a need and filled it
which is creating fake graphs on twitter
just for the people who didn't know
there was a pandemic
if you do know there was a pandemic you
look at it and say well this is stupid
you can't measure that
it's just the pandemic
and that made me wonder if you were to
compare the number of jobs created under
biden because there were a lot of them
to the number of citizens that died
under biden which would be the bigger
number do you know
the number of jobs created under biden
were the number of citizens who died
under biden
i think i think died i'm not positive
but i think died and
i asked this further question
for historians
what president has presided over the
most number of citizen deaths citizens
citizen deaths as opposed to military
during the first year of their
uh reign
what president had the most american
deaths during their first year not the
first term
first year
i think it's biden
i think he beats
lincoln
right
lincoln was probably two number two
now imagine running for office
when your critics can say and accurately
that more american citizens died under
your reign that in the first year
than any other president now of course
that's lying with statistics right
because the population of the united
states is something like 10 times what
it was when when lincoln was in office
and of course again it's the pandemic
which wasn't biden's fault
so you can you can do anything with
statistics it would be terribly unfair
to say that he'd killed a lot of people
just because he was president
but those are the rules the rules are
that
uh you get credit for the jobs
and you get blamed for the deaths
so the i didn't make up the rules those
are just the rules it doesn't matter if
the president had
anything to do with them
no i don't think roosevelt
presided over that many deaths in his
first year of office so it's the first
year question
have you ever noticed that it's
especially irksome
when people use sarcasm to answer you
does that bother you
when somebody like you're debating
somebody and they use sarcasm you're
like ugh
god i hate that
does it bother you more
when they use sarcasm on something
stupid in other words they're saying
something that's objectively stupid but
they're adding sarcasm like it's so
obviously correct that you're an idiot
for not getting it
well here's an example of that
when i tweeted that
that the election of 2020 has to be
under the presumption of fraud
presumption not evidence but presumption
because it's non-transparent i got this
reply from ellen cutler on twitter
and ellen says sarcastically
ah
u h h
60 plus court cases
is that not transparency
uh trump started his con before the
election it certainly has worked on you
meaning me
uh
uh 60 plus court cases
that's not enough transparency for you
really
really
that's not enough transparency
really
that in 60 court cases not enough
transparency for you
that's the most annoying sarcasm in the
world when the thing they're saying is
objectively stupid
you know
the courts
don't add transparency to an election
right
except in whatever minor way they were
asked to rule on something
if you have an election which
by its nature isn't transparent
the the courts aren't going to settle
that for you
somebody says it's not stupid no carol
it's very stupid
it is very stupid
the courts are not the tool that tells
you an election was fair or not they can
only judge the things that are brought
to them and are under their jurisdiction
do you know what kinds of things are not
under their jurisdiction
most of the things about an election
because after the election is actually
done
the courts say well that would have been
good before the election but after the
election we can't even look at it
so no the courts
are not a vehicle to find transparency
except they can drill down on a specific
question but they're not they're not
going to audit the whole network it
can't be done
so i saw that chuck grassley was talking
about fentanyl
and wanting to make his schedule one and
when i first read that i thought all
right all right
now there's a member of congress
who's uh trying to do something about
fentanyl that that sounds pretty good
and then i said to myself
what does schedule one mean
so i had to go look it up
so apparently fentanyl is schedule 2
right now which means that it is allowed
to be used for medical uses
approved medical uses but it's illegal
for recreation
now does that sound like exactly what
fentanyl should be
legal for medical use as it is now
but illegal
for recreational
that's what it is now chuck grassley
wants to make his schedule one which
would make it illegal for legitimate
medical uses
what
wait
what
he wants to take a bad situation and do
the only thing that would make it worse
by by making the people who at least can
find a way to get away from pain
take that away from them
i mean i don't think anybody is more
anti fentanyl than somebody whose
stepson died on on fentanyl
meaning me
you can't get more anti-fentanyl than i
am
but why would you take it away from the
medical use
like maybe i don't understand what he's
doing there must be something missing in
the story but is our government
so weak
just gonna get a load of this some of
you know i have
i call it my body
chen
chen is a uh he gets labeled by twitter
as being affiliated with
chinese estate media
a way to interpret that would be that
he's a chinese agent
who says pro-chinese things on twitter
now of course chen denies that and says
these are his own opinions
but
we assume that he he has to stay within
the
cccp's opinions so i'm sure they are his
personal opinions within the realm of
what's allowed him to say
so he so he's a
pro-china
i guess you could say a critic of the
united states
and he even agreed with chuck
grassley
that's right
china
agrees with chuck grassley that the
problem is on our end
the problems on our end that we've got
an administrative you know problem with
how we deal with fentanyl
that's right
instead of stopping fentanyl coming from
china
chuck grassley came up with the only
idea about fentanyl that i can imagine
that would make china
compliment him
china is the drug dealer creating the
precursors that go to the cartels that
go into the united states china does it
intentionally and knowingly because it
kills tens of thousands of americans per
year
that's what china does
and chuck grassley just came up with an
idea that china likes
it is such a bad idea that china
actually complemented it
can't get more pathetic
as a politician than doing something
that your enemies compliment because
they really like it
because it's good for them
oh my god that's pathetic
i said something really dumb yesterday i
want to correct
i was saying that there are only
two people in congress
who
might have the the balls to try to make
it illegal
for pharma to advertise on
network news and social media like every
other country except two i guess
and i said yeah we need somebody who's
like got balls and they could you know
really take on the big pharma and then i
realized that i'm an idiot
because i think thomas
massey and rand paul
would be
cr do a fact check on me but they'd be
closer to a libertarian point of view
right
which i think by its nature doesn't like
a lot of government
rules so they would be exactly
in terms of just philosophy
they would not be exactly compatible
with any new new rules you know
obviously they make new rules and they
vote for them but uh i don't know that
they would be the best
messengers given that they're sort of
keep the government out of our or away
kind of people which i respect by the
way
in terms of philosophy i respect the
philosophy but sometimes there's you
have to make exceptions
all right um
what else we got going on all right um
um i got i saw
i said uh
thomas massey quote speaking of him you
said about january 6
he said why would a president meaning
biden why would a president complain
about an election he won
almost a year into his term
which is what he was doing yesterday on
january says why would he spend so much
time complaining when he won it was a
year ago
and then thomas massey went on said
today biden could have worked on
inflation the border crisis or other
urgent issues for americans and i'm
thinking yes
yes he could have been useful and he
decided not to that's exactly what we
saw
and instead he sounded like an angry old
man after four beers shouting at the
neighbor's dog
that's exactly what he sounded like
by the way this is good persuasion
because it's visual
uh it's visual in the sense that you can
imagine
him after four beers shouting at the
neighbor's dog
so very good
persuasion technique there
does it seem to you
that
the democrats are lost
if they're still fighting trump
they just seem lost but also it seems to
me that they've handed trump or whoever
becomes the republican nominee
uh they've handed them a loaded gun and
said just shoot me with it
and i'm going to show you how now i'm
not saying that the republicans will
take this advice
and this is advice by the way but look
how easily the republicans could just
win everything
with january 6 as their issue
which seems impossible doesn't it
because it seems
if the democrats are saying january 6 is
the
is the one thing that they have going
for them
democrats
what are the odds that that's going to
be the same thing that would be good for
republicans
well let me show you
so when you're talking about the uh 2020
election as
former president trump likes to do
uh he uses what i call the child frame
the child's frame was you said it was
rigged
it wasn't fair
what do i say about fairness
fairness is a concept that was invented
so idiots and children have a way to
argue
because fairness isn't real
there's no fairness in the world
everybody disagrees about what is fair
so arguing fairness is exactly what
children and idiots do
it's that's the idiot frame i ca i'll
call it the child frame because that's
not quite as insulting as the idiot
frame but if if you're arguing anything
if you're arguing anything is unfair
you've taken a child's point of view
compared to what you could have said
which i tweeted today a non-auditable
election bears the full presumption of
fraud
which is i have no i have no proof of
fraud
no proof
no no courts have proven it
so take the official thing that the
democrats say no court has proven it but
the courts are also the wrong vehicle
for it
and since we don't have a vehicle for
looking into a non-auditable
situation
then the full presumption of fraud has
to be on it because it's a government
it is not an individual
if the government were an individual
let's say a citizen you would never use
the presumption of crime you'd always
use the assumption of innocence for
individuals but for the government
because of their power
if they
intentionally make something
non-transparent
they intentionally hide something or
they intentionally design a system that
can't be audited
they may have some fraud in there
they may not
does it matter
well it doesn't matter for the past
because the past is already settled but
it definitely matters for the future
so if you're a republican and you decide
to take the it was rigged
or even if you don't
deny it
let's say even if you don't say yeah
that the president went too far
which is also bad because then you're
just criticizing your own party so
instead of criticizing your own party
which won't work and say oh yeah it
wasn't rigged
you're not going to get elected that way
because the republicans won't even like
you if you say it wasn't rigged
if you say it was rigged
well you don't get president that way
either probably because there are too
many people think okay that's too far
there's no evidence of that proof
there's no proof of it there is evidence
but you know evidence can either be true
or false
if you do this this is called the high
ground move i have tried this out on
many people how many people after
hearing this push back
okay after you hear
all right well it might be back we'll
have to wait to see if we have any
comments so there we go did you guys
lose the feed there for a while
yeah interesting
so what i told you
that the entire
narrative
when i told you the complete narrative
could be destroyed with one sentence
and it was obviously true
youtube cut me
do you think that was a coincidence
that at the very moment i told you how
to kneecap the entire democratic
movement
with precision and absoluteness
can you agree with me
can you agree with me that this message
is unbeatable
let's just
the i say this message is unfucking
beatable
like a hundred percent unbeatable
right
this is the end of the democrats
uh on youtube they're saying there's no
audio hey paul can you give me a
uh there's only one person i trust on
this on locals
paul
are you there
um i saw you say that the audio was good
yeah paul said it's good but they're
still saying it's not
now
okay i was confirmed
uh all right the audio is fine so it's
just the trolls we have a confirmation i
finally i finally worked out a system
for knowing when the trolls are just
saying the audio is bad and that is
having a a trusted person who's watching
both platforms so
paul thank you you are a
citizen and a gentleman and a patriot
and the patriot
paul collider thank you very much
um so let me just uh summarize
uh if the republicans lose the leave the
child frame and stop saying it was
unfair
and they go to the high ground maneuver
that is the end of any chance that a
democrat
could be president
i mean you you would have to do
everything else wrong to lose the
election under these uh circumstances
and you'd have to be really uh quick
about dismissing the court cases and
you'd have to do it the way i do it
when because somebody's going to say but
all those court cases and that's when
you say this is also a high ground
maneuver but you know the court can only
look at what's brought to them and
what's within their jurisdiction
so the court maybe could look at one
percent of an election
maximum
now is that accurate
if i said to you the courts could only
in the best case scenario
given that they can only look at narrow
little things within their
jurisdiction and narrow little claims
then maybe the court could get at one
percent of the transparency
is that fair now i don't know if it's 10
or 20 or 1
but but claiming 1 doesn't sound wrong
i mean it feels like it's in the range
of
the right direction
um
the epoch times is holding a global cova
doctor summer to summit today
interesting
all right
let's see if i can get kicked off of uh
social media again
um do you remember something called herd
immunity
it was all the talk there for a while
wasn't it
we were going to get to herd immunity
either by vaccinations or infections
and now
we are totally a herd immunity
and it doesn't seem to make any
difference at all
am i wrong about that
fact check me
we are definitely a herd immunity i mean
we reach the level of infections plus
vaccinations
and
it seems to be making
no difference in the infections am i
right
definitely i think this the official
word is still a big difference in
hospitalizations and outcomes
so so from that perspective the
vaccinations are working
of keeping people out of the hospital
and from dying
not entirely but they're doing a good
job
right but have you heard anybody in
power say
you know the whole herd immunity thing
didn't work out
correct me if i'm wrong but a hundred
percent of our strategy
was aimed at herd immunity and we have
i'd say this week
you know maybe last week but at least by
this week
can we not confirm that that didn't work
we can confirm that right
is that too strong
i don't think that's too strong
because i feel like we could get to 100
vaccinations and we'd we'd still be
looking at what we're looking at
so
while uh i support the government in
moving the goal posts
somebody said they moved the goalposts i
support them doing that because in the
context of an emergency where people are
just figuring it out and
they're basically just
improvising
they're going to get a lot of big stuff
wrong
and then you need to improvise again and
fix it
so yeah i'm going to be the most
forgiving of anybody in public
for whatever mistakes get made
right i will be the most forgiving of
all of you because i i think you just
have to put it in context that everybody
was guessing
uh and once once you accept that
everybody was guessing i think you can
be a little bit more generous
about uh
so i guess youtube's still freezing up
every now and then
but i would like to build credibility i
would like to see anthony fauci say you
know
our whole strategy was building toward
herd immunity and that didn't work
that didn't work
but the good news is
we did lower the deaths and
um and whatever
so that that would go a long way toward
building his credibility you know for me
the for me the experts can admit they're
wrong all day long and i'll still be
good
just admit you were wrong
we sort of need that
don't we
this isn't really politics as usual with
with the
you know with politics you can live with
the fact that nobody admits they're
wrong
but when it's life and death and his
health
i feel like the credibility of our
politicians would be boosted by saying
oh we got that one totally wrong
trust me i did the best i could but we
we got that totally wrong
i listen to the experts that are not
right every time
that would help a lot
a lot
um well kamala harris uh made some news
on yesterday by comparing
the fake insurrection day to pearl
harbor and 9 11.
many people were offended
the death counts of those two things
were not the same but here's another way
they're not the same
pearl harbor was an attack
from an outside force trying to destroy
our democracy and our country
911 was an attack from the outside
trying to destroy our democracy in our
country
so i do think you could compare uh pearl
harbor and
911
because they were attacks from the
outside
that we didn't see coming and they were
from outside forces
but if you talk about january 6 uh this
is
completely an inside deal
like it's americans and americans
and i would argue that uh
uh it was an insurrection on january 6.
now i i don't want to disappoint a lot
of you but in my opinion january 6 was
an insurrection
does anybody disagree with me
i've heard a lot of people say it's
that it wasn't an insurrection but
january 6 was definitely an insurrection
now here's the bad news
the protesters who tried to stop that
insurrection
and delay the vote so we could know that
we had a good vote the protesters failed
and so the democrats succeeded in their
insurrection or at least according to
the protesters now we don't have uh
any court proof
that the election was fraudulent
we have no no court proof we do have the
uh guarant the presumption
and the full presumption of fraud
because it's a non-transparent system so
you do assume it was fraud but we don't
have core proof
under those conditions i would think
that it's fair to call it an
insurrection by the democrats that the
republican protesters tried to stop and
failed
and then as is often the case with the
democrats one of the ways they cover
their uh bad behavior
is by doing a louder job of blaming you
of the same behavior
and my god does it work
i i've said this before tucker carlson
has been saying this for years that the
democrats blame you for whatever they're
doing and i and the first uh 20 times i
heard it i thought that's too far
that's too far that's just a coincidence
you know if it's just politics everybody
blames everybody if everything
and so it looks like they're blaming you
for what they're doing because
everybody's doing bad things and
everybody's blaming people so it's
really just a perceptual thing
it's not an actual it's not an actual
effect
it's not like they consciously
blame you for the thing they're doing
except that
it looks like that's exactly what they
do
it looks like that's how they hide it
for example
russia collusion
the truth which we know with no doubt
whatsoever is that the clinton campaign
colluded with another country at least
great britain and russia
to to change the results of the election
but because they made it invisible
by making the entire story about what
whether trump did or did not collude
with russia
we learned he did not
that story was so big that it it's like
the magic trick where it diverts you
we we have guaranteed
proven connections between the clinton
campaign and foreign entities
influencing our elections
nobody even questions it
right
as far as i know
there's nobody on the left or the right
who would question what i just said that
the
the democratic
campaign
talked to foreign nationals
and got their help to try to influence
the election
there's no doubt about those facts but
we act like it doesn't matter
only because our brains have been
diverted to the magic trick it's all
about trump diddy did he not and you
just can't even see the other thing it
becomes invisible
but it's there
we all see it we see it but it doesn't
activate
i guess that's the better way to see it
we can see it clearly
but it doesn't activate into
motion and anything kinetic
it just sits there
it's the damnedest thing and i think you
could think of three more examples of it
but it looks like an actual strategy
that works like nothing i've ever seen
work before really well
anyway
my mascots which you might call my
critics but i call my mascots
they're not going to like that and
they'll think i'll get banned for what i
said and i tweeted this today i want to
make it really clear
i said i declare my right as a citizen
of the united states
to label
the 2020 election illegitimate
based on a lack of transparency
an election that can't be fully audited
by design
must bear the full presumption of fraud
now that statement violates the
narrative doesn't it
i mean that's you i don't think you can
violate the narrative harder than that
will i get banned for that
nope and by the way my uh broadcast
yesterday got remonetized it's too late
to actually make money but
youtube will sometimes preemptively
demonetize you which
lowers your visibility i believe
and
uh
but then they'll re-monetize it if you
appeal and it doesn't really violate any
rules which is what happened
but you've already lost your money by
then and and your audience
so it's sort of too late by the time
they do that
which is a really good trick by the way
if it's a trick it's a good one
so we'll see i say i will not be banned
for saying the truth
uh
what might happen is the connection
might go go bad
as apparently it did
i put in my profile on twitter i've
changed it to say that i'm the number
one number one best
predictor in the country during the
pandemic
not number 2 not one of the best
but the number one best predictor
and then i have a link to my actual full
description of all my predictions and
how they did
people are still telling me that i'm
going to pay for my bad predictions
until they look at them
and then they get really really quiet
so my mascots
who you might call my critics
were really really frothy for the last
week or so did anybody notice
because i was working them up into a
lather
intentionally
and i wanted to see how much of a lather
i could get all my critics worked up for
because they all believed that i had
some kind of opinions i'd never held
but then once i had him in the highest
level of lather i'd lost i don't know 20
10 000 uh
followers or something like that people
were bailing out like crazy ah he's
turned
so i waited it was hard to wait
because i wanted to do it earlier but i
was like hold
hold
hold
and then i finally released my full list
of what my predictions were and and i do
think that the list um
does support my claim i'm the number one
best predictor of the entire pandemic
if you see my what i actually predicted
i ran it through the local subscription
people because they've watched all my
predictions live and they're not indexed
so i needed lots of witnesses
you know i needed thousands of witnesses
to say yes these were my actual
predictions so that you didn't think i
made them up after the fact
um
how many left let's see
i'll give you an actual number
because you're right that was hyperbole
um so around
i don't know it's hard to say because
you know there's some get added at the
same time some are subtracting but i was
pushing
670 000 and now it's at 663.
so 7000 down net at a time i might have
gained 3 000
so ish so
rounded off to about 10 000 people
uh left because of that
but now that i have that little link
every time somebody complains i just
send them that little link and what do
they do after that
they get really quiet
as soon as they see my actual
predictions
they get really really quiet
and nobody's come back after that
zero people have seen the link and then
come after me a second time it just
shuts them down totally
which is quite
nice
how many of you follow a twitter user
named james lindsey
is that name familiar to you he got a
lot of attention during the pandemic
um
i would recommend that you stop
immediately
um so he's he's turned into in my
opinion i'll try to just keep to an
opinion because facts are elusive in my
opinion he's turned into a very negative
force
and he was warning today i i blocked him
today finally because i need to manage
my life completely
he's been one of my
mascots that you might call a critic
and he was quite sure that
the i and the other people who were
quote wrong
are going to have to pay for our
wrongness
so he's already setting it up that he
wants to make sure that all the people
who are wrong
i guess that would include people like
me
will pay for their wrongness and really
really be held to account
to which i say james lindsay number one
you were completely wrong about all of
all of my predictions and you shat upon
me
for making predictions that were the
best in the world while you completely
misinformed treated them as the worst
now should you be worried that the
person who says people should be
punished for being wrong can't
tell who was the rightest in the world
from who was wrong
the guy who wants to punish people for
being wrong
can't tell the difference between the
number one rightist person and somebody
who is wrong
and and that's that's who you're
following
you're following somebody who wants to
punish people without having a
clue
if they were right or wrong
don't follow him
i mean obviously
you're a free person you can do whatever
you want but i would say he's he turned
into a really
he's like smigiel with the ring i think
he has some views about the uh pandemic
that he's he's too
invested in
so he sort of turned into oh my precious
yeah
there was a time that i thought his
voice was important
and indeed i would like to compliment
all of the critics
so i've been a critic of alex berenson
for his views because i think he
tweeted a lot of things that
people i trust found inaccurate
but
also
national treasure
i think you could be wrong about
everything and still be a national
treasure if you're a critic
because you need the credits
right
didn't you feel safer
knowing there was an alex berenson
right
didn't you feel safer knowing there was
a james lindsay
didn't you feel safer knowing there was
a
dr malone
yeah i mean the critics make you feel
safer because you feel like at least the
other side is getting you know
uh
aspirated or something whatever is the
best word for that
um oh and somebody says james lindsay's
a good voice against critical race
theory so that would be a different
topic
yeah somebody says malone is intel
you mean intelligence services um
i'm not seeing that
all right so
um
yeah i think you should uh
you should block anybody or stop
following anybody who's turned into
michael um meanwhile the supreme court
has lost all credibility
i i've been tweeting even in the last
year i've been tweeting that the supreme
court is the
is the
the you know the jewel
in our crown it's like the thing we
can't lose
because as long as the supreme court is
working and the court system in general
the supreme court essentially especially
as long as the supreme court is
functioning
we can make everything else work
right that's the only thing that can't
be broken
as long as that's working we're good
so how is that working
well
here's some
here are a few things that our justices
got wrong
and this comes from some tweets by
michael sanger
and he says this is a partial list of
coveted misinformation repeated by the
u.s supreme court so far today this is
just in one day so i guess they're
hearing cases about band-aids or
something i don't even know the details
um
so this is from sudden meyer
she said a hundred thousand children are
in critical care and on ventilators
no
it's closer to three thousand
a hundred if a hundred thousand children
in the us were
in critical care and on ventilators
that would be the only story
there wouldn't be any other story
it would just be pictures of those kids
on ventilators so where did she even get
this
like where do you get that
statistic from that's just out of
nowhere here's another one this is from
justice breyer
vaccine mandate would prevent a hundred
percent of u.s cases
what
what
what
is he the only person in the world who
doesn't know
that vaccines don't don't stop the
transmission of the omicron especially
he said that in public
these are these are our smartest people
he said that in public
here's another one
uh sodermeyer said that uh kovades are
at an all-time high
uh
but that probably was a
misinterpretation i think she means
cumulative
yeah if it was interpreted to mean you
know per week that would be crazy
because it's nowhere near it i think so
i guess it depends on the context on
that one
um this is something kagan said
so justice kagan said it's quote beyond
settled that vaccines and masks are the
best way to stop the spread
what
what
it might be true
and it might be untrue
but how could you live in america and
say that those questions are settled
settled by whom
who believes they're settled
i got vaccinated i don't think it's
settled
for god's sakes what
was it settled before we decided we
needed infinite boosters
what the hell does settled mean
this is crazy
from the supreme court
here's another one from sodomire
uh the federal government can mandate
vaccine use using its police power well
that's more of a legal thing i don't i
don't don't have an opinion on that
um sodomire also said hospitals are
nearing capacity
are they
are hospitals nearing capacity
my understanding is that the critical
care are always near capacity because
they're designed to be near capacity and
that the regular hospitals are maybe not
that busy
is it misleading at least
if not now right wrong
and here's a wild one from sodomire
omicron is deadlier than delta
what what
we have a we have a supreme court
justice
who thinks that omicron
is deadlier than delta
i don't think there's a citizen who
believes that
well and we all know it's not true
how could she be the only one left who
doesn't know this
uh jack possabic just was tweeting
around a study on the uk i think
that suggests that omicron could be
as much as
a hundred times less dangerous than
delta
a hundred times less dangerous
now i don't think that's true actually
if that feels like too much if you know
what i mean
it feels like too much
but
there's no doubt that it's less
dangerous at this point right
are we beyond wondering if it's more
dangerous than delta
now i think she may have
come to that conclusion because some
some people think omicron will spread
faster
and then there'll be a lot of people out
who have to stay home from work and you
know that could cause more problems in
the long run
but she didn't explain it that way i
guess
she didn't explain it that way
so um and then breyer said that
hospitals are full of unvaccinated
people
oh
what
you know
first of all the hospitals aren't full
but it's definitely a mix of vaccinated
and unvaccinated
now um i think what he means is that the
the worst outcomes the critical care and
the ones who die or the unvaccinated
ones more or less that's true
so some of these i think some of these
are less about being wrong and more
about being unclear
but still is shocking
it's shocking because at the very least
the supreme court should be clear
you know they do have that ability
um the unvaxed make up 80 in our
hospital somebody says
uh
but uh eighty percent of the serious
cases right
eighty percent of the serious cases
um
well
so now we've lost all faith in the
supreme court
our elections cannot be trusted because
they're not transparent
our leaders are lying to us
telling us that
january 6 was an insurrection in the
opposite direction of what it
was and somehow our system still works
isn't it the day of this thing
on one hand everything is broken
just everything
on the other hand
i know i wake up every day and my coffee
tastes the same and
the stock market's doing okay
i don't know how everything works out
it's kind of weird
um
let me ask you this at this point
do you see any problems ahead of ahead
of us that aren't just inflation
go
let's assume that we work our way
through the pandemic whether it's
february 1st or or sometime soon but
we're in a weird place in the world
aren't we
correct me if i'm wrong but i feel like
we've solved almost every problem
except inflation and that's probably
going to get solved
homeless uh i'm not entirely sure the
homeless are a problem the way you see
it
let me let me give you my newest opinion
on the homeless
the reason the homeless are homeless
is because they want to take drugs and
live a free life
and being in a home would require them
to you know follow the restrictions of
living inside basically
and
if you have people who are
taking
agency and living as free people no
matter how bad it looks to you
i don't know that's a problem
it's a problem for the people who live
in those towns but they can move
right it's a problem that will work its
oneself out
so it's a weird kind of problem that the
the we're trying to solve a problem for
a group of people who don't say they
have a problem or at least not that
problem that's the part they want to
keep the don't go inside
so
um
the entire western world is under
assault and scott doesn't notice
well i certainly notice uh all of the
devious things that china is doing you
know we've got the hacking we've got the
public opinion manipulation we've got
uh we don't trust our you know drug
companies
uh and we've got of course the critical
race theory tearing us apart and all
those things but in my opinion none of
those are really going to get the job
done
let's talk about the border
um
how many of you have had a border
related problem if you don't live on the
border obviously it's a big problem if
you're near the border
but i i don't live near the border
and i have so far zero problems that are
caused by
the stream of maybe even infected
coveted people coming across the border
illegally many of them criminals
well i won't say many but too many of
them are criminals i don't want to say
many are criminals that would be unfair
because it's the opposite
the weird thing about the border is that
it's a gigantic problem that doesn't
affect me in a way that i can determine
and i'm interested if you also
have any direct effect from it
no i don't live in a gated community
people assume i'm in a gated community
and there's there there's a reason i'm
not
uh
yeah gator community i don't like gated
communities
they're really paying the ass
uh
cheap
effect it affects my taxes
um okay i'll give you that
yeah but you know i don't see it
directly so but that's a good point so
somebody said it will affect my taxes in
california that's true
that's true but you know you know the
thing that i've never seen calculated
is the net
i don't have my own wall either
if you get inside my house
you're going to wish you hadn't
so my
my only security to my house is if you
get on the inside i'm first of all going
to have a good picture of you before you
got in and secondly when you get in
good luck getting out
good luck getting out
but you could get in
anybody could get in the house
but good luck in now
so um
uh
yeah
so i i i agree with you that the border
is uh an issue that has to be fixed
i agree with you that some people
especially if you're near the border
it's got to be terrible i mean there's
got to be just chaos if you're near the
border so if you're an american near the
border it's definitely bad for you but
here's the calculation i've never seen
maybe you have
let's take just california as an example
so we have massive illegal immigration
and i don't know what percentage of them
stay in california but i would guess
most
i don't think most people come across
the border and then leave to another
state do they give me a fact check on
that but
i'd guess
75 stay
now we have massive open immigration
do those people add to the economy or
subtract
and
whichever one it is
by how much
and does it matter if it's the first
year they're here or should you measure
it over 10 years
because
immigration generally adds to the gdp
right
if you have controlled immigration
would well let me say if you have
controlled immigration
could you say that it's always positive
to the gdp
if it's controlled
meaning that you only let in the people
you want
at the numbers you want
right yeah that would be positive but
what i don't know is the crossover
if you just you just threw the doors
open and said well screw it come in if
you want to at what point does it become
does it cross over into negative
and i you know economics is my
my bag i don't know
so
so i've said forever that the way to win
on immigration
here's here's how the republicans should
win on immigration
they should say we should separate the
question of border security
from the question of how many people get
in
they've never done that
and it's stupid it just gives the issue
away basically so they have an airtight
issue that they should win on every time
which is immigration control and they
find a way to lose by framing it wrong
the right way to frame it is way way way
there are two issues
one is how we control the border and we
would want to be able to control it as
much as possible but the second question
that's related is how many people to let
in
and that should be determined by
economists
so in other words
if the economist let's say every six
months they recalculate and if the
economists say
hey it looks like we could use some more
immigrants
to for the gdp
then you then you turn the lever and you
open you let in a bunch more
and then if the economy say hey
something special happened like a
pandemic
we better close that border it's like
okay temporarily close it temporarily
now you tell me that you couldn't sell
that to everybody
because you're saying if it's good for
the country we'll let them in
and if it's bad for the country we won't
and it will be determined not by me
not by me as president i'm not in this
it will be determined by a bipartisan
group of economists who just have to
work it out and tell us hey you need a
few more immigrants or or
different kinds of immigrants or
something
ah
thank you i was waiting for somebody to
catch me so i could tell you how i'll
weasel out of it
somebody said in quotes oh trust the
experts
scott have you not been telling us
for years not to trust the experts but
now but now scott
really
really
now you're going to trust the experts
is that what you're going to do
nope
did you hear anywhere in my idea trust
nope
nope the idea requires no trust in fact
you could totally not trust the
economist
still works
it's the same it's the same kind of
effect why uh capitalism works even
though it's broken
completely still works
and and our democratic republic
completely broken from head to head to
bottom right
congress is broken the supreme court
doesn't even read the news apparently
completely broken still works
still works
so if you build this uh immigration
system the way i described
and then my uh my critic at the moment
said but then you'd be trusting the
experts the economist to know when to
tweak it to which i say no i wouldn't i
wouldn't be trusting them at all
i would be
relying on them
which is different
in other words i want the country to
think that the system made sense
and then they'll accept it
we only need to know that something was
done rationally we don't need to know it
was done
right which is the difference
because i think that people do actually
understand
that the government is guessing on some
stuff
you know like we're guessing
what to do with the economy and taxes a
little bit we're guessing so i think
there is some forgiveness for a bad
guess but there's no forgiveness for a
bad system
for example
i can forgive america for electing a
president i didn't want to be elected
but i can't forgive them for having a
system that can't be audited
see
you we completely can accept the mistake
of getting the wrong president which
seems like a big mistake but we can
accept that
because we didn't have a revolution
there was no insurrection
we accepted it a very broken system and
we accepted it
but we should not have accepted the
system that got us there because it was
non-transparent
fix the system
and you you have a fighting chance of
getting the citizens to say i don't like
where it went i don't like the outcome
but i get it
i don't like where that went but at
least that made sense
you know at least you had a process
and i'll respect the process even if i
don't like the answer
i did say there was an insurrection of
the democrats
all right
a degradation of california iq is a fact
i think it would be caused by porous
borders
so somebody's saying that the iq in
california is going down because of
porous borders
that's a that's a figure i wouldn't
trust
how do people who don't speak english do
on english iq tests
or do we even do they even take them
i mean
i assume that some kind of a racist
racist sounding opinion
um
but i think the history is that
immigration just works
for gdp
now i will tell you that the average uh
the average intelligence of people may
not matter as much as you think
in my opinion the
say top five percent of smart people
matter a lot
like you can't really have a a good
civilization unless your top five
percent of smart people
have the the freedom to do what they
need to do and the incentives and and
they can do their thing it's not the
bottom ninety percent were inventing
anything like there was nobody in the
bottom ninety percent of intelligence
who worked on the iphone
except maybe the janitor or something
uh
the the top ten percent are the ones
that are doing all the things that
transform society and and the rest
you know the rest they just need to be
able to do their jobs
and that's it if you could raise a
family
you know well and do your job that's all
the iq you need
the extra would be wasted
uh run the really check on the sodomire
quotes would that work
uh well it would work on some of them
so you really think that a hundred
thousand children are on ventilators and
critical care and we haven't heard of it
really
really
a hundred thousand kids in critical care
and the first we're hearing about it
the first we're hearing about it is from
the supreme court
well i think it worked right
in that case it worked
all right somebody says immigration
drains your economy it drains it but
also
it also boosts it
so what i'm saying is you need to figure
out the net we know the drain
the drain is obvious but the net is
you know the benefit is a little less
obvious because that
that kicks in maybe in the second
generation how would you even measure
the benefit of immigration
uh i'd love to see here's something i'd
like to say
all right for those of you who are
racist and i know there are some of you
here
so speaking to the racists
if you were to measure the you know
immigrants who who just are fresh over
the border
uh how would they do
compared to say americans who've been
living here maybe not as well because
they're starting from a low point
but give me the second generation of
immigrants
give me the second generation of
immigrants and let me compare the second
generation of immigrants from any
country
doesn't matter the country just second
second generation immigrants you compare
them
to all of you racist who have
been here for a while
who's going to win
which one of them would do better the
second generation
or the people who've been here for a
long time
i would put my money on the second
generation of immigrants every time
now i don't have data to back that up by
the way so if you have data you can
change my mind
but if i had to guess and a lot of this
is observational right if you live in
california you meet a lot of
first generation and second generation
you do not want your kid
to compete against a second generation
immigrant
let me say that again
if your kids in school
you better hope they're not competing
against too many second generation
immigrants because they're getting their
asses kicked
because they're they're hungry
you know it's a sort of a gross
generalization
of course it's a gross generalization
um
so that's what i've got to say about
that
um don't i don't mean your specific kids
they're all they're all geniuses i'm
sure
uh depends if they got poisoned by
college
all right
that's all i got for now and thank you
for joining me this is the best live
stream you've ever seen best moment of
your life i think it's guaranteed and
i'll talk to you tomorrow
