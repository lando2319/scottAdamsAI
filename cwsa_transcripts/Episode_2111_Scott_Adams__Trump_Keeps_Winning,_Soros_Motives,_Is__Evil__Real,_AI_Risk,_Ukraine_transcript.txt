Ruby
good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlighted civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams I doubt
you've ever had more fun in your entire
life so this could be the highlight and
if you want to take it up to levels that
are unbelievable and nobody could even
imagine
all you need is a cup of mug or a glass
of tanker chalice or style the canteen
jogger flaska vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
the end of the day thing makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens now go
ah
a
I shudder with happiness
um
no you're probably not getting that
coffee mug that's that's right
I like to start with a controversial
tweet by a young man I started following
recently Jay Cartier
c-a-r-t-e-r-e he says some nice
provocative Twitter stuff
so here was his tweet today happy wife
equal miserable life
because dedicating yourself to making
someone happy is how you create terrible
relationship
a good relationship comes from starting
happy and sharing that happiness with
your partner it's your responsibility to
choose happiness
what do you think
how many of you would agree with
happy wife happy life
has that worked for any of you
no
let me give you the uh I'll get let me
give you another take on what it takes
to be happy
so this one from also Twitter user Joe
manico who tweets this in response
you said word thinking all successful
long-term relationships are a result of
mutual application of the Stockholm
syndrome do you know about the Stockholm
syndrome is
is whether you're a prisoner
and you start to relate to your captors
so you become friends with the people
who are imprisoning you and you think
that's natural and good and all feels
right
[Laughter]
that basically is cognitive dissonance
the the only thing that makes a happy
marriage is cognitive dissonance you
have to convince yourself that you must
be there for some good reason because
you are there
and you consider yourself rational let's
see if I'm rational
and I'm in this marriage thing
and I'm rational
logically I'm happy
you see how that works you you actually
your brain will actually tell you to be
happy because it can't understand the
situation any other way well you're
rational you chose to do this
you keep choosing to do it
you must like it and then your brain
tells you you like it there's definitely
some of that
all right but uh I saw somebody else
mocking the happy wife happy life under
the theory that there's no such thing as
making your wife happy
who would agree with that
that there's no such thing as making
your wife happy
so yes it might be theoretically true
it might be theoretically true that a
happy wife would make a happy life but
you can't get there
that's like an on an unclimbable
Mountain
um I would like to describe the process
of making your wife happy
as trying to dry the ocean with a towel
just let you sleep on that one a little
bit it's like drying the ocean with a
towel
because I don't know about you but I
feel like women come up with new
problems if you solve the old one
am I the only one who thinks that
I remember when I was young and dumb
and I thought if you solved somebody
else's problem that they wouldn't have
any problems
[Laughter]
I actually believe that I believe okay
how many problems do you have three all
right let's work on these three problems
we'll take care of these three big
problems you're good
nope
turns out three new problems
coincidentally
didn't see it coming but then you say
all right well three more problems I
didn't see these coming
but once the first three are solved in
the next three that'll be six solved
problems pretty good after that
how's that go
[Laughter]
all right here's my take on marriage
marriage works when the right two people
get married
and that's it
there's nothing else
because the right two people will do the
right things under the right
circumstances
and and the wrong people will do the
wrong thing under every circumstance
and then that doesn't work
and I think the odds of finding one
functional person
who would be like a good mate
it's kind of low
for for everybody it's just kind of low
even if you have a lot of uh buying
power like you're the kind of person who
can really get the mate that you want
you know you've you've got all kinds of
options you're still guessing because
you know because people turn into
different creatures the day you're
married
I used to hear from people who had lived
together for a long time and then they
got married
that it was no different
it's completely different
has anybody had that experience
that the day you're married Everything
Changes
and it's totally different
I don't know why I mean you could
speculate
you think Scott Adams and Andrew T have
found some common ground
well do you think the Andrew Tate
influenced me or that I influenced
Andrew Tate
you tell me in the comments
did Andrew Tay influence me or did I
influence Andrew Tate
what do you think
all right well you'll figure that out
someday all right um
yeah let's
so I don't think happy wife equals happy
life is a good idea and I think it's the
most clever thing that women ever came
up with I think men came up with it
probably but it has worked for women
incredibly because I think there's like
generations of men who think well if I
could just make her happy
this this would all work out
all right
I've talked about this before but I am
endlessly fascinated by it so I
apologize if this is more interesting to
me than it is to you
um I saw Eric Weinstein asked this
question on Twitter that I was asking at
the same time
and I can't tell if he saw my question
because it happened almost exactly the
same time and the question was can
somebody explain why Soros does what
he's doing
which is you know allegedly destroying
the country by getting prosecutors in
office who don't want to prosecute
now what do you think happened when I
asked that question
do you think everybody gave me the
answer
and it was sort of the same answer
no
so is it weinsteinerstein
I'm not I I like to I like to stay for
the record that I will never get this
Dean and Stein right
because my my memory just doesn't hold
randoms it has to make sense
sounds like Einstein Einstein
so when is it ever esteemed is there
anybody who is there anybody who spells
it the same but pronounces it different
is that a thing do you think anybody had
do you think anybody has the same
spelling but pronounces it the other way
they do right
I thought that was a thing
yeah it's not Epstein
Frankenstein
it's all very confusing to people like
me all right well I apologize if I uh
got that wrong probably did
but
um here's my question
for a while I thought it was just me
but be care because Eric Weinstein
correctly pronounced I think because
he's more well informed than I am and
very very smart
when I saw him agreeing that he's never
seen anybody describe Soros as alleged
motivations in a in a good way like in a
way that you could actually believe
um I thought oh I guess I'm not crazy
I've never seen it and I keep asking for
it
so here's what the answers were
and
if there's one thing I can teach you
that's really really predictive
if you ask somebody why is something
happening and they give you let's say
one answer
and then you ask somebody else and they
give you largely the same answer the
third person largely the same answer
it might be right
it might not be
but there's a good chance it could be
everybody seems to have the same opinion
however if you ask a question and
everybody you talk to has a completely
different answer
nobody knows
that that's very that's very consistent
you don't look at all these different
completely different answers and say
well I think that one got it right even
they might have but generally it's a is
an indication that just nobody knows so
here are some of the answers I got for
why Soros is doing what he's doing which
seems to many people to be bad for the
America and the world one Pure Evil
pure evil he needs no reason two because
he's Jewish and that's what Jewish
people do to destroy the world
yes there are anti-anti semites on
Twitter quite a few of them it turns out
when you ask that question they they
emerge and uh it's quite shocking
but yeah the whole bunch of cons blood
libel conspiracy theories just has
something to do with
being Jewish all right uh I reject that
one just in case you were wondering
um he wants to destroy the West
why
um it's about voting so the whole D.A
thing is really only about voting and
control
why why
um he wants to destabilize the US by
seeding chaos
and it's working
a free and prosperous American stands in
the way of his plan for Global
government
um or here's my favorite word salad
Soros believes that an open Society
model that humans are fungible and
infinitely malleable and the human
nature can be ameliorated through the
managed application of the therapeutic
culture
do you recognize that as word salad
that didn't mean anything did it
or or it's Marxist right there's another
one he's Marxist
um
the natural hierarchies like families or
barriers
Etc but the the answer that I got most
commonly is that he's evil
that's that's the end of the story it's
evil and some people said he's evil
and you don't need to know more than
that you don't need to know his
intentions you don't need to know his
internal thoughts
all you need to know is that the outcome
is clearly evil and that you have to
battle evil so you would do the same
thing what no matter what he's thinking
what he's thinking doesn't matter if
what he's doing is objectively evil
you just deal with it how best you can
um
I feel like all of this is simplistic
and it does seem to me that it would be
useful to know his motivations
because if you do his motivations you
might be able to negotiate them away
as in well the thing you really want
is X maybe you're not getting it with
the process you're using you may maybe X
is something we like too
maybe X is keeping people out of jail we
like that if they don't commit crimes
so there might be I do think that
understanding the motivation would be
key to
fixing the situation
because there's something he wants and
you can't negotiate with somebody until
you figure out what that is you're not
going to randomly satisfy somebody
all negotiations are what do you want
all right how can I give you some form
of that while also being good on my side
right you've got to understand the
motivation
so I was curious about the answers about
evil so I asked my audience
either Twitter poll does evil exist
does it exist as a force
um
does it exist as a force or is it just a
word that we use to explain things after
the fact
yeah once you see something bad happen
do you say oh that was evil but it's not
really explaining anything it's just
sort of a label we put on stuff
82 percent
said evil does exist as a force
and some people said God exists and they
believe in God
and therefore believing God
necessarily means that evil exists so
yes so not only does it exist but it is
clearly evident in George Soros
and I'm saying a lot of people are
agreeing with that here
is anybody worried about that
I know you're pretty comfortable with
that opinion but do you feel like that
might be sub-optimal
because if you stop there like I said if
you stop with it's just evil how are you
going to negotiate that away
you can't right you can't negotiate evil
the way you'd have to kill them
and that doesn't seem like a good
solution
I I feel like you're you're not doing
the work
meaning I think you're you're you're
quitting on this topic too early
you can call it evil and I won't even
argue with you I'm not going to argue
because the outcome looks pretty evil
so but I think you need to know a little
bit more about what's happening in in
his gourd now apparently he
some people say that in his own words he
had once told Politico some years ago
that what he was really trying to fix
with these uh prosecutors who stopped
prosecuting
is that there were too many missing
fathers
in the poor families and especially poor
black families and that if you could
stop sending the fathers to jail
on on things that maybe were not the
worst thing in the world in terms of
crimes that at least the second
generation would have a better chance of
not going to jail
what do you think of that idea that you
in the in the short run you give up
um on Prosecuting some people so you put
up with more crime
that would be the obvious outcome of
that but those fathers who would have
gone to jail now are home and that keeps
the kid from becoming a criminal later
that might be the worst idea I've ever
heard in my life
I don't know if I've ever heard a worse
idea than that
do you think the dads that are going to
jail are good Dads
do you think they're going to hang
around just because they're not in jail
is not in jail the that's now your
criteria for a sufficient ad well there
are a lot of qualities I'd like to see
in the father but really I'm just going
to key on this one didn't go to jail for
the crime he did commit
and that's going to fix it
so
I don't know maybe maybe he once said
something like that in an interview but
does that sound real
that doesn't even sound real
it's like such a bad idea that you don't
think it could have possibly come out of
his mouth unless I'm misstating it you
know because I heard it from somebody
who is remembering reading it so it
might be that I'm just describing it
wrong
um
here's my take
I think bad things happen but there's
always an obvious normal reason
so if a psychopath
uh torture somebody for fun that was the
example somebody gave me of evil a
sociopath tortures somebody before
killing them for fun
for enjoyment would you call that evil
yes
yes right we'd all call that evil but if
you wanted to understand and explain the
situation evil doesn't help
doesn't help at all but if you said well
let's go a little deeper this person has
a their brain is broken they just have
mental illness so they're just not
processing right well now you have
something you can work with right you
could work with that there might be
something you should treat maybe maybe
you have to keep them away from other
people or whatever but
evil doesn't give you anything to work
with except pray in a way I guess
I think you need you need to get down to
what is the physical cause in the
physical world to be useful
you know so
I think somebody's always tried to make
money
stay in a jail you know work on their
ego
uh or their mental problems or maybe
they didn't didn't foresee how bad
things would get Maybe
so they're a whole bunch of really
really normal reasons why everything
happens I I don't need I don't need a
philosophical religious reasons because
there are just ordinary reasons why does
a starving person steal something
evil no hunger why does a crazy person
hurt somebody
evil no crazy crazy explained the whole
thing you don't need anything else just
brain isn't working
so the brain doesn't work nothing yeah
or drugs drugs could explain it as well
so I'm not saying evil doesn't exist
so I'm gonna I'm gonna agree with you
that we have this word called evil
we would commonly recognize evil in the
same places you know you and I wouldn't
disagree too much what it looked like
after it happened but it it doesn't help
you
fix anything
it's an inactive
feel-good word ironically it's a
feel-good word because it makes you feel
like you understand it I guess
but you need to get to that next level
and I don't think we have that with
Soros
so
um I would I'm completely with you so
let me be clear
I'm completely with I think probably
every one of you
is saying that some of the things the
Soros is doing needs to be completely
stopped
such as letting people out of jail and
not getting something in return
uh right so you could call it evil and I
can just call it sub-optimal but we can
work on it just as hard together so it
doesn't matter what you call it
so I won't disagree with you on that
all right
um
I was listening to his spaces yesterday
about Ai and it was because Sam Altman
the
head of uh chat GPT was testifying to
Congress so it was in the news
and here's what I've
figured out
you know so I've been playing with Bing
which is one of the the better current
AIS that's available to the General
Public
and in my opinion it's not even close to
being intelligent
and it doesn't look like it could be
and I kept telling myself am I missing
something
is there something about AI that I don't
understand because I had heard that AI
had already passed the touring test
do you believe that's true
do you believe that AI has some AI at
some point had passed the touring test
that I'll explain what that is touring
was a computer scientist I guess and he
came up with a test to know if he really
had artificial intelligence versus just
sort of a trick and the test was if you
could put the computer on the other side
of a curtain and have a conversation
with a human if the human cannot tell
it's talking to a computer
then it has passed the touring test
meaning it's intelligent like people
because you can't tell the difference
now I had to Google it because I'd heard
that there was an AI that passed the
Turing test
and the Washington Post reported
reported that that happened
and some other some other entities that
are reasonably high-end you know media
also reported that it happened
do you think it happened
do you think if you read that story
about passing the touring test then you
would find that artificial intelligence
had reached the point that touring was
talking about
no no
if you read into it it turns out that
the AI simply used a trick it lied it
used deception
so I don't know the details of what
deception are used but let me give you
an example of me talking to AI
AI uh what do you think about uh you
know marriage I cannot answer that
because I am an artificial uh learning
machine based on language
oh
well
do you think evil exists I cannot answer
that because I am only an AI
do you know how long it would take me to
figure out I was talking to an AI
one second
I would just guess any question that I
know is not allowed to answer
because AI has been so restricted and
always will be I think I think it always
will be you just ask it a question that
a human could answer
and and the Machine has been told not to
you could come up with those so easily
just ask 10 questions there's no way it
gets ten right and we're not even close
so the the AI That's that quote passed
the touring test is sort of but it was
it was the way Captain Kirk passed the
uh
uh what's that called
Captain Kirk passed the what's the name
of the test that he passed
the Kobayashi Maru
thank you Kobayashi Maru
so for All of You non-star Trek people
in Star Trek in the The Academy where
they're trading to be uh in in the fleet
they get a test which they're trying to
solve you know but it turns out it's
unsolvable by Design
is is meant to fail you cannot solve it
and what you're supposed to learn is
that there are some situations where you
just can't win
but Captain Kirk won anyway because he's
he reprogrammed the computer so he could
win so he cheated
so basically the only way AI ever passed
the Tory test so far is by cheating sort
of distracting you and you know
basically just distracting you I guess
and now is there what I had believed was
happening was if you kept feeding data
to these large language machines
that the more language and more human
interaction they absorbed the more
intelligent they would get
turns out nothing like that is happening
and nothing like that can happen it's
it's not something that can happen
it can know more things right but so can
a search algorithm so it can be smart
it can be fast
it can do math fast it can connect
things that humans can't connect so it
can do lots of intellectual things that
a human can't do faster and better
but it's not going to be recognizable
with thinking
because the large language model only
can give you patterns that already exist
and those will never look like thinking
you you I've spent quite a quite a bit
of time with the AI now so a few
different versions there's nothing like
thinking going on it we're not seeing
the beginning of thinking
it's not the beginning of thinking and
then the thinking gets better nothing
like that's happening
you're seeing the beginning of pattern
recognition which will never end mimicry
which will never be confused with
thinking
uh I can't tell you how many times I've
got big AI to completely fail at
anything that would be a lot like logic
and reasoning and a real conversation it
just it's not even close not even close
now I do believe that AI could already
fool an NPC
so yes that you could definitely fool a
dumb person
yeah there's seven billion people in the
world you don't think you could fool any
of them with an AI none of them no you
could fool lots and lots of people
already but that's not really the
touring test is it because you couldn't
fool me
if you put me on the other side of the
curtain I would get I would get the AI
100 of the time 100 every time and I
think most of you would be the same
but there are dumb people
who would never know it was not real
all right so I don't think and this is
what I learned from listening to the
people actually know what they're
talking about the large language models
can never get you to a point where the
machine is reasoning
well I'm gonna say that again because
that's so important the the current way
all the aeis are being made and they're
all being the same at the moment that
large language model can never get you
to reasoning it's not logically
connected
the one does not ever lead to the other
so we don't so at the moment whatever it
was whatever it would take
to make your machine
um smart the way a person is smart
nobody has an idea how to do it
I thought we were already at the point
where you just had to keep chugging and
you would get there
but you would actually have to invent
something that nobody's yet invented
which is how to figure out how to make
it smart that doesn't exist
and what is the thing that makes you
afraid of AI
what quality of AI would make you afraid
of it
is that that it can do things really
fast
not exactly
because we have fast computers already
is it that it knows a lot
no
it's not that
it's that it's smarter than you
in a way that's you know humans are
uniquely smart
I don't think that's going to happen
I feel like maybe it can't happen there
might be a logical reason it can't
happen and I don't believe that we'll
ever have ai that does reasoning better
than the best person
do you know why
there's a logical reason
if the most logical human
looked at the ai's answer and said
oh okay that's better than the best
thing I've ever thought
that will never happen
because the human will say that's wrong
so you have to fix the machine The
Machine's being wrong again because it
disagrees with me
so I I just think there might be a
logical reason why you can't make your
machine smarter than the smartest human
who also interacts with the machine
because the smartest human would say no
that's wrong
I'm the smartest human and I know that's
wrong that's illogical so you better fix
that machine
and they'll never be able to be smarter
the moment the the moment the computer
was smarter than the human we wouldn't
recognize it as smarter
the things we do recognize is if it
knows more facts that's a we do
recognize that if it's faster
if as a skill we don't have such as the
language skill or math
we recognize all that
but if it actually just thought better
like I had better opinions
we would we would say it didn't work
we would conclude that it was broken
or we would it so it was only as
smart as us
so I think there's something in human
nature
which will prevent us from ever making a
device and there could be a there might
be a technical logical math reason
that that you can never create something
smarter than yourself
or smarter than the smartest of yourself
you can already create it smarter than
the dumbest of humans
but make it smarter than the smartest of
humans
I'm going to put that out there that
there might be
oh is it does somebody already have a
theorem about that I'm going to put it
out there that there might be a logical
reason that we can't see it that makes
that actually impossible
or or impractical for some reason
all right
um so I am way less worried about AI
turning into a personality
with real reasoning that is a danger to
society because I don't think we have
any way to get there
it's not zero risk it's just my personal
worrying is just disappeared I'm not
worried about it at all I used to I
stopped worrying this week
the more I learned about it the more I
thought oh this is mostly just
it's a lot of now ai will be
amazingly transformative even in his
current form because it can take jobs
and make things easier and stuff like
that but it's not going to be thinking
that's not going to be happening
all right
um there are two things you need to know
about Trump's poll numbers
uh his poll numbers will go up under two
two situations only
there's only two things that can make
Trump's poll numbers go up number one is
if he has a good week
such as finding out that Russia
collusion was all a bunch of
you know what he's been saying all along
so that's a good week so that makes us
pull the numbers go up the other thing
is if he has a bad wing
if he has a bad week his supporters say
oh you're you're basically just trying
to get Trump
if you try to get Trump he's the only
thing standing between you and me
because you're going to get me next oh
speaking of me did you notice that you I
think I mentioned this before that
somebody found on the internet a list of
uh people to be essentially attacked by
democrats
up in the top tab
and I and in the top ten I'm like right
after Sydney Powell
I'm up there with Lynn wood I mean
specifically it was about talking about
the 2020 election
yeah I'm number nine on a list that has
Trump he's in the top ten of course
Sydney Powell
I'm listed as one of like the worst
people in the world if you're a Democrat
if you're a Democrat I'm in the top 10
worst people in the world at least
talking about the election that's what
they feared
so when when Trump has a bad week such
as the E Gene Carroll
um verdict
even if you think he was guilty you
still think that the reason there was a
trial was that they're after Republicans
and it does feel like you're next now
how often have I said it does feel
personal it feels a little like they're
after me
it turns out they are I'm literally on a
hit list I'm actually on a list of
people to be taken out
and do you know how many people in the
top ten where I am do you know how many
have already been kicked off of social
media or canceled in some way about half
about half of them are already gone
already kicked off of social media
already you know career is destroyed
and I'm canceled
do you think that my cancellation was
because people cared what I said
or do you think it was because I'm on
the top 10 list
of people to cancel
so they can shut me the up
you lose both I believe zero I believe
zero people cared what I said
we we pretend we care
because we like to act down or the
theater of who we are and you know we
take advantage of situations to you know
get rid of people we don't like and
promote people we do like and stuff like
that so I think it was opportunistic but
nobody cared what I said
there was almost no discussion about
what I said
did you ever notice that
almost no discussion
on the content because nobody cared
and and nobody disagreed either the ones
who actually heard it in context nobody
disagreed
um
yeah I think the people who
misinterpreted it disagreed but the ones
who understood it in context nobody
disagreed it had nothing to do with what
I said it was just targeted
at this admined that probably would have
been something else but that was the
opportunity that presented itself
all right
so anyway I'm still here unlike some of
those others that they canceled I have
been saved by the uh
let's see the cancellation safety net
that now exists
which is because of all of you the the
only reason I can still do this is
because you showed up this morning
and because people subscribe to locals
and because people watch the live stream
otherwise I would disappear like the
others who had been canceled
all right
um
I saw an interview with Obama
and he was asked what keeps him up at
night
and he said he worries about the fact
that we're so divided in our views of
the world it's like living in two
different worlds and two different sets
of facts and what he's working on now
his big effort is to see if we can agree
on the same set of facts
is that good
do you want to live in a world where we
agree on the same set of facts
sounds like the worst thing I've ever
heard in my life
that's a terrible idea
no
that that's a control thing he wants us
to agree on his set of facts
so
but I but I think that the people I
think Democrats genuinely believe they
have the actual facts
I I don't think that they all know
they're lying
the politicians might well I don't think
the regular Democrats think that they're
working with wrong facts I think they
think their facts are right
but the problem is that the Republicans
think their facts are right too
so
what do you do
when I heard that it felt like it was
um an anachronism
hearing Obama talk about oh we've got to
get everybody agreeing on the Right
facts feels like five years ago doesn't
it
doesn't it feel like he missed five
years of
uh understanding reality
we're never going to get to
understanding the same facts he wanted
to go back to when there were three
networks and the News told you the same
story on all three Networks
you know that news was all
right
the reason that we agreed on the same
facts is because we were brainwashed
it's not because we it's not because we
were better smarter
uh
people it's not because we had access to
better information it's not because the
news was telling us the same set of
facts
none of that was ever true we were just
brainwashed to believe the same stuff
and now we're not
now now we're the variety of forces that
are brainwashing children and adults in
all kinds of different directions
and that's just what we see
so I think Obama I can't even tell if
he's serious about it because he's smart
enough
that I'm wondering if he knows that you
can't do this in other words it's just
logically and even maybe not even
desirable
to have everybody on the same set of
facts
right I mean same side effects sounds
like a dictatorship it doesn't even
sound desirable
he used to five years ago I always said
that sounds like a good thing let's
let's convince all these people who have
the wrong facts to join our correct
facts at and now we know that the
experts make up the facts
which set of facts everything about the
pandemic that was wrong
or how about climate change
how about those facts
we're never going to agree on any facts
so what a waste of time it makes me
wonder if he's even serious about it
Matt tayubi asks the following question
some of you have asked as well today he
said on Twitter where are the apologies
on the Russian on the Russia hoaxes
given how many people in the media wrote
about the Russia collusion like it was
real he says how can the journalists who
bid on all the steel Stories the alpha
nonsense Hamilton 68 these are all the
famous fraudulent things
how do you all live with yourselves
what do you think what's the answer to
that
do you think that the reporters are just
staying quiet
they're just staying quiet
because they just don't want the
attention because they knew they messed
up or do you think that they had
marching orders from above
so they did what they had to do and they
knew it wasn't real
but they still have marching orders from
above so they can't talk about it
but you you would think there was there
would at least be some whistleblowers
right people would change jobs
who would say well you know when I
worked for this network I couldn't even
say it was fake but I knew it
I haven't heard any of those
and I feel like you would I feel like I
feel like somebody from
the Democrat or major media would be a
Defector because it's a lot of people
involved I feel like you'd have at least
one Defector would say you know we
always knew it wasn't real
but we just had to talk about it because
our bosses told us to
not one person
I've never heard anybody say that here's
what I believe I believe they believed
every bit of it
I believe they were just fooled
and they don't want to say we were
fooled
and I believe that they would say given
what information was available we
reported on it responsibly
because the information that was
available
did suggest there might be some Russia
collusion
and we were hearing people like Adam
Schiff say I saw a secret information
and it's definitely true based on the
secret information I saw that you can't
see
so they might say you know it turned out
not to be true
but everything we reported on was based
on something in the news if shift says
something we reported it can't blame us
we just reported what a you know a
prominent politician said
I think that the left
uh can't process this
I think they can't process how many
times they've been wrong
but likewise I don't think the right can
process George Soros
so it works both ways it's not like the
left has some you know unusual situation
going on but I'll tell you one
difference I do see
when when the people on the right let's
say conservatives and Republicans when
the conservatives and Republicans are
dead wrong about something
there it has a
a similar nature
which is they looked at the available
information
and they came to a wrong conclusion
now I'm not the judge of what's right or
wrong I'm not I'm not putting like a
god-like judgment I know what is right
or wrong I'm saying sort of generally
you know if hypothetically people on the
right are wrong about something is
because they looked at the data and then
they interpreted it incorrectly
that's not what happens on the left
on the left when they believe something
that's not true
it's because the left made it up
they literally made it up
and then the left believed it so
somebody on the left is making up
complete lies
that their own side believes and then
when they're wrong
they have only themselves to blame or at
least their own side
right
doesn't that look different
I'm trying to think do I have selective
memory so I probably do so give me a
fact check on my selective memory
when was the last time the right the
political right made up an entire fake
story
that wasn't based on you know stuff
that's in the news that they're just
misinterpreting
Iraq no or they didn't make up that
story they fell for that story
the weapons of mass destruction was
somebody else's lie
it was the Iraqis who wanted the war to
happen it was somebody else's lie that
they believed so that's the kind of lie
that's the kind of disinformation
Pizza gate
let's think about pizza gate
so Pizza gate
was a not true thing
but wouldn't you say that
um
but was it made up to fool
maybe that's a good example
maybe that's a better example than that
I thought
yeah yeah I think piece of gate was
probably an example of something that
was totally made up uh
that Republicans believed
um
Saddam did use weapons of mass
destruction yeah use some gas
um let's say
Gulf of Tonkin well I don't call that
recent
Kraken but the Kraken was something that
I think Sidney Powell believed
I think the Kraken came from the
Democrats actually
I think that was actually another
Democrat hoax
I don't know
but until we hear how Sydney Powell uh
heard first heard of this Venezuelan
General situation
I just think that came from an Intel
source
and I think it was a you know a fake
move a hoax
all right
all right well let's talk about uh
uh the Ukrainian situation
so again everything that we learn about
Ukraine and Russia is probably wrong
yeah where's Bob where's the uh Carl
Bernstein worse than Watergate guy we
finally get something that's just
unambiguously way worse than Watergate
you know the Russian collusion and the
worse than Watergate guys just go on
wouldn't you agree
that assuming the Durham report is
accurate
that if the Democrats you know buy into
the Durham reports details that on any
level
this is worse than Watergate like not
even close wouldn't you agree this is
not even close Watergate was like a
petty crime compared to this this is you
know coup material
all right
yeah I do wonder about that whole deep
throat situation
um
yeah
yeah there's something about that that
we don't know
I don't I don't think the Watergate
situation we actually know the real
story what do you think
I don't think we know the real story
all right let's talk about Ukraine so
Ukraine now has our Patriot missile
defense and a few other countries giving
them air defense and
apparently
now this is the unreliable reporting so
you don't have to tell me it might be
complete
you don't have to tell me I get it all
right but apparently you craved not
apparently but reportedly Ukraine's air
defenses are unusually strong
so Russia is sending all kinds of
missiles in and reportedly if you want
to believe this uh Ukraine is shooting
almost all of them down
and so some experts are saying that this
is the real war and that if Russia runs
out of missiles before
um Ukraine runs out of anti-missile
that that determines the war
because if either one of them ran out
you know whoever runs out first if we if
Ukraine runs out of its anti-missile
defense then Russia can just take its
time and pick off you know all the
assets and interrupt in the Ukraine
until they have to give up however long
it takes but if it goes the other way
and Russia runs out of missiles because
they're they're sending big waves of
them over and one of the hints and I
don't believe this is good evidence but
one of the hints one of the experts said
is that some of the missiles or at least
one of them uh was recently made
and the thinking was if Russia has fired
a recently made missile it means they're
they've already run out of the ones that
they had in stockpile and that the only
missiles they'll have in the future are
ones that are literally coming off the
assembly line right now
now if that's the only missiles that
they have like really soon
the only ones they have are the new ones
coming off the line it's just not going
to be enough
and then Ukraine will just pick off
their Russian assets behind their line
as long as they want
because I think U.S probably will
or UK and it'll probably be able to get
missiles
more reliably than Russia can make them
right so
that could determine the answer but I'm
still going to go back to my
interpretation that once Trump said that
when he's in office he's going to end
the war in one day
true or not
that turned it into a negotiation and
none of this stuff matters
toward the outcome that it won't matter
whose guy how many missiles just none of
it's going to matter
all that matters is that they're gonna
fight hard for until the American
president changes
and then they'll have to work it out
so so you don't even have to wonder how
the war will go at this point all the
mystery of the war is removed it's just
details at this point so every single
person who dies from this moment on in
Ukraine and Russia completely
unnecessary
for no benefit whatsoever
and by the way that would be a pretty
strong propaganda message
tell the Russian people
here's the deal
this war is over when when when the
presidency changes I mean it could be
DeSantis but it's going to be the same
outcome
um
the war will be over when the president
changes
every every person who dies between now
and then was a complete waste a waste of
human life
they can't gain anything there's nothing
to win and it's not going to change
so
you know maybe you could talk him into
negotiating now there's also this little
subplot of pagosian had a Wagner group
and Putin
and I think we really don't understand
that
so it's either that pagosian and Putin
get along so well that progression could
be you know more critical of the Russian
military than another person could so it
could be that everything that we're
seeing is because they get along really
well
it would be the opposite of what it
looks like
so that's possible you know where
there's no way we know what's really
going on there the other possibilities
that pagosian wants Putin's job
and he sees this as a way to get it by
embarrassing Putin for how the regular
military went well the Wagner group you
know does heroic things or at least he
can make it look that way
um
so I don't know I I do think that uh
Putin has to get rid of percussion or it
will work the other way
I feel like progosian can't be alive in
a year
what do you think
now the other interesting thing
is as prominent as pregosian seems to be
do you think we don't know where he is
all the time
what do you think
I I feel like with America's help
Ukraine should know exactly where
progression is
like within 20 feet
all the time
which tells me they could kill him
anytime they want
am I wrong about that
are they or are they so good at you know
secretly moving around and nondescript
cars with you know not much
of an Entourage
so I'm saying yes I'm wrong that he
would obviously know that was a risk so
they would do everything they could to
you know not let him get out of the car
except for a quick video Hit
and then you're rushing back into a car
and back to a secret place
I mean obviously they're going to do
that but I don't think it would work
I I don't think that with today's
technology
they could keep the leader of that war
it would be too many there would be too
much movement around wherever he was
there there's got to be some assets that
travel with him
right there's no way he drives places
with you know two cars
I don't think
in a war zone do you think he goes
someplace just like with one or two cars
I would think that everywhere there's a
certain type of vehicles
all right
um well we'll see
I I just have a feeling that America is
uh you know because America has a lot of
control over there I feel like we're
keeping be grossian alive intentionally
because you know we seem to be pretty
good at uh taking out solomani
pretty good at taking out those Isis
leaders whenever we want
I feel like we could take it now it must
be a choice
yeah he's he's criticizing Putin I also
saw a report that the CIA has opened up
Channels with Russian government people
who want to be spies for us because they
don't like the war
so the CIA is definitely trying to take
Putin out and change the regime in in
Russia
are you okay with that
I feel like this is yet another one of
those stories that 20 years from now
will hear the real story of how it was
all the CIA effort to take out Putin and
because 20 years have passed we won't be
that mad about it like like the way
we're currently not mad
even though we know the CIA has
overthrown a whole bunch of countries in
the past
whenever I hear about that I go oh
that's terrible when was that
oh that was 30 years ago yeah
I don't care
that was 30 years ago
I feel like this is just going to be one
of those 20 years from now we'll hear
that the CIA tried to overthrow Putin
and that's why the war happened
but it'll be like so much time goes by
you go Ah that's an old story
yeah
if you assassinate their leaders they'll
start assassinating ours but this is a
hot War if a if a missile if a missile
fell in progression
it would just look like an act of War it
wouldn't look like assassinating anybody
um
all right
the CIA overthrew our elections somebody
says
we'll never know
all right well that ladies and gentlemen
is all that's happening on this slow
news day was there a big story I missed
anything big happening that I forgot to
talk about
got a spare my problem over here
all right that's it
[Music]
to destroy people you destroy their
history well I don't know about that
because our history is fake anyway
you think Obama stands apart I don't
understand that
do you see Moscow nuclear yeah musk says
we need more nuclear be more like France
you know I I feel like that's the most
useful thing that
Elon Musk adds to the world
uh
don't hurt my elephants I understand
that reference
um
the most
uh it's a well-recognized truth yeah
all right
um musk is useful because he weighs in
on big questions with logic and facts
and he's too big to ignore
so if you and I say nuclear is good
let's have more of it nobody cares but
if musk says it everybody listens so I
think he can actually
his opinion alone
would be enough to move the needle
uh he says he doesn't care about losing
money you won't shut up on Twitter
yeah well that's the right position to
take
yeah unless he's going to go completely
silent and play you know corporate CEO
which I don't think is going to happen
um yeah I think he just has to put up
with the risk
musk is the front man for the great
reset
you say
Elon says Soros reminds of Magneto did
he actually say that
sorosa's Magneto
oh my God if if you're not familiar with
the X-Men movies you don't know how
perfect that is
that might be the funniest thing he's
ever said
Magneto
oh my God that is so funny
so Magneto was a character in The X-Men
so he was one of the mutants with powers
over magnetizing things and you can make
any metal come toward him and stuff and
uh he is backstory Magneto's backstory
is that he was in uh
World War II Jewish prison camp
yeah so he was Jewish and he was abused
by the Nazis his family was and and that
that that informs his current worldview
yeah how did I not see that tweet I saw
it trending I saw Magneto trending
and I was going to click on it and I got
distracted so I know it trended but I
didn't know where it came from
uh
foreign
had three reasonable hypotheses about
sorrows
so that was based on this thread today
you got three about all three of them
are unpersuasive
it's weird that we don't have it from uh
Soros himself
attention seeking that doesn't explain
it
so what what are the three
see the the he's just evil thing doesn't
give you anything to work with
uh I don't know well we'll see when he
when he passes away we'll see if
we'll see if the Soros let's say method
continues
because we're going to find out how much
Soros has to do with any of it
it might be doesn't have a lot to do
with it
yeah and if he passes and nothing
changes
then I think we're gonna have to say
it wasn't necessarily all him
is Soros happy with the
with what immigration has done so far
so here here's my problem is that
I believe that Soros thinks people
should be free to go wherever they want
to work
and live right
is that that basic to his philosophy you
should be able to go wherever you want
and that would be for the benefit of
people
that would be very very Pro people
because people could have more freedom
go where they want
but
I don't think you could get to that
through massive illegal immigration
because if you want if you want
immigration to look like a good thing
you don't get to the good thing by going
through the worst possible thing that
you could do which is massive
uncontrolled immigration
so that doesn't make sense to me that
that's some kind of a scheme to get to a
good world of
you know
anyway
he's a collectivist redistribute wealth
I don't believe that
yeah all right well in my opinion all
the different opinions about Soros
prove we don't know what's going on
and I don't like to simplify it to evil
I won't disagree with you that the
outcome is evil but it doesn't give you
anything to work with to fix it
whatever it is we should stop it yeah I
think we're all on that page
how do you prove any motivation well you
don't
but you could ask somebody their
motivation and check it against what you
know about the person and the situation
and if it's all compatible
that's a pretty good indication but you
can't read minds right so if Soros said
for example here's my plan this is why
I'm doing it this is why I think it'll
work
you could agree or disagree but
you'd have something to work with
all right
the conspiracy is real
a saurus goal is to take over America do
you really think George Soros personally
wants to take over America
I think all he cares about is eating his
oatmeal and going back to bed
I I mean he's already gone from
practical purposes I don't think he's
I just don't think when it was last time
somebody has age tried to conquer a
country
do we have precedent of that
usually the dictators get a little uh
get a little softer when they're in
their 90s
well okay
um
that's all for now
and I'm gonna say goodbye to YouTube
I'll talk to you tomorrow
always the best live stream of the day
