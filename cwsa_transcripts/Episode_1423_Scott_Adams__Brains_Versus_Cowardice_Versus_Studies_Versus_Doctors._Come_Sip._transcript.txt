on the ball
those of you who are early risers and uh
dare I say assertive self-starters
you're all here early because you know
that if you missed the simultaneous sip
live well you're going to have to do it
record it
and the recorded simultaneous sip well
one of the best things in the world is
not the best thing in the world which
would be the live simultaneous sip which
is coming at you just about now and all
you need is a cup of micro glass a
tanker Chelsea's dying
I can't think of Alaska vessel of any
kind
how's my audio today pretty good right
fill your cup with your favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine hit
of the day the thing that makes
everything except my audio better it's
called the simultaneous Sip and it
happens now go
um did you get the live one yeah it's
better isn't it
no surprise
well
may I start with the news of the day
the big news of the day
is like the big news of yesterday and
the news of the day before
because there's not much big news
happening
so we need something to be afraid of
are you ready
beware
of the Delta variable the Delta variable
is coming for you oh yeah you thought
you were out of the woods no that
doesn't sell clicks how can you sell
advertisement on news programs if you've
solved a pandemic you can't what you
need is
the delto variant Beware of the Delta
variant which is under your bed it's
under your bed it's in your closet
children
put on your masks Beware of the Delta a
variable
or variant
now I don't know how afraid of the Delta
variant you should be
I know I'm not afraid of it because I
got vaccinated
and you know the the funny thing about
vaccinations if there's anything funny
about them is that it's caused this uh
cattle versus sheep kind of thing
we humans so love to be on a team and
hate the other team that will make a
team out of anything
and suddenly it's like oh you're on the
moderna vaccination team or the Pfizer
team like what if I don't want to be on
a team
what if I just want to get vaccinated
I don't have to be on a team do I
so here's the thing my particular
vaccination apparently is effective
against the Delta variant oh I might
have other risks getting vaccinated but
not the Delta variant so your mileage
May differ
but we'll see if the Delta variant gets
us because you got to be afraid of
something
so the House of Representatives voted
yesterday
to approve a resolution to create a
committee to look into the January 6
Capital attack
can you think of anything that you would
like your government to do less than
that
if you were to make a list of all the
things you think are important
that your government should look into
where would you put on your list of top
priorities for the country where would
you put form a committee to look into
the January 6 Capital attack
I don't have any questions left about
that do you
suppose we find out there were some bad
actors in the group
I don't care it's not like a few bad
actors caused it to happen they might
have been there
well what if you find out that all the
people there had different motives
we kind of know that
what if you find out that a large group
of Americans had some really bad actors
in it
is there any possibility there weren't
are there any large group of Americans
that don't have any Bad actors in them
what if we find out there were FBI
Assets in the group
of course there were
so we already know that
do you think the FBI uh informants or
assets cause the riots do you think they
pushed them well you don't need a
committee to look into that do you it
seems like law enforcement would be
looking into that
um or not
so I don't see any purpose of this
whatsoever except political just to keep
it as a story
I think uh was it McCarthy who who
warned that you would lose your
committee assignments if you're
Republican and you and you joined this
committee so I don't know that this will
go anywhere very political completely
useless
big story of the day
well uh Brittany
Britney Spears is still a prisoner of
her conservatorship I guess she was
unsuccessful in getting that released
but Bill Cosby is a free man
that's right Britney Spears is still
under a conservatorship
dancing away in her bikini
but Bill Cosby
free man
now
I don't want to uh
cause anybody to feel bad about this
story
if you've been a victim of any kind of
crime like this or know anybody who has
or you're just a good person
you're probably quite offended by the
story of Bill Cosby going free
it turns out
that he is Accused by approximately 60
women
of a very similar crime
6-0
60
women
how does your lawyer get you out of jail
when 60 women have accused you of a
similar horrible crime
what kind of a lawyer can do that
well he here's the basic idea most of
these or all of them I think were past
the uh
uh stat statute of limitations
so there was only one
that was the subject of his going to
jail
and it turns out that he has some kind
of oral agreement
everything sounds naughty when you're
talking about Cosby now he had an oral
agreement with a lawyer and a lawyer a
prosecutor that he wouldn't be
prosecuted for that one crime uh if he
was forthcoming on the civil case I
don't really understand the details of
that but apparently he got some kind of
immunity
for the one thing that he was being
prosecuted for and it took them two
years to sort that out and a court
finally decided yeah you're right you
had the immunity so you can't be
prosecuted for the one that they could
prosecute
and a 60.
so
how often
can a rich guy get out of jail
with good lawyering lawyer lawyering
it's kind of impressive in a horrible
way isn't it
I mean what
is it is it possible to say every normal
criminal who's not famous do they all
also have a get in a jail free card if
they just lawyer well enough
because really this was just the quality
of the lawyering right that's the only
thing that made him get out of jail I
can't imagine that other people would
have gotten out of jail even in the same
circumstances
the funniest part of this story and when
I say funny I mean
like you're gonna vomit funny
uh Harvey Weinstein's lawyer uh thinks
that Harvey
will be next
oh that's bad my computer just glitched
let's see if I'm still on there all
right
um and I love the fact
I love the fact that Harvey Weinstein's
lawyer is trying to make a comparison
because first of all
Cosby is apparently guilty as hell
60 women accused him
you know it's hard it's hard to imagine
he's not guilty
but to to therefore say that because he
got off on that one technicality that
Harvey Weinstein is just like him and
and uh was falsely accused it takes a
lot of lawyer balls to make that
argument
but Harvey Weinstein's
lawyers making that argument that
because this completely unrelated case
where the guy is guilty as got off
on a technicality
therefore his his client who has nothing
to do with Cosby whatsoever in a
completely different situation should
also be suffering
totally logical
not
all right
uh on school choice
we've been watching the change in
attitudes here so listen to this
according to uh Corey DeAngelis in a
tweet yesterday
a year ago ish 64 percent of the public
was in favor of funding the students
instead of the school system meaning
that the student could take their
funding and go to any other school that
would accept it and the money would just
travel with the student instead of going
to a public school
um so now it's going from 64 percent
we're in favor of the money following
the student up to 74 now
74 of those surveyed
want the funding schedule thing to to
change and in fact a lot of states are
looking into doing that
um
and
somebody asked if Harvey Weinstein is
really guilty because he was just
trading sex for fame no I don't think
that was all he was doing he was
masturbating into a plant
at one point and I don't think he traded
anything for that I think he just
assaulted a plant
so no it is not fair to say that all he
did was trade sex for fame he was
actually a rapist it seems
all right but back to school choice it's
icky to put these topics right next to
each other but I did it anyway
see if we could deal with it so 74
percent of those polls say that the
funding should follow the student what
do I tell you about the 25 rule
you see it over and over again 25 of the
public
will answer the dumbest answer on any
poll
the poll could be are you in favor of
oxygen
25 of the public would say I don't think
so I'm not trusting that oxygen and I
don't think oxygen is real I think it's
fake it doesn't matter what the question
is 25 of the public can be reliable
idiots and so on the school choice thing
we've hit the the idiot level
so I've tell I think I've told you
before that we should consider a 75
being on the same side as unanimous
because that is all the smart people
the other 25 percent are just the
freaking morons who would vote against
oxygen and clean water and anything
for whatever reason the solid 25 are
against everything
all right so Fire season is starting in
California
so that's the end of my happiness uh if
you might remember last year
the pandemic was in place but well at
least we could go Outdoors not really if
you were in California and it was summer
you couldn't even go Outdoors
so you couldn't go anywhere indoors but
you also couldn't go Outdoors for many
weeks in California
that sucks
let me tell you
when you can't go indoors and you can't
go Outdoors you've got a very small
world and it's not cool but I'm entering
that phase now so we had we had a good
solid month where the coronavirus was
less and The Mask wearing was released
if you were vaccinated and the air was
clear
and now that appears to be ending and
I'm going into the long dark period of
California because California is so
poorly managed
that we let a problem which we know to
be a problem persist
doesn't change anything
nope we just keep on going with the same
problems
um
so there was a study on masks and Kids a
randomized controlled trial those are
the good kind right if it's randomized
and it's controlled
pretty good trial now that doesn't mean
it's right I think we've all learned
that you can't you can't trust any
individual study it's just not a thing
you should trust but this study said
there was a a
problem with carbon dioxide and kids and
masks so if kids wore masks for any
length of time the quality of the air
there was breathing went down so less
oxygen more carbon dioxide and
apparently that has some some types of
health risks and so the suggestion is
that maybe mess are bad for kids
did you need a study for that
I'm not sure you needed a study to
decide not to put masks on kids but your
mileage might differ maybe you're afraid
of
the Delta variant beware the Delta
variant put masks on the kids because
the Delta variant is coming for you
so
I wondered how long it would take for
somebody to debunk this study
it took Andrea's back house about five
minutes until he saw my tweet and came
in and said
you know every time uh Andres or uh
Anatoly lubarsky my two favorite critics
anytime they criticize something I just
shake my head because it's usually
something I should have seen you know
even with my limited analytical
abilities even I should have seen it but
I didn't really look for it usually uh
here's what Andre says about this study
uh he says in the JMA paper there's no
difference when measuring only the
inhale there
they have to throw in inhaled and exhale
there to find something
now I'm not sure I totally understand
that
but it looks like on the surface
that the inhaled air was fine
but the exhale there had too much carbon
dioxide in it how is that even a thing I
mean I'm not I don't even know how that
could be a thing
uh but the suggestion is that maybe you
should ignore that paper
you know or at least wait for more
papers to confirm it but uh put a little
put a little asterisk next to that paper
that said
um children and mass seems like a bad
idea to me
so it's been a few days now since Tucker
Carlson talked about the NSA spying on
him
and no news organizations seem to be
agreeing with him including his own
and the NSA has denied it in a way that
confirmed it now we talked about this
yesterday the nsa's overly specific
denial is as clear a confirmation that
it happened as anything just clearly
confirming it
and and we just moved on
how did that happen
this should be one of the biggest
stories in the country if not the world
that the government was spying on a
political
person you know somebody who talks on
the news and
and then they basically confirmed it by
denying it in a way that really does
confirm it
and we just let that go
I guess there's just nothing you can do
about it you know maybe there's some
legal thing that Tucker is looking into
but
can you see how thoroughly the the news
business can just make a story go away
they just made this thing go away
I don't know what would be bigger than
this
uh I'm saying Matt Gates is calling for
an investigation
as well he should because you know Matt
Gates is being invested is being watched
by the NSA
don't you don't you figure that Matt
Gates is being spied on one way or
another now it may not be directly they
may have some some case in which they're
looking for somebody else's stuff but
they just get his incidentally but I
would say that the odds that Matt Gates
is not being spied on by our government
is low
it's probably low
I'm almost curious in fact I think the
odds that my digital Communications are
compromised are
100 percent
I mean I don't know that there's any
chance they're not
I would say that if you have any
public standing in terms of politics and
standing in this case just means you
talk about it you have an audience if
you have an audience
and you might be persuading people one
way or another
I feel like your digital Communications
is all penetrated by now if not by my
own country
than by you know foreign intelligence
people
I would think that somebody would want a
blackmail Me by by now
isn't it weird that I haven't well you
wouldn't know I guess I wouldn't admit
it if I had been but uh I haven't been
blackmailed by anybody strangely enough
and again if I had that I suppose I'd
lie about it
all right
see I'm at my laptop keeps dying here
and that makes me think that
over on locals can you tell me if my
feed just went dark when my computer
timed out and I don't think my computer
should be timing out when I've got a
live stream going so
so locals make the make the see what you
can do to make sure my screen doesn't go
to screen saver
all right
um
as uh Adam dopamine said today on
Twitter
now Adam is a medical doctor he's an MD
and he tweets us when you see 97 percent
of doctors agreeing on whatever that is
meaningless it's a lie of consensus now
on some level you knew that right you
knew that just because everybody agreed
that doesn't necessarily make it true
but let's take that to a deeper level
he says as an MD I can attest that the
vast majority of doctors outside of
universities do zero primary research
we know what we read in journals learn
at conferences or here at uh late here
on the Lay News
so in other words the doctors are
basically getting their information the
same way you are and they don't have any
special expertise to know if it's true
so how so if there's one study
and then the doctors read it all the
doctors will agree and you'll say to
yourself well all those doctors agree
but it doesn't mean anything
because the doctors are just looking at
the same thing you're looking at oh
there's a study you looked at it and it
said X works the doctor looked at it and
said X works and he came to the same
conclusion the doctor
added nothing
now and if you don't know that that all
the doctors agree it literally means
nothing
let me
um let me take you back to and I think
Adam pointed this out do you remember
when we were told that 17 intelligence
agencies agreed on what was it on Russia
collusion or something
do you remember that there were 17
intelligence agencies agreed who was and
this will be a test of your memory
anybody who's been following me for a
while
who was the only person in the country
I think the only person public person
who is the only public person in the
country who said as soon as I saw the 17
intelligence agencies that really means
one
who else immediately said no 17 agencies
means one
the other 16
didn't reproduce the work
they just looked at the one
Uh something's happening
noisy there's some noise happening here
um right so if you worked in a in a
large organization as I did and you
happened to be the author of The Dilbert
comic
if you're the author of The Dilbert
comic you know how
bureaucracies work that the agreement is
just people agreeing with other people
right
so
um and I see some other names in the
comments
um but I think I might have been the
first to say it out loud
yeah a lot a lot of people who are maybe
not in the public I were saying it
privately so I don't claim that nobody
else thought of it but I don't think
anybody was dumb enough to say it out
loud as soon as I did
so whenever you see that just to keep in
mind that you're not talking about
experts looking at experts you're
talking about people just like you
looking at experts
now Andres Backhouse weighed in on this
and he said I had a tweet I was recently
reminded by a German MD
that medicine as a study program doesn't
aim at qualifying for scientific medical
research
meaning that if you study to be a doctor
you have not learned how to do medical
research and therefore you haven't
learned how to read it either
so you can get through the program says
Andres without having read a single
paper or having analyzed data you can
become a doctor without ever looking at
a published study and learning how to
read it correctly or analyze it or be
critical
so those are the people who are telling
you
what to believe
people you believe are qualified but
have never even taken the courses
who would you trust somebody like
Andres and somebody with an economics
background who has studied you know at
least could look at data and studies and
and know if at least the math is done
right
who are you going to study who are you
going to believe somebody who's not a
doctor
but knows how to look at a study or
somebody who is a doctor
who doesn't know how to look at a study
so those are your choices
um I would like to nominate myself for a
Nobel Prize and either science or
medicine and I'm open to whichever one
they'd like to give me maybe both
so I'm going to present to with you now
to you now
my proposal for why I
should receive a Nobel Prize in science
or medicine either one both would be
fine
and I'm going to give you my scientific
theory
that will change everything are you
ready
this is based not on my medical
understanding of course
this is based not on my scientific
understanding
of course
this is based on pattern recognition
and being pretty good at hearing a dog
that doesn't bark
and goes like this
and I'm going to lay out my argument
there is a mystery about viruses which
is why they go away
why did they ever go away
now if I said to you why is it that
viruses go away in the summer I know
from experience every one of you who are
not doctors and not virologists will be
quite sure you know the answer and
you'll say to me well Scott it's obvious
it's warmer and viruses don't like that
people go Outdoors they don't have the
indoor air conditioning circulating
things they get more vitamin D so
they're healthier the virus has mutated
by them Scott don't you know that people
have reached herd immunity by them
right you would have lots of reasons why
viruses go away
but did you know
that the experts
don't believe any of them
meaning that everything you can think of
for why any virus goes away forget about
coronavirus just antivirus Spanish Flu
antivirus any seasonal virus why does it
ever go away
the experts don't know
the experts don't know so when you say
it's obvious it's vitamin D the experts
thought of that right you're not the one
who thought of it the experts looked
into Vitamin D they looked into
everything and they can't find it they
can't find the reason that a virus goes
away did you know that it's a
fascinating fact now it could be the
combination of things
but here's the problem every time you
say
the reason the virus goes away is that
it has something to do with seasonality
here's the problem
it's always winter somewhere
and these viruses are global
the virus should always be able to hide
wherever the conditions are still good
and then because people are traveling
around the world routinely
that the virus would just go wherever it
can live the best and it might
[Applause]
[Music]
hello
and it would just go wherever uh
wherever it needs to live so in theory
any virus that has not reached herd
immunity and that appears to be
everything
because even even the Spanish flu I
don't think ever came close I don't
believe it ever came close to herd
immunity so things are going away for
reasons we don't know here is why I will
get the Nobel Prize because I'm going to
tell you what the secret is you ready
here are things we know
number one we know that the amount of
viral load you get initially determines
how sick you get everybody agree with
that the amount you initially get
has is very highly correlated with how
sick you get
I think everybody agrees with that
therefore
if you've got just a small exposure to
it while you are otherwise healthy
would you get immunity
that didn't show up
when you were being tested for immunity
so here's my hypothesis
and why I'll get the Nobel Prize for
sites or possibly medicine or possibly
both
I believe that what's unique about the
summer
is that people get exposed to micro
doses of the virus and that they they
develop something like a pre-immunity
meaning that if you check them for
antibodies maybe you wouldn't find them
the way you're expecting to find them
but that you're that your body has been
warned essentially basically it's been
prepped by tiny little exposures but not
enough to make you sick because you're
out in the sun and you're outdoors and
maybe you get a little whiff of it from
passing somebody
so my hypothesis is
herd immunity but
not measurable
meaning that if you measured and
antibodies in the normal way you just
wouldn't find it but that there's
something about the micro exposure that
preps some bodies in a way that may be
as hard to detect to just be a little
bit more alert for this specific problem
and it just gets on it faster
because that could be it it could be it
could be nothing more than somebody's
are responding faster now I suppose the
other possibility is that some people
have natural immunity to anything and
that herd immunity doesn't really have
to be 70 maybe it needs to be 35 and
we've never been right about herd
immunity that's the other possibility
um
somebody says nope no Nobel for you all
right well that's I'm going to stick
with that hypothesis that it has to be
something about your somebody's prepping
but not in a way that we can detect
all right that'll probably take 10 or 20
years for me to get that Nobel Prize but
I'm patient I can wait
I would like my critics to make up their
minds
my critics call me a coward
sometimes they call me a coward for uh
saying that face masks work in some
situations
and that I am a coward
for taking that position
but at the same time the fact that I got
a vaccination with this so-called risky
experimental vaccine
um makes me foolhardy
so I am simultaneously a coward about
mass at the same time I should be much
more afraid but I'm not about vaccines
so could my critics make up their mind
am I a coward or am I foolhardy because
I can't be both
and if you're going to criticize me at
least be consistent will you am I
foolhardy or am I a coward please make
up your mind well I would like to add
this if you would like to find who the
dumbest people in the world they're the
ones who call anybody a coward for a
risk management decision
all of us are making risk management
decisions all of us are trying to make
the decision that lowers our risk if
you're trying to make decisions that
lower your risk
based on you know incomplete data and
the best you can do about making your
guess are you a coward or are you like
every person in the world with
every decision for every
year every minute of the whole
 civilization
all of your decisions
yours mine everybody's decisions are
comparing risks
that's everybody all the time with every
decision
if your best analysis is that somebody
was a coward
you're a idiot
and I hate to be the first to tell you
you don't know how to analyze anything
you're just a idiot
if if that's your filter on life it's
like oh this one's a coward he got a
vaccine
he's so afraid he's so afraid of the
Coronavirus
or he's wearing a mask because it's the
law he must be a coward what kind of a
coward is he
please
if if your best analytical approach is
calling somebody a coward because they
made a different risk management
decision than you did
don't talk in public
please don't ever talk in public you do
not have the brains to say things out
loud
right at the very least talk in terms of
risk management perhaps you have a
different opinion of the risk
let's say
you're one of these people like uh
sticks and hex and Hammer or 666.
who apparently has decided that the risk
of getting the vaccine
is higher than the risk of getting the
Coronavirus
is he right
what do you think is uh sticks and hex
and Hammer or 666 on Twitter a lot of
you know
very reasonable guy right if you've
watched the show you know he's very
reason based very rational
is that the right decision
how the would you know
how the would you know
if if the risk of getting the
vaccination is higher in the long run
than not getting it you don't know that
now I made a decision
but is it because I know that my my risk
management is right no no am I going to
tell you that the sticks and hex and
Hammer 666 got it wrong
no
no how the would I know
do you know how much the risk of the I
don't know the the variants that are
caused by the vaccination the long-term
effects of the vaccination
somebody says he's right Paul
you don't know if he's right you
couldn't know that nobody Einstein
couldn't know that all the smartest
people in the world can't know that it's
unknowable 100 percent
unknowable
but you still have to make a decision
right so I made a decision based on a
number of variables and one of the
variables was that it would free me up
to you know travel and not have to wear
a mask and stuff now did I make the
correct decision
to get the vaccination
how the would I know
it's impossible to know nobody has
enough information about the future to
know which way is right I'll tell you
what what I was influenced by
I was influenced by the fact that
apparently most side effects happen
early
so I had waited a number of months and I
saw how many you know side effects there
seemed to be compared to how many people
got the vaccination and it looked like
we have most side effects happen early
there weren't that many compared to what
I saw as the risk of the coronavirus am
I right
is that is that a uh and let's say
accurate or useful analysis
how the would I know
it's unknowable right I do know it made
me feel better
right so whoever says John you're dead
wrong everybody who has certainty about
the risks of vaccination
versus the risk of not vaccination all
the people with certainty are your
idiots
you're just idiots I'm sorry
and you should not watch this live
stream anymore you're not smart enough
to watch this live stream you could be
uh you could be confident that you made
the right decision for yourself
that would be fair you could be
confident that there are certain type of
risks you're not comfortable with but
maybe other kinds that you are
oh that would be fair that would be a
reasonable decision but if you say to
yourself you're dead wrong to get the
vaccination or you're dead wrong not to
get the vaccination you're an idiot
there's no way around that
that's like brain that doesn't work
you can't know what was the
right decision you just have to take
your best shot at it
if I'm wrong
and let's say I get a horrible disease
from the vaccination I'm not expecting
that but let's say I do
would you then say well Scott I told you
well if you do you're a idiot
because you didn't know you got lucky
somebody's going to be right right
somebody in the long run will look more
right than somebody else it's not
because you're knew you don't
 know
you're guessing all right so get over
yourself if you're confident that you're
positive about vaccinations you're a
 idiot because nobody should be
confident about this at all
at all all right
maybe I've taken that too far
here's what uh Queen of the Universe
elect says on Twitter to my points about
this she said about masks and about
vaccination she says both are evidence
of your cowardice
you were so afraid of the pandemic the
pandemic that you got the risky vaccine
it wasn't out of foolhardiness it was
out of cowardice this fear is so deep
that you believe we should all be
forcibly vaccinated to protect you it's
very sad
um
no I don't believe you should all be
forcibly vaccinated to protect me do you
know why
I got the vaccination I don't need you
to be vaccinated
so opposite opposite of that I'm
unafraid
because I'm vaccinated
was I ever afraid of masks no I just
didn't like them
you know for a variety of obvious
reasons yeah so it's a mind reading and
it's someone who is sure that my bravery
and my cowardice are exactly the same
thinking this is this is people who
imagine they can think but they really
can't
these are really really dumb people who
have certainty about this okay so don't
be the certain person you could be for
vaccinations or against them that's fine
I think you could make an argument
either way
but don't be certain don't be that
person
all right
um
let's see uh there's a study that says
that the covet can destroy your penis
so there's a study that found that
people had recovered still had uh
coveted in their penis
and at least a few cases not enough to
be statistically relevant yet but
anecdotally there are some people who
seem to have become impotent after
getting the coronavirus and it's still
in their penis
now
um
the doctors haven't been uh specific
about this but I think this is an
obvious case like breast exams
uh you should you should examine your
penis on a regular basis
um I think that's what Jeffrey tubin was
doing
a lot of people think he was pleasuring
himself but that was really a
self-examination
he was wondering if he'd been infected
with the covert the covet virus and he
was just finding out it was just
examination to see if his junk was still
working and apparently he was so good
for you
all right now how much uh how much
should you put in your belief
that coronavirus will make you impotent
probably not a lot
probably not a ton
but you've got the Long Haul problem
with covid but allegedly people have had
problems with the vaccination
which one is bigger
so for all of you who are just positive
you are just positive in your opinion
for all of you
tell me the risk
of having a vaccination out bad outcome
versus the risk of having a long-term
coronavirus problem remember that's even
if you live
having a long long-haul problem so what
are the risks
so many of you are very very certain of
the risks so for all of you who are so
certain
please compare with compare to me in the
comments give me the risk of a vaccine
vaccination bad outcome
versus the risk of a coronavirus
long-haul problem
what what you don't know
but you were so certain just minutes ago
where are all my where all my convinced
people who are so sure that one of those
choices is cowardice well obviously you
would know the risks because you
couldn't compare the risks to know which
one is the cowardest one unless you knew
the risk is it one percent
all right hahaha
um
you know and let me say somebody said
I'm changing Minds about getting the
vaccination that's not my intention
I I'm quite adamant about the fact that
you shouldn't get your medical advice
from cartoonists all right that's not I
don't say that just as a bumper sticker
really seriously don't get your medical
advice from cartoonists but if I can
help you think about it a different way
and you can talk to your medical experts
more productively maybe that's good but
don't don't get your decisions from the
cartoonist don't do that
all right um
and I think I just lost the feed here
because my laptop keeps dying
so sorry about the screensaver going out
uh on locals
um
all right just look I'm looking at some
of your comments we're all good over
there good thank you it's back all right
yeah so the screen saver was knocking my
live feed off on my laptop doesn't
happen on here so I'll have to so I've
told you every time I add a complication
to the live streaming it does go bad
the complication here is that using the
laptop as a the screen saver that I need
to deactivate
so there's one more thing I have to
remember to do
um still working on the microphones by
the way I'm going to try to get my road
Caster working I figured out how to give
phantom power to some microphones on it
which was not obvious at first
but I figured out my phantom power
problem and now I got to figure out how
to get
sound out of the road caster so this is
how far I got I've got a mixing board
where I can get the sound into it now
with all of my microphones
I just can't get any sound out of it
I've got to figure that out
um
here's a question I might never get the
virus why risk taking the vaccination
Donnie
I I just don't know what to say to that
I just don't want to say that
if if you don't know the risk of the
vaccination and you also don't know the
risk of getting the virus
you don't know which one's bigger
and nobody can tell you nobody else
knows either nobody knows that stuff
you're gonna have to make the decision
without knowing which one is the bigger
risk
now I happen to feel
that given that the fact that most
vaccinations are going to show you a bad
impact fairly quickly
that gives me some comfort along with
the fact that we know that it does
create antibodies and it does work so we
know it works
and we know that the period where you
would see the most problems doesn't seem
to be a big risk of course some be some
people will always have problems with a
mass rollout of any kind of new medicine
um
all right
somebody says moderna gave you a vertigo
well keep in mind if you're like most
people you get at least one mystery
illness per week
is there anybody who doesn't get a
mystery illness every week
like I'll wake up and like ow my earlobe
wow why does my earlobe hurt and it'll
hurt all day and they'll just go away
the next day you wake up it's like ah my
sinus my sinus
pretty much every week right have you
have you ever gone a week where you
didn't have at least one mystery illness
my ankle ah I could barely walk on this
one ankle okay it's okay by tomorrow
how could it be possible that people
people you know tens of millions of
people getting the vaccination
of course there should be millions of
stories of people who got the
vaccination and then ah my eye my eye of
course it has to happen it can't not
happen you know just the the the way
numbers work
all right
I think I have uh
angered everybody those people who have
a certainty about their risk management
decisions have all gone away because
I've either shamed you or you you'll
never watch me again
uh one of those two things is happening
right now
somebody says a co-worker got vertigo
badly
um I I don't know that vertigo is
necessarily a vaccination problem
but I'm open to it could be
all right
um
that's all for now I'm going to turn off
uh YouTube I'm going to talk to my
locals people here for another minute
and I will see you tomorrow
