well today will be interesting
want it
yes it will because it turns out
this is far too glaringly white isn't it
too glaringly white we're going to use
this in a minute
but let's get it out of my way for now
all right
so
congratulations to all of you for
showing up at the best place in the
entire
metaverse
yeah yeah this used to be the best place
in the world
but then facebook announced that it was
going to create infinite new
metaverse worlds in virtual reality and
ar and now
now we know it's the best thing in all
of those worlds yes and if you'd like to
take it up a level all you need is a
copper mug or glass a tanker jealous or
stein
a canteen jugger flash a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid i
like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasured
pleasured
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine of
the day
the thing that makes everything better
except the shipping containers it's
called the simultaneous sip and it
happens now go
ah
antibodies
well in no particular order
my favorite story of the day
i saw erica
you all know erica right
erica
tweeted this apparently
at a louisiana high school
there was a violent week of fighting at
the high school
and a bunch of dads
got together
to basically help out at the school so
this
volunteer group of dads
i'm looking at a meme of me as cornholio
that's happening over in locals right
now
so the dads on duty they put their
little shirts on they say dad's on duty
and they go hang out with the kids and
turns out the kids kind of like it which
is weird i'm not sure the reporting is
all accurate but it looks like
the students appreciated having some
adult
dad-like figures and the funny part of
the story is that the dads were just
making dad jokes
and the kids were laughing at the dad
jokes but it just changed it sort of
changed the vibe
of the school and apparently made a big
difference
so
kudos to dads on duty
uh if you saw this story
i feel like
this is one of those weird periods in
history right
now
if you saw the visual of the story
that all the dads are african-american
and
uh they're all big guys too they're like
they're just really big guys
and
i feel like i had to mention that even
though it's not relevant to the story
like we're in that weird time where
the fact that uh all the dads involved
seem to be black
somehow that mattered but it doesn't
matter like the story doesn't require it
but somehow it
adds flavor to the story or something
so um oh i guess maybe maybe this is
maybe this is the angle on that that
makes it a little special
is that it's just a great solution
maybe we can see more of it
i don't know
uh actor peter scolari passed away age
66 from cancer
i have a peter scalari
story
one of the weird things about my life
is i just end up meeting a lot of people
who
who end up being in the news
and years ago when i was doing a dilbert
tv show
we were casting for the the talent for
the various dilbert parts
and
just the interesting thing i learned
that involved peter scolari because he
was one of the people who uh
well i i can't use the word uh
tried out for the part and that's the
point of the story so apparently in
hollywood there's there are three levels
of uh actors
at the bottom level the people who are
new to the game
um
i see i see you all like fighting you
naked
i saw your comment
um
so the three level of celebrities i
learned this when i was i was working
there at the bottom level they have to
audition for every role
because they're not famous nobody knows
them you just have to audition or you're
not going to get the job
at the next level up
you still need to audition
but you're a little bit famous or even
you know a lot famous
and they don't want to call it an
audition
so you do a fake audition
but you call it a meeting
and so
peter scalari was already quite
successful from you know bosom buddies
and other stuff
and
so when when his name came up and we
invited him in to i think he was
trying for the role of the dilbert voice
if i recall
and
uh you have to do this whole thing where
you you pretend you're not
actually um
you're not actually doing an interview
you just have a conversation
and so you pretend that when he tries
out
he auditions that he's actually just
having a conversation with him he's not
actually auditioning
so so it goes like this you know you'll
be you know hey what do you think of
this you know interested in this role
you know you make conversations and
stuff and and at some point the actor
will say yeah you know and so let me
look at this uh
you know were you looking for something
like you know he'll do a voice he'll do
a take and you'll say yeah yeah that's
pretty good uh
well you know we're thinking about that
maybe maybe a little
more serious or something maybe give him
a note but you wouldn't ask him to do it
again
he would have to volunteer to do it
again
so this whole weird etiquette of how to
deal with you know different levels of
celebrity you just can't ask him to
audition he's just got a volunteer
anyway he didn't get the job
but i will tell you he was he was very
talented
the the the people who were successful
professionals actors and actresses i'm
not even sure if you use actors anymore
they could do different takes on the
same character
and other people couldn't
and it was fascinating to watch so
somebody like a peter scolari
could come in and give you you know one
one kind of vibe
and then you'd say well you know make
this change and they could give you a
whole different vibe
for the for the voice and others just
couldn't do it they could do 10 versions
of the same voice
so there is a difference between those
who can act and those who can't and
i will say peter's glory had it he had
the gift
and i got to see it live and it was a it
was a treat
um
and by the way at the top level of the
stardom you don't ask them to do
anything you just offer them the part
right if it's tom cruise you just offer
them the part
uh the best biden means that we saw
coming out of the strange behavior where
biden's hands were in front of him like
beavis and butthead and cornholio i
don't know how many you saw but the ones
i liked were the
the meme where somebody put ski poles in
his hands put him on the ski ski slope
the jet pack was good did you see the
jet pack one
lifting off of the jet pack
the riding a tiny horse
he had the reins in his hands he's on
top of a miniature horse
very good
very good
and of course cornhole leo was my
favorite did i miss one
um
did i miss one the llama oh was there a
homor oh or the ice cream cones that was
actually my idea was he was holding two
ice cream cones and somebody
photoshopped that in there
holding corn dogs
i absolutely love
this era where you can you can turn
something into a video or visual mean in
an hour
oh yeah the rock'em sock'em robots that
was a good one too
all right those are all good
um
what else is happening
so cnn is covering the alec baldwin
story and has a big article about it and
i guess we learned today
that allegedly the prop person handed
alec baldwin this gun
and announced that it was quote a cold
gun
now a cold gun in the lingo of uh i
guess the business
is it means it's not loaded
and then allegedly and this part is
unclear it looks like
alec baldwin might have aimed into
somebody but i don't know that that's
true i think that was debunked
so
we've got some sort of conflicting
stories
it's unclear if it was intentionally
aimed at anybody even in joke
or it just went off
you know accidentally in some way
yeah now here's the part you're i had to
be in the comments here you know exactly
where i'm going on this cnn does this
story
without ever mentioning
that it shouldn't have made any
difference
what the prop person said
are you with me
anybody with the smallest ounce
of common sense or gun training you know
gun safety training
you don't take somebody's word for it
that a gun is unloaded
is there anything more basic than that
do you know who i don't believe if they
tell me if they hand me a gun and tell
me it's not loaded
do you know who i don't
trust everyone
everyone
there's no exception
if the pope
hands you a gun and says don't worry
it's not loaded
check it
check it
because you don't know the pope is
telling you the truth
don't take a chance
so somehow they can write that story
without mentioning the most basic gun
safety facts
that it shouldn't have mattered
who made that mistake
there were 10 ways for the accident not
to happen and all of them involved just
normal common sense
so i don't think we can
let anybody off the hook by saying oh he
didn't know it was loaded
that doesn't count sorry no credit for
don't know it was loaded
my favorite joke so far
in the totally inappropriate category
let me give you a test
are we adult enough
that we can handle the contradiction
that i think most of us genuinely see
this as
a i hope
as a real tragedy with real people who
who really will have to suffer forever
the survivors
will have to suffer forever the loss of
their loved one
and of course the deaths themselves so
it's a tragedy
and as humans we need to point that out
but
are we not allowed
to enjoy the jokes
what do you think
where do you stand on that
my take is i can't help it
i feel like it's beyond my control
if something's funny
i laugh at it
and i don't know how many of you have
the same feeling but
the thing that makes these jokes
make you laugh
is that they're so deeply inappropriate
am i right
if they were not deeply inappropriate
would they really be funny no
so in many ways
i'm giving you uh i'm giving you an out
right so somebody accuses you of
laughing at these jokes here's your out
they're funny because they're
inappropriate
it's true right it's the
inappropriateness the fact that
it's a tragedy
that's why you're laughing
if it were not deeply inappropriate you
wouldn't have two things in
sort of atom balance which is what
triggers the uh the reflex to laugh
so i'm going to give you permission to
enjoy this but maybe not right in front
of the victims or their families okay
i hope they're staying off the internet
today
um but wendy rogers who's an arizona
state senator had the tweet of the day
in my opinion
now what i like about this tweet is it's
coming from somebody who's not a
professional humorist
who somehow crafted
a perfect joke
okay so a non-professional
wendy rogers somehow crafted a perfect
tweet
you want to hear it
of course you do
here's her tweet
hillary clinton dick cheney and alec
baldwin go hunting
how does that play out
come on that's pretty clever
that's pretty funny
now here's what i liked about it
the the ending how does that play out
is perfect
just in terms of joke
construction because
and this is a
basically where hypnosis and humor
overlap
what is beautiful about this punchline
is the question how does that play out
allows you to imagine your funniest
version
that's a hypnosis trick now i doubt
she's studied hypnosis
but leaving stuff out so that the
audience can fill in the joke is really
good form now i don't know if she's just
really good at this
wendy rogers or if she you know
she just hit one out of the park lucky
swing but this is a perfect joke
i looked at this i read this like five
times i was like
god that there's not one wasted word in
that sentence there's nothing you could
change in that that would make that
better
anyway
so we got some runaway inflation it
looks like
or do we
does anybody understand how inflation
works
uh is anybody old enough here and i know
some of you are do you remember
stagflation
remember in the the uh
was it the jimmy carter years we had
stagflation
and
then all the experts said whoa now we
know what stagflation is
and we know what conditions will cause
it in the future
and then those conditions happen again
in the future and what happened
no stagflation
so we don't even know what caused it
apparently well i mean i don't
because we were pretty sure that
it was going to happen again and then it
just didn't
now of course there are lots of
variables in play so you have to have
all the other things lined up to get the
same result and we didn't
now
how good are we at predicting
economic stuff
not really good are we
that doesn't mean it's not a problem
what it does mean is i can't tell
right and i remind you too often i have
a degree in economics i don't know if
we're in trouble or not
and i'm not sure i would trust anybody's
opinion on this because people have been
so wrong about inflation and stagflation
and national debt we don't even know
what national debt is
we don't even know what it is like just
the most basic stuff about the economy i
don't think anybody knows
like you know and the problem is that
there are just so many variables right
so something could happen with a war a
shortage
some kind of bottleneck thing nobody i
don't think anybody saw the supply chain
thing coming maybe they did i don't know
but
um
i guess my only takeaway on the runaway
inflation hyperinflation risk
is we don't really know
maybe
maybe
all right britain it looks like they're
first in line to get these new
antivirals the therapeutics
coming to us from pfizer and merck
so there would be pills that you take
they could reduce the risk of
uh that mild to moderately ill people
reduce their risk of disease by 50
percent i'm sorry the risk of you know
serious hospitalization and death
by 50
to which i say
if you can reduce
the winter surge by 50
and again other people saying we already
have
therapeutics yeah we've already got
regeneron et cetera
given all the ways that we've learned to
treat covet
given the fact that our most vulnerable
or mostly vaccinated
given the fact that the people most
likely to die a lot of them already died
i feel like
the argument for keeping any
restrictions in place
really just became irrational didn't
they at least after the bills are
available so they're not available yet
maybe the end of the year
but if we're in january and we've got
these antivirals i don't know if they
can produce enough of them fast enough
but if we had them in january
what would be the argument for any
ongoing
restrictions now the argument of course
is to reduce deaths but if you can if
you can reduce them by 50 percent
isn't that going to be enough
i mean we keep doing things that reduce
the risk by 50
how many times do you have to cut it in
half before you're you're okay
they've been irrational since yeah
they've been irrational for a while
long-term effects unknown
correct
long-term effects of the anti-viral
drugs unknown
long-term effects of getting a covet
unknown hey i have a question for you
i'm just going to put this out there
so we keep hearing about all of the
so-called long-haul
covid problems so people get the covid
and let's say they have a bad case of it
but then
but then for weeks or months they have
symptoms
i'm just going to put this out there
because the the range of symptoms seem
pretty broad
have you ever had a
surgery
so i've had
three surgeries none of them super major
right i had
you know a couple of nasal things etc
some polyps in my sinus
and so none of them were major surgeries
but each of them required
anesthesia how long does it take you to
recover from anesthesia in surgery and i
don't mean that day
i mean how many months
have you ever had a minor surgery
it takes months doesn't it to feel to
feel right even after your problem is
completely solved you know whatever the
actual cutting was about of the surgery
the there's something like a fog that
somebody says like a year
right
now last year or actually during the
pandemic i had some surgery that was uh
delayed for months and months
and months many of you know the story
had some sinus polyps that needed to be
removed
and so the surgery was delayed and part
of that delay put me on prednisone
so i got in prednisone for
you know a period
and then i thought i was going to go
from that and the prednisone reduces the
polyps in the meantime until you can get
the surgery
then the surgery got cancelled delayed
so
i got on prednisone again a second dose
within a year which is sort of a lot
because getting off a prednisone is kind
of a problem
and then i had it a third time
so i believe if i'm remembering right
there were three separate
extended periods of prednisone
it took me
months
to be able to walk upstairs after i got
off prednisone
months
and i was in good shape
right i mean i was i was a gym rat
and just the prednisone it wasn't even
the illness and it wasn't it wasn't even
the uh
wasn't even the surgery
but just getting off a prednisone
if you have too much of it
it's it's months
like i would get to the top of the
stairs and i'd be like ah
now it's fine i can i can run upstairs
you know easily
now
prednisone is a steroid right
don't you get prednisone when you get
cold
isn't that a pretty normal
uh pretty normal prescription am i right
about that
and
and if you get prednisone do you get it
long enough that you have the problem i
had
because i don't i don't think they give
it to you that long right
because i was on it for a few weeks i
think each time
yeah so here's my question
how many of what we what people are
reporting to be long covered you know
months long symptoms how many of those
symptoms are caused by the treatment
or the or just recovering from a bad
illness in general
if something if something just knocks
you on your ass
whatever it is it could be just a bad
regular flu
don't you have
lasting
issues from that like a few weeks later
a few weeks later you've still got some
problems i don't know i'll just put that
out there that a lot of the reported
long haul might have
might be just the trauma of the
experience itself
all right um
let's go brandon
all right i need i need a little help
here
a little help uh i would like to employ
the global brain
calling on all viewers
to be part of a single intelligence
i'm gonna set you up and then your
global brain will be unleashed
right
have you noticed and this is not my
original observation that let's go
brandon starts with l g b
as in lgbtq
can we think of the t in the queue
so that let's go brandon
total quality
or something
i don't know i just feel like there's
some way to make a meme or a joke out of
this you know with
being respectful of course to the lgbtq
community
don't want to insult them unnecessarily
uh but it's a weird coincidence isn't it
oh there it is somebody already has the
the show there's already t-shirt lgbt
let's go brandon team
let's go brandon teachers quit
totally quit
all right i'm looking at your take
quaaludes
uh
let's go brandon to quantico
um
too quantico okay
i didn't quit
uh
let's get brandon too quick there we go
let's get brandon to quit
that's it
oh it's already a shirt it's already a
shirt i'm saying i'm seeing a video of
it
here on the locals platform so you can't
see it here on
on netflix but over on the locals
platform they're they're posting
pictures of it
yeah let's get back
let's get biden to quit
actually says let's get biden to quit
all
right um
here's a segment i call
citizens doing the work of governments
you ready for this
citizens doing the work of governments
so what's our big problem it's the
supply chain as you know
and i'm going to read you a tweet thread
because i want to see where you see an
example
of a citizen solving maybe we don't know
if it's a solution yet but certainly it
looks like leadership from citizens as
opposed to government now the question
is who's in charge of the supply chain
problem
biden
footage edge anybody we don't know
but uh ryan peterson
private citizen and ceo of flexport who
is in the business of uh logistics and
stuff
for shipping
all right so here's somebody who's a ceo
of a shipping logistics um entity
and so therefore has an understanding of
you know the big picture right
so ryan peterson
um tweets
the following and i'm going to read the
whole tweet if you don't mind
because
normally i would you know summarize it
but i don't want to get anything wrong
and i think that this is important not
only because
you can see a citizen doing the work of
government here basically but
um
you'll you'll get the whole you'll get
the little picture i'll just read it all
right so this was uh tweeted yesterday
by ryan peterson ceo of flexport he says
yesterday i rented a boat and took the
leader of one of flexport's partners in
long beach on a three-hour
tour of the port complex here's a thread
about what i learned all right so the
first part is he went in person
right he didn't he didn't read the
internet he went in person to talk to
the people
at the port all right so
i keep asking can anybody explain what
the problem is and nobody can right
have you noticed that nobody can explain
what the freaking problem is exactly
they think it's drivers and you know all
kinds of stuff well here's what he found
out
okay he goes to the port he goes uh the
ports i guess we went to two of them the
ports of la and long beach are at a
standstill in a full three-hour loop
through the poor complex
passing every single terminal we saw
less than
a dozen containers get unloaded
so the in three hours they only saw
fewer than 12 containers get
unloaded okay
so did you think it was about trucks
all right we'll keep going
there are hundreds of cranes
i counted only seven that were even
operating
and they seemed to be going pretty
slowly
so it's not cranes
got lots of cranes
okay
it seems that everyone now agrees
that the bottleneck is yard space at the
container terminals
the terminals are simply overflowing
with containers
and he'll say later that's mostly empty
ones
which means they no longer have space to
take in new containers either either
from ships or land it's a true traffic
jam because it says right now if you
have a chassis so that would be the the
truck with nothing on it
with no empty container on it you can go
pick up containers at any port terminal
however
if you have an empty container on that
chassis
they're not allowing you to return it
except on highly restricted basis
meaning the government
here it is
government problem if you can't get the
empty off the chassis you don't have a
chassis to go back and pick up the next
container
and if nobody goes to pick up the next
container
the port remains jammed
ask yourself have you heard anything
like this until now
all of the news you've read
all the people speculating has anybody
told you this
it's the first time i heard it i'll go
on
um
with the yards so full carrier slash
terminals are being highly restrictive
and where and when they will accept
empties
so i guess you can bring the empty to
the yard also containers are not
fungible between carriers meaning you
know one one carrier can't use somebody
else's container
so the truckers have to drop their empty
off at the right terminal
this is causing empty containers to pile
up
this one trucking partner alone has 450
containers
sitting on chassis right now
450 trucks
they can't use
that are perfectly good trucks
presumably with drivers
and they can't use them
because they have empty chassis on them
and no place to put them
because of government regulations
you see where this is going
um
all right
this is a trucking company with six
yards that represent 153 owner operator
drivers
so he has almost three containers
sitting on chassis at his yard
for every driver on the team
he can't take the containers off the
chassis because he's not allowed
by the city of long beach zoning code to
store empty containers more than too
high in his truck yard this was tweeted
yesterday
today
today
the mayor of long beach
just announced that they're going to
allow them to pile the containers more
than too high
so this this government regulation that
looks like
it was uh
at least in long beach so we don't know
about la yet
but it looks like they'll pile them high
with the chassis all tied up storing
empties they can't be returned to the
port there are no chassis available blah
blah
oh okay and with all the containers
piling up in the terminal yard the
longshoremen can't unload the ships
right so they're literally just too many
empties they just can't unload the ships
and so the queue grows longer when now
over 70 ships
containing 500 000 containers are
waiting offshore
the line is going to get longer not
shorter
this is a negative feedback loop you
know so the worse it gets the worse i
guess uh all right how do we fix this so
now he talks about solutions now when i
talk about the solutions
and when ryan peterson talks about the
solutions here's the attitude you should
take toward it
not necessarily that this is the exact
solution
but directionally okay so if you can
tell yourself this is a directional area
to go you won't get too wound up about
the details of it
he said
what we can do that's fast basically he
says when you're designing an operation
you must choose your bottleneck
bottleneck so here's a design note you
have to choose your bottleneck if the
bottleneck appears somewhere that you
didn't choose it
you aren't running an operation it's
running you so he's saying it's poorly
designed by its nature
you should always choose the most
capital intensive part of the line to be
your bottleneck
now he doesn't explain that but
capital intensive presumably means it's
easier to flex your capital
in other words get more money
than it is to get more people or more
anything else i'm guessing that's what
it means
in a port that's the ship to shore
cranes
the cranes should never be unable to run
because they're waiting for another part
oh okay
so the most capital i have that wrong so
the most capital intensive part is the
cranes
and they're not running so that means
it's not a well-designed system
so the bottleneck right now is not the
cranes it's the yard space
so we've got to get rid of those empties
all right
and he says that and here's somebody who
knows what they're talking about right
so he knows he knows systems and he
knows this industry so listen to this
advice
in operations when a bottleneck appears
somewhere that you didn't design for it
so in other words it's not in the crane
area because
they're designed for it i guess
you must overwhelm the bottleneck
overwhelm the bottleneck in other words
you don't want to peck away at it
you need to basically just drop
everything
and throw everything at the bottleneck
okay so how do you do that
he suggests an executive order in other
words
biden
effective immediately overriding the
zoning rules in long beach and los
angeles to allow truck yards to store
empty containers up to six high looks
like we got that 24 hours later i don't
know if this is just because of
ryan's involvement but i do know that
the government heard about his tweet
the day he tweeted so i made sure that
uh at least
some productive people in the media and
in the government were aware of this and
and are very aware of it and are you
know looking into it etc
so i can i can confirm that uh
productive parts of the government are
looking into this
and maybe maybe this is why it happened
fast i imagine that it doesn't happen
that fast so my in my imagination
probably they were already thinking
about this
stacking up the containers and it just
happened
so that's good news
then
ryan says two bring every container
chassis owned by the national
guard and the military anywhere oh so if
the military and the national guard have
trucks
that they can
carry different chassis or that they can
carry different containers on uh to
employ those
create a new temporary container yard
so you need probably 500 acres he thinks
and it could be government land or
something near the ports
so you need a a ton of land
temporarily
ideally temporarily
somewhere near the ports
how hard would it be to give 500 acres
available on short short notice well if
it's government land maybe that's fast
they can say
just use this government land what if
there's no government land
here's what i suggest if if this is
really something we need
if we really really need this for the
you know the health of the country
this is
basically a war
level problem
it's a war level problem people don't
act the same
when it's a little problem
as they do when it's a big problem right
people don't act the same in the
pandemic
as they do when they get a cold so i
believe this is a non-problem because if
joe biden ever went on tv and said you
know we can solve this thing if we get
500 acres
near the port
how long would it take
a patriot
a farmer a landowner somewhere how long
would it take at least one patriot to
say i got 500 acres
hell yeah
bring it over here
national problem
whole countries in a jam
i got 500 acres absolutely
just you know help me clean it up when
you're done
i i feel like that's a very solvable
problem in the context of a crisis
people would just step up i think
like i would like to think of that of my
fellow americans
uh ryan says also bring in barges and
small container ships and start hauling
containers out of long beach
to other smaller ports that aren't
backed up
now
uh this is not a comprehensive list so
as i said
think in terms of
all the different ways that you can get
rid of the empties
you know don't don't get obsessed by
these specific suggestions
but he does make the case that you could
probably do it
and you could probably do it fast if you
had the will and the leadership
i don't think it's a money problem i
don't think it's knowing what to do
problem anymore i think it's just a will
power
leadership brute force kind of situation
so we could probably power through it
um
and then he's got some other uh
he said he'd be happy to lead this
effort for the federal state government
well there you go
you even you haven't you even have
somebody who understands it and is
already a ceo
just volunteered to lead the effort
you know and you probably need somebody
who has this level of understanding
about the whole system
to really do anything productive because
you know any change to one part of the
system is going to ripple through the
rest of the system so you need somebody
who knows what kind of changes aren't
going to break the system somewhere else
so where's uh pete butterjudge
and why can't he make ryan peterson the
port
czar
just until we get this over with
i don't know
so i'm going to put this in the category
of
citizens doing what the government
couldn't do you remember the story i
told earlier today about the dads
just saying okay the school is failing
the government is failing
how about you and i put on these dad
shirts and go fix the school and so they
did because the government couldn't fix
it so the dads went and fixed it and
succeeded
so the government was so far pretty
close to worthless on this whole supply
chain issue so a citizen says well
maybe i'll solve it
i'm saying the same thing
like literally right now what i'm doing
is
making sure that enough people have
heard this idea why
because the government isn't doing it
like i am literally doing the
government's job right now
for free
and i'm happy to do it because i'm a
patriot
and the country has a crisis
of course i want to help
so does ryan peterson so does somebody
with 500 acres somewhere
so does
anybody who's got a truck and can put it
empty on it
but
just for fun
i'm going to take it to a new level
right
what follows is my whiteboard
presentation
of what to do with all the empties
don't take this too seriously
all right i'm going to present this in
the
spirit of
just stretching your mind a little bit
all right
i'm not
i wouldn't say this is a practical idea
but it's fun
it goes like this
let's say you got a port
here's your port
you want to get rid of all these
containers
now let's say that not too far away
there's a mountain
right
i'm going to solve all the world's
problems at once you ready
just all at once
you're going to take these containers
and you know
line them up on the mountain
butt to bop
until
you have the equivalent
of a tunnel
a tunnel
now you'd have to
open up the you know once you stuck them
together you'd have to you know weld
an opening between them but then imagine
you do that
so you open them up
and you've got this big ass tunnel
that goes up the hill or the mountain
have you ever heard of a heat chimney
have you ever heard of that concept
heat chimney
a heat chimney
a heat chimney
is when uh the natural rising of warm
air
is uh put through a chimney so basically
if you built this
all by itself it would start sucking in
warm air
because warm air rises and it would suck
it into this pole and it would exhale it
in there
and if it was a big enough
entity it would be pretty fast
now
wait for it wait for it
why would you do this
because you're going to build a co2
capture facility
on the top
co
2 capture
all right we know that we have
technology
i don't think you can even see this can
you
do
let me fix that a little bit
all right
so
uh if you were to build a co2 capture
device that pulls air that pulls the co2
out of the air
what is the biggest part of the expense
the biggest part of the expense i think
you'd have to fact check me on this
is energy
so the biggest part of the expense is
these big
big fans
that move the wind so you have to move
the air you force it through the filters
to get the co2 out
but what if you didn't need the fans
what if nature was your fan
what if
the warm air was warm enough at the
bottom
that by the time it got to the top it
was just like a hurricane
i'm not sure if the physics work to get
enough air flow but
could you get enough airflow
to build a cheap co2 capture on the top
of a hill
boom solving climate change
and the shipping container problem at
the same time
now
is this a practical plan
no
and it wouldn't happen fast
but
i just like to put two eyes do this
together now and then because it's good
for your creativity
um sometimes
sometimes
it's useful to hear what's called the
bad version of the idea i've talked
about this before it's a hollywood trick
if you don't have a good idea for
uh let's say a script
you know what what does the character do
now if you don't have a good idea throw
out the bad one
because the bad one will make somebody
say well that won't work
but it does remind me of something that
will
so he says do you realize we still need
those empty containers
we'll make more
we'll make more
because you know
i'm not talking about uh we're not
talking about enough containers that
would change the global
container situation
and i'm not talking about really using
containers for this because there's got
to be an easier way to make a pipe
than containers
but
here's the only the only question that i
ask is this could you create a situation
with a
heat chimney on a on a hill because it's
easier to build it on a hill because you
don't need to support it
you know laying something down on the
ground is easier than building a
structure a mile high right you just lay
it there
now would you be able to get enough air
flow
to power a co2 scrubber
engineers engineers
anybody anybody
do we have
i i know a huge percentage of your
engineers
and i'm waiting for you to weigh in
come on tell me why it won't work
because you
uh
okay this is no i know it's not
practical to fix the container problem
but um
yeah but the co2 capture is useless
okay
uh
spotted owl problem yes
solar would be cheaper
maybe
homeless houses you know i also thought
about that but
you know imagine if you put 500
containers turn sideways in the field
and just let the homeless people camp
out in it it'd be better than being
outdoors
but i think we can do better than that
for the homeless
elon musk's boring tool
there you go
um yeah so let me let me do that so
imagine instead of using containers
that's probably a better idea isn't it
if you use the the boring company
b-o-r-i-n-g
so instead of uh laying down the pipe
you just more bore a tunnel
yeah i know maybe
maybe
maybe so
um
all right let's see what else we're
going to talk about that was just for
fun
but
you see this pattern of citizens doing
the work of the government don't you
what's that about
i've never i think we've never seen that
before it has something to do with
social media makes it possible right
because it just wouldn't be possible
without it
all right here's my other favorite story
i have a new favorite athlete
inez
i don't know if i'm pronouncing it right
e-n-e-s is it inez or ennis
eunes cantor
apparently he made some comments about
uh
china
um
he made some comments about tibet
and china's treatment of tibet and china
started pulling nba broadcasts uh
which we think is in apparent
retaliation
so what does ennis cantor do
when he said something that has cost a
lot of money to his employer the nba
and caused an international
problem
does
does
ns say oops sorry about that
and i guess i'll go away now
does ns apologize to china and say oh
i'm sorry about that i guess i went a
little too far
he does not
he does not
here's what ns does
he makes a new video so instead of
complaining about tibet
he goes after the uyghur situation
he makes a video
a hammering china about the uyghur
situation and lays out the whole
brutality of it
um
here's what uh he says uh yeah i'm
calling you out talking about
xi jinping he says i'm calling you out
in front of the whole world close down
the slave labor camps and free the
uyghur people stop the genocide now
well
there may be a lot of nba players who
are kneeling for the anthem
and i don't care about them at the
moment
but
and as cantor i give you standing
ovation
standing ovation
[Applause]
[Applause]
and what is ns cantor doing
the government's
job he's doing the government's job
he's doing what biden should be doing
trump would be doing this
i think
wouldn't he
so
three examples in the news today
of citizens doing the job of the
government because the government wasn't
doing it
there's something going on
is it
is it because people are noticing that
we don't have a coherent government
because you know it seemed like the
citizen participation was also
happening under trump but it looked like
more of a it looked more like more of a
collaborative thing
than a desperation thing
at the moment it looks more like
desperation we don't have a government
we better do this ourselves
but under trump it looked more like oh
he actually listens to what people say
so if you have a good idea maybe it'll
get implemented and sure enough you know
i've told you the story of
uh submitting a good idea and next thing
you know it's an executive order
so
uh
mr cab is asking if my hair is growing
back
uh interestingly it did grow back when i
was on prednisone
uh not permanently but even the the bald
spots started filling back in
that's scary
but it was temporary
um
do you know before federal attacks
tariffs were imposed on ships i don't
know if the relevance of that yet
all right
so in a new york times opinion piece
paul krugman
says uh china has big problems coming
china has big problems coming
big problems that
it feels like the wording of that sounds
familiar doesn't it
have you heard that from anyone before
is there anybody who's been saying in
public
that china has big problems coming
so that's the headline
big problem is coming
does it sound familiar
it should
because uh china has big problems coming
i think i've mentioned it before
i believe i mentioned it before
yeah
and uh one of the big problems
among the big problems are they
apparently they tried to hide their
economic situation by building massive
uh real estate
projects that
didn't get used you know nobody nobody
moved into them
oh yes i did say that yes i did
have i told you how i
track my influence
now is of course it's not scientific and
not 100 reliable but one of the ways i
track it is by um language
you know if somebody uses the same term
you say i wonder if two people came up
with that at the same time or one was
influenced by the other
so you can never know it could be that's
just
an obvious phrase so you see it more
than once
we'll see
but paul krugman who i know certainly
people on the
right political right don't think his uh
predictions have been so good
but he says they got big trouble
big trouble coming
and i think he's right
you know have i told you the interplay
between economics and psychology
that economics is
unless you have a physical constraint
like the the ports have a physical
constraint
economics is mostly a psychology issue
if you think things are going to be good
next year you invest
if you think the prices are going up
because of inflation maybe you buy
something now so basically your
expectations and your psychology drive
the entire economy
what happens to china's economy when
everybody understands that it's not safe
to do business there
that they got big problems
it's a problem if if this psychology
breaks the economy rigs
what would it take for china's
psychology to break in a way that breaks
the economy
well
it might take paul krugman a no you know
nobel
winner for economics to tell you that
you're in deep deep trouble i mean he
could be right or he could be wrong but
the more people with his credentials who
tell china they're doomed
the more somebody's going to believe him
right
the more people talk about problems
somebody's saying i look like that
character that was once on babylon 5. i
assume you know that i was on babylon 5
right that's why you're saying that
i
there's an old sci-fi show called
babylon 5. i had a
a small part on that
because i'd said some good things about
the show so they invited me on to be a
character i was not a good actor
yes and covet is coming for china so
apparently china has an outbreak in
several provinces
i don't see any way
that china doesn't have a
a big big problem coming
because i just don't think you can keep
it out and i don't know that they can
vaccinate fast enough
so i don't think kovan will be the thing
that takes him down
i think it'll be something else
have you seen raised by wolves on hbo
um
no
but i just got interested in that
yesterday remind me what that was about
i remember that the title of it raised
by wolves was completely misleading has
nothing to do with anything like that
what is it about
yeah no i was in babylon 5 for one
episode
in which i played uh someone who i
played a guy who was looking for his dog
i want to say
somebody actually posted it here
um so the people on locals can see it
but let me show you
see if you can see it here on youtube
if you watched the show
that was me when i had hair
in a scene with uh mr garibaldi who was
playing security in the scene
now here here's the uh funny part you
see the
the minbari alien behind me over my
shoulder
so that was my longtime girlfriend at
the time
uh pam and pam is uh you know
japanese-american
and
so uh
you know they made her as a
japanese-american minbari
and uh she had like six hours of makeup
or something to get that look and her
only role was to stand back there and
carry my briefcase
and i had i think two lines or something
that i blew
i believe yeah somebody said garibaldi
is a poor man's bruce willis
that's pretty funny
i think he passed away if i'm not
mistaken i think
i think that actor passed away
so i'll tell you just a little that
actor's story
so
so the reason i was invited to be on the
show as sort of a guest character was
because i'd said it was my favorite show
at the time so they they liked it i said
that in public so they invited me to be
on as a character yeah jerry doyle was
the name of the actor
and uh i did my lines a few times and
and blew them even though it was like
two lines i you know
if you're not an actor it's a lot of
pressure to get that right
and
i finally got the line right
but it happened to be exactly when the
entire cast decided to prank me so it
ruined the scene
so
i forget the details i think they all
the rest of the cast of which there were
just lots of them you know because it
was a in a cafe scene where there'd be
lots of extras and stuff
so they they were waiting to
some part of the scene and then
everybody just like rushed
rushed us
like it was just like this big crowd
just
and it was just a prank you know to play
on the new guy
uh but i think that was the first time i
got the line right they ruined the scene
but i eventually got it
um
yes and they did not they did not hand
me a hot gun
these pretzels are making me thirsty
what's that from
oh yeah the minbari were the best aliens
ever
if you haven't by the way i'll tell you
my favorite scene
um i'm blanking on the name of the show
runner who wrote i think you wrote every
episode as one guy
and there was one bit of the writing
that i just thought was brilliant there
was a scene in this
um tv show in which the minbari
you know the head
head minbari person
was uh almost killed in a
in an attack
but it turned out it was
minbari
who was trying to kill their own minbari
leader
and
the the person who stopped it
decided not to tell
the leader
who it was that was behind the attack
and the reason was he didn't want the
leader
to be
thank you joe straczynski was the
showrunner wrote all these he didn't
want the leader
to think less
of the
people she was leading
and therefore kept that information from
her because he didn't want to ruin his
leader by
turning her against you know her own
people
and i really i just love that part of
the
scene i'm watching dune right now i'm
three quarters through it i can't i
can't watch a whole movie at once
but uh i
the the original dune
was maybe one of the worst films ever
made i tried to watch that so many times
and you get it's just so slow
but the new one it looks like they fixed
the bad parts
it's it's good i'm enjoying it
all right
um
looks like it's time
for us to say goodbye
and
it's kind of a slow-ish news day
how was this episode
i can never tell
all right some people liked it on locals
good
um
just looking at your comments oh okay
well on locals people liked it
how about youtube
sophistry hour
you know the the sophistry people i
don't know
this is something wrong with everybody
who uses that insult
i don't know if anybody has ever accused
anybody of sophistry without themselves
being defective in some way
maybe i don't know
i think usually it's a cognitive
dissonance when people use that word
because there's something that they
didn't agree with
that they have to imagine there's
something wrong with the speaker and
sophistry is one of those words you
could just throw in there because you
don't have to defend it well i don't
have to defend it it's just sophistry
um
soporific is the word
uh
oh i lost you on the heat chimney stuff
i remember the heat chimney stuff wasn't
serious
but i thought it would be interesting to
learn learn a couple of concepts if you
learned about a heat chimney
and you learned about co2 scrubbers
that's all i wanted
you need to expand your news sources i
think i do
but the new sources where would i expand
it to
i have a horse weiner pointed at me
uh
all right
that's all for now and i will talk to
you tomorrow and if the government
doesn't fix things we'll do it
we'll do it ourselves damn it
