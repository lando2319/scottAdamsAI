um hey everybody come on in it's time
for
coffee with scott adams the very best of
all times
if you made a list of all your times
this would be right at the top
everything else way less important if
you get this part right
the rest of your day perfect i
guarantee it and all you need is a
copper mug or glass a tanker shells or
steiner canteen jugger flask a vessel of
any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid i
like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine hit
of the day
the thing that goes like this
it's called the simultaneous sip go
now if you've tried the simultaneous sip
without going
at the end you're missing the best part
when you have sex scream when you have
the simultaneous sip
go makes it all better
you think i'm kidding but i'm not it
does make it better
now how about this turns out that
modernist vaccination
at least in the test was shown to be 100
effective in adolescents
aged 12 to 17. 100 percent
that is very close very close
to the exact number of people who don't
get the virus between the age of 12 and
17
or don't get any serious problem with it
now
that doesn't mean you shouldn't get
vaccinated
but this is uh pretty close to what you
would expect isn't it
you'd kind of expect that if the vaccine
works
and children are unlikely to get it in
the first place
you put the two together and looks
pretty good
so that's all good news so lebron james
who was asked in an interview if he got
vaccinated
now you know lebron is a role model he
has spoken out on
a number of topics the george floyd
stuff
notably but lebron is sort of
i don't know if he's reluctant but he's
a he's a role model
whether he likes it or not he's a role
model
so what do you make of somebody who's a
role model
and certainly could influence people
all right there are small role models
and then there are big role models i
would think lebron is a big role model
and he could actually make a difference
so he decided to not say in public
whether he had been vaccinated
now do you think he said he he would
you know do you think that he didn't
answer the question
because he is vaccinated or because he's
not
what's your guess i feel like he is
i saw see a cnn um
host i guess guessing that if he
wouldn't say that he was vaccinated it
probably means he
isn't but i don't think that his
team would let him play unless he were
that's what i think i think that he is
vaccinated and he doesn't want to say it
so that's my guess someday we might find
out
here's another one of these cases where
you can
we'll probably know i think at some
point we'll probably know if he got the
vaccination
and uh compare your prediction to mine
so my prediction is he doesn't want to
tell people he did get it
uh and if your prediction is that he
doesn't want to say it because he didn't
get it
i don't know i would check that
prediction because i feel as if the
organization
that pays him would probably require it
or at least push really hard and we
might have heard about that if there was
some pushing going on
so i'm guessing he got it however
i feel it's cowardly and despicable not
to tell the public what he did
now i get that he's not a doctor so you
shouldn't be taking
medical advice from lebron or from me
but he does know his his
actions influence people so if he has
any confidence whatsoever in his own
decision
i feel as if he should tell the public
um that was the decision i made
because with the the people who choose
to
watch me and follow me here i probably
have a little bit more influence than
just some random person right let me ask
this in the comments
is there anybody here who was influenced
uh to either get the vaccination or
knock at it by anything i did
let's see if influence makes a
difference
how many people in the comments uh made
a decision
i say yes now most of you should be no
right most of you just of course not
influenced by that sort of thing but see
if you see any yeses go by
so far 95 99 knows
but it's not the number of no's that
we're looking for we're seeing if there
are
any yeses because persuasion is more
like a
you know you move two percent you know
maybe if you're really good you move
five percent
i see two yeses so three s's so far
um mom let's see if i see any more
uh yes another one uh
mostly nose mostly nose 99 nose
framed helpfully so maybe a little bit
there's a yes
all right so um about what i thought so
somewhere in
another yes so we're seeing that
somewhere in maybe the
two percent five percent range five
percent at the most
but um so you can see for yourself
all right i don't have to guess
rick says i influenced him on marrying
the hot women
well i'm glad i could do that for you oh
let's see
sing some more yeses coming in all right
so you can see for yourself if you're
watching
the comments that there are real human
beings
who really made life decisions
based in part on what i did
that's a pretty heavy responsibility
and if lebron said to himself you know i
don't want to be the one who killed
anybody
so i'm just not going to say oh i don't
know if that's crazy
you know it's not crazy to want to be
not a doctor and don't influence people
on medical stuff
but at the same time lebron has the same
problem
an ethical problem i would say moral or
ethical whichever one you want to use
i think that everybody who's a public
figure
yeah and i am on a smaller scale than
lebron of course
but i feel like we have a responsibility
to tell you what we decided
do you agree or disagree with that do
you think it would have been better if
i'd just been quiet about it
because i i don't i feel like you should
see
what public figures did and then listen
to our argument
now i don't think you should look at one
public figure and make a decision based
on one person
but you know we're all we're all trying
to do our best here right
you know we've got our medical advice
sometimes you trust us sometimes you
don't
but doesn't it help to talk to a friend
doesn't it help to see a public figure
go through the thinking
i feel like it does you know it's
definitely a double-edged sword
but i feel that lebron um took more of a
cowardly approach i feel like he should
step
up but it could be that he
you know made like other people think
maybe he didn't get the vaccination and
doesn't want to discourage others
you know feeling it's just a personal
decision maybe
so i'm not going to say i i should
condemn him for this
i chose differently i feel
i feel there was a risk he's avoiding
and if he wants to avoid that risk
it's not dumb it might be a little
cowardly
but it's not dumb i choose to take the
risk
and if anybody dies because of anything
i did
well i'm sorry about that i really am
and i'm doing my best well like that's
all i can do right i'm i'm doing my
honest best
to not get anybody killed because they
heard any advice from me
but you know there's a risk there
well the george floyd anniversary
you hate to call it that don't you
anniversary there should be a different
word for
something that happens on an annual
basis
that's just purely bad you know
anniversary sounds like oh it's your
wedding anniversary it's a good thing
but uh this is the bad kind of
anniversary
and politico reports that biden wanted
to use the anniversary
as sort of a deadline for congress to
pass a police reform bill
and here's the part that just blew my
head apart
politico goes on and says but with no
bill in sight
he has instead blah blah are you kidding
me
one year after the george floyd
event and the tragedy and there's not
even a bill
in sight meaning that there's nobody
even
working on a police
reform anything now could it be that
it's just because the federal government
maybe isn't the right body to do that
maybe it's a state thing i don't know
biden was expecting something
so apparently the president of the
united states thinks it's the
federal the federal government's job and
he got
nothing are you telling me that all the
people in congress
all the republicans and all the
democrats they couldn't come up
with one idea just one idea
for making things better in this domain
nothing are you kidding me
this whole thing is just a fake fake
fake story
it's a fake story because if
this problem were even a little bit
real there would be all kinds of
suggestions for fixing it
this is the tell the tell is that a year
later there's not
a good idea it wasn't a real
problem to begin with
now it's a real tragedy anybody getting
killed
it's a tragedy and that's that's a
problem per se
but if nobody had a better idea
i mean i feel like that's important to
know right nobody had a better idea
now i'm seeing in the comments and thank
you for reminding me
that tim scott did it have at one point
what looked like very productive
suggestions he got
shot down ironically shouldn't use that
phrase
but it didn't go anywhere because he's a
republican
is my understanding is that your
understanding that the tim scott
police reform bill didn't go anywhere
because tim scott is
not a democrat that's probably the only
reason right
so if congress isn't even serious about
this
should you be really i mean
i feel like if congress doesn't even
treat it like it's a real problem
they are treating it like it's not real
like it doesn't even exist
because if it were real and it existed
there would at least be suggestions for
what to do
just some suggestions all right
here's my suggestion which of course
will never be implemented
because it might work which is teaching
life and strategy in school
life strategy now schools teach you
skills you know like how to read blah
blah although they don't do it very well
apparently in the inner cities
but there should be a federal required
course
on life strategies
life strategies now it should be bigger
than just what do you do if the police
stop you
but it should be in there right if
you're going to have like a
let's say a semester-long class on how
to
have a strategy for a good life
depending where you live and depending
on your ethnicity especially
you should have a little bit of a module
about how to not get your ass
killed by the police because i don't
think it's that hard
i really don't i'm sorry if it seems
like it's hard to you
you know i'm sorry that you feel that
way
but it's not hard it's just not hard to
not get killed by the police
you have to really try to get killed by
the police
and i think we know exactly how to do it
which is resisting arrest
so i think that's something the federal
government can do and who would object
to that
who would object to that they would
right if democrats came up with a plan
to teach
life strategy which would include stay
off drugs you know go to school
get good grades and by the way if you're
young and black and poor
and you do those things get good grades
stay out of jail
and you know stay off drugs you do those
three things
and you're black what what does your
future look like
golden but it's golden
it's like a it's like a freeway to
success
there's nothing in the way if you do
those three things
and also don't resist arrest so you'll
get yourself killed
so if the federal government came up a
plan and says hey
we can't fix the police directly maybe
the states need to do what they need to
do there
but we can certainly make sure that the
students are not
just crushed by bad teaching and useless
instruction
you can make sure that just make sure
that there's a module there
you know if you can put 16 19 training
in there and you can put critical race
theory and things
and those things are what i would call
anti-strategy
an anti-strategy is something they teach
you in school that will make your life
worse
it'll just make your life worse and i
think the
looking uh looking at the rear view
mirror does that
i'll say more about that actually let me
say more about that
right now if you wanted to uh
destroy black america how would you do
it
let's say you were you were china or you
were some
nemesis of the united states and you
wanted to destroy
uh black america because that would you
know largely
take a big bite out of destroying
america in general
if you were evil and you wanted to do
that one good way would be to advocate
teaching critical race theory
and the 1619 project now
the point of the 1619 project
the point of critical race theory well
the 1619 project in particular
is to make sure that people understand
the the true brutality of our history
without you know whitewashing it
basically ironically um
now i don't have any objection
whatsoever
with an honest accounting of history
i feel like that's a good idea to have
the the clearest
most accurate view of history brutal
though it may be
and i do think that it's perfectly valid
to make a really
big deal about the the role of racism
and slavery in the country good to know
good to teach but there's a difference
between being honest and being accurate
and being strategic they're different
if you're doing one it might hurt your
ability to do the other
and if your top priority is the is to
make sure
people really get drilled into their
head how slavery
and systemic racism are the main main
variables of success in this country
that becomes your strategy by default
you know if you fill your head with one
thing whatever that one thing is
you're you're going to be motivated by
that one thing it doesn't matter what
the thing is
if you take as your main strategy
for success dwelling on the past
has that ever worked can you think of
examples where
somebody was successful because they
dwelled on the past
just one example oh yeah there was that
that's successful entrepreneur whose
success
is entirely based on dwelling on how bad
things were
well definitely they're entrepreneurs
who use their their pain to succeed
but i don't see any anything like that
happening with the 1619 project
what's missing is the part where they
say we're going to teach you this
and then the actions that you'll take
because of this are now these productive
ones
because that's what you want to do right
you're trying to create
students that are productive members of
society so what do they do differently
because the 1619 project what
complain feel that they're victims what
what productive thing do you do because
of it
now compare that with strategy where
somebody says
here's the deal white people have a
bunch of advantages
black people have a bunch of their own
advantages which are different
among them every fortune 500 company
wants to hire you
just stay in school and stay out of jail
and stay off drugs
just do those three things every fortune
500
company wants you and they want you bad
because they need
they need diversity they need it
like it's not even what they want they
freaking need it
it's a requirement to hire you you know
you will be so mentored
that you'll be sick of it if you're
black
you just have to do those three things
now if they had a life class that taught
that
what would you do differently because of
that
well those three things stay off drugs
stay in school
you know stay out of jail
yeah science there's a comment on
science here that i won't read
all right um
now here's the here's the persuasion
that i think uh
blm and the critical race theory in 1619
should do instead of what they're doing
now the
the genius of what they are doing black
lives matter etc
is that to criticize any of it makes you
a racist
even if you said to yourself well i like
the general thrust of all these things
i like black lives matter i like
critical race theory
i like the 16 19 project for just
you know the informing people uh you
know i like all that
but what it is what's it persuading
i'll tell you what it would persuade me
if i were black
now not black well i i identify as black
but um if somebody told me
that my group mattered
how would you take that let's just turn
this on you let's
whatever you are all right uh let's say
for those of you who are not black let's
say you have a i don't know
irish background suppose i said to you
irish people matter
how do you take that i take that as the
most
losing strategy i've ever heard
dino is the lowest uh thing you should
shoot for
to matter that's the lowest bar you can
aim for
ah i'd like to matter
um so yes david says we should give
politicians a bonus based on lifting the
black communities
if you could if you could measure that
um
that wouldn't be a bad idea although it
might be racist it might actually work
out but i don't think you get
past the the racist part of that um
so here's here's my persuasion advice to
black lives matter
if you say that black lives matter you
have taken the very
lowest standard oh you just matter
does that inspire you do you feel like
ah
i'm gonna go out there i'm gonna i'm
gonna matter
that's nothing you should be shooting
for thriving
you should be shooting for killing it
you should be
shooting for exceeding expectations
beating the average beating everybody
else you're competing on
you know reaching for the stars
you're reaching for mattering mattering
the lowest level of success is that you
just exist and matter that's it
so number one shoot higher
like much higher way higher
you should you should be like
inspirational
the the whole uh approach is that it's a
bunch of
a bunch of losers who are wallowing in
their loserhood
and are trying to achieve the minimum
level of a human being
that you don't want to kill them that's
it
like the minimum value that people don't
want to kill you just for existing
good lord it could not be worse in terms
of persuasion
here's a here's a persuasive counter to
that
it's and this is a variant of the high
ground
maneuver now the high ground maneuver i
talk about it a lot but the more
examples you see the
the more useful it'll be for you the
high ground is when you say something
that in the context of people debating
and being on different sides
you can find something that both sides
just have to agree with
it's just the the one thought that's
above them all
and here's my suggestion for that
the high ground is that looking
backwards rarely leads anyone forward
looking backwards rarely leads
anyone forward
do you feel that that's the high ground
the moment i said it
you said to yourself that's true
i can't think of an example that's where
that's not true
is that always true i think it is
i think it's always true because the
cards that you have to play
let's say you're playing poker doesn't
matter what your old cards were
i mean the old cards might have been a
story about you being very unlucky and
you lost a lot of
poker hands before that but it's your
current hand that matters
it's only your current hand that will
win the pot
you can't win a pot with a hand you used
to have
so looking at it obsessively in your
rear view mirror
doesn't make you a better poker player
what does make you a good poker player
is learning the rules learning
the odds learning essentially what would
be a life strategy
applied to poker just learning learning
how stuff works
that would be really useful so
looking backwards rarely leads anyone
forward everybody would agree with that
the moment they hear it and they're like
oh
shoot that's true and i would say to
thrive in the future teach
success strategies not victimhood
now victimhood has advantages
it's not like it doesn't have any
advantages here's one of the advantages
of
victimhood it's good for the leaders
because that's how they get to be
leaders they talk about all the
victimhood
and then they get to be the leaders it's
not good for the people they're leading
it's not even a little bit good now i
suppose if the leaders could use all
this victimhood to get some special
special laws or something that'd be
pretty good
but here's the problem where are we on
the the long
arc toward justice and equality
right that arc you have to look at what
place you are on it to decide what your
strategy is
in any given place if this were the 60s
complaining about victimhood very good
strategy
because the victimhood is just so
gigantic and so everywhere
that you need to complain about it
nobody's going to fix it unless you
complain right
but once you get to this phase of the
arc
toward equality and the difference
between
you know everybody is a little bit
smaller
the uh the uh
the strategy has to change and once you
get to the the smaller differences and
really where the individual differences
overwhelm the individual differences
between any two people
completely overwhelm any racial
disparities
right that means these two are not even
close
nobody i don't know
have you even ever in your life seen a
qualified black person turned down for a
job
in favor of a less qualified white
person
have you ever seen that i've been in a
lot of hiring and corporate situations
i've never even seen it once
i've never seen it once individual
qualities just overwhelm any racial
stuff
in 2021 i mean by a mile it's not even
close
so complaining made and victimhood
as a frame made complete sense in the
60s it was a good strategy
it's just it's a terrible strategy now
except for the leaders
so the leaders no longer represent the
the people they're leading and that's a
big problem right now
all right um let's see what else is
going on
uh cnn
has apparently hired some psychics and
they're reading the news from the future
and so one of the things here's a
headline on an opinion piece in cnn
today
says arizona and georgia audits move
forward
as republicans continue to push election
fraud lies wait a minute
do i not understand what an audit is
because in my simplistic view of the
world
i thought an audit was where you find
out
things that you didn't know already
am i wrong because cnn seems to indicate
that an audit
is a thing you do to find out what you
already knew before the audit
and i'm not sure that makes sense
and i wonder how many viewers of cnn say
to themselves
yeah we don't need to wait for the
result of the audit
because it's being reported there on cnn
that there's nothing to see
now i'm not predicting that we will find
anything that's some massive fraud
i don't know that anything will be found
in these audits
and i don't really have a prediction
about it you know my my prediction about
election integrity is that our system
has to get hacked we just don't know
when it happens
it's either already happened or it will
definitely happen in the future
but we don't know where we are in the
timeline maybe the audit will
kick that up who knows but here are some
words they could have used
that i feel would have been fair enough
instead of calling it election fraud
lies
the part we don't know about until the
audit's over could have said it was
unfounded
you know you could argue whether was
founded or unfounded
but i think unfounded would be a good
opinion word
you could say it's unproven it's
unproven
i think even people who think it's sarah
would say that's true
you could say it's baseless you could
argue whether it's
base less or not enough base
to prove it but at least that would be
within the
opinion realm right unfounded unproven
baseless
all good opinion words i would accept
any of them
but election fraud lies
how do they know how it's going to turn
out
and we just accept this uncritically as
if cnn knows how an audit will turn out
the whole point of the audit is that you
don't know how it turns out
all right elon musk had the funniest
tweet i've seen on cryptocurrencies and
there have been a lot of funny tweets in
that category a
twitter user named david lee tweeted at
musk
and said curie curious what are your
thoughts on
ethereum 2.0 cardano solano
polkadot iota and others that are trying
to scale with
low fees now if you're not in the
cryptocurrency world
um the only thing you need to know to
understand this
is that cryptocurrency is really
complicated
meaning that there's a whole bunch of
different cryptocurrencies
they all have their own characteristics
and and rules etc
and so understanding all of the
different ones and what what makes one
maybe a better choice for the future
which one is extendable which one could
scale better all those things make
make it an incredibly complicated
thing that crypto geeks like to argue
about
forever so what does the biggest
geek in the world elon musk and i say
that with affection um
so what does he say when david lee
mentions all these cryptos and
and then asks this question he goes what
makes you choose
doge over them now doge
is a cryptocurrency that was started as
a joke as i understand it
and has a little dog as its
you know character and uh there were
memes
involving the crypto until so many
people bought it that it's
it's become sort of a serious thing that
started as a joke
so david lee says you know what about
all these cryptos blah blah what makes
you choose
doge over them and here's elon musk one
of the smartest people
in the world who's going to tell you
everything you need about cryptocurrency
are you ready
i will now teach you courtesy of
elon musk all the important things you
know but
you need to know about which
cryptocurrency to buy okay
here it is he said doge
has dogs and memes whereas the others do
not
that is the best answer you'll ever hear
on cryptocurrencies now the point of it
is
that it's all irrational right
the moment you try to act as if any of
this is rational
like oh the reasons bitcoin will go up
are x y and z
the reasons ethereum is good is because
you know you can have daps and whatever
and and elon musk just rips a hole in
all of that
 just says now dodge doge has
dogs and memes
whereas the others do not that is
literally all you need to know about
cryptocurrency
everything else is a detail that you
didn't need to know
so uh there's that
uh there's still some questions about
trump obstructing justice and the russia
investigation
i can't believe this story is still out
there and
it's obvious that you know biden is
starting to struggle a little bit
as new presidents do after a few months
of honeymoon
not quite getting his legislation
through et cetera and
i guess the news just needs to kick
trump around a little bit more
so there's calls for unredacting
um some parts of bill barr's memo about
obstruction of justice blah blah and
it's a boring story and if not
nothing else gets unredacted we'll never
hear about it again
all right here's a fake news alert or is
it
apparently black lives matter one of the
organization's
twitter feeds uh tweeted that they
indicated support for
the palestinians during the uh the
mix-up between hamas and
israel now apparently fox news and the
daily wire
reported that as black lives matter was
supporting
hamas but hamas
of course is the political military
terrorist part
that is just you know a component of the
palestinians it's just one component
and so the fake news part of it is it
was not
hamas that black lives matter mentioned
but rather the palestinian people
and they had some solidarity with them
said the the tweet
now uh the news today is that fox news
and the daily wire i guess
are being accused of fake news because
what they should have reported
is that black lives matter supports the
palestinian people in sort of a general
human human kind of a way and not hamas
so does that sound about right to you
uh everything good there that that
clarification
uh
hey richard uh richard thomas has a
comment he says
scott's a trump chill at heart well
richard
can i call you dick i think i can call
you a dick
um am i a trump
shill at heart is that what i want for
myself
in my heart of hearts is shilling for
the ex-president
the thing i really want to do well
i'm going to put you in timeout
dick try to try to make a comment that
has um
oh i don't know content or entertainment
otherwise you're just a narcissist and
you are
you are condemned all right
so here's my take on the black lives
matter tweet supporting the palestinians
um where is the part of the tweet where
they were supporting the israeli
citizens because if i understand
correctly black lives matter
is trying to avoid the you know the
political part and just support the
people
but were there not missiles and or bombs
heading in both directions were not the
palestinian people
definitely in danger and under attack
they were
but were not the israeli public
also under attack at the exact same time
yes they were so when black lives matter
says we support
some of those people but not
these other people who are all very much
joined as part of one story what is the
reasonable
interpretation of that the reasonable
interpretation of that
is they're either anti-semitic or they
were supporting hamas
can you come up with another
interpretation
i can't think of another interpretation
it's either anti-semitic
or they are actually supporting hamas
because they're not mentioning the the
israeli victims and
i don't know how you ignore that right
it was missiles and bombs at both
people's public
at the same time
how do you have how do you have empathy
for only half of them
um ridiculous so this is the a rare case
of a news story that got fact checked as
fake news
but you can also fact check the fact
check as a fake fact check
which reverses the fake news back to
real news
and that's as clear as cryptocurrency
all right
um here is an interesting exchange of
tweets
ed markey in congress he was uh
putting some shade on republicans he's a
democrat and he said
by tweet you cannot negotiate a climate
bill with climate deniers
representative dan crenshaw uh objected
that and tweeted
you aren't you liar
now i like this
i love that crenshaw starts with
you liar because that's all this is
this is literally a public lie
and i i just like that a politician just
says it's just a lie
you know no no beating around the bush
and he says we aren't denying climate
change we're just pointing out that your
solutions will hurt people and do
nothing to prevent
climate change now some of you are
already saying at this point
is that true is it true what
dan crenshaw says that republicans are
not
denying climate change being human
caused
michael schellenberger weighed in and
said
michael says i testified before congress
on climate change and energy
six times since january and not a single
time
did i hear any member of congress deny
either the reality of climate change nor
humankind's contribution to it
now michael followed up with another
tweet saying that he's not saying there
are no deniers in congress
but he's pointing out if they are there
they're kind of quiet
because he's been deeply involved in
direct conversations
and just nobody brought it up nobody
brought it up
did you know that
i'm getting a tip for blocking a dick
and that's the way it should be so
i have some curiosity about this myself
now i do
i do believe that there are climate
change deniers in the republican party
but is it true that they are so so few
of them that they're sort of irrelevant
you know does that check out
because i'm trying to think who in
the republican party at least lately
let's say in the last i don't know two
years can you think of a republican be
um i think representative greene might
have said something
uh marjorie taylor green but can you
think of
other republicans who are saying out
loud that there's no human-caused
climate change are there people
doing that still now uh i know a lot of
you
are climate deniers or climate change
deniers
specifically the the human part of it
being dangerous
um just to reinforce
uh my view is that humans are changing
the client
the the climate and that it probably is
a really big
problem but not one that we're incapable
of fixing so i believe we're capable of
fixing the problems
but i think it's real i just don't know
how big it is or how well we can predict
it
but it looks real enough to me
um and i could be wrong about that right
so i'll
i'll i'll leave open the possibility
that when i interpret
science that there's a whole lot of
guessing going on so i could be totally
wrong in a humorous little uh
bit of news uh there was a hit piece
in the daily beast by somebody
by by a quote journalist named will
summer
and then the daily beast uh he talks
about how patrick byrne
founder of uh
overstock.com how patrick burn got
kicked off of twitter
for talking about election
irregularities but found a home
on the locals platform uh
full disclosure i am a small investor in
the locals platform
and i also have a community there a
subscription service community where i
put my stuff that i can't put on twitter
and patrick byrne went there as well
and he got criticized for going there
and you know having having the place
where he could have free speech
about his topic which is the election
and uh dave rubin responded to this hit
piece
by noting that patrick byrne is already
making uh over a million dollars a year
on locals
so he has enough subscriptions at five
dollars a pop
that his current run rate is over a
million dollars a year
so patrick byrne got canceled by twitter
goes and does exactly the same thing on
locals
and he's going to make over a million
dollars this year now he's pretty rich i
understand so i'm not sure
a million dollars makes a difference to
him but
how much do you love that how much do
you love the fact
he got cancelled into making a million
dollars
full disclosure again uh my community on
locals is quite robust
and um i'm actually
shocked how well this is working
in terms of if you you know if you're
worried about your content not
not being um appropriate for the general
public because you're going to get
cancelled
you could make a ton of money
either on sub stack which is another
place people are going
or locals subscription service so you
can see why
twitter is working so hard to come up
with a subscription service
i'm not sure why they haven't yet but
you can see that the future is this kind
of model
because the public is willing to pay for
content that they like
what the public doesn't like is somebody
else telling them what they can see
the public does not like to be told what
they can see and what they can't see
but they don't mind paying for it at
least enough of them to make it a
it's not just a good business model it's
freaking amazing
it's the best thing i've ever seen to
give you an idea
of how well the subscription service
works
compared to youtube so i have
at this point over 100 000 subscribers
on youtube
and it's monetized there's ads on it and
everything but the youtube revenue
is just it's just a fraction of what you
can do on a
subscription service it's not even close
uh how much is locals my my community i
charge
seven dollars per month or there's a
special going on now
that you can get a uh two free months if
you buy a
a year subscription so that's a new
offer
uh each of the locals communities
charges whatever they want
so that's that's the beauty of that they
can just charge what they want
i pick seven because it's a lucky number
there's no other reason
i just saw i just thought oh seven i
think patrick byrne is five dollars
a month and that worked out
um if you went to college you paid to
hear somebody speak yeah
i guess you did uh the locals
coin yes the locals coin is another way
that people get
compensated on locals so they they have
their own coin
token sort of thing but will i do it in
a hot tub i might
uh yes you get to choose your price that
is correct somebody asked me it's seven
dollars a month
for one person that's correct yeah we we
might look at
um we might look at some models where
you can
buy a group of people but you do find
that
well let me uh let me make the case
for why seven dollars a month is not as
bad as you think
i have a subscription service to hbo max
uh i've watched no content on it this
month that i cared about
i have a subscription to disney plus or
whatever it is the street
streaming service uh actually after i
watched all of the mandalorian series
there wasn't a single thing on there
that i wanted to watch ever again
i'm still paying for it i have netflix
about once every three or four months i
find something on netflix that's worth
watching
i have a a subscription to hulu
that i've watched one thing on
ever it has lots of stuff i'm just not
interested in it or i've already seen it
so with my content you get
new content 45 minutes to an hour
or so plus a lot of postings um
and a lot of micro lessons so the the
proposition that i offer for my
subscribers
is that for seven dollars a month i will
deliver to you
thousands of dollars worth of value
meaning that if if i had offered it for
thousands of dollars people would buy it
maybe you wouldn't
but people would it would be worth
thousands of dollars so i'm teaching uh
success strategies and so far the people
who followed me
on locals would say and if there are any
of them here you can
you can weigh in actually let's do that
there i think there are enough people
here
who follow me on locals that also
are on this live stream right now how
many of you who follow me on locals are
getting
seven dollars worth of value per month
in terms of your
your total your life value
right so i'm not just giving you some
entertainment for an hour
i'm trying to change people's lives look
at the comments
look at all the yeses
it's just a it's a solid wall of yes
right there
all right so that's what i'm offering
i'm offering that
if you don't get seven if you don't get
thousands of dollars worth of value
every month every month every single
month
for seven dollars then it wasn't worth
it to you but look at the number of
people who are getting
thousands of dollars of value for seven
dollars every month
um and one comment says wish you
interacted more with people's
locals posts well you know i do read
most of them and i do a lot of liking on
them but it's hard to
hard to comment on hundreds and hundreds
of stuff
yeah i mean look at the comments it's
overwhelming
it's pretty it's just a solid wall of
yes
and that's so that's the point now how
many of you
would would say that you got thousands
of dollars of value and of watching
cnn this year or watching whatever your
favorite news channel is did you get
thousands of dollars worth of value
every month from any other streaming
service
probably not yet the people who are
watching patrick byrne
are getting information about the
election
from patrick that they're not seeing on
the
any other source if you could find out
something you really cared about
in this case the election and you can
see things that you weren't seeing
anywhere else
and you really care about it is it worth
five dollars a month yeah
yeah for a lot of people it is i think
he has over 19 000 people
want exactly that so
locals is just terrific for these uh
specific cases where where people just
want more of something specific
um thank you derek
all right that's all for now i also run
my robots
read news comic which is my extra
naughty comic
you may have seen a few of them on
twitter but most of them are
behind the subscription wall because
they're a little bit too
edgy to to allow it to the public and by
the way
you want to know something cool this is
the coolest thing
and you would only get this in a
subscription service
right because people want to be there
they subscribed
but i will often post something and i'll
ask people
not to share it outside of locals
because they could you know just
screenshot it and tweet it would be easy
i don't think
anybody has i don't think even on
one occasion i've asked people not to
share something
i don't think i ever left locals not
once and i didn't even expect that you
know i figured i was taking a risk
and i'm sure at some point it'll happen
but
i could not be more amazed that there
are
i know 6 600 people looking at
my edgy stuff that would get me canceled
in the real world
and they're not they're not tweeting it
just because i asked them
that's all i just asked them to and they
didn't do it i'm blown away by that by
the way i'm just blown away that that's
even a possibility
that that could be happening challenge
accepted
i'm sure some trolls will come in and
and do just all of that but
if you want to pay seven dollars a month
to do that uh go ahead
and thank you for all the good comments
and i'll talk to you
tomorrow
