dude
[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of civilization this is
the place to be you know a lot of people
have decided to be somewhere else not
watching this live
wow do we feel sorry for them we should
yes feel terrible for them
let me get that little wire out of your
way there you go there you go
now if you'd like to take your
experience up to levels that only a
Chinese weather balloon has ever seen
all you need is a cover of my girl glass
a tanker Chelsea's time a canteen jogger
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's the dopamine the end of
the day the thing makes everything
better
it's called the simultaneous
it happens now
seriously you just finished your coffee
there's somebody on YouTube I mean we're
just going to mock you over on the
locals platform
didn't time the coffee right over on
YouTube
well don't do that again
you've been warned
well the best and weirdest story of the
day
I guess this happened yesterday or the
day before somehow I missed this story
until just recently
so yay it has commanded fighting
with a post on Instagram I'm not making
this up
everything I say now about this story is
actually true
I'm actually this is real
yay posted on Instagram watching Jonah
Hill in 21 Jump Street made me like
Jewish people again
and then he goes on no one should take
anger against one or two individuals and
transform that into hatred toward
millions of innocent people
and then he says no Christian can be
labeled anti-semite knowing Jesus is Jew
thank you Jonah Hill I love you
is
this is the craziest best thing he's
done yet
because now just just think about how
you feel about it
just release release yourself from you
know the logic of it don't think of the
story the details just just tell me how
you feel about it
it totally works
this is the funny thing the funny thing
is that we laugh at it because it's just
so weird
and yet it totally works
in my opinion it would be hard to be mad
at him after he said that
because first of all he's saying no one
should take anger so he's basically
he's basically disavowing himself
he's disavowing himself and he's giving
this ridiculous reason why he's come to
this conclusion
and the reason that he's giving is so
funny
that you sort of believe it
even though it couldn't possibly be true
that it's the only thing that changed
his mind but the fact that he went at it
like this
is kind to perfect
and now I can't speak for the Jewish
community and anybody who supports them
for how they might feel about this but
what do you really want from people
what do you want from people
if somebody had offended me or some
group I'm with and then later came at me
with this that Joni Hill you know cured
him of hating my group and uh and then
he says as clearly as possible no one
should take anger
about a few people in generalize it to
Millions that's all you wanted to hear
right
that was literally exactly what you
wanted him to say no you should not
generalize it to people because you
mattered a few
I feel like he nailed it
as silly as this is I think he actually
nailed it
we'll see we'll see I suppose it depends
what he does after this but that could
not be a more quirky perfect artistic
the way to approach it I just love that
all right
what do you think is the biggest source
of racism in the country
Democrats climate change teachers unions
Republicans
it's Democrats right
because all the other categories are
Democrats
right the the climate change pushers who
want to get rid of your cheap energy
that
minorities would love to use
um teachers unions mostly Democrats is
basically Democrats so Democrats in
their in their typical narcissistic way
have created an entire philosophy around
projection
pretty much it's just projection so
they're gigantic racists
who only see the world through racial
terms and they're trying to project that
on everybody else and make everybody
else the bad guy now I'm not saying
there aren't any
conservative racists of course there are
but the fact that the Democrats have
made it their main theme certainly makes
race the uh the big issue now I want to
push back on something that a lot of my
audience says to me in various ways
how many of you think that the election
of Obama made race relations worse
let me see your actions
because if you trace if you trace the
you know race relations line I think
Gallup attracts it it looks like the
election of Obama
sure all right but do you blame Obama
for that let's say the timing the timing
does seem to be
around the Obama election but do you
blame Obama for that
I'm saying mostly yes yes yes all right
here I'm gonna I'm gonna do something
you don't like at all
I think that was entirely the
right-leaning media that wasn't Obama
I think if the right leading media had
not made a racist
kind of framing of him from the first
moment you wouldn't have noticed
that's right to me to me it looks like
the media assigned um
people the opinion that
Obama was going to be bad for white
people and then white people adopted
that view
and so I was watching you at the time
and to me it looked like a massive psyop
against Obama
that that you know the whole uh
I mean I actually talked to somebody
during Obama's presidency in the middle
of his presidency
there was a republican who told me that
it's a known fact that Obama is a Muslim
and I said what
and he said yeah I mean everybody knows
he's and I said you mean like an actual
practice a Muslim as in if you asked him
he would say yes I'm a Muslim he said
yes
everybody knows he's a practicing Muslim
now where do you get that
this is somebody who followed you know
right-leaning news it came to the
conclusion that that Obama was a Muslim
somebody says he is a Muslim there you
go do you think that it's only the left
that guess brainwashed by the news
it's not it's not just the left
yeah to me I think that Obama was a
marker
for you know he certainly marks the time
that race race relations started to
plummet but I think that was almost
entirely because of the way the news
handled it that's my opinion because you
know I remember going through that
period
and thinking oh my God it's just every
day
something that's vaguely racially
related or race scare or Obama's going
to take away whatever white people like
yeah to me
when I tell you that the media assigns
our opinions you don't think I only mean
liberals right
everybody's opinion is assigned not all
of us you know I'm even saying it and I
know that my opinions are probably
coming from the media I mean I try as
hard as I can to you know find some
space between the media narratives and
what I think but have you noticed how
often I end up snapping into the meat
into the narrative like everybody else
it's almost irresistible
to get pulled into you know one of the
binaries
so I'm sure it's happening to me I'd be
surprised if it's not happening to all
of you
but keep that in mind that you may be
getting your opinions more from the
media than you think because that's how
it works
but let's talk about the race absurdity
so we've clearly gotten to the point of
race relations absurdity
because the race grifters have been
running the show for a while the race
grifters or anybody who makes money
complaining about race basically
and
here's the newest one CNN has an article
about digital blackface
so there's a complaint that white people
have been using memes in which a black
American is saying something that's you
know witty or funny or something and it
fits the story
so a bunch of white people keep using
these memes of black people
now white people also use memes of white
people I don't know if you knew that but
memes actually have lots of different
um representation
but apparently if you're a white person
and you use one that has a black person
in it and I'm not saying these are
insulting they just are memes yeah memes
always make people look silly but it's
not about you know race
um and here let me explain why this is
digital blackface
according to CNN opinion piece digital
blackface involves white people play
acting and being black
what
if you send a meme around or you play
acting or being black
I was not aware of that rule I thought
that a meme that featured a black
American was
like every other meme it was just a meme
that's what I thought I didn't realize
that I was play acting being black when
I did it
um
this is from some cultural Clinic
and the cultural critic says the
internet thrives on white people
laughing at exaggerated displays of
Blackness
don't we also laugh at exaggerated
displays of Karens
I've seen as many Karen videos
as anything else I mean
it's more about the people being
interesting not anyway
um
reflecting a tendency among some to see
quote black people as walking hyperbole
is that a problem
you know I woke up this morning and I
thought you know I hope there's no big
problems today and then I find out that
white people are using memes and
and therefore seeing black people as
walking hyperbole
have we run out of problems
are we completely out of problems
they're sending memes around that are
not your own race is mocking people
for being walking hyperbole I mean you
have to try really hard to make that
racist you got to try really hard but I
guess they succeeded
I saw a tweet for you Christopher Ruffo
rufo uh it was a black mother who was
doing a very forceful denunciation of
ethnic studies curriculum in Minnesota
and her complaint was that it was
teaching black kids that their obstacles
you know racism obstacles so she was
worried that it gave them the idea that
they can't succeed
because it was telling them through all
these obstacles and she would rather
have her children and other black kids I
guess be told that they can succeed
which is pretty smart
then she went on too far
it started out great I was going to
Tweet this thing I was like oh finally
somebody who can actually see what's
good for Black America
is black so maybe somebody will listen
to her and is making a real good point
and I was like ah yes that's it that's
exactly what I want to say
and then she went and father further and
said quote
I can see why you white proponents of
this bill might support it it's not your
kids being told they can't succeed and
you get to shed some of your white guilt
in the process
okay so it turns out she's a huge racist
but she's not wrong
about the messages sentenced to black
kids I think she's right about that
Jesus happens to be a racist
um do you believe that white people are
why the ethnic studies are being taught
in school
now I do believe that probably in this
particular school there might be more
white people and therefore they might be
the majority that are voting for it
right but let me ask you this if the
black population of this same area in
Minnesota if the black population did
not want ethnic studies do you think
that the white people would be pushing
it no no you do want it no we don't want
it no you really do no no so even though
the white people are the ones doing all
the promoting and voting and you know
they they might have control of the
levers of power
they wouldn't do it
unless there was a demand for it
so here she is blaming the white people
for doing trying to do something that
obviously they think is for the benefit
of black people but the important thing
here is that it's a white people's fault
that's the important part
and I'm glad that This Racist mother
finally got to the important part that
somehow it's still white people's fault
that's that's that's the key
the key factor here
well speaking on more ridiculous race
related things the association of
American medical colleges
had some data on
different ethnicities getting into
medical school now I had heard for a
long time
that Asian Americans were being
suppressed
and discriminated against and I think
there was a lawsuit that they won they
showed that but I didn't know how bad it
was
did you have any idea how bad it is
that the best Asian-American student has
the same chance of getting into medical
school as the worst blackston
it's the same
what
now when I say the worst these are all
people who are within the range of
getting into medical school right so the
worst person who gets into the middle
school school is going to be smarter
than the average person
but
there's a huge difference
now as someone tweeted
it feels like they're trying to make you
a racist
I mean let's be honest here
if you knew that one group of people was
getting in with lower qualifications
than the other on average
on average averages do not apply to any
individual
but do you interview your doctor
do you say well this is just a first
interview
if if things don't go well I'm going to
talk to a few other doctors some of you
do some of you do but would you actually
know how to judge your doctor's
qualifications based on one
the conversation
because if if they have a degree from
the same school what do you know about
them nothing you don't know anything
about them
how many of you think that it would be
let's say
morally suspect but wise to discriminate
in choosing a doctor how many think it
would be to your best interest although
we don't like to discriminate
I'm not recommending it how many think
it would be to your best interest to
discriminate wildly in choosing a doctor
given these this data yeah it's mostly
yeses of course
now
nobody can recommend discrimination
but I would give you this following
guide
if it's something about let's say hiring
hiring and firing
you should really judge the individual
you really shouldn't if it's life and
death though
you should do whatever you need to stay
safe
would you agree if it's life and death
discriminate all you want
it's not even illegal
would you go into a neighborhood that
looked dangerous statistically
or would you say well I'm going to judge
all the individuals in that neighborhood
individually
no you say that looks like a dangerous
neighbor it'll stay out of it
so
yeah I do think that if you're not
discriminating for your own well-being
you're not doing it right
Scott doesn't know what discriminate
means
pretty sure I do that's like the dumbest
comment I've seen
forever
all right
so that was disturbing
that there's such a difference
all right um
there was a trump rally in Waco
and the the Trump rally as the news
likes to tell us is in the shadow of his
many legal problems his many illegal
problems so shall we summarize Trump's
many legal problems yeah there are four
of them and oh boy oh boy the walls are
closing in there's a Stormy Daniels
thing that even Mario Cuomo the
ex-governor of New York says quote I
think it's all politics and that's why I
think the people of this country are
saying Cuomo continued it just feeds
that anger in that cynicism and the
partisanship Cuomo continues it's a
coincidence that Bragg goes after Trump
and Tish James goes after Trump and
Georgia goes after Trump that's all a
coincidence I think it feeds the
citizens and that's the cancer in our
body politic right now if you can't
convince Mario Cuomo
that this that the Stormy Daniels thing
is real even Mario Cuomo
very Democrat says no this it's not real
it's just political all three of them
all three of them so uh the Georgia find
the votes do you really think there's
any chance that Trump is in legal
trouble for saying fine votes
no you don't have to be your dershowitz
to Know You couldn't possibly prosecute
them for using the words of find votes
you know the news is trying to say is he
pressured he did all this thing but when
you come down to it you have to look at
what he said
and what he said does not indicate a
crime so there's no risk in that the
January 6 protest protests peacefully
he's been looked into completely there's
nothing there there's no prosecution
that's going to happen there how about
those Mar-A-Lago documents
well it's a little awkward now that Joe
Biden has some documents isn't it
so there are four legal problems for
Trump and all four of them help him
all four of them help him because
there's no way he's getting prosecuted
for any of this or or if it is it would
be a misdemeanor or something and
all it does is uh as Mario Cuomo says
accurately it just feeds the anger and
cynicism
do you think that has anything to do
with why his Waco rally was huge very
successful Waco rally apparently
yeah I feel like these these attacks on
Trump are making him stronger at the
moment
I also feel that the only reason that
DeSantis was looking so good
is that Trump was removing himself from
the news for so long
have you noticed that the moment Trump
you know gets close to powering up like
he's he's just starting to power up into
full strength as soon as he does
DeSantis disappears
doesn't he and I mean I mean in terms of
the wattage you know just the energy
like Trump is just
infinitely interesting they love him or
hate him he's interesting and DeSantis
I try to be interesting I try to be
interested in them but I have to work at
it would you agree
I want this sentence to be interesting
do I have to uh to kind of put a little
effort into finding out what he's up to
but with Trump it's like yeah I do
support Trump entertain me like I'm just
automatically drawn to that energy and
it doesn't have to do with policy it's
not about policy because I don't you
know I don't have something a big
difference in policy between the two of
them that that's uh animated me right
now
well
so I would say that if Trump just stays
healthy and doesn't create some new
some new uh issue he should Waltz right
into the nomination what do you think
yeah now I'm still I'm still endorsing
the Vivek
rava Swami because I think we need
somebody younger and I think that Trump
is insanely uh divisive
now he's divisive not because of what he
says exactly but because of the way the
Democrats are going to treat him so
Trump is divisive the same way Obama was
you put Obama in office and you know Fox
News is going to go crazy on him for
eight years
you put Trump in office you know CNN
MSNBC you're going to go crazy on it for
eight years but I don't know that that
would be different with anybody else
maybe less wattage you know DeSantis
would be more of a boring muted attack
or something
but it's I think we're at the point
where it's going to be full-scale war no
matter whether it's a democrat or a
republican probably doesn't matter
all right
um
Trump is getting some pushback because
he's saying that if he gets come if he
gets uh indicted or arrested for this uh
Stormy Daniels stuff
that there could be what is known by all
that no crime has been committed talking
about the Stormy Daniels payments and
also known the potential death and
destruction destruction is such a false
charge could be catastrophic for our
country so Trump is basically saying
that his supporters might turn to death
and destruction if he's charged
that's not ideal is it
that's not ideal
but you know what else it's also honest
it's hard for me to get uh like I want
to not like this
because it seems so unproductive
but I can't fault him for being honest
there is a risk of death and destruction
and I I don't mean and I certainly don't
mean that to be any kind of like warning
or anything like that I'm just saying it
as a objective fact it's probably true
now I don't think it'd be massive
you know you use this hyperbole but I
think there could be trouble
um and the trouble would be
because the charges would be so
obviously political as Mario Cuomo
points out everybody can see his
political
so do you want to live in the country
where
uh let me ask you this would you be
happier living in the country where
Trump could be arrested on a obviously
false charge to take him off and there
would be no there would be no violence
no violence
is that the country you want to live in
that that somebody can be taken off the
field for obviously not legal means
obviously not legal now I think you want
to live in a country where violence is
on the table
I don't recommend it
do not recommend it I want to be as
clear as possible do not recommend
violence but I don't want to live in a
country where it's not on the table
so I'm going to say this on the table
it's just on the table I don't recommend
it
but let's not kid ourselves if you take
down the president on bogus charges that
are obviously bogus yeah there could be
some violence
and I don't want to live in a country
where that's not true
at the same time I don't want any
violence
all right
I don't know if you noticed that uh
Trump is
jumping on the build more comments that
desantises the tribute band
you may remember I told you that once
you hear that DeSantis is the tribute
band
that's like a kill shot
I was wondering how long it would take
Trump to
you know repeat that didn't take him
long he was on it yeah so he's uh
he's definitely echoing that trivia bad
thing yeah I was quoting Bill Maher
which makes it stronger
um
so
if you're wondering if Trump still has
that Keen political Instinct that got
him to be president the first time
well this would be one indication yes
yeah it's not it's not everything
but we do see the spark of uh having
basically a higher gear than the people
he's competing against that's what I see
um so an article by Julie Kelly in
American greatness
and I was not up to date on how many FBI
agents have been outed in various
operations but apparently the proud boys
involvement in January 6. according to
this Julie Kelly story was almost
entirely set up by the FBI
so here's what we know the leader of the
proud boys was not there on January 6.
right the leader wasn't there
which tells me it wasn't coming from
leadership
it was coming from somewhere else now we
know that apparently there was a map
I think a map found with the proud boys
that would show sort of an angle of
attack for the capital and if you
thought that the proud boys had a map
for an Insurrection and having had to
get to the vulnerable parts of the
capital Did you know that that came from
the FBI
there was an FBI map the FBI was giving
it to the proud boys
like that that's in the news I mean I
think it's true I don't trust the news
anymore but I think it's true
now when you hear stuff like that
and I don't think there are any proud
boys were there any proud boys that got
picked up for violence none of them were
armed they weren't armed
so more and more it looks like January 6
was you know an FBI operation some kind
of an OP
and more and more it looks like the
Democrats are
um basically a criminal organization at
this point
they are a criminal organization
I think you could use a RICO law to take
down all the Democrats at this point
like actually
like actually literally
couldn't you is there any lawyer who can
tell me I feel like the the the
collusion
that's been used against Trump
should be a RICO violation right because
they're acting like a criminal
organization
they're not acting like a political
organization they're they're actually
committing crimes
under an organized umbrella of
associations
that's Rico right
sovereign immunity
do individuals have sovereign immunity
I don't think a member of the
intelligence agency have sovereign
immunity
I'm talking about
you know I mean maybe that maybe
Congress has some immunity but there's
still enough people as part of the
operation
yeah who would charge him yeah that's a
problem
Rico is just politics
State actors have immunity
well what is a state actor
if you're an elected official you have
immunity or probably an appointed
official right but what if you're uh
what if you're just working for a
paycheck or you're a political pundit on
TV or you're the news
because I think you could find a web of
Ricoh type connections
with members of the media
employees of the Department of Justice
employees of the FBI
are they all immune
yeah I don't think they have immunity
for illegal actions do they
they probably have only immunity for
civil suits would that be true
because yeah if you if you do a criminal
thing it doesn't matter if you're
elected that's the whole point of the
stuff against Trump
all right
they're immune from you know they're not
immune from criminal law
okay well
in my opinion is going to the level
where it looks like just a criminal
organization
that's not hyperbole
I don't intend that to be hyper I think
the Democrats have actually reached the
level collectively that it looks like a
RICO case to me
now I don't think there's any chance of
that happening but
um I don't I don't see them as just a
political party anymore
think about all the things that
Republicans have been blamed of
blamed for
mostly they're blamed for crimes that
didn't happen
you know obviously there are lots of
lower level officials of all types who
get convicted for everything so I'm not
talking about the you know the state
official you heard about that one time
but in in National politics
it seems to me the Republicans have not
committed any major crimes
I guess you'd count you know people like
uh
Michael Cohen or something but are they
political I guess they are sort of
yeah to me it looks like
um one is a criminal organization the
other's not
all right AOC came out against Banning
Tick Tock uh would you like to know the
reasons that she gave
for wanting to not ban tick tock
all right here's AOC she looked into it
and the reason she gave our I'll just
summarize them I don't understand
anything about the topic
that's my summary summarization of her
reasons her reasons showed she didn't
understand the topic at all she actually
ignored the influence part of it where
where China can just decide how to
influence us by
tweaking acting like that didn't exist
now what if I told you about the people
who act like the big risk the influence
part is
is the
it doesn't exist and they act like the
data security part is real and then they
take it to the next level of obviously
either lying or bought off which is they
say well other other American companies
have you know data problems
so why why would we be racist against
China
so imagine if you will that in public
she's acting like an American company
should be treated the same as an
adversarial country China
acts like there's no difference between
our own country and an adversary country
that what is that now I can't even tell
if that's stupid or just bought off
I mean nobody would be that stupid right
except that there are a number of
politicians who are acting exactly that
stupid
and I really can't tell if they think
the data security problem is the big
problem
and they just don't know the other one
is there or are they lying
are they lie
so here's my take on Tick Tock a hundred
percent of the people who can explain
the risk
want to ban it
a hundred percent of the people who can
explain the risk want to ban it in other
words if you see somebody say well well
there are two risks one is they get a
private data correct correct and the
other is that they can influence our
opinions through the algorithm correct
there's nobody here's here's my claim
nobody who can even explain the risks
is in favor of keeping Tick Tock nobody
you won't see it
everybody who is in favor of of keeping
Tick Tock will be unable to explain the
situation and they'll say stuff like
well Facebook has your data too
if you say Facebook has your data too
you are either stupid
you know so uninformed that I think I'd
have to call you stupid or you're lying
you're lying because you think it's good
for your I don't know your politics or
something
yeah or both yeah she could be stupid
and lying that's true
yeah
mahad are you really saying that
Facebook has your data too
I can't tell if that's a joke
oh my god there are people on YouTube
saying what's the difference between
Facebook having your data in China
I want to see you say that out loud
say in the con I want to see a how
stupid you are ask me what's the
difference between an American company
having your data and the and a Chinese
adversarial company ask it again well I
want to see you put that in writing go
ahead
there it is Facebook is as bad as China
there's somebody willing to say that out
loud in public the Facebook is as bad as
China
are you
are you a Chinese troll
I mean nobody with a brain could think
that
all right
so
um here's a question for you has AOC
ever been in favor of a policy that
wasn't good for China
now I don't know the answer to this but
I'll say so AOC is big for climate
change which is mostly good for China
bad for the United States
did she oppose uh tariffs
did AOC oppose tariffs on China
because because Trump's the first one
who brought it up so I feel like she
probably did
yeah is she in favor of ESG which is
terrible for America yes
yep
yeah I don't think there's anything that
she's in favor of that isn't good for
China and bad for America
has anybody not noticed that
am I the only one who's noticed that all
of her policies are pro-china and
anti-American
it's a little bit hard to to miss the
pattern at this point
that's a preview pattern
well uh Professor Scott Galloway was on
Real Time with Bill Maher and Tick Tock
came up and
I like to call Scott Galloway one of the
better Scots
I keep track of all the people named
Scott
you know in case one's a murderer
yes it was a Scott Peterson was it Scott
Peterson who killed his wife
that's a bad Scott
so you have some bad Scots
you got some good ones
so Scott Galloway he's he's right in the
he's at least in the top five of Scots
he might even be in the top three he's
an excellent Scott he does a very good
Scott
and I'm happy to have him on board
um but when he was asked about Tick Tock
he accurately described the risk
he accurately said would you want
something jacked into your brain where
your adversary could push a button and
change your opinion because that's what
you have
that's what Tick Tock is it means
effectively jacked into your brain and
China can push one button and change
your opinion they can do that now the
way he put it was even better than I put
it which is they can they can make sure
that every day their app makes Americans
feel a little bit shittier about their
life
what's that do to your country
every day you feel a little bit shittier
about yourself and your country
yeah that's what it's doing right now
now given that that Scott Galloway one
of the better Scots
could accurately describe the risk what
side do you think he was on
well I think I broadcast that everybody
who can accurately describe the risk is
on the same side
everybody
who's either lying to you about the risk
or leaving it out
they could be on the other side
it's that simple and you could actually
do this test I'd love to see somebody
like a Matt Gates or Thomas Massey do
this if they have some kind of thing say
you know I've discovered that anybody
who can describe the risk is against it
can you describe the risk in your own
words can you describe the risk and then
when they failed to do it say are you
not aware of the biggest risk all right
did you actually come prepared for this
this hearing you're all prepared and
you're here and you don't know the
biggest risk of tick tock that it's the
persuasion not the data
how in the world could you come here and
not know the biggest risk
I'd love to see that
all right uh
as you know AI is going to change
everything
you know that all of your apps are going
to be obsolete in about a year right
dating apps might be an exception
because you need an audience of people
on both sides it's not just the app you
need the audience but
your phone is just going to be you
telling you what you want
it doesn't I don't even think it needs
software it just needs to connect I mean
except minimal software to connect to AI
because
correct me if I'm wrong
if if I had a on AI on my phone and
let's say it was a phone designed around
the AI interface so I can either type in
a message or I can say it but if I want
to make a spreadsheet
and the only software I had was AI
don't you think I could already say to
it all right create a spreadsheet and uh
I'm going to start putting some numbers
into it or I put 200 into the top of
that column
you don't you don't think you could just
talk to it and it would form a
spreadsheet
without ever having any spreadsheet
software natively in it
I think it would
it would just have to look at what a
spreadsheet is and then just make it
itself on the Fly
yeah
so I suppose you wanted to send somebody
a message
the old way is you're typing your
message and you've got typos and bad
grammar and all that the new way is
going to be
uh aai
send a email to Bob tell them I'm sorry
I missed the meeting
and then AI would make up a more polite
version of sorry I missed the meeting
and you would never even look at it you
just say go send it
all right
so
here's why I mentioned that it's not
because the the future is fun it's that
every one of your tech companies is
obsolete
did you guys see that coming it might be
the the most existential problem in the
country right now
meaning the one that could kill you the
fastest is that 100 of the economy that
depends on having all these different
apps and softwares it might all be
obsolete in a year
all of it
it could be that only Hardware is what
we sell after a year from now because
software is just AI
and AI will do everything
so you don't need other software
yeah here's how I want to post to
Twitter
a uh AI send a tweet out says something
like this post it to all my social
networks
and then I just posts all the social
networks
I never have to put in a password
imagine not having to use passwords
because the AI knows who you are
because I don't think the AI would ever
be surprised you know the AIS listen to
your voice it might be looking at your
face it knows the patterns that you type
your AI would know if you were a fake
right away
so does it ever need any kind of
credentials do you ever have to put in a
password
my bank already uses my voice but I
guess that's going to be dicey because
you can fake voices now
you just use your face for your password
yet
so
I think it's no passwords just faces
Biometrics and no apps just AI
yeah we can't even imagine what this is
going to be
when when the experts say you can't
imagine what's what's going to happen
like really soon you really really can't
imagine it is literally Beyond
imagination and I don't think we've ever
been here before because even when the
internet was formed there's this famous
video of
um
uh David Bowie
you know when the Internet is just
formed David Bowie is saying you have no
idea what this is going to do it's going
to like connect everything and
everything will be different so David
Bowie could see it you know 20 years
before it happened
but I think everybody could see that
with the internet the internet's sort of
easy to understand it's just oh
everybody's connected
like that's an easy concept and as long
as you know everybody's connected you
can kind of you know Intuit
what that might look like but you cannot
you cannot
into it what AI is going to do
I have no idea and when you combine AI
with uh robots and when you combine AI
with virtual reality imagine entering a
virtual reality world so it looks looks
real and the people that you meet there
are fully sentient
and all of your conversations feel like
real people remember you imagine having
a real friend in the virtual world
that has no human connection they are
just AI but they get to know you
intimately and over time they're more
and more personal and they say more and
more of the things you'd like to hear
fewer the things you don't like to hear
and you just fall in love
that's a hundred percent gonna happen
100 percent
guarantee it
all right
um do you keep seeing these uh horrible
videos of people in the Congo and
various parts of Africa mining for these
Rare Earth minerals and it's just this
big dirty pit with people who recovered
Head To Toe with you know the whatever
the dirt is that they're digging through
and I saw one yesterday there was a you
know
a Cobalt mind you and some people were
being dug out that there's been a
collapse but they got them out and
everybody's cheering and stuff I had I
had two takes on that video number one
I looked at it it looked like the
saddest worst
you know criminally dangerous situation
I've ever seen in my life
and then I heard the people cheering
all happily and laughing when they they
got their co-workers out from under a
collapse
and I thought to myself have you ever
done have you ever studied the theory of
happiness
and the people have this Baseline
happiness that even if you have an
amputation you know a month later you go
back to your Baseline of happiness
I wonder if the people there were
substantially less happy
than somebody who was just like say low
income living somewhere else
I don't know
there's something about the story that
isn't tracking with me
which is why would so many people do it
if it were not their best option
I mean isn't isn't there other option
worse
you're saying they're doing it for the
pay because there's nothing else that
would get paid well that's my point if
the other option is you don't get money
then they think it's their best option
even if it's unhealthy
so I don't know how to how to think of
something where it's their best option
but here's the point I'm going to
everything that they're doing
did you ever see like a like a video of
all the it's like just thousands of
people like Milling around in this big
dirty hole
have you ever just tracked any one of
them
just look at one of them
they're not doing anything
most of them are standing there with a
shovel
and looking at somebody else
it's like 99 out of 100 of them are
doing absolutely nothing they're just
Milling around I don't know why
but is this not the perfect situation
for robots
why are there any humans in those holes
in the first place
what is it that the human can do that
the robot can't do
Sarah says in all caps Scott thought
kovid would collapse the civilization
LOL
Sarah you know that never happened right
are you having an episode
Sarah you okay
you should see somebody about that you
have some kind of disease that's making
you shout in all caps things which only
you remember but never happened
that that's something you should look
into
yeah if you start shouting in all caps a
memory of something that didn't happen
to the person who knows it didn't happen
there's something wrong you need to seek
help so go go take care of that right
away
all right well anyway I think we could
uh we could mine Rare Earth minerals if
we used machines to do it
I think if we use machines
we could do it even in the U.S safely I
think
all right
um
were you expecting it when the Ukraine
war kicked off weren't you expecting the
Russians to use their Advanced cyber
capabilities to
to take down all the networks in Ukraine
and then it sort of didn't happen
yeah they had a few easy wins that
apparently were not lasting
and like here's the uh I guess the
takeaway from this
turns out it's really hard to conduct a
Cyber attack
that's the takeaway
well it turns out it's really hard
so Russia tried as much as they could
but well it turns out it's hard
could couldn't pull it off
did we
did we miscalculate everything about
Russia
did Russia actually have a paper
military and a paper cyber ability
because you know what else we
overestimated do you remember when we
said Russia interfered with the 2016
elections and then we looked into their
valuable memes from their troll Farm
and they spent a hundred thousand
dollars on some memes that weren't even
all in the same direction some of them
were like pro-hillary some were
pro-chomp
and and then you saw the quality of the
memes that looked like they were made by
high school kids with no persuasive
anything
so we know we know Russia can't do memes
they can't influence an election even if
they tried
they can't do cyber attacks too well
and their military is kind of lame
so maybe we're wrong about everything
you ever think about it maybe just
everything's wrong and we're no closer
to nuclear war
yeah now in my opinion we're not closer
to nuclear war not even a little bit
because nobody wants it the minimum
requirement for a nuclear war is that
somebody wants it
and we have exactly zero people
who want it or are crazy nobody nobody
and as the Wall Street Journal in an
opinion piece said today
I think that's what it was
um Putin does have an escape he has an
Escape Route if he had no Escape Route
that'd be different but he actually can
just say oh we got what we wanted we
kept Crimea and we you know maybe kept
them from entering NATO or something so
he could he could definitely negotiate
from this point and get something he
didn't mind keeping
as long as NATO stayed out of Ukraine
so yeah you could just you could just
negotiate anytime he wants now there's
one theory that I'm not going to endorse
but the idea is that Russia would run
out of uh Fighters before Ukraine
now the argument goes that even though
Russia has more people and would be
willing to throw more fodder at it
forever that the ukrainians are never
going to quit because it's their
Homeland so no matter how few there are
left and no matter how irregular the
Army and no matter if they have to turn
it into a guerrilla War
the ukrainians will keep fighting
I don't know I'm not sure that's true
but that's a that's a current opinion of
somebody
uh Sarah is yelling in all caps again
something that didn't happen lol Scott
thinks Ukraine is winning really sort of
the opposite of what I just said Sarah
you can't tell what's happening over
there
so Sarah you need medical help I'm going
to hide you on this channel so that
you'll be yelling at yourself from now
on
but that's just a cry for help I think
you need some medical attention here
all right
so cyber war is hard
um
let me ask you if any of you are having
this problem
do you find that it's harder and harder
to interact with people who still
believe the news is real
have you had that problem
every time I talk to somebody who says
something they heard it on the news and
I think
really
you still don't know the news is made up
because I think people think that people
still think that it's only the news from
the other side that's made up
no
no it's all of it all the news about
public figures and politics is made up
let me say as clearly as possible all of
the news all of the news about public
figures and politics is made up and what
I mean by made up is usually in the
early stages the facts are wrong
you know the source wasn't real the
thing they the thing somebody quoted
didn't really happen right so in the
beginning stories are just wrong on the
facts but they're always wrong in the
context
they're always wrong in the context
always
there's not a single story I've never
met anybody involved with the story
who is willing to say yeah that's they
got that story right never it's not even
a thing and when I meet people who think
that the news is still sometimes correct
I don't know what to do with it anymore
because I used to argue well if you'd
read this Source or check this Source
but I know that doesn't make any
difference
so here's what I've
decided on and it seems to disarm people
I show empathy for them being
victimized by the news
I just say I'm sorry the news did this
to you
and I'm never going to have a
conversation with somebody who thinks
the news is telling them anything useful
that would be the biggest waste of time
you should start your conversation with
this do you believe the news is real
if they say yes or they say well if you
do your own research or you watch your
own things just walk away
as long as somebody thinks that the news
on one side is real and the other side
is not real
you can have a conversation with that
person they the minimum requirement for
an honest conversation is both sides
both sides of the news are presenting
narrative
which is not real it's just a narrative
yeah I treat them as somebody who's been
victimized by the Press
yeah as Mark Twain said if you don't
read the newspaper you're uninformed if
you do read it you're misinformed
exactly I hate when I just recreate what
uh Mark Twain figured out 100 years ago
Democrats voted against the parents
right bill yeah
all right uh reframed and reframe
Vivek is Dave Chappelle showing up
unannounced
that's funny
have I ever gotten the Mark Twain award
no that's for a much higher profile
people
I'm not high enough profile to win an
award like that
Oscar Wilde says the real news is in a
year old paper yeah one to five years is
how long it takes the news
come out
Mexican cartels I'm not sure that the
tick tock CA CEO brought Mexican cartels
with them
have you ever won a Pulitzer no I don't
want to Pulitzer my God
the Pulitzer is a completely discredited
award
how many pulitzers did the did the New
York Times get for the fake news about
Russia collusion now no Pulitzer is is a
sign that you're uh
a political operative at this point
unless it's non-fiction unless it's
fiction
no I I would not want to Pulitzer there
was a time when I wanted one because I
thought that would be a good War to have
in my line of work but at the moment I
would just be embarrassed if I had one
it would just be kind of embarrassing
um
Liberty says we could not match Russia
in a continental War are you Russian
you sound like a Russian agent because I
don't think anybody believes what you
just said
you don't think you the Russian forces
apparently would last about 25 minutes
if they attacked the United States
unless they use nukes I don't even know
if their nukes work
if I ever saw a man who wanted a
Pulitzer and Scott Adams says a mind
reader
if I don't win it's not worth winning
the Mind readers are out
I'm getting mind read quite a bit
if I can't win
no you don't win unless you apply did
you know that you can't win a Pulitzer
unless you submit for it
if I were trying to win I would be
submitting
but you don't see me doing that I do not
submit my work for the Pulitzer
um
oh you're joking okay
you're forgetting their allies no I'm
not
all right
yeah I wanted I wanted Pulitzer until I
found out how they were awarded but more
they're awarded just you know the small
group of people it's just their opinion
so it doesn't have any any real weight
if five people decide that you should
get a Pulitzer who are those five people
oh I won the prestigious random five
people award
what's that
five randomly chosen uh judges for your
category
and they changed the judges around you
know every year I think
uh
oh Trump gave out fake news Awards
daily wire is increasingly sneaky
anti-trump Scott is not sneaky
okay
oh
um
I realized that uh
I should have turned my iPad upside down
so there's a step that remember I told
you that every step you add to the
process increases the rate the chances
of failure by like 25 percent
any any little change increases your
risk of getting wrong and one of the
things I had to add was I have to flip
the iPad over right before I go live
and
when locals didn't work
and I had to redo it and re-up the app
and stuff I lost that part of the
process so
the camera is up here
where is it supposed to be down in this
corner down here
and then I would be looking here to see
both of the cameras in the same place
um
Garden flag yet I don't know what that
is
Mark Twain never won the Mark Twain
award
that's funny
um
could you inform your audience about
Biden's bringing Tick Tock back at least
tell me I'm wrong
uh well I don't know what you're talking
about
because nobody brought Tick Tock back
it's always been here
do you have a clear view when Scott is
looking at which stream can can you tell
that I'm looking at the locals comments
right now
so this is what my eyes look like when
I'm looking at the locals comments
this is my eyes when I'm looking at the
YouTube comments
all right that's all I got for today and
YouTube I'm gonna say see you later
thanks for joining
I'll talk to you tomorrow
