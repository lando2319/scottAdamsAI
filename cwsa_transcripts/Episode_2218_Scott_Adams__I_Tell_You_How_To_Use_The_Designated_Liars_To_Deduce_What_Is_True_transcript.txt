good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams now
streaming to you live all over the world
through YouTube and through X live on X
at the moment and of course my beloved
locals community
uh who get to see the good stuff oh you
wouldn't believe what they heard before
you came on Wow but if you'd like to
take this experience up to levels that
nobody dreamed were possible including
two white board presentations too too
wait for that all you need is a couple
of micro glass a tanker chalices
and fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine end
of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous except it happens now go
ah so good so good today's episode is
brought to you by the best book in the
world it's called reframe your brain and
it might actually be the best book in
the world I say that because people say
come on come on no I don't mean
religious books religious books are
their own category
but if you want a book that will almost
certainly change your life in some
positive way probably a number of ways
apparently people are having their lives
changed even now it's available even
though Amazon is making it as hard as
possible let me ask you this
of all the books on Amazon you can
imagine there are tens of millions of
books how many of those books
if you went to the page and then tried
to click on it to buy it how many of
those would Amazon not let you buy
I don't know if there are any others but
mine's pretty hard to get so the the the
hardcover got listed
but it got listed as not yet available
but if you go to the hardcover page it
doesn't show the soft cover option
so if you thought you were buying a book
and you're like oh hardcover is there
you'd see it's not available
and that you wouldn't see that you could
buy the soft cover that's been available
for a couple weeks now
we live in a zero trust environment
under normal conditions I would say to
myself this is probably a little
technical problem we'll get that worked
out
but how many times have I told you
there's a technical problem
not the first one
so in a zero trusted environment I'm
going to assume guilt until a proven
innocent not that it's true
but I wouldn't assume it's an accident
at this point so if you can buy that
book if you can find a way to actually
purchase it
you'll be out of the game
all right here's some updates
um yet another trial
of using mushrooms for depression
it turns out that the magic mushrooms
made a huge difference so basically
every time they study it I think
correct me if I'm wrong but a hundred
percent of The Times They study
depression and mushrooms
there's a big Improvement
and there's something really big big big
that's coming down the pike
and I don't know what it's going to do
remember I you know I I always remind
you that I told you that when Trump Rose
in 2015 2016 I told you it was going to
change more than politics it would
change the way you saw reality itself
well if you thought that was a change
wait till you try mushrooms for your
depression
talk talk about a change in reality
so toward the end of uh today's show
I'm gonna blow your minds
like your your brain is just going to
come off
so and almost certainly almost certainly
you're gonna say what
so wait for that that's the Whiteboard
presentation
all right
um I I saw a article that apparently a
lot of employees are pretending they
have ai knowledge because their boss
doesn't know one way or the other so
that they can they can feel like they're
the the valuable employees and I thought
to myself
well there's there's a whole week of
Dilbert reborn comics
which are available by subscription only
on Twitter and on the locals platform
local scottadams.locals.com
but
um did you see that coming
you you knew the people were going to
pretend that they knew AI without
knowing AI you knew that was gonna
happen
that's a Wally thing well unemployment
is inching up from 3.5 to 3.8 let's
pretend we can measure that
yeah let's pretend that we can measure
it in a meaningful and Accurate Way such
that the change between 3.5 and 3.8 is
Meaningful
probably not
probably not so but if the numbers that
are official make it look like inflation
is inching up which is hard to imagine
why would it be going up
just uh too much money supply I don't
know seems like you should be going down
but uh that would be I would guess one
of the most important uh predictors of
the next election
should it be a fair and free election
I would say I would think inflation is
the biggest number that would change
people's vote what do you say
if everything else were the same and
inflation looked like it was inching up
on Election Day
I think that's game over
at least in terms of the public the
Voting is a separate question
all right here's my opinion on Mitch
McConnell and you all know he's he's had
health problems and he's been freezing
up uh actually he just goes blank like
you can't talk in public it's happened a
few times we all feel bad for him
don't want to you know I don't want to
mock somebody for age or infirmity so
I'm going to mock other people instead
I think you can ignore everything
Republicans say
on any topic
as long as they let that guy keep keep
his job
now you can say to me but but but the
other Republicans can't you know they
have no say over whether he retires sure
they do of course they do yeah if they
all said you got to retire you'd retire
because it would just be too
embarrassing not to they could just not
take his calls you know just ignore his
office they could treat him like he's
not there they could get him out in a
day
and
I'm sure they have their reasons
but if you're not going to tell me the
reasons I'm not going to listen to you
about anything
right you have no credibility if the
leader of your party is incapacitated
and you're just letting it happen
right why because Biden is also
incapacitated so that's okay
or you know Schumer's close to it now
consumer's doing fine but
yeah how can you make fun of the fact
that Democrats keep Federman you can't
how can you make fun of Biden's
declining cognitive ability you can't
not if you're trying to be a serious
person so if you want to be a serious
person they all have to go
you know Feinstein's got to go but
McConnell's got to go at the same time
so Republicans
could you pull it together just a little
bit
I mean this is just free money sitting
on the table I realize it's awkward it's
uncomfortable it's not the thing you
want to be known for
but you got to do it
you gotta do it there's nobody in the
world who thinks this is right nobody
zero people think this is okay and you
can't do this the simplest thing
you could ever do in your life you can't
do this
just just help a guy out help him retire
with a little bit of dignity Maybe
crazy yeah just ignore everything
Republicans say from now on if you if
you can't get that right all right
here is a service under thinking
seriously of doing
you've seen me give my description of
how to know if the news is credible for
example I won't go through the whole
thing but I did a whole list of you know
what is a credible Story versus a
non-credible story and one of them just
to give you an example is if the only
source is a anonymous source
and it's only being reported by the part
of the media that hates the person who's
being marked on that's never true this
is never true right and then you could
rate the other things for how often
they're true and then you'd have a good
little guide
to look at the news but there's another
thing I want to add and I'm just
starting to build the list it would be
the list of what I call the designated
Liars
now this is a little tricky because
there's some Nuance to it if you miss
the Nuance then the beauty the beauty of
the idea disappears right so I'm not
talking about people who lie
right in a moment you're going to
suggest people who are simple Liars
that's not what this is about
we're not talking about simply lying
because that would be a lot of
politicians
I'm talking about designated Liars right
if you miss the designated part that
would be like missing the difference
between climate change as a hoax versus
the climate agenda is Oaks right if you
miss that designated word
which you will not all of you but
somebody on YouTube on YouTube is going
to say but other people lie you know
they're going to do that
whoever does that is an NPC
right so it's not about liars
it's not about liars it's about
designated liars and what I mean by that
is there's a there's a group of
Democrats now you could you could make
an argument that happens on the right
we'll talk about that as well but on the
left if you see any of these people
be the chief character of in a story now
the chief character would be somebody
who wrote the big article that
everybody's talking about or or somebody
who's always on the news talking about
it if you see Phil bump of the
Washington Post
making a claim that other people are
saying hmm I'm not so sure that's true
Phil bump is an absolute signal that
it's a fake story
is almost synonymous with fake news
now
he would deny that of course and he
denied it quite a bit because he's under
Fire in the news and so
um Jonathan Turley and Miranda Devine is
it diviner Devine Divine Miranda Divine
or Devine
somebody somebody fact checked me I'll
say it correctly when you do Vine Divine
okay it's divine so Miranda Divine has
an article and basically it's just
mocking Phil bump for being a ridiculous
character
uh now
in terms of full disclosure Phil bump
does work for the Washington Post which
in the Dilbert reborn comic is where
ratbert works as a as a writer a rapper
I guess I should tell you
here his current Incarnation as a writer
for the Washington poop so in the
Dilbert reborn comic that you can only
see by subscription uh it's the
Washington Pope and rapper basically
plays Phil bump
now I don't use the name but in your
mind if you see it just just tell
yourself it's Phil bump and it's funnier
all right so Phil bump is one of my
mascots so full disclosure he is one of
the people who comes after me in public
and uh was quite he was dancing on My
Grave when I got canceled primarily by
his newspaper which started the rest of
the newspapers so when the Washington
Post canceled me that allowed everybody
else to do at the same time
so uh just know that I'm not objective
but Phil bumps a good signal for fake
news the other ones you know Adam Schiff
Eric swalwell Jamie Raskin Jerry Nadler
Dan Goldman uh Blumenthal
Brandon Clapper
now they're the ones that I call the
designated Liars here are the names that
are not on the list
uh Corinne Jean-Pierre
do you understand why she's not on the
list
because she's not a signal of fake news
she's somebody who lies and Spins
everything all the time but she'll spin
a positive a thing that's real
she'll spend a thing that's not real you
can't really tell
so she's not a signal because she's just
out there spinning all the time the
other people that are not a signal would
be leadership so Schumer Biden Pelosi
and Harris because they're going to talk
about everything all the time because
they're in leadership right so if you
see them saying something that's true or
not true it's not really a signal
they're just talking about everything
all the time same as John John
Pierre whatever
cringe on Pierre so I don't consider
them designated Liars they would just be
ordinary politicians who don't always
tell the truth and spit a lot now the
Republicans have a lot of those
Republicans have people who are wrong
you know they believe things that are
not true
they have people who are under-informed
let's say uh not Banning Tick Tock for
example might not understand it so they
might have a bad opinion there there are
people who maybe just have different
philosophies there there are people who
maybe they know they're bending or
spending or something and probably
there's some people who just know
they're lying
on the Republican side
but here's what's different
there is not an identifiable Squad of
liars
on the right that I'm aware of if I'm
missing it because I have some bias
somebody should suggest it to me
now if you say to me but Scott
here's somebody who lied again it's not
about lying
they're all going to be lying sooner or
later except for Thomas Massey I have to
throw Thomas Massey in there every time
I call Congress Liars because he's so
obviously not one
that it just I just feel shitty when I
don't yeah Rand Paul's not a liar there
are others too right there are others
that I do trust or not lie uh
but Republicans have a different set of
credibility problems
I don't think they have designated Liars
but if they do
well so somebody's saying what about
Crenshaw on
um on Ukraine
that doesn't seem to me like a
designated liar that seems like somebody
who has an opinion you don't have
because Crenshaw is not identifiable
with the guy you stick forward to say
the things that are never true
he's just somebody who disagrees with
you deeply on a big issue
and I probably disagree with him as well
but that doesn't make him a liar and it
certainly doesn't make him a designated
liar
Adam kinzinger there's something going
on with Adam kinsinger that has more to
do with the Ukraine war
I I don't see Adam kinsiger as sort of
the designated liar I think he's
honestly it looks like he has some
mental difficulties is how it projects
now I don't know that I'm not a doctor
but when I see Adam kinsiger I don't see
Mental Health
he doesn't he doesn't display mental
health in the way that I normally would
you recognize it
so if you're if you're displaying
something that looks like maybe there's
something you're working on on your own
that's just its own category
all right
um
so would that be helpful if you tell me
tell me the truth
if you could for a moment be unbiased
I know it's impossible would this be
useful if you were teaching somebody how
to look at the news would it be useful
to have a list of these 10 people or
designated Liars you know they're alive
that's the only reason they're on TV
it would be useful right
yeah
all right
um
here's some fake science
all right here's the thing I believe I'm
I believe I'm going to explain this to
you correctly
but if later you say to me Scott you've
got that story completely wrong well
I'll change it I'll change my mind
but I gotta tell you what I think I know
all right
so
you know what a placebo is right you're
all smart educated people
you know that a placebo is a fake pill
that if you have a pill that you think
will be real and will solve some problem
then you give somebody the fake pill and
you see how they do you compare it to
the the real drug
now if the real drug improves people's
condition more than the
um more than the placebo
that you're likely to get improved you
know if there are no side effects
or if there are minimum minimal side
effects now this largely proves wouldn't
you say because whenever they do this
study you always get this effect
the the people who take the fake pill
very predictably not 100 of the time but
predictably they'll have
they'll have you know a substantial kind
of a benefit
so would you agree
that the placebo effect is one of the
most studied and guaranteed to be real
effects you've ever seen in science
how many would say that that's
guaranteed to be real because nothing I
don't think anything's been studied this
much
has anything ever been studied as much
as this because every time they do a
study
this shows up
like you don't even have to be looking
for and it's everywhere I mean the
placebo effect is just everywhere so
it's real
in the comments
can you at least acknowledge that the
placebo effect is real so that I can go
on to my next point it's real right
everybody knows it's totally real yeah
totally real all right
um
Maybe not maybe not
do you know if they don't study
because they don't have to
what they don't study is somebody who
took no pill at all
do you know what would happen if they
did
suppose every suppose every test was
Placebo in one group a real drug in
another group and then the thing that
they don't study but what if they did
no pill at all and you don't even know
you're in the study so they'd have to
even not even know they're in the study
what do you think that would be
just take a guess
what do you think the don't do anything
and you're not even in this study would
look like
foreign
that's right the people who did
absolutely nothing
they improve about the same as the
placebo
do you know what that means
it means everything you've ever heard
about the placebo was
it's always been
it was easy to prove
easy to prove
and for your entire life the people that
you trust the scientists
told you they did some science
and then they told you they used their
statistical genius
to prove that the thing called the
placebo effect is a real thing
now I'm seeing somebody say this is
incorrect
so I'm open to correction
because I'm not I'm not completely sure
this is true
I'll tell you that you know it's just
something I ran across on the internet
recently but as soon as I saw it I
thought to myself
well I'm pretty sure they don't study
the person who wasn't in the study
I'm pretty sure that's not a normal
thing and and I do know
that in the normal course of things
most people improve if you do nothing
or at least they say they improved maybe
they just got used to it so they said
they improved who knows some of them
might be some of that
but
I don't know I'm open for fact checking
I'm open for fact checking but remember
we live in a zero trust environment
where science
is mostly
mostly
the vast majority of the things you call
science
are
and apparently you always have been
from the you know the so-called
nutrition you know the the nutrition
triangle that was from day one
it was never even attempted to be true
but if but if the placebo effect
isn't real
what can you believe
wanna see another one do you think I
could do this again
let's see
foreign
[Music]
you probably know that uh RFK Jr
says that solar might be a good Green
Technology but it's not economical
if you include all of the other costs
you know because everything has you know
closed down costs and maybe social costs
and then there's how long it takes to
get approval and all that stuff
now also with the solar power
people will say hey you forgot to
include the recycling costs
you know blah blah blah blah
right
so let me ask you the question you you
all watch the news
you know this is the most informed group
I've ever seen literally it's the most
informed group of news Watchers so you
all watch the news and you know you all
know that climate change no matter what
you think of the reality of it you would
agree it's
maybe the biggest issue outside of
Ukraine I guess
maybe the biggest issue right
so
but at least you're recycling your
plastic right
all right is everybody recycling their
plastic at least trying to help
as Michael sheldenberger informed you
recently do you know that the plastic
recycling has never been real
it's never been real
they don't recycle the plastic that you
separate they throw it in the garbage
and they ship it to Asia and it ends up
in the ocean and your water supply
and always has
and always has
recycling isn't real
plastic I think I think maybe metal cans
is real
uh maybe cardboard is real I don't know
but plastic recycling
has never been real
how many of you knew that
how many how many of you knew the
plastic recycling was never real
a lot of you did
how many Democrats do you think know
that
not so many not so many
all right
so what is the answer you all watch the
news so the most important question I
would say see if you agree with me the
most important question about climate
change
in terms of what we're going to do about
it because even if you think there's no
risk
you you'd need more energy right so the
people who don't believe in climate
change as a as a risk the ones who do
believe it you all need more energy so
the biggest question is which one's more
economical
so tell me which one's more economical
solar
or nuclear and I'm going to tell you the
real answer after you tell me your
answers there's a there's an absolute
real answer
I can give you complete certainty on
this question
a lot of people say nuclear
a lot of people say nuclear
all right
both that's an interesting answer
both make sense from a you need all the
energy you can get perspective but one
of them is going to be better
all right do you want the absolute
guaranteed correct answer
nobody knows
are you kidding me
you think somebody knows the answer to
this question
no this is completely unknowable now
here we happen to be in my my domain of
expertise
you know I know it doesn't seem like it
but I do have many years of corporate
experience trying to analyze what costs
more both initially and also in the long
run because it's not your initial cost
it's you know you have to you have to
put in decommissioning and everything
else there so
I can guarantee you
that the level of complexity involved in
nuclear as well as solar
guarantees that nobody knows the answer
it's a guarantee
here's what else they don't know
what will be the economics if let's say
you got a capable president
let's say you have a fake ramaswamy
and he said hey this nuclear stuff would
be good if you could make it easier to
build and easier to get approved
so at the moment it's nearly impossible
to get a nuclear power plan built
because of all the environmentalists and
blah blah blah
but could you imagine
there's somebody who is smart and a
president could say Hey you states don't
get a vote
because this is this is too close to the
homeland security you can't really have
a country
there's a National Defense unless you're
also a strong economy so you need your
Basics your energy production that's the
most basic thing you got to get your
energy production and then maybe
Transportation would be next uh but if
you don't get your energy production
right you might as well disband your
army
your Army's useless
if you don't have energy and you don't
have a good economy to equip them right
so somebody like Vivek could make the
argument that that nuclear energy is not
just a choice of which energy to use
but it's a requirement for the
sustainability of the United States
defensively and in every other way that
we have a robust
efficient nuclear energy
um game
now could the federal government just
say hey environmentalists uh go away
and hey Democrats it doesn't matter what
you want because it's National Security
so I'm going to get rid of all the the
little state and local ordinances and
I'm going to say there's just one set of
federal approvals and if you and they
won't be that hard you know they'll be
they'll be optimized so you can get your
approval and I'm just going to say you
States you just don't get a vote in this
because you're driving the country into
ruin and that's a that's a defense
problem
so could that happen
I don't know
but you don't either
that's my point my point is if you don't
know
could save do that or could Trump do
that he didn't do it the first time so I
suspect he can't
uh but I think Vivek could do it because
do you know do you know what it would
take
to remove all of those regulations the
minimum it would take for a president to
do that
they would have to understand the topic
how many people have ever run for that
office a president
do you think you could introduce to the
topic of nuclear regulation
and have them like do a deep dive
and then come out with a usable opinion
a usable opinion of which things could
be tweaked and modified and who's lying
to them about what you can't change
we've only had one candidate who was
capable well Jimmy Carter I guess but uh
yeah Jimmy Carter right but at the
moment we have one candidate I think has
that capability
and I happen to think we have some smart
candidates right RFK Jr super smart
uh Trump I believe is super smart in his
you know within his domain
uh
well you haven't seen a fake before
Vivek is the one person who's running
for president in the longest time who
you could say can you look at this mess
and and try to untangle this you know
you don't have to be the biggest expert
in each part of it but at least you
could understand the landscape I don't
think anybody else can even see the
landscape it's just way too complicated
if you don't know the political part you
also don't know the base economics if
you don't know that we could approve for
example you can approve modular designs
and then let people build as many as
they want so long as it's the same
design
so there's a whole bunch of things you
could do to lower the price or cost of
nuclear you can store the uh the waste
on site which is now a normal way to do
it so you don't have the transportation
you don't need a different facility you
just keep it on site put it a little
Barrel every once in a while
uh so that the economics of waste is is
pretty low at this point
the the risk of a meltdown which is what
causes you to be uninsurable
if we build the newer models they've
never had a meltdown
if we did a generation three or were
getting close to generation four those
have never had a meltdown Generation 4
can't have one it's built so the design
itself is a failure causes it to just
stop
The Current Designs including three you
have to keep the energy going if the
energy is lost you could get a meltdown
so you don't build something like
Fukushima where you put your backup
generators below the the ocean line it
was below sea level
they actually put their backup
generators
below sea level
in a tsunami Zone
now is that a problem with nuclear power
would you say and therefore nuclear
power is dangerous
I mean that's a pretty big leap how
about we just don't put our backup
generators underwater
that would be like a start
but you know that's not the only problem
there uh if he gets a generation four
you don't need the power at all it just
stops working when the election the
other electricity goes off
yeah it's a dumb design
Snoopy boobs says wow Scott's a nuclear
scientist which part of this uh did I
need to be a nuclear scientist for
was there something I forgot I said that
was sort of sciencey
yeah
all right
um Jamie Raskin you recognize him from
the people who signal fake news uh he
wants to investigate Jared kushner's
Saudi Investments
now that's a really good play
from the Democrats in a political sense
is good and here's why it's good the
general public can't tell the difference
between a publicly announced investment
in an investment fund that is publicly
investing in things with well-known
public management
compared to literally a money-washing
slash bribery influence scheme with lots
of shell corporations run by Hunter
Biden
the public isn't going to know the
difference to them it's going to look
like two sketchy things
is it Financial
yes
okay so there's money involved and it's
like a politician
yes but is it a politician who ran for
office no Jared didn't run for office
and neither did Hunter oh so it's
similar you're saying oh so if Jared is
innocent
well therefore logically
Hunter did nothing wrong
so it's a brilliant play because the
most of the public doesn't know any
anything that's going on with either
story
but if you tune into your casual viewer
and somebody says sure they're going
after Hunter but look what Jared did
you're a casual casual consumer of the
news that sounds like a pretty good
point doesn't it oh they're both doing
it okay I guess I can forget about that
as a topic because everybody does it
everybody's doing it no not everybody is
setting up is shell corporations and
lying about it
Jared Jared did a did an announcement he
did a press release
if you do a press release about what
you're doing
and you know the Investments presumably
will be known at some point because
they're going to be big ones
I don't know uh if you say you're not
comfortable with Jared
uh let's say capitalizing on his
connections he made during office I get
that
but what is better than doing it
transparently
and are we better off or worse off if
Saudi Arabia and Jared Kushner have a
close relationship
are we better off or worse off
he was the architect of the Abraham
Accords
we're a hundred percent better off
it's not even close
you want you want the Saudis
to have a good working relationship with
some prominent Americans
so that we work better with them there's
a reason that Saudi
you know has played well with the Trump
Administration and now Jared because
they played well with them that's how it
works
and we'll need them in the future so
so I don't mind that we have connections
with them as long as it's all public
um did I talk about this uh Vivek
dismantling uh Harvey Levin on TMZ and
his co-host whose name I can't remember
Charles Charles
now I'm not going to replay it for you
or describe it I'll just tell you how he
did it
here here's how most Republicans have
argued about climate change and what
happens right here here's most
Republicans
climate change isn't even real
well are you denying all of science
because you're an idiot well yesterday
it was cold
okay you know that temperature and
climate are really not the same and
anecdotally that doesn't really approve
anything
it snowed yesterday okay well I don't
even feel like we're talking about the
same thing it's cold
and then and then the Democrats declare
that the Republican whoever it is is a
big old dope who doesn't believe in
science right that's the way it goes
every time now enter Vivek
it took him about one minute to
demonstrate that everything those two
new Harvey and Charles knew about
climate change was way less than Vivek
new
okay that's that that was that was his
starting point you know he very clearly
told them that he was better he was more
well-read and understood the topic at a
more detailed level
next thing he did right
is he debunked their you know climate
hoax thing and said no the agenda
that what we're doing about it part is
the hoax in other words we're not doing
the right stuff I'm not I'm not arguing
whether CO2 is a greenhouse gas
I am instead arguing that you have not
included all of the costs and the
benefits of your analysis
and that's when he was done right that
that's you know when he started to tell
them you've simply not included enough
in your analysis
you know you have to look at the number
of people dying
you have to look at how well we
remediate you have to look at how many
people die from cold which is way more
than the ones to die from warmth and you
know once you've included all of those
things uh your your best analysis for
keeping people alive would be to go hard
with fossil fuels today because that's
what keeps people alive today
but also work hard to get your nuclear
and your you know all forms of energy up
so that you can transition because you
don't want to pollute
now if invac Vivek doesn't want to
pollute
so you don't have to ask him this
question because it's obvious would you
rather have a new Nuclear Power Plant
or or bore coal
you don't have to ask them that
of course he wants a nuclear power plant
he says it directly right so once Vivek
showed that the difference between their
analyzes was that he had included
the value of human life
in his
I'm not making this up
Vivek showed that he was including the
value of human life literally keeping
people alive and that you know as bad as
the pollution is from fossil fuels it is
how you keep them alive
and it's not even close if you take
people's energy away things don't work
out at all
so
the the funny thing about it if you get
a chance to look at it you can just
Google it look for Vivek and TMZ it'll
pop right up uh you have to watch the
the reactions the physical reactions of
The Two Hosts Harvey and Charles and
they start getting animated
and they're they're triggered into
cognitive distance
because I'll tell you what nobody
expects to lose if you're Harvey and
Charles these are you know well-informed
uh public hosts yeah these are high
functioning people who pay attention to
the news it's their business right so
when when they get into a conversation
about climate change
they expect to be on top of the mountain
and just pissing on the ants that are
running below because that's how it's
supposed to work because the only people
they've ever talked to who disagreed
with them were idiots
if I'm being honest they've only talked
to idiots
because the idiot of you is oh it snowed
today
so no climate change
you're not going to win with that
came in and said you know what are you
count keeping people alive
you know how about that is your best
metric keeping people alive
and that just shut them down that it
just made them look like idiots
because what was their argument for well
I guess I would rather kill 10 times as
many people but you know I really like
solar
there's nothing there once you've made
the case that more people will clearly
die with the current set of policies
then all they have to do is they don't
even know how to respond to that so they
were both in deep cognitive dissonance
and it was a wonderful so if you'd like
to see what cognitive dissonance looks
like
that's a real good example you have to
watch them flip out they start just
spewing things and trying to talk over
each other and they fell apart
so it was wonderful
all right uh I saw this joke from
wokosaurus rex on on X he says uh
he says new game all you have to do is
add add the quote I've never seen
anything like it to any statement about
anything to prove your point and how bad
climate change is affecting the world
you don't need any evidence the phrase
itself so for he gives an example it
rained today
I've never seen anything like it
and I laughed for 10 minutes because
that's exactly what the news coverage is
it's like the wind
was very strong
we've never seen anything like it
uh the the five Late Late Show hosts
minus the good one Greg gotfeld if you
saw the podcast with the the five of
them
they're like uh raining so hard I've
never seen anything like it anyway to me
that was funny uh RFK Jr has these stats
which if these are true
I don't know what to say about how Biden
could even be
polling anywhere near equal but this is
what RFK JR says about his own party
right President Biden Justified his open
border policy so even or if ajudu calls
it an open border
like remember he's a Democrat
and he's just he was there he did a he
did a little documentary it's an open
border it's because it's an open border
let me say it again do you know why RFK
Jr calls it an open border
because he's not a liar that's
why right he's not a liar so he couldn't
not call it that because that's
obviously what it is so all credit to
him for you know bringing some truth to
the topic but look at these numbers
uh
uh he says the Trump era border patrol
had 2600 quote children in cages as as
they like to say where his critics like
to say and RFK JR says today there are
12 000 children in cages plus and here's
the part that I can't even process
85 000 children have disappeared
now disappeared means we just don't know
where they went it doesn't mean that
something bad happened to them
necessarily
but out of 85 000 missing children which
a lot of them I assume were
unaccompanied minors
and we're probably trafficked
intentionally
I don't know what percentage of the 85
000
were being trafficked and abused but
it's not zero
I don't know what it is but it's going
to be some shocking percentage
and would is it fair to say that that
makes Biden the biggest uh child
trafficker in the world
because it's entirely his decision
whether this happens or not
he's the only one who decides whether
this is going to happen nobody else just
one guy
and that one guy apparently is
responsible for 12 000 children in cages
and 85 000 missing of which
what would be what would be a small
guess twenty thousand of them are
sexually abused
and still are like at this minute but
what's your guess
it's probably something in that range
this is the deepest level of evil that
I've seen in America
since slavery or Jim Crow or something
right I mean this is sort of Epic evil
this this is evil on a scale that
honestly I had no idea
I had no idea it was that big I knew I
knew it was hard to track people once
they got in but 85 000 kids that we
don't have a good idea even where they
are
that is uh not good dab action
right you need a dad
you're going to need somebody in that
office
who cares about children now the good
news is a number of candidates fit that
fit that description
but wow
all right
um
Vivek who makes news so well Vivek is
the best earned media guy of all time
Trump got tons of earned media but often
they were just you know criticizing him
so his earned media was working against
him as much as it was for him vivekes is
you know is more of a 60 40. like it's
overwhelmingly positive but of course
critics will try to turn it into
something it isn't but here's something
you said today another perfect thing to
highlight he says under General CQ
Brown's leadership the Air Force is
trying to reduce white male pilots from
86 percent of Flyers down to 43 percent
amidst a major recruiting crisis
so there's a recruiting crisis
can't get enough people
but they're going to make it much much
harder to get good people by
discriminating against I assume straight
white males I assume if you're a gay and
a white male maybe you're still good
but if you're a straight straight white
male they're going to tell you
pretty much we're looking for somebody
else
now
why would a straight white male join the
military
if you were a straight straight white
male and one of one of your options was
to join the military I wouldn't advise
against it
now I typically would not advise against
joining the military even though it's
clearly a risky proposition by its
nature and I don't I don't usually
advise people to take risky actions
but at least there's a payoff
right at least you get benefits and you
you learn a skill maybe there's a lot to
gain
so you know it's a personal decision
but at this point I think I will weigh
in and say if you're a straight white
male the military just said you're not
going to do well
so you should probably look for a
different plan
so I can't recommend the US military to
a strike white male under the current
conditions
this was about the Air Force but you
assume it's the same everywhere
all right
um so Vivek did a video in which he's
debunking
a number of hoaxes against them one of
the hoaxes was that he made a lot of
money on he failed Alzheimer's drug how
many of you think that's true
that he made a lot of money on a failed
Alzheimer's drug
because that's one of the main claims
about it no it's not true
he did have it failed Alzheimer's drugs
as he points out over 99 of all
Alzheimer drug attempts failed
he was one of them and it was in a
subsidiary of his company and they never
sold any stock in the subsidiary
so the stock you know was worth a
zillion dollars and then it was worth
zero but he wrote it all the way he
wrote it to the top he wrote it at the
bottom which
was the ethical thing to do
because there was a point where I could
have sold the stock at the top before he
knew if the drug worked
he could have done that
decided not to decided to let his
investment follow the actual result of
the trial the trial said it didn't work
and then that was the end of it
right
so that that's his version let me say
that the only thing I know for sure is
that that was his his explanation I
wasn't there but it sounded right to me
there's a study out of the CU Boulder
that says that offices don't really
attract
so aren't you aren't you glad you
studied that
you know I've been wondering why lizzo
wasn't returning my calls
but science has now answered this
apparently offices don't attract
so
no call coming for me
was there anybody who needed science to
tell them
that people like to have something in
common you know the important stuff in
common with their mates you know they
like to have the same religion
usually they like to have same at least
political leaning
they like to be somewhere in the same
age usually less one of them is rich
and uh
yeah I I feel like they didn't need to
study this so much huh do you think they
wasted a little money studying this
feels like it feels like it yeah
well let's talk about
Ukraine and I'm going to talk about the
double slit experiment
if you haven't had enough science
all right uh Ukraine allegedly don't
believe anything coming out of Ukraine
don't believe anything coming out of
Ukraine this is just the story
we're told
that Ukraine has made a you know small
puncture in the Russian lines
but I have to admit uh I was trying to
visualize what difference that makes
because it seems to me if you punch
through a line
then you're right in the middle of the
strongest part of the Russian military
which is their side of the line
so it feels like it could be a trap you
know bring in the all the good assets oh
we finally got through put our best
assets through the hole and then you
know they get destroyed so I was trying
to sort of visualize
you know how how that works
but um then I saw an explanation that I
liked a lot which is that the Russian
forces this is according to
Dave demaro a retired US Army
non-commissioned officer who was a front
line Military Intelligence person during
the Cold War and in Iraq so he knows
what he's talking about and he says that
the Russians don't know how to fight in
all directions in other words you've got
a lot of let's say artillery batteries
that are designed to shoot bullets
they're not bullets you know shoot
artillery in One Direction
now obviously they could turn it around
but it's not meant for up close fighting
right so if you can get a small you know
heavy machine gun kind of truck you can
just pull up behind the artillery
battery and wipe them out because
they're not they're not really designed
for defending from behind
so the idea is that if you get a few you
know a few assets through the line you
can get behind some of their stuff
totally mess up their you know
coordination because they don't know
what's going on because you're shooting
them from both sides and uh and then
there's chaos and then somehow you can
take advantage of that so that's the
idea so that's not my prediction or
anything just so you wondered how that
works it's the the deal is to get behind
people who are not good at defending you
from behind
so there's more to it but that's one
thing I was not wasn't obvious to me so
I like that explanation
how many of you are aware of the physics
experiment called the double slit
experiment
I'll tell you what it is but how many of
you are familiar with it already a lot
of you right it's a famous experiment in
which uh it gets to the question of
whether light is a particle or a wave
have you ever heard that if you're like
a science nerd you've heard oh sometimes
light is a particle like a photon
and sometimes it's a wave
what the hell does that mean
what's a wave
I never understood that until finally
somebody explained
the wave is just probability
why don't they just say that
a wave and then they say the wave has
collapsed
so the probability is collapsed
into a particle when you measure it
you know what would be another way to
explain that
there was always a photon we just didn't
know where it was
and then when we measured it we knew
where it was and now we know where it is
so there's this whole like big sciencey
experiment that's supposed to tell you
about the nature of reality
and all it is is it's hard to find out
where a photon is it's all it's
like one of the most basic things that
they try to use to explain how
scientists understand the universe but
you don't no they just don't know how to
use words clearly if they use words
clearly they would say well there are
photons
we don't know where they are until we
look but once we look there they are
and they call that collapsing the way
you feel
how about tell me you didn't know where
it was but then when you checked there
it was
now there's a there's an oddity to it
uh about what you whether you're
measuring it or not
so what the double spit the double slit
experiment tries to show but I think
it's all actually is that
there's something about observation
that turns things real
now suppose you don't believe what I
just said
instead you believe the scientists
so the scientists would say that the
things don't become real until they're
looked at
and it was a study that I tweeted today
in May I guess
that or was written up in May of this
year
that there is no preferred reality it's
all subjective
and that the two buoys on one screen is
actually literally what's happening
that is to say my subjective impression
of what's happening is no more or less
true than your subjective oppression and
there isn't any base reality
so science is sort of heading in that
direction so that's two movies on one
screen which I've been telling you
forever that that reality is obviously
subjective in my opinion
so
here's my additive
uh
tying together of two things that
shouldn't be tied together to blow your
mind it's coming
I haven't said it yet
if it's true
that you can collapse reality
by observation and also measurement
if it's true that's what the scientists
say
could it also be true
since observation is sort of a weird
thing it has to do with Consciousness I
guess if your eyes were closed it
wouldn't happen
the scientists would say if you were
standing right in front of it with your
eyes closed you couldn't tell it was
happening
the the particle wouldn't really be
anywhere
but as soon as you open your eyes Boop
it pops immediately into one position
now I'm simplifying because you can't
see a photon but let's say you're using
equipment to look at it
all right so that that's that's what the
actual scientists say is real
so if you were to take their their
beliefs that that's real
I'm going to extend that now to a thing
called affirmations
and positive thinking
affirmations are visualizing what you
want to happen in the future
as if it's a reality
now if
being conscious in the present can
collapse a wave field as they say and
make something real
is it possible
that you can collapse reality
by imagining it really clearly
because if you told me that
Consciousness can collapse reality I
would say well then you're telling me
reality is subjective because if I'm not
there it's not collapsing
or if I'm not measuring it
but
I've I've had this is anecdotal
my personal observation over a lifetime
is that the more clearly I can see a
specific future the more likely it
happens
whether it's good or bad
so I've told you that I have this
ongoing problem with water leaks
you know no matter where I go whatever
house has nothing to do with the quality
of the construction
it's just everywhere I go there are
massive order leaks
yesterday I'm writing a check for my you
know handyman slash Builder kind of guy
who does a lot of work in my house
and he looks up and he goes uh oh
and I'm like
I'm not looking up
and he keeps looking up he's like ah wow
I'm like no don't look up Scott that
that ceiling was just redone just
repainted there is no problem up there
and finally I did look up
and there's this big water bulge
directly above our heads
you know where the paint starts to bulge
down just before it pops and turns into
a shower
yeah now do you think that that was
going to happen on his own or do you
think the fact that every time I walk
through the house I look at the ceiling
and say well where's my next leak
because I expect them to be there
that leak was exactly where I expected
it to be I mean in the kitchen
sure enough there was do you know how
many times I've been in the kitchen that
rained
where actually water was coming from the
ceiling
I don't know the exact number but I
think it's about a dozen
a dozen times different houses
yeah
does that happen to you no but I also
spent a lot of time visualizing it
accidentally because I don't want it to
happen but I think about it all the time
because of the history
so I've got a feeling that one of the
reasons that maybe somebody have
repetitive problems people have
different sets of problems but they have
the same one all the time I've got this
one
but all the time
it just never stops
and by the way I'm not this is not
um
interpreting the past I've been telling
my followers for years that I have this
continuous problem and then when I have
when I report it so they could say it
themselves I take pictures of it it's
real I have continuous water leak
problems
some people don't
so could it be
that literally everything that happens
is some function of our imagination and
if you're not imagining anything
specific
then it's random
it just happens to you but if you
visualize it it happens
yeah
so that's my prostate okay
that's funny it took me a while to
figure that out
all right so my mind breaking
uh
reframe
is that it's possible
that the thing that collapses the wave
and make something real
is how clearly you imagine it
what do you think
no
do you think it's a coincidence that
Elon Musk says and I say it as well that
the most likely outcome is the most
entertaining
that the most entertaining one is the
most likely is a better way to say it
right because though you often think
about the most entertaining outcome
like when you think of the next
presidential election or let's say 2016.
did anybody have any doubt any doubt
whatsoever that the most entertaining
outcome would be Trump winning the
presidency of course
then when when he ran the second time
it wasn't really that entertaining it
was just something that was going to
happen or not happen you had a
preference or not a preference
but it wasn't entertaining in fact it
was the opposite because we were sort of
not being entertained by all the
division
and now time is going by and I keep
telling you the most entertaining
outcome
would be if Trump had a third act
Revival
managed to somehow Against All Odds
prove there was some problem in the
election which would be the ultimate
and then goes to the presidency and has
a good presidency
that would be the most entertaining and
the thing is everybody knows that
we all know it every time he opens his
mouth about some new evidence about
election problems you say to yourself I
don't think he's going to prove it
but that sure would be entertaining that
would be entertaining
so we'll see
and what am I thinking of I'm saying
this book
as the number one book in the entire
world except for religious books
and
the more clearly I see it the more
likely it'll happen so if you want to do
this experiment to see if our
imaginations can make something happen
since you have you have no reason not to
you're probably not competing against me
for a best-selling book
just uh join me just imagine this the
number one book
just imagine it that's all
let's see what happens
and um
oh yes I don't know the details but Joe
Biggs one of the January 6 people got 17
years
is that right
I don't know the details of his case I
would just say that on the surface
that doesn't look like justice to me
and I would say that that's another
example of why you pretty much have to
elect Trump or somebody like Vivek
somebody I wouldn't vote for anybody who
didn't promise to pardon the January 6
people
to me that's that's bottom line
by the way as DeSantis said he would or
would not what is the Santa said
DeSantis is quiet on it or he says he
won't he's just quiet about it right
yes he would
he he's not talking about pardoning
Trump though
all right so here's the thing
it any candidate who doesn't say it
directly I will pardon these people I
think they're disqualified
do you agree
if you can't say it out loud that's
disqualifying
is disqualified
yeah I I think that's got to be that's
got to be the ticket to the show if you
can't say it directly
I don't even want to hear anything else
you have to say I don't care about your
policies don't care about your character
don't care about your history don't care
about
your anything
if you're not willing to do that simple
thing then you're willing to let your
party burn
uh if the other side decides I want to
that is unacceptable
all right ladies and gentlemen
I believe
that is uh what we want to talk to you
talk about today I would like to mention
a reframe that I heard on the Joe Rogan
show I think I'll mention reframes even
when they're not my own all right this
one comes from Jocko Willock and I won't
explain it as well as he does if you
want to see the video where Jocko
explains it it's much better but uh he's
got this thing he says when bad news
happens
he says good
and the first time I heard it and Joe
Rogan says that he he now uses that
technique when something bad happens or
something's hard he says good
and I thought to myself that couldn't
possibly work right because it's a
little bit opposite of what a hypnotist
would recommend
generally you don't want to recommend
saying something that's observably not
true
right you'd like to stick with things
that you actually feel are true but if
you say that bad news is good
then your brain is like well but is it
you know so it's a little unclear
messaging to yourself but I tried it
I tried it yesterday
so when I got the leak in my ceiling I'm
like because I it wasn't just a few
hours ago I'd heard about that reframe I
thought well I'll give it a try
so I look at the ceiling and I go good
I swear to god it worked
it worked
it completely changed my uh my
connection to the problem
what the hell
it worked it worked instantly it
actually worked instantly
now that one's as weird as there's
there's a reframe I do have in the book
in which the reframe is if you have some
big problem and it's just bugging you
you say that the problem has as much of
a right to exist as I do
doesn't make any sense right it's the
same as saying that your problem is good
or that anything is good about it now in
in Jocko had more of an explanation it
has something to do with you know
another challenge to overcome
you know you'll learn something maybe
there's an opportunity that comes out of
the bad news because bad news often
kicks up opportunities so he had he had
a little you know explanation around it
but I'm not even sure you needed it I
think the word itself carried the power
you just associate it with a positive
word and suddenly it changed how you
feel about it it was that easy
yeah so just say if you had a problem
well the problem has a right to exist
it just won't bother you as much you'll
still you know work on it if you could
solve it but if you just put a different
word on it now again I'll remind you
that the power of reframes and by the
way the the way that I can tell when my
Critics on who give me one star reviews
the way I can tell that they haven't
read the book is they they say it's a
book of advice
it's not a book of advice
it's a book of words that change your
brain
like good in that context it's just a
word
the word itself has the powers like a
little program so a reframe is like a
little program they put into your head
to to optimize something it doesn't have
to be true doesn't have to be logical
it just has to work and that's what good
does it just works so if you if you want
to spend all your time figuring out why
it works you can maybe that would be
interesting
but it doesn't matter
it works try it so Jocko good job on
that that was that was quite that was
really useful
that so when I tell people that you know
my 160 reframes will change your life
it's the only one you'd ever heard
was Jocko's
that's a pretty big change it
immediately made all the problems for
the rest of my life a little bit less
bro bothers them because I'll just do
that again it looks like it works
so imagine how big the changes are that
you can make just by a little tuning of
the words in your head all right ladies
and gentlemen that's all for now thanks
for joining us on YouTube for the best
live stream you've ever seen come back
tomorrow
