good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization well maybe
we don't know about these UFOs yet but
uh I think this is the highlight of
civilization don't let anybody tell you
differently but if you'd like to take it
up to another dimension well all you
need is the
maybe a CERN uh collider but you could
also use a cupboard bug or a glass a
tanker cellos or Stine a canteen Joker
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee
enjoyed me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine here the day
the thing makes everything better it's
called
it happens now go
ah
that's better
much better
so I don't know if you were checking the
news but uh
turns out
ex-president Trump has been indicted
does it feel like we've been here before
is this some kind of weird Groundhog Day
situation
president Trump is indicted
I just feel like every I don't know six
weeks I've I'm here
I know but this is the this is the one
this is the one that gets him
uh the walls are closing in
all right so as you know the indictments
are coming down they're going to be
seven counts including Espionage and uh
not cooperating with the
Department of Justice I guess
and we don't know the details yet they
have not been announced but it looks
like he's looking at maybe life in
prison
life in prison
um
how do you feel about this give me your
give me your uh feeling on this
disgusted hunted helpless BS
law fair
rigged
angry irritated angry you know what I'm
worried about
um
I'm worried that they wore you down or
they wore all of us down
and that the anger that you should be
feeling about this you all already used
up in the prior indictments
it's like oh and then you go away and
it's like oh but it feels like a repeat
now
I found that I couldn't generate the
same amount of anger
I generated with the last indictment
anybody having that that issue and it
has nothing to do whether he did or did
not do something illegal has nothing to
do with what happened it has only to do
with the fact that it's the third fourth
tenth time he's been in great legal
Jeopardy if if you count the
impeachments
plus the legal issues
I just feel like I'm worn out I'm just
exhausted
now that's a pretty good strategy
for the Dems because I I think I worry
that they've
exhausted your outrage
you know once you're out of outrage
because there's so much to be outraged
about
specifically in terms of unequal Justice
it just seems like there's so much
that I'm just
I'm just empty I've drawn out of things
but let me make the following
predictions
number one how the other candidates
treat this
will make a big difference to the
outcomes
um specifically if it turns out that
Trump is taking the left with people who
talked about it right
and if they talked about it wrong they
are dead they are dead at least to me
all right so let me give you an idea of
what the three major candidates said
Republican candidates
all right here's DeSantis talking about
it and this by the way is an excellent
excellent answer
so here's how to do a right this is
DeSantis quote why so zealous in
pursuing Trump yes so passive about
Hillary or Hunter the DeSantis
Administration will bring accountability
to the doj excise political bias and
weaponization once and for all that's
perfect
that's perfect because he didn't say
Trump is good or Trump is bad or Trump
should be anything he just said that the
Democrats are weaponizing it perfect
right so if Trump went down
and desensis was your choice you know if
you're a republican he's he ended up to
be your choice would you be happy with
that response
I would be I would be completely happy
with that yes now give me a fact check
did DeSantis say he would pardon some of
the j6ers and would that include Trump
did DeSantis say he would he did say he
would pardon Trump
my memory is getting confused I think he
did right I think he did right so I
would say DeSantis is perfectly clean on
this question what do you think
just on this question he's perfectly
clean right yeah I think he handled it
just right
about patents here's what Penn said
um
he will support the Republican nominee
no matter who it is
and then when asked does that include
Trump
he said well he won't be the nominee but
if he is but he won't but what if he is
but he won't
how's that answer
and then he said he would not pardon uh
Trump or I think anybody else no pardons
for January 6.
how do you feel about no pardons for
January 6.
disqualifying yeah it's disqualifying
I love myself some Mike Pence you know I
think his performance as vice president
was tremendous
but no
no
that's uh Dead on Arrival I'm sorry he
does not get even a reasonable
consideration from that point of view
how about Vivek ramaswamy did you see
his statement now is this guy the
lengthy
but it's also very good so I'm going to
read the whole thing if you don't mind
it's a little likely so this is a Vivek
ramaswami says we can't have two tiers
of Justice one for Trump another for
Biden one for Assange another for
Manning one for BLM antifa another for
peaceful protesters on January 6.
very good nice little summary starts you
off strong
I never thought we'd see the day when
the U.S president deputizes the doj to
arrest his lead rival in the middle of
an election yeah that gets right to it
that's that's the heart of it right
there Obama shamefully tried to deputize
the FBI to infiltrate Trump's 2016
campaign but they're leaving nothing to
chance this time around the federal
police state is outright arresting Trump
he's going hard at this
uh this is an affront to every citizen
we cannot devolve into a Banana Republic
where the party in power uses police
force to arrest its political opponents
is hypocritical for the doj to
selectively prosecute Trump but not
Biden
pretty much every one of you agrees with
that I'm sure
there are also serious legal questions
about the president's power to
declassify documents and the potential
illegality of the overclassification of
federal documents in the first place
that's that's a small issue I'm not sure
I would have put that in there that's
for the course to decide about We the
People decide who governs the nation
exactly
exactly and they're taking your choice
away or trying to it would be much
easier for me to win this election if
Trump were in the race
correct but I stand for principles over
politics
are you allowed to do that
I I didn't know that was allowed are you
allowed to stand for principle over
politics but he is I mean I think it's
good politics too you know don't get me
wrong I do believe he believes that the
principle so I think he's telling you
the absolute truth his opinion but you
know it is politics too it's just good
politics
um
he says I commit to Pardon Trump
promptly on January 20th 2025 and to
restore the rule of law in our country
boom
how about
I
perfect statement I commit to Pardon
Trump promptly on January 20th 2025.
isn't that interesting
now how do you like his answer compared
to DeSantis who do you think did a
better desantist or
Swami
well if x is longer yeah he had more
meat on the bone there yeah but he but
he was also
um
super direct about the pardon
now here's what I like about his take on
this
he could always change his mind
yeah if you became president
and it turns out that the charges were
way worse than anybody imagined he could
change his mind nobody would care I mean
but he'd have to have the facts on his
side right if the facts were not on his
side
than changing his mind would be pretty
bad idea but he has the option if it
turns out there's something we don't
know and it changes how you feel about
it you can change his mind but at the
moment with what we do now and his
position which I agree with on the
weaponization of the Department of
Justice
this is a strong statement
I like the principle over the
you know over the minutia
so I think he nailed it
good job there
uh about
does this wouldn't feel real to you
let me let me check your temperature
does it everybody's been saying oh this
is the one you got to worry about you
know the bill bars the people who
actually know what they're talking about
when it comes to some of this legal
stuff I don't trust my judgment
but I see a bunch of people who do have
the knowledge and the background and the
judgments saying this is the one they've
been saying this for a long time do you
think they're right
is this the one
it doesn't feel like it
it doesn't feel like the one yeah what
does dershow would say
yeah so
so I guess he's being charged with
Espionage do you think that there's
anything about what he did that would
sound to your mind now this is not the
I'm not talking about the the legal
technical definition of Espionage he may
in fact have tripped over some technical
definition but in your mind
does espionage sound anything like what
he's accused of doing
it doesn't does it at the very worst he
was playing fast and loose with some
confidential information that's the
worst
worst case scenario he was unconscious
now the so so there's some details of
the story we'll talk about
so I think the most interesting part of
the story is that there's an audio
recording of him saying something along
the lines of Mark Billy General Millie
was blaming Trump for wanting to attack
uh Iran allegedly Trump was saying
that's not me
that was Mark Miller himself who drew up
the attack plans that wasn't me
so he's basically countering Millie in
this audio
and he seems to be at least rustling
papers
and referring to something as if he has
in his hand maybe something he's showing
to people
in which uh
is something about an attack plan for
Iran
now how would you feel
if there was a secret attack plan for
Iran and Trump had removed it and
potentially somebody could see the
actual attack plan
for Iran I'm sorry around yeah Iran
what would you feel about that
fine you'd be okay with that
a military attack plan
against a adversary
you'd be okay if if the president
allowed that into the wrong hands
no I mean just put it you put it in a
risky situation by having it not as
secure
really
interesting well we don't know if it was
in the wrong hands now we're only
talking about the risk of it getting in
the wrong hands but he was clearly
talking to some people who did not have
security clearance
I mean the if the audio is correct
and we don't know if it is but
all right so we don't know if anything
about that's true
if it were true I would be a little
concerned about it unless
it's so generic that it doesn't mean
anything
because you you can imagine it being
super generic it's like well we would
start with an aerial bombardment
and what would Iran say to that well
obviously obviously they start with an
aerial bombardment
right and that'll be we would work
carefully with our allies in Israel
well of course obviously they're going
to work carefully with our allies in
Israel so what do you think that
document said do you think it really
said uh here's the beach we're gonna
land on
do you think do you think he had a
document that said here's the beach this
is where we're gonna have our beach head
like something that really would make a
difference I don't think so I doubt it
yeah my guess is it was a very generic
document
that said something along the line of
we'd start with an aerial bombardment
you know they they have X assets we'd
have to take out their anti-aircraft
first it probably is the most generic
my guess is the world's most generic
battle plan
do you think I'm wrong
I I say it's generic
we'll never see it I don't think we'll
ever see it if it exists don't even know
if it exists but wouldn't you feel
different
or differently if you knew that the plan
was just a bunch of generic BS
I always feel different that would make
a big difference to me but I don't know
if we'll ever find that out
I have a hard time believing he would
have taken that out of the office and
waved it around
if it really was the secret stuff I mean
I'm sure it was classified but I just it
just feels like it would be generic
like would they show the president
what kind of document does the president
get shown in the first place do you
think the military comes in with a
25-page detailed document of the battle
plan and hands it to a president
or do they summarize it in one page
and it's just so generic by the time
it's summarized that there's just no
details there if I were the military I
would never give the president those
details
because it would increase the number of
people who saw them
right I would I would simply keep the
the detailed plans into the smallest
smallest group of people and I would
just tell the president that you had a
plan yes we have a plan and we've got
details
I wouldn't hand it to him would you
would you actually hand them the
detailed plan the president
why would they ever do that
I don't think they would ever do that
yeah they they can't get Trump to read
the uh the briefings
if Trump wasn't reading the briefings
how much of a document is he going to
read
one page
probably one or two pages I guess
there's some rough rustling the paper so
it might have been more than one page
but anyway so that's a big question the
news will try to convince you that it's
really some good stuff in there but we
don't know even if it exists
I would say if that document is real and
they can determine it ever existed
correct me if I'm wrong
uh every document that goes into the
Oval Office is digitized yes or no
yes or no every document that enters the
Oval Office is digitized and kept
forever independent of the piece of
paper
so in theory
in theory they should be able to do a
global search
look for Iran look for Mark Milly as the
author look for the president as a
recipient
boom there's your electronic document
am I wrong
there's no way that was only on a piece
of paper
I don't think there's any chance of that
so you find out what it was
and then you ask him to produce that
document and if he can't or if he does
it now which would be almost as damning
that would suggest that he really knew
he had something that was confidential
and that he really was trying to hide it
which would really be a problem
so
uh
Ben Shapiro is better than Scott on this
well what kind of a up comment is
that
do you think I don't know that Ben
Shapiro is literally like isn't he a
lawyer
so is that some kind of an insightful
comment that a lawyer has a little
better Insight on a legal question
did did you come here for my legal
insights
foreign
stuff because of course
yeah okay can I just ask you once as
clearly as possible
I don't care what you think
but don't do the anti-semitic stuff in
the chats right go off and have your own
little bigoted
thoughts you can do that but don't put
it don't put it to this forum we don't
want to see it at all
right
um
so here's my take on this
I don't think that Republicans are going
to care what he did or did not do the
pundits will you're the ones who go on
TV will say oh the law is a law and
nobody's above the law
I feel like that's what you should say
after every time somebody says it
because it's so boring
that the next time somebody goes on a TV
show and says nobody is above the law
that when you do an impression of them
they should go like this nobody's above
the law
because it's just so stupid it
bothers me nobody's about the law
because it doesn't mean anything
it means nothing
there's no no useful information because
who the are you talking to are you
talking to somebody who thinks that the
law should be different for a different
citizens what are you adding to the
conversation
right the only thing about Trump is
whether he's being treated below the law
right if they start saying nobody is
below the law that would fit perfectly
and also be a new thought but you know
it's not a new thought the ways Above
the Law always Above the Law gurgle
this is only about somebody being
treated below the law somebody treating
and being targeted that's the story if
if you let the story be about Above the
Law it was above Allah
then you've just let the idiots win
all right you should mock the and
if anybody who ever says he's not above
the law
take my lead on this please
um
I would say that the the allegations
against President Trump seem pretty
serious
but I also don't think there's a victim
yes sir
is there a victim in the story
I mean can you make an argument for a
victim
you can make a a potential argument like
oh maybe nothing bad happened but
potentially it could have
so you can't let people get away with
stuff because the next time maybe
something would happen that's bad you
don't want to set a precedent of not
Prosecuting for people for putting your
secrets at risk
on the other hand
it's going to look like a weaponized
Department of Justice
given that DeSantis and
Vivek ramaswami and Trump himself have
all decided that the weaponized
Department of Justice should be the
biggest issue
and I feel like it should be because you
know what I feel like everything they do
to Trump they're doing to me
well let me I just said it right let me
just put it right there now I might be a
special case because you know I have
public profile and I have my own
troubles I have my own problems but I
feel like whatever they do to him
they're doing to me
it does not feel like I'm watching a
story it just feels like it's happening
to me
and
how many of you feel the same
I've never had this feeling before
I've never had a feeling where the
politician
was a proxy for me as a as a citizen
have you ever had that can you think of
any time that's ever happened
where they where the candidate became a
proxy for you like actually you
yeah
Trump has a way doesn't he I just don't
know that other people could have done
that maybe Reagan something like that
but you it takes a really unique
personality
to make you feel hip especially after
all he's done right it's not like he
hasn't disappointed you
am I right
that the the love-hate relationship with
Trump
um bonds people to him in a way that I
don't think ordinary political observers
understand
Trump is a case of love
it's not even politics with him it's
actually just a weird form of love and
part of the way that he addicts you to
him is by disappointing you
do you understand that the way he
addicts you is to disappoint you
if he didn't disappoint you in a fairly
you know hard to predict way but you
know it's coming you just don't know how
and when
you wouldn't be as in love with him if
in fact that describes how you feel all
right his supporters there's something
about the fact that he does he'll do six
six things that you love you just love
and you love him for saying it and then
he'll do one thing you're like holy cow
what
and then you lose your love but then he
does six more things that makes you love
him you're like
ah why does he keep doing this to me why
does he keep making me love him
so I do believe that there is a you know
the the Democrats call it a cult
but it doesn't feel like that to me
like I get what they're saying and
they're that word is not so wrong that I
would mock them for it but I feel like
it's it's just a few degrees off I don't
think it's a cult
I think people fell in love with him
I think they love him and that's not
exactly a cult it has more to do with
just him it's not even about you know
the community or the other Republicans
or anything else they just like it
now the reason I I talk like this is I
have exactly the same feeling
my feeling for him personally is very
good like you know I've met him so you
have a different feeling when you met
somebody but
you know I get disappointed too
so I mean I get I get just jacked back
and forth like crazy you know on some
level
I would love to have a trump free
existence
my life would probably be better
if I didn't have to deal with it and you
know I have to explain it and have to be
associated with it so more people hate
me than already do that sort of thing
but on the other hand
oh my God does he deserve to win
you know what I mean
there there's some sort of karmic
Justice that I feel just hanging over me
like a weight
like Karma won't let him lose
it it just feels like almost an external
Force
that's that's gonna set this right by
putting them back in office
but I got to admit
This legal Jeopardy does look pretty
serious
if I had to rank it on the scale of one
to ten for seriousness
it's at least an eight
what do you say
eight out of ten for seriousness
I've got some nose oh dershowitz says no
Joshua says no
all right well I'm gonna wait for
dershowitz and then alter my opinion
I've told you my darshan was rule
the dershowitz rule is very simple
if dershowitz disagrees with me on let's
say a legal issue I will immediately uh
alter my opinion to matches
because he hasn't been wrong yet
well I'm sure he's been wrong about
something but he's you know far more
likely to be right about this than
anybody else and the reason he's far
more likely to be right
is it dershowitz and also Charlie are
two people that you can depend on
to follow the the path of the law and
precedent
and not lie to you
I mean I do love love the fact that
there are two lawyers that I can trust
when they give an opinion about a
political figure yeah if dershowitz or
turtley give me a view I immediately say
that looks reasonable I'm going to adopt
that view
I don't think Barnes falls into that
category but
um I mean it's a little more of a
partisan
in my opinion
all right
um
do you think that this indictment will
guarantee Trump wins or guarantee he
loses
because it could go either way right
this is a really high risk
and the reason is high risk is that if
they take him down I don't know what
that's going to do to my brain
do you have you thought about it
because part of me thinks he's never
going to be taken down because we've
been through this before
but what would that do to your brain if
he takes them down
I think I would flip out
I think I would be done with the United
States
too strong
not not done in terms of moving but
if there's anything that's too far
this is too far
and I I believe that one of the purposes
that I can serve if anything to the
let's say to the greater good is I've
used this term before the internet dads
there is a group of people who I believe
do better than others in being
independent thinkers and not having any
objective other than making the world a
better place
and yeah yeah sirovich he's an internet
dad I don't believe he's just
politically motivated I think he's
looking for what makes sense what works
and
I like to things that I'm in that
category of people who will not lie to
you because I don't have a reason to
just don't have a reason to lie to you
no there's no incentive whatsoever
so
in my opinion that's too far
and I'd like to
make sure that the Democrats are aware
of what too far looks like
right now I don't know what I would do
nor would I necessarily Telegraph it
I don't think Civil War
but whatever would happen would be
fairly extreme
uh I do think people would die
I do think people would die if he gets
indicted and goes to jail not indicted
but if he goes to jail
I think there'd be a riot
what do you think
do you think there would be violence
I think people would just stop paying
taxes it could be the end of the
Republic
yeah I think taking down Trump has a is
an existential threat to the Republic
not a big one
not you know not 90 percent
but I think it's a I think it's a solid
10 risk to end the Republic if they jail
them
if your government is willing to take
and I'm just making up this number but
if they're willing to take a 10 risk to
end the Republic
because this would be a big deal
this would be a big deal
um I don't know what would happen now I
suspect that depending on the timing of
it
um what's your guess my my guess of the
timing is they'll drag you down so they
don't have a result before the election
what do you think I believe that there
will not be a court result before the
election
does that sound right
because I don't think they want to
result the last thing the Democrats want
is a legal result before the election
you know why right
because they lose either way
it doesn't matter what the result is
they lose it's a lose-lose for them if
they put him in jail
half the country is going to flip the
 out
unless they really have the goods and it
doesn't look like it yet
okay
nobody's going to think that was a real
election
nobody is going to treat whoever gets
elected in that scenario as a legitimate
president I wouldn't I would not
consider that whoever wins to be a
legitimate president if the winning only
became well if maybe if it was a
republican because that's a different
situation where you're replacing like
would like but if the Democrats win
because they figured out how to jail
Trump at the last minute
that's not going over well would you
agree
that is too far
but I don't think they're going to play
it that way I think they want to put the
cloud over him until he gets elected and
then what happens can he pardon himself
can Trump pardon himself
how's that work
well I think that at the very least they
would have to delay the legal process
for another four years because they
don't like to prosecute sending
presidents
I know I think the Democrats through
their surrogates
are playing a very dangerous game
there is one way that this ends right
and it doesn't include Trump in jail
if you put Trump in jail
I have to cut well 40 percent of the
country is just going to flip out
and
that is just too far
that's just too far you know the
impeachment was sort of theater and I
thought it was you know outrageous and
inappropriate but it wasn't you know too
far it was just political but putting
him in jail
that that's when I would lose uh every
bit of trust and love for my government
or the country really in fact if the
country allowed that to happen I would
lose my love for the country itself
I would lose all respect for our country
if we let that happen
and that's a pretty bad place to be
all right
let's talk about something else UFOs
um I've asked before and almost all of
you think the UFO story is BS
but I love the fact that there are so
many credible people who are saying it's
credible
um here's my theory
you may have heard it before
the only thing that fits all of the
facts and evidence because the
Whistleblower story has some weird holes
in it
and the holes are
are these only happening in the United
States all the UFOs are crashing in the
United States
and their actual like dead UFO bodies
and no one no one else was talking about
it but what about all the other
countries it's like this Global
conspiracy
you know there's nobody not the Russians
there nobody's no citizen took a picture
and put it on the internet right so
they're all kinds of these really you
know this story doesn't hold together if
you do the really test really
really every single time the government
got there first really did they all
crash next to a U.S military base
how did all of them only get captured by
the military just no citizen right no
citizen saw these just the military and
they they packed it up and took it away
well
maybe I mean
uh I'll always be open to recreational
belief you know that maybe maybe there's
some Millions I would love that but
here's what I think is the most likely
explanation
that the U.S is starting this rumor
um
as disinformation
so that our our adversaries Russia and
China
believe that there's some possibility
just some possibility
that we have an alien weaponry
now you say to yourself Scott
did Russia are never going to believe
that
what do you mean
there are members of our own government
who believe it you don't think that
they're members of the you don't think
there are members of our own military
who believe the alien story
if you were if you were to do a survey
of our generals you think not one of
them would think that's true
no they would
some of them would think is fake but
absolutely some of them think it's true
would you agree with that there's some
some high-end members of our government
or military or both some of them believe
that the that there are some UFOs and
we're taking them apart to learn their
secrets
now that would be a really good story
to have out there if you thought you
could sell it at least a little bit to
any of the Russians or even a little bit
to any of the Chinese you know it
doesn't mean that Putin himself believes
it or that she believes it but maybe the
generals might
yeah just put a little doubt out there
so they're not so willing to go to war
because we're really talking about uh
nuclear confrontations with both of them
we're talking about what happens if
Taiwan becomes a subjective attack well
you know what happens if Russia looks
like it's losing
I think that's a stretch but
I do think that this was put out here as
uh and that would also explain
why the Whistleblower could say it under
oath
and not be concerned
because it's just a government operation
and you would be protected I assume you
could do that right
if you were a CIA agent just
hypothetically if let's say you were a
CIA agent could you lie
under oath
for National Security
could you
no
could you lie under oath about what
somebody told you
because he didn't say you saw him
personally he said people told him
what if people did tell them that
suppose suppose people actually told
them these stories but they were the
spies
what if he's not the Spy but the spies
are the ones who told them it was real
so that he would become a whistleblower
and then he would have no record as
being you know part of intelligence or
anything so you say well this guy looks
totally real
all of his information is from other
people who told him he has no direct
information but he looks real he's not
lying
all you do is you have the Liars talk to
him he gets all these good stories
thinks they're real and now he's not
lying he's just wrong
so I think the most look the the one
explanation that fits all of the
observed facts is that it's a
disinformation campaign to uh influence
our foreign adversaries
that's the best I have
I wouldn't bet my life on it but it's
the only it's the only uh hypothesis
that answers all questions
it tightens everything up in a nice
little bag doesn't mean it's right it's
just the only thing that answers all the
questions everything else leaves
gigantic question marks
seems like a dumb misinformation
campaign well here's the assumption that
you would have to make to think that was
a bad idea
check this assumption
that high ranking members in the Russian
and Chinese military could or could not
be convinced that it might be true might
be true
remember this is the trick that Trump
uses when Trump says he might bomb
Moscow
he says directly he only has to think
there's a 10 chance
that's it if he thinks there's a 10
chance he'll act like it's real
so you don't think that you could
convince some members of those two
governments there's a 10 chance we have
some alien technology
you could convince ten percent of the
people of anything
let me say that again you could convince
ten percent of any group of people of
absolutely anything
and this is well within well within the
range of things you could convince
people are true now I've never seen any
data on this
but do you think that the average
Russian
is more or less likely to believe in a
UFO than the average American
what do you think
the average Russian more or less likely
than an American
I don't know there's no such thing as an
average Russian so it's a weird question
but uh
I think they're not that different than
Americans
I don't think that they are more
gullible or less gullible than Americans
and don't you think that at least a
quarter of America believes these UFOs
are real
at least a quarter of America I don't
know what the real number is but at
least a quarter
maybe higher wouldn't you think
you think less than a quarter
I don't know I think in regular Middle
America people see it on the news and
they say it must be true
you know we're we're sort of a weird
group of people because we're the the
people who really read the news every
day and care about it and you know you
see all the lies and the gullibility and
stuff so we're the most skeptical group
you could be
and probably
you know the rest of the country is just
saying oh it's unseeing then must be
true
all right
um Elon Musk weighed in again to uh
Michael schellenberger or thread so
Michael schellenberger is taking the
interesting take on this which I wasn't
expecting
he is treating the story as credible
which is different from being true got
to make that distinction credible just
means it came from a source that cannot
be impugned
I think that would be fair there's
nothing about the whistleblowers past
that suggests he's a liar am I right
as far as I know he's served with
distinction in the military and he's on
record you know he's he's put it out
there and there are other people too
shellenberger says there are other
people who are confirming the story so
there there is some other
but I don't know if anybody's seen it I
think they're more confirming the story
than somebody else has seen him
um but you'll most replied to that and
he said I haven't seen anything and I
think I'd know
do you believe that Elon Musk would know
if there if there were a secret U.S
government entity that was so secret
that even the rest of the government
didn't know about it
would Elon Musk know about something so
secret that even the president of the
United States might not know about it
I don't know I I think I think musk
would know about it from a in the
general sense that he would know if any
UFOs look credible I don't think he
would have specific information about
you know a top secret government program
of some kind but if you're talking about
a dozen crashed ships
and that would just be the United States
yeah you think about all the world and
all the other crashes there must be in
theory
um if Elon Musk hasn't heard anything
that looked credible
I mean I'm I'm leaning in his Direction
on this
as you know
all right however we don't know that
these are coming from different planets
I saw a Brian romelli
a tweet today showed a a bust a carved
bust of a woman's head and he tweeted
this made of a diorite
and he said diorite is one of the
strongest materials on Earth it resists
alkaline acidic elements and it can
withstand the effects of the environment
in time
expert claim experts claim that this
meaning that bust that looks just
perfect remember the bus had no no
degradation it looks exactly like it
looked three thousand years ago I don't
know what this diorite is but it looks
like a metal of some sort or something
but it looked it looked like it was made
in a mold in modern times because it's
perfect like you know every part of it
is smooth and perfect
and uh
as Brian says in his tweet experts claim
this this was made with stones sticks
chicken bones and copper 3000 years ago
I don't think this was made by the
ancient people with their chicken Moats
when you look at it you say no that was
not made with chicken bones and copper I
don't know what it was made with
but it doesn't look like it was made by
the people of the time
three thousand years ago so three
thousand years ago there may have been
an artifact that the Ancients found
there was an advanced civilization that
could do that
now that would also explain everything
from the pyramids to the Sphinx and all
the things that we can't figure out how
they were made
I am getting more and more convinced by
the earlier Advanced civilization
hypothesis meaning that there wasn't
necessarily an Atlantis
but there probably was an advanced
civilization before some cataclysm
and it wouldn't surprise me
if they built drones
maybe they still have their under
underwater uh base and and you know
there's some because it's easier to
imagine all the people dying but the
robots going on
right imagine a situation where a virus
killed all the humans 10 years from now
so 10 years from now all the humans die
from a terrible virus in 10 years do you
think the robots will have enough AI
and enough you know physicality there's
enough robots walking around that the
robots could keep the lights on
and just go on
do you think the robots could uh you
know well they could at least
cannibalize each other for parts
right one robot breaks but you take some
parts from the other broken robot so you
could go on for a very long time if the
robots could assemble things if he gets
the point where the robots could type on
a computer or just use their minds to
connect to the internet
um
if everything's local if they have a
power source that they can either repair
or runs forever
you don't think you could have an
underground civilization of robots that
have been there for six thousand years
what do you think
if we put robots on Mars and no humans
but they were sent there with the
express purpose of setting up a
civilization and Building Things and
repairing themselves
he came back in ten thousand years would
the robot still be there building and
repairing things
there's a good chance they would I mean
there's a chance it wouldn't but there's
a good chance to say what
because remember they don't die that
easily you know to kill a robot
you know it's got a break or something
so if they can repair each other that's
that's the main thing once the robots
can repair each other they can also do
anything else with their physical
environment and they have ai which would
include all the knowledge of the of the
whoever built them in theory
in a theory I would say we're I'm going
to put a number on I'd say that we are
20 years away
from building a self-sustaining robot
civilization
20 years
20 years is the blink of an eye
we're basically at a point where we
could build a civilization that would
withstand a human cataclysm that killed
us all
as long as they were protected they
would just keep on
so I'm going to go with the theory
so this this is similar to
um
the way simulation theory is thought of
just playing the odds
what are the odds that our civilization
the one right now Will Bill will build a
environment with self-sustaining
technology robots that can repair
themselves
a hundred percent yeah the odds that
we'll do it maybe in the young people's
lifetime not mine maybe but the the odds
that we'll do it in the next 50 years or
100 percent
in my opinion I think it's a hundred
percent
so if we can do it in our in our
civilization then it's right here I mean
it's going to happen in many of your
lifetimes why do you think that a prior
civilization if you hypothesize that
they existed what and and they would
have had thousands of years to develop
oh here's the most mind-bending thing
think about our current civilization and
where we were
500 years ago
we're basically walking around and you
know pooping in holes and and wearing
Rags 500 years ago
so the time it takes a civilization to
go from uh rag farmers
to Rockets to Mars is about 500 years
just 500 years
now imagine if there was a human
civilization
50 000 years ago
or make it easier I'll say yeah
twelve thousand years ago
twelve thousand years is not that much
if they were humans twelve thousand
years ago
they could have reached our level of
Technology
12 times over
so if you say to yourself what are the
odds of some primitive civilization
being able to do what we do the the
answer is
they could have done it 12 times over
it's not it's not just possible it's
nearly guaranteed because whatever it
was about the humans now
if if we were biologically similar then
and 12 000 years isn't a lot of
evolution for a human being
they had probably 12 times the chances
of building advanced technology that
could go on without them
so we're definitely going to make
autonomous robots they could live with
ever forever without us it's going to
happen they might be on Mars
but it's going to happen why do you
think they didn't do it
I actually think there was a prior
civilization
maybe more than one it's actually
possible there were 10 prior
civilizations that all reached our level
of Technology
but we don't we just don't see any of it
because it wouldn't take more than I
don't know a few thousand years for all
signs of them to disappear
imagine if you will that their entire
civilization lived in what is now an icy
shelf you know maybe the climate was
different or something so they just
lived what is now below Antarctica or
something or or below the ocean
maybe they never lived above the ground
maybe after 2000 years they said hey
this atmosphere is no good why don't we
just go live under the ocean forever
and maybe they're still there
all right
so I'm uh I'm about 80 percent on past
civilizations that had advanced
technology and if that's true
given given that I think it's very
likely there were Advanced Technologies
or Advanced civilizations wouldn't that
be far more likely
than space aliens figured out how to
overcome the physics of space and time
and distance and get here from a distant
planet and then 12 of them crash
If there really are 12 of them
this is far more likely
that uh there were you know some kind of
human-made thing all right
um
Ukraine's counter offensive has
allegedly started Russians are allegedly
putting up a stiff defense but you may
have noticed there's almost no news
about it what's up with that
so the Ukraine counter-offensive is I
guess in full swing
and we don't know anything about it
nothing there's just no news about it
is that intentional
what's going on over there
now as I've said I believe the the
Ukrainian War has been over for some
time the war is over this is the
negotiation and I think that the
negotiation is going to be all about
Crimea
I think that Ukraine wants enough at
least threat of Crimea you know maybe a
little surrounded or something but I
think that's what they need before they
negotiate I think they don't want to
negotiate until they've got a you know
maybe a good claim for they could take
Crimea if they pushed they might not
take it
but they might be surrounding it and
saying all right if you don't negotiate
what we want we're going to take Crimea
and it's going to be bloody
so it's definitely a negotiation at this
point not a war
um
but not much news
um I saw that as predicted there will be
a I guess Mark Andreessen was tweeting
this recently he tweeted that in our era
New Era of AI every child will have an
AI tutor that is infinitely patient
infinitely knowledgeable and infinitely
helpful and uh an AI company that I've
used a little bit called Synthesia
uh now has a tutor it's basically an
avatar you get to pick your own avatar
and that Avatar will have conversations
with you and teach you individually and
that will be better than
anything we've ever seen
now
I guess I have a little skepticism
whether we'll ever be as happy listening
to people on the screen as we would be
people in person
and I suspect it's going to be a
combination of some people who can only
learn from other people
and some people who actually would love
to have it on the screen now I'm the
kind of person with who might like it on
the screen because I can fast forward it
if you sit in a classroom what
percentage of the time that the teacher
is up there doing something is actually
education
it's a very small percent right of all
they're talking and acting and doing
stuff yeah maybe 25 is actually teaching
so if I could just put my finger on the
screen and go
up to the part where something's on the
Whiteboard you know and you actually
seeing some graphics and something
useful
that'd be great you know I would think
that even something like math
could be turned into a a visual
um
a visual lesson that would just bring
you inside it like you're inside a
machine and you can see the machine
working there's there's addition there's
there's calculus back there I don't know
there's probably some way that even
something like math
could be taught without making it just
memorization
um and then certainly English and
writing and conversation and language
those things would be easy for the AI
but math would be a little challenging
because it's so boring the the reason
that
I think it would be hard to get a kid to
use a screen maybe an adult can but to
get a kid to use a screen is asking a
lot of their
um self-control
but if you put them in a room where
there's a human looking at and saying
hey Billy Billy eyes up here
maybe you can get them to pay attention
but if you put a kid with a scream alone
in a room
how much how much education is going to
happen
I don't know too many kids who could
learn on the road with a screen no
matter how well designed that is great
is I don't know kids are good to do that
I do think adults can do that
and I do think that it works really well
to supplement in-person training but I
don't think you could give a kid an iPad
and said go get your education
I mean so there's certainly a limit
there
they might need a robot I think you need
a robot tutor so the robot can actually
look at the kids and say hey hey
eyes up here
it's robots I think it's going to be
robots
all right
here is Congress being extra extra
useless
what have I told you about when
politicians say they're going to form a
committee to study something
what does that mean we're going to form
a committee to study these
recommendations
well it means they just want it to go
away
it means they're not trying to solve it
they just want it to go away
so I was not aware of this but during
the the debt
ceiling negotiations and the budgeting
negotiations there so Democrats wanted
to
have a deal to immediately mandate more
transmission
on the electorate grid and I may have
the details wrong but I think what the
Democrats wanted was to mandate that the
various companies that own their own
transmission facilities that they
connect with each other I always thought
they were but I guess they're not so
that they can share energy when there's
a shortage in some place and somebody
has some extra now apparently there's
some resistance from to this from the
industry itself
because I think the industry likes more
control of their own territory and to
not be subject to the demands of their
neighbor
which I can understand
because let's say if they have some
energy it's a high demand period they
can charge more money
but what if the neighbor says hey we
want your energy
well then they can't charge more money
for it they probably have some deal
where they give it to them at a you know
low price or something so so I think
they have to study to find out if the
industry is going to get killed by it
or if it would just be all good
and they've decided that they're going
to take two and a half years to study it
two and a half years to study a proposal
that would require the nation's big
Power regions to share energy during the
peak two and a half years
to study it
does that sound like Congress was
serious about that at all
at all no we're not serious about that
they made it go away
so what do you consider one of our
biggest Homeland Security risks I'll
tell you mine
the energy grid
I don't think there's much that we need
to get right more than the energy grid
because if the energy grid is is fixed
and by the way this is an RFK Junior
uh thing uh he says if you fix the
energy grid then green energy actually
could work
because you could be producing it in one
place when the sun is out and the wind
is blowing and then just transport it to
where those things are not happening and
then when it reverses
transported back now there's a lot of
loss over Transportation so that that
has to be managed but at the very least
you should be able to transport it to
the the neighboring companies assets
I don't know I don't have an opinion yet
if it's a good idea or a bad idea the
way it was proposed but certainly you
need a free market a free market where
if somebody has some extra energy and
someone else in the country needs it
what would be the problem with selling
it to it just that they could sell it
more on their own territory I guess but
I feel like the free market in the long
run would be a better idea but this
looks like maybe it's not a free market
it looks like it might be mandated as in
uh if you run out of energy you can just
demand that your neighbor give you some
I don't know if that's a good idea
so there might be a mandate party here
that's the sticker I don't know the
details I'm guessing the Mandate parts
of the sticker because the Republicans
wouldn't say no to free markets would
they would the Republicans have a
problem with the free market where
everybody could simply buy and sell as
they needed to so it can't be that there
must be some details in here that are
obnoxious
all right
um
so
MSNBC apparently beat fox in the prime
time viewing on Monday night
which is unusual so two things happen
one is that Tucker's departure is really
slammed them for uh
in terms of ratings some say down a
third
um but Rachel Maddow only does one show
a week and I guess she just killed it on
Monday and she beats all the fox
all they'd have to do is back up the
truck to Rachel Maddow and put her on
for five nights a week and she would be
beating Fox News
I did not see that coming
I did not see that coming
so
Fox News has a real problem I don't know
what they're going to do about that
all right uh did you hear the story that
China is planning on building an
eavesdropping station in Cuba
so it'll be 100 miles off Florida and
they could use it to monitor
Communications in the United States at
least the southern U.S
how in the world do we let that happen
now it's not there yet it's just that's
the plan
how in the world
like I don't understand this story
how in the world
does Cuba think they can get away with
that
wouldn't you have to invade Cuba to make
that stop
what kind of military does Cuba have
these days because they withstand an
American invasion
or a decapitation strike
would that Force us to overthrow Cuba
I think it would
oh we could jam it maybe
I I don't know how good jamming is I
don't think they would consider building
it if we could jam it
now I don't know if a blockade is right
I think we should see this is a job for
Trump
imagine Biden versus Trump
Biden says to Cuba hey
get rid of those things or we'll get mad
at you
what does Cuba do well I don't know what
if Trump says if Trump called Cuba he'd
say uh we're gonna we're gonna
decapitate you we're going to take out
your leadership if you don't get rid of
those by Tuesday
and what would Cuba think would they
believe that Trump would actually
decapitate their leadership
in the next 48 hours yes they would yes
they would they wouldn't maybe think
it's a hundred percent
but it's that 10 thing and what does
Cuba get like what is their upside from
working with China
and I'm sure they have trade and stuff
but they couldn't possibly be enough
upside to make that worthwhile so every
time you see a situation where you know
Trump would be exactly the right
solution now I'm not saying that you
know if egg wouldn't be or that DeSantis
wouldn't be they they also would
probably be tough but it's just that he
has that extra
I don't know the extra scariness the
unpredictability thing
I just feel like Trump would would be
able to sell that threat better than
anybody could ever sell a threat because
he's the salesman he can sell a threat
all right
um
can you believe that there are people
going on television and saying that the
Canadian fire problem is uh climate
change
and I honestly can't tell if they know
they're full of
do you know do they know that that's not
a thing
now here's what I mean by not a thing
climate change is not what caused 15
fires to start at the same time
climate change doesn't set fires
and there's there's no Direct
you know track from the climate change
to the fires it's not like climate
change made more electricity
this was more lightning nobody's saying
that
it was a perfectly normal Canadian year
and their forests were maybe under
managed or maybe they weren't under
managed because apparently it's just
something that happens once in a while
it's not the first time there there's
some historical precedence for exactly
this happening before which I didn't
know until Jesse Waters said it I assume
he's right
um
but when I watched the the climate
people
go on TV they act like we're stupid
does anything bother you more than
stupid people acting like you're stupid
I don't think there's anything that gets
under my skin more than that
yeah like and and I have I have this
problem a lot because when you're I'll
just I'll just say it because uh I have
no shame
I'm smarter than most people
right probably so are most of you
probably most of you are smarter than
most people because you're engaging in
you know stuff that dumb people don't
engage in just this content so you're
probably smarter than most people if
you're watching this
so you probably have this situation a
lot where dumb people are treating you
like you're the idiot and what do you do
like what do you do with that
who is it uh jayapal
what's her name she's one of the squad
jayapal Saturday uh
yeah and she's and she's acting like
how can you ignore
the climate change now
I mean it's right in your face it's so
obvious
and the whole time I'm like oh God
that's so squirmishly awkwardly
dumb it's like dumb on a level if you
had arrogance to dumb
you've got a you've got a nuclear weapon
there
because she has arrogance about her
intelligence and it's just really really
dumb because the thing with the shifting
fires is you don't have to be a
scientist to know that this wasn't
because of climate change and I'm not
even making I'm not making a claim about
climate change I'm not saying that there
is or is not climate change I'm saying
that 15 fires starting at once is not
climate change and anybody should know
that
everybody should know that it's obvious
and how in the world
do so here's my genuine question
do you think that somebody like jayapal
is just being political and pretending
and knows full well that this is not
because of climate change
or does or is she in some kind of
cognitive dissonance where she actually
believes it is because the people around
her say it is and everybody she talks to
says this and so she's convinced that
it's obvious and all the smart people
around her say it's true
what do you think because she did not
look like she was telling a political
lie to me to me she looked like she was
actually disgusted and feeling arrogant
about the poor intelligence of the
people who think that 15 fires are
started automatically because of climate
change
I don't know I had such a like a
reaction to watching dumb people call me
dumb I just hate it
when smart people call me dumb
I just gave you the example of that if
if dershowitz disagrees with me
I have no problem saying he's the smart
one in the conversation no problem at
all but I'm not having that with JFL
she's not the smart one in this
conversation
all right
um
so I tweeted this and I believe it to be
true
but it may not be true after today so
this is this is something I thought was
true one day ago
so one day ago I said that RFK Jr has
the strongest path to the presidency
that was one day ago and a lot of that
had to do with the fact that he could
beat Trump if he got the nomination
but now I'm not certain no sure I'm not
so sure he would run against Trump
because the the Box hoax gate or
whatever you want to call it that might
actually
take him out of the race it's possible
I'm not betting on it so I'm not
predicting it will take him out but it's
possible
so that does change the calculation so
here's the calculation that says RFK Jr
has the strongest path to the presidency
and before you say it I want to tell you
that I am aware of the fact that you
don't know any Democrats who want him to
be president can we stipulate that you
don't know any Democrats who want him to
be president I get that it doesn't have
anything to do with my prediction
completely unrelated
all right
so here's why I think he has the
strongest path uh he's the only person
who's polling High who's actually in the
race on the Democrat side
so give me a fact check as I go these
are the assumptions on basis he's the
only one with enough support
that if Biden disappeared for some
reason before the primaries
he would be the obvious one
now some other people would jump in
but they would by then they would have
lost a lot of time
whereas RFK Jr would have created his
old brand and people would know what
he's about by about that time so here's
so my assumption is that Biden is not
going to make it uh physically he's not
going to make it through the nomination
process
so the first part of it is Biden's
Health which seems so obviously degraded
that I don't think the Democrats even
want to take a chance on them
and I don't think they want to take a
chance on President Kamala Harris
so so I'm going to say there's a 75
percent chance Biden
does not make it to the primary to be
the actual candidate
if he doesn't
RFK Jr would be the most obvious
replacement
if he gets the nomination will he also
get Democrat votes
of course he will because he's a
Democrat and because he's not Trump if
you assume Trump wins that's that
assumption is under question uh because
of the legal stuff if you assume he's
running against Trump his numbers show
he kills Trump he would destroy probably
better than Biden would
so the Democrats are going to have a
choice of somebody who would definitely
be Trump
versus somebody who might not even
survive
and just died Kamala Harris would be the
the leader do you think that Democrats
are going to allow that level of risk
to themselves
to put themselves in that situation well
they also have a problem with RFK Jr who
wants to rip apart
you know maybe the CIA and some things
they love and close the border and stuff
so he's not he's not the ideal choice of
the deep state but if he gets the
nomination the rank and file and the
Democrats are just going to vote they're
just going to line up and vote for him
so
I think that Biden's health will fail 75
chance I think the most likely stand-in
for the nomination would be RFK Jr if if
he's running against Trump
he wins
according to the polls he's got a
dominant uh advantage
and if it's not Trump
and it's DeSantis
um I heard somebody say this yesterday
if it's DeSantis versus
RFK Jr
I'm going to start liking my country
again all right I already I like my
country but
um
that would be one of the strongest
contests we've ever seen now I don't
agree with RFK Jr's policies on stuff
I'm I'm not entirely sure what the
census is and whether I agree or
disagree on anything there but a policy
aside they are two serious American
Patriots
who I would feel proud to have as my
president
I would feel proud to have either one of
them as my president I would also feel
confident that they could handle the job
and I would feel confident that they're
operating in the interest of the country
of course everybody looks out for
themselves as well but I would think
that unlike Biden where I actually don't
know if he's looking out for the benefit
of the country I actually don't know
because of all the bribery stuff
I just don't know
so
I think that would be an amazingly
healthy situation
so it always seems like you know we're
at the edge of Doom
but just just imagine for a minute
that uh imagine for a minute if Trump
gets taken out that you're going to see
a contest on the Republican side between
DeSantis and Vivek wouldn't you love to
see that
Vivek adds so much
to the political
philosophical thought on the right the
way he frames things the way he does
um
maybe the best job of communicating
we've seen on a Republican uh
I would love just love to see the
Republicans sharpen their sharpen their
tools by having those two characters go
at each other hard wouldn't that be the
best a nice Free Fair polite
but hard
fight between those those two characters
and again whichever of those two won I'd
be pretty happy
I'd be pretty happy with that the only
person I absolutely don't want to be
president is Biden
you know we're a comments they're sort
of the same animal they're sort of a
Biden Harris
creature it's like one creature that's a
combination of the two of them so
there's not even a Biden or a Harris
at this point there's a Biden Harris
it's like one creature with two heads I
don't want that
I do not want that to be my president
and
uh but RFK Jr I would I would feel like
the country was in good hands even if I
didn't like every single thing he did I
still feel like rationality was winning
and you know maybe I should look at my
own opinions harder if he disagrees yeah
I mean that's the ultimate test here's
the ultimate test of the leader yeah I
guess it's the dershowitz test the
ultimate test of a leader is if they
disagree with you it makes you rethink
your position
that's the ultimate test
yeah that's the best a politician can be
they disagree and you immediately say
well let me think about that that I had
not thought of it that way but now that
you've presented it I'm going to think
about it that way that's the best you
can do and RFK Jr does that like crazy
Vivek can do that I think DeSantis can
do that I think Trump does that
the those those are really really good
leadership qualities I think they all
have that we've never had a better batch
of candidates
um
so what about Chris Christie huh
I'm trying to figure out what the play
is for Chris Christie
it's got to be just for speaking
engagements
maybe speaking engagements
maybe somebody who hates Trump wants to
wants to just rough him up a little bit
so that's just one way to do it
I don't know
I don't even know what's what that's
about you couldn't possibly think
that he's going to win right
and then of course
so so
this should tell you everything you need
to know about Christy
so Christy uh announces he's going to
run and in theory that should be his big
publicity today right so DeSantis
announced he got big publicity you know
if they did basically when you announce
you're going to run that's your big
publicity day so Christy announces he's
going to run but what was the story
what was the story on the day he
announced he was going to run
the story was that Trump called him fat
oh
and he didn't even like the Trump did
this you know like juvenile thing where
he was like wow he sure mentions you
know size a lot you know why why does he
have some
some obsession with size and of course
that makes you think of Christie's size
which makes you think he's fat and the
funny thing is Trump is not exactly
svelt
you know Trump's got a Trump's got a few
pounds on him and somehow he still gets
away with it like the only thing I heard
about that Chris Christie is uh let me
tell you about his policies
Chris Christie's policies I'm sure I
have these here
um the it is quotes
did he say anything was there any
takeaway
oh wait here's something from Trump
calling him fat well that's interesting
now I'm all in on this story
Trump already took him out
Trump took him out with one tweet that
got criticized for being juvenile
sure
it was very juvenile
I would definitely agree it was uncalled
for it was unprofessional and
unstatesmanlike
and it ruined Christie's chances forever
and it totally worked
he's not a bully because it doesn't work
right he's got a lifetime of bullying he
knows it works
he knows it works that's why he does it
all right
and that ladies and gentlemen
is the presentation I was prepared to
give you is there any news that I missed
today any big news that you think I
should weigh in on because
uh discussed
uh Tucker Oh Tucker is there a second
video from Tucker today did I see that
just before I came on is anybody listen
to it yet what's the topic
oh yesterday it came on
yeah I was a little out of touch
yesterday it's about uh what's it about
oh okay it's about taboos and child okay
I don't want to talk about that stuff
all right
uh yeah the simultaneous erupting files
I mentioned
oh the global Health passport okay let's
talk about that so the World Health
Organization wants to have a global
Health passport which presumably they
could turn on and off if there's a
pandemic and restrict your travel
uh what do you think of that do you
think the United States is going to sign
up for a global passport
no
so I didn't talk about that story
because I don't find it real
I I don't think there's any chance the
United States will sign up for a World
Health Organization
china-sponsored
restriction on travel
I know I mean I could be wrong maybe the
Democrats might but to me it's just
another reason to assume that Trump or
republican will get elected
yeah so I don't think that story
uh Jimmy doors on the Ukraine Hit List
what
was he anti-ukraine
um do you see Bremer's response to
Tucker's initial video oh uh yeah Ian
bremmer has a response to Tucker's
initial video which
um Ian actually sent me the link they
make sure I saw it and it was my
birthday yesterday so I didn't do any
work
so so I'm a little uh I'm like 24 hours
behind just because I was enjoying
myself yesterday
all right I'll I'll look into that
though I want to see that because I know
he's got a different take on Ukraine
and I think his takes are worth looking
at
um
all right YouTube thanks for joining I
will see you tomorrow
