do do
morning everybody and welcome to the
highlight of civilization
it's your lucky day because you're here
and so are all all of us and we're going
to have the best time you've ever
experienced my God it's going to be
amazing and all you need to take it up a
level is a cup of mug or a glass of
tanker jealous of Steiner canteen jug or
flask of vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
into the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous
it's gonna happen now
go
ah yeah
it was really good
better than I expected
all right ladies and gentlemen
here's the news uh yet another state
Texas in this case is uh got some
legislation to ban
Dei in universities so they would they
would be
they would be following the Florida
model so Dei is diversity equity and
inclusion
and
two of our biggest states
have banned it as dangerous
in in universities so regular colleges
can still do it now how would you like
to be a Dei
you know head of a Dei market and know
that two states thought it was so
dangerous they had to make it illegal
well yeah how would you process that
would you say to yourself well there's
two stupid States
48 are smart but two are stupid
is that how you would to think of it
or would you say to yourself
maybe I should look into why they did
that
you know it's one thing to disagree
right people disagree all the time on
politics but it's illegal
that's a whole different level of a
disagreeing it's illegal you can't even
do it if you're in a University at least
in Florida
and Texas is trying to make that the
case
I don't know I I feel that that would
have an impact on my career decisions
huh
do I want us to keep working on this
thing that two responsible States two of
our bigger ones have decided is so
dangerous it can't even be an option
can't even be an option even if you want
it it's too dangerous
they should at least look into why that
is why why people think that
as you know the house is trying to expel
Adam Schiff for being the biggest liar
uh the biggest liar in Congress
which I laughed when I thought of saying
it
imagine being the biggest liar in your
neighborhood
right if you are the biggest the biggest
liar in your entire neighborhood
well it probably wouldn't be that bad
I mean you probably don't have that many
liars in your neighborhood how about the
biggest liar in your whole zip code
well that'd probably be a pretty big
liar
you know if you knew somebody was the
biggest liar in your entire zip code
well that'd be
a lot of lion probably
but Adam Schiff is the biggest liar
in Congress
I don't that's sort of like being you
know Michael Jordan it's like a whole
other level of
worst liar in the world
bigger than the biggest one in your
entire zip code and will they kick him
out of Congress for lying
I don't see how they can
how in the world can you kick people out
of Congress for lying
oh
just the idea of it is funny
because that's all they do for a living
I don't know if it was ever different it
was ready was there any time in the 50s
or something where we imagined things
were awesome but they really weren't
was there any time when Congress was
anything but light
I don't even know if you could get
elected if you told the truth it's like
a it's a group of professional Liars so
a group of professional Liars
believe they can expel one of their
members for lying too well
now I do think you should be expelled
but obviously how any I don't see any
possibility that that could happen
with the Congress big what it is
but at least we get to talk about it and
that's better than nothing
um
Glenn Greenwald is back to work after
his tragic family situation his husband
passed away if he didn't hear about that
which was uh horrible
especially because of the young family
situation
um so somehow that struck me as
more tragic than a lot of things in the
news I don't know there's just something
about that that really got me
um so
but anyway Glenn grudwald is back to his
combatitive self
um he was talking about the corporate
media
and there was a new survey that he was
horrificing off
but he points out how
if you if you look at Americans American
opinions of what is true and what is not
true
there are three gigantic stories that
Americans believe are true
or they have a belief about these three
big stories I'll mention them that that
according to Glenn Greenwald the the
mainstream press just treats them like
they don't exist
the three stories are the Russia
collusion hoax you know the story being
it's the hoax and we know that now the
hunter laptop hoax which we know is a
hoax by the Intel people and the Hunter
and uh and Joe Biden's dealings overseas
with whatever sketchy Pavements were
happening there and so
greenwald's point is that the American
public overwhelmingly believes that
Russia collusion was fake and that it
was a plan by the Democrats the American
public does Believe by a big majority
that the hunter laptop was real
and that the government tried to tell
you it wasn't
and that Hunter and Joe have some
questions to answer about their their
dealings overseas so the majority of
America cares about these three stories
and as Greenwald points out the media
doesn't disagree with them
it just tries to act like they're not
there
which is just mind-boggling
the fact that we could just sort of
act like maybe it doesn't matter and
then then because our opinions are
assigned by the media nobody's assigning
an opinion that you should care and so
you don't
if you're a Democrat
well the house is coming up with this
fentanyl bill now fentanyl of course has
always been illegal if you're dealing it
in the streets but the trouble was that
the dealers kept tweaking the compounds
in it to make it technically different
than the illegal one that was specified
and so now Congress is uh trying to
tighten that up so that any form of
fentanyl even if you've tweaked it would
be illegal forever
sound like a good idea
do you favor that the Congress should
change it so if it's fentanyl it's
fentanyl it doesn't matter if you
tweaked a few compounds it's still
fentanyl so it's still illegal I see
somebody says no no you don't agree with
that
or you want it to be legal that might be
a different different argument all right
well yes it seems like if you're going
to make it illegal you should do it
right
um and there's a thing that I always
criticize people for criticizing but I'm
going to do it
why'd that take so long
does this seem like a story of Congress
doing the right thing
because it doesn't look like that to me
how many years have we known this
problem existed
years right probably four or five years
we've known that the bad guys were
changing the formula to make it legal
because we knew they were doing it in
China
that's why China says oh well there's
nothing we can do we keep making it
illegal but then they keep making a
slightly different version what are we
going to do nothing we can do you know
we always knew that was fake because of
course they could do it they just had to
do what our Congress is doing and saying
you can't change a few compounds and
call it a new thing if it's still
basically Fentanyl so
to me this is an admission of massive
incompetence of our Congress
the fact that it took years to plug the
most obvious hole You you could ever
plug which is a few molecules doesn't
change it
why is this taking you so long now the
thing I criticize when people say the
things like I just said is everything
you want to happen takes too long
doesn't it there's nothing good
this should not have happened sooner so
I mock people who say well why didn't
you do it sooner because it's just the
universal thing
but this fentanyl thing is just is kind
of unique
there was probably everybody involved
knew that this hold needed to be plugged
they knew how to do it you know you just
have some legislation just write it up
and it took this long it took years
I mean to me this is just
a kind of fashion of massive massive
incompetence in Congress massive I mean
it's like it's hard even to hold in my
mind the level of incompetence
that which they would try to make sense
at all illegal know that they had failed
because this Tweaky of compound stuff
and then just let a ride for a few years
I I don't even know how to describe that
level of incompetence is beyond what my
brain can even hold and I can hold a lot
of incompetence in there
I do it for a living
all right anyway so there are now three
prominent voices at least and maybe you
can list some more who want to use the
military to attack the cartels in Mexico
so Dan Crenshaw has apparently been
appointed to so speaker McCarthy put him
in charge of a high profile task force
to figure out effective strategies
against the cartels
so
that makes me happy again you could say
what took you so long but I think maybe
that had to do with the nature of the
house
so now that we have the house
you have a house that is going to be
more aggressive about fentanyl do you
think Dan Crenshaw is the right person
to be leading that high pro profile task
force
because I know there's a lot of there's
a lot of uh critics of him
I'm going to say yes
I'm going to say yes because he has the
military experience
do you want somebody who doesn't have
military that specific kind of military
experience
I mean that seems pretty important to me
and I I always prefer a military person
recommending War
especially one who had you know an
injury
so
if somebody who's actually been in war
says you know I hate War don't do War
but you got to do it this time that's a
little more credible to me it's a little
more credible
so I like I think he has the right
choice you know if this Congress doesn't
have an infinite number of people to put
on anything they've got to use the
people they got
he has the highest I think his eyes
profile
with also the right resume for the job
I think that's a good that feels like a
good move by McCarthy
um so now we know that Trump wants to
attack the cartels militarily uh Vivek
ramaswamy maybe more prominent than the
others in terms of how often he brings
it up and he's saying it too now here's
some of the pushback I got
my God you can't attack a neighboring
country
you know what will the what will the
Mexican military think and how can you
deal with your neighboring countries
like that well the first thing I would
like to suggest is nobody's saying
attack the country
nobody's saying attack the Mexican
military or the government buildings
for 99.9 percent of all Mexicans they
wouldn't be aware there was a war on the
cartels
yeah the the cartel
sites presumably would be attacked maybe
there would be some kind of Black Ops
assassination campaign that was going on
but most people wouldn't even know there
was a war
you just wake up do what you always do
go back to bed again
there wouldn't be any bombs in your
neighborhood
right they're going to go after
uh well identified cartel Setters and
Laboratories and stuff presumably it's
not going to be so it's not going to be
some general War
so everybody who who says you can't go
to war with Mexico nobody's going to war
with Mexico
is on our side at least you know the
population they're out fighting us they
want they want to come here and be us
the Mexicans are as interested in being
us
as opposed to fighting us it's just the
cartels
so I don't know what that would look
like but I'm glad everybody's talking
about it now
so there's a new survey out about how
many Americans believe in God
it's a little murky because you know how
you ask the question gives you a
different answer but uh according to
let's see who did this uh survey by the
University of Chicago some research
organization there that not quite 50
Americans say they have no doubt about
the existence of God
so 50 percent
are sure that God exists
and the other 50 are either not sure or
presumably some of them are sure he
doesn't exist
um or she
don't want to give a pronoun to God I
could get in trouble for that
but uh
do you think this is going to be a
continuing trend
so there's been a long a long-term Trend
and I guess the believe it or not the
pandemic actually accelerated
the uh the reduction in religious belief
but do you think this trend is uh is
going to be a good not good but let's
say a long-term Trend and that religion
will continue to decrease
or or at least maybe
um
maybe the strictest interpretations of
religion
you know maybe they're the ones that are
at risk
yeah do you I remember when I was a kid
it seemed like Newt Gingrich and all the
conservative Christians were the ones
running everything
because there were there were enough of
them
that since they operated as a block
often it seemed like the they had a lot
of power didn't they the religious right
you never hear about them anymore do you
ever hear about the religious right
it's like it's not even a thing anymore
but I guess the numbers for that went
from like a quarter of the country down
to the teens
yeah the Moral Majority right the Moral
Majority exactly
so basically they're half as big as they
were
yeah the event the Evangelical type I'm
not sure specifically
evangelicals but the but the people sort
of in that camp
they're only half as many of them as
when I was a kid or when I was younger
so there was some kind of a trend
happening what do you think is behind
that what do you think is causing that
trend
if you had to say what is behind it
because I I wouldn't say that the
mainstream media is behind it usually
they are behind stuff like this it
doesn't seem like mainstream media
because they don't say any anti-religion
stuff I mean Bill Maher is the only one
I can think of who's openly
anti-religion
exactly one person
uh you think you think it's social media
some say it's Satan Satan's doing it but
Satan's been here why is Satan suddenly
winning
like what changed
if you believe that Satan is active what
changed
Satan gets smarter
smartphones but having the smartphones
make you less religious
education
do you think they're getting less of it
in school
oh that's probably true I'll bet they
get lesser than School
yeah that's probably it isn't it
because I'm pretty sure all of my
teachers in school were religious and he
knew it
I think they all were
and you knew it
but if you have a teacher who is not
religious you'd probably know that as
well
I'd probably have some effect on kids
I don't know if that's the answer but
maybe that's part of several variables
that are changing
yeah
lawsuits against the Catholic Church
well it's not just that people are less
likely to go to church which is also
true they're less likely to think
there's an afterlife
so are you interested in what's changing
that because I don't think we know
and that's such a big big fundamental
cultural change shouldn't we should we
know why that's changing I'm not saying
it shouldn't change
maybe you should I don't know it's hard
it's hard to estimate whether that's
helping or hurting but should we know I
mean that is such a fundamental part of
the country
you think just science is doing a better
job so people are picking science that
doesn't seem right
the science is not exactly killing it
lately
lack of humility
all right well I don't think we know but
apparently
um all right I'm gonna I'm gonna offer a
guess here's my guess
I believe that there's a a Breaking
Point
and the breaking point is when Ordinary
People can profess that they are not
religious and there's no there's no uh
pushback
maybe we reached the number of people
like you know if if only one percent of
the country were atheists
they wouldn't talk would they
am I right if only one percent were
atheists and everybody else totally
believed that one percent would shut up
because it wouldn't be safe to give your
opinion but we have sort of gradually
crawled toward a place where you could
run for office and say you don't believe
in God
what do you think do you think you could
run for president in 2024 there is
nobody doing it you wouldn't win just to
be clear you wouldn't win
but I don't know that it would be a
fatal error
yeah I think we've reached a point where
people would say all right you could be
non-binary you can be you know whoever
you want to be and one of those things
you can be is a non-believer
now of course there would be some people
who held that against them and they
could vote based on that but that's the
same way it is for everything right if
somebody's too religious you might hold
that against them too
so I mean we always but but it seems
like it's safe to be a non-believer now
what would you say
is it safe to be a non-believer I think
it is
I don't think you would lose your job
for it would you have you heard of
anybody losing their job because they
didn't believe in God
I mean maybe it happened but I've never
you've heard of it
I haven't heard of that
anyway so maybe it just got a safe to
say you're not a Believer and that could
be it
um Trump and I guess truth social or
suing the Washington poop
you call them the Washington Post but to
me they're the Washington poop
um oh by the way the Washington posts
are collecting their Pulitzer prizes for
all their great work last year
that you know I've told you this story
before but when I learned how the
Pulitzer Prize is awarded
I'd no longer wanted one
you know early in my career I was like
oh if I could win a Pulitzer because
sometimes cartoonists got them I thought
if I could win a Pulitzer that would be
like the feather in my cap you know that
would be the ultimate thing they can't
take that away for you you would always
be a Pulitzer prize-winning cartoonist
if you just win once
so I thought oh I'd sure sure what a win
once
and then I uh I get interviewed by a guy
whose wife
uh I won't mention who it is it's
somebody well known but their wife was
on the uh committee the Pulitzer
committee now there are a number of
little Pulitzer groups that judge
different categories
and do you know what it takes to be on
the Pulitzer judging committee
due to what qualifications you need
ability to read
[Laughter]
that's about it
yeah I I'm not even sure how they select
them but basically if you could read
and you have an opinion you're on the
committee
so it's literally nothing but a little
group of people sitting around a room or
zooming with each other and saying what
book did you like
of the ones submitted oh I like this one
would you like oh I like this one and
then whoever gets the most likes from
that little group of randomly selected
people
they decide that one gets the Pulitzer
is there anything that means less to you
than that
now uh you've seen award shows where
whenever it's the uh
it's the audience is the ones who votes
the actors are always they always talk
about it it's like yeah this means more
to me because this comes from the public
if the public votes for you to get an
award
that probably means quite a bit
if if a little group of Judges votes for
you to get an award
it doesn't mean much at all
it really doesn't it just means a little
group of people picked you
it almost has no meaning whatsoever but
anyway
so much about that
um
but uh Trump does true socialist so we
assuming the Washington Post for 3.78
billion they're complaint is that the
Washington Post has been doing what they
would call some hit pieces on them
and it's been on a years-long crusade
they say
against the truth I guess the parent
company uh characterized by saying that
there were concealing relevant
information and
I don't know some various wrongdoing
about what securities fraud
so apparently true social is confident
enough
that they did not do any of these crimes
which The Washington Post was suggesting
they did but they could assumed for 3.78
billion
what if that worked
we put the Washington Post on a business
wouldn't it
because I can't imagine they could pay
that or any version of it
so
so this is actually an existential
threat isn't it
a true socialist trying to take out the
Washington Post
you know as we as we were in the run-up
to the 2024 election
you realize that the election left TV
and came to your your house right
like people like me who think we're just
talking about the news we'll just take
it out yeah just get canceled
The Washington Post could just get
canceled
but you know if you imagine that somehow
the lawsuit goes the truth social way I
don't know if it will they're probably
just warning them off
but I suppose it did
they would take the Washington Post off
the chessboard
do you know what a big blow that would
be to the CIA and the Democrats
that that's like their uh their Crown
Jewel that's where they they push their
fake news
that the Washington Post Its primary uh
purpose is to launder fake news into
credible news
let me say it again the primary purpose
of the Washington Post
is the launder fake news into real news
because they have a reputation that
they're a real news entity
and so if they say it's real they're
believe their readers say oh I guess
maybe that's real
um but I don't think it's been a news
Organization for a long time
I think it's just a uh fake news
laundering organization at this point
do you remember uh when they canceled me
so they canceled the Dilbert com the
Washington posted do you remember when
they called me to find out
yeah what was the context of my
situation
no they didn't they didn't call me to
check out the context
after a 30-year successful business uh
uh partnership in which they'd carried
my comic to great success
they didn't even ask
what was going on
didn't even ask
that's because it didn't matter
it really didn't matter because they're
not in the business of being credible or
well they're in the business of looking
credible
so I believe that I was just one more
chess piece taken off the board if if
Republicans had cared about what I said
then I would probably be saying oh I
think it's what I said
but given that only Democrats cared
is there anything else you need to know
only Democrats scared there were some
people who didn't hear the whole story
who might have cared but of people who
heard the whole story it was just
Democrats
it was purely political in the end it
was purely political
all right
um I'm watching the Biden Administration
once again do the uh
the same trick that the Democrats do
with reparations
they try to bribe with other people's
money
so they tried to bribe the students by
delaying their requirement to start
paying back the loans
yeah at least through the pandemic but
it looks like they won't be able to
delay it anymore and those loans will
come due
that is really bad for Biden
because I'm pretty sure he was depending
on continuing to bribe young people and
now he can't bribe them anymore with
their student loans
so that's the bigger story is what's
that going to do vote wise
but I love the fact that the Democrats
have this pattern of promising people
money that they can't possibly give to
them reparations oh yeah
why don't you come back with a
recommendation
uh student loans oh we'll delay those
you don't have to pay any student loans
as long as you keep electing Democrats
well maybe you do have to pay
all right
let's talk about the story in the press
that is the least credible story
I've seen lately
that Epstein was maybe
blackmailing Bill Gates
because Epstein knew that Bill Gates had
a young girlfriend
who played Bridge some Russian young
young Russian girlfriend and the the
rumor comes from one message from
Epstein to Gates
in Bill Gates in which Epstein mentioned
you wanted some repayment
because Epstein had paid for the young
woman to go get some coding classes
because she had talked to Epstein about
funding her startup for this bridge
startup
now
just because Epstein said to Bill Gates
you know you owe me money to pay this
back because it's your girlfriend
basically he didn't say the girlfriend
part
um that has been taken
as evidence that Epstein was
sort of uh cleverly and subtly
blackmailing Bill Gates by mentioning
that he knows about Bill Gates's
girlfriend
and then people said oh that's how he
blackmails people
so he finds out their dirty little
secrets and they just sort of mentions
them before he asks them for money or to
donate to his funds or whatever
now
I don't think this is enough
do you think that's enough
I'm not I'm not defending Bill Gates
I'm just saying you know innocent until
proven guilty and all that but do you
think that one message that said you
know you should pay me back for paying
for a coding school now the weird thing
is they were both so rich that that
amount of money or something that
normally they would not ask each other
for like a billionaire doesn't ask
somebody to pay him back ten thousand
dollars
do they
if you were a billionaire would you ask
your billionaire friend to reimburse you
ten thousand dollars or would you just
say ah let it go let it ride
I think you wouldn't even care
so it seemed weirdly who is asking for
the money
and that's why people would say oh I
wasn't really asking for the money
it was reminding him that he knows about
his girlfriend to like soften him up to
get what he wants
baby
but
what exactly is the uh the Bill Gates
crime here besides having a girlfriend
which everybody knew
yeah I don't know to me that's kind of
thin
but I don't discount it don't discount
it it does look a little bit blackmaily
but you have to connect a lot of dots
into your mind
that aren't in the story to be sure
about it
so but I would like to uh
dovetail on that topic to this question
everybody seems to want this Epstein
list
why would there be a list
who believes there's a list
so what I said this on social media let
me tell you the answers I got some
people said Scott of course there's a
list there was references to the little
black address books
so he had a little black address books
do you think that anybody in the address
books was not a sex criminal
or was it an address book of only sex
criminal uh contacts
don't you think he also had a general a
general address book
all right then other people said
Scott you already have the slight logs
and since you know that nothing happened
on that island Epstein's Island that was
legal
the flight logs is all you need if they
went to the island they're guilty
is that a standard you're okay with that
all the women who went to the island
were sex criminals
does that even make sense are there that
many adult women in government who are
sex criminals
probably not
probably not if we're men I'd say well
maybe but women
probably not
um some others said
um okay there's not there's not an
actual list
but the the FBI could pull one together
because they've got the the CDs and the
the computer records and they've got
everything from the the black little
address books to everything else and
they could create a list
could they
could they
they could create a list from the
evidence they have well if they haven't
if they had evidence of specific people
doing sex crimes
do you think they're setting up
or or is it more likely that they don't
have enough Goods on anybody to actually
win a case they just suspect there was
something going on
well here's what I think if you're a
high-end blackmailer you do not make a
list of the people you're blackmailing
do you know why
answer to this why would you not make a
list that is exclusively a list of the
people you're blackmailing
why would you not make that list
because if somebody found the list
they would
they would
blackmail you
you'd have to be the worst blackmailer
in the world
to leave a list that you could be
blackmailed for having
I mean you know there are dumb criminals
but did Epstein look like a dumb
criminal I mean you use the very
definition of a smart criminal but you
think there's a list
of just of just the people he's
blackmailing
oh he's got a list
of people he has contacts with and
probably every single person in his
address book is somebody who would like
to Blackmail
probably he would have liked to
Blackmail all of them but there's no way
you can know if the list is just
somebody he knows then he thinks maybe
someday he could blackmail but he
doesn't have anything on him
versus people he has black males he
would just commit that to memory
now they might have a list of the girls
that they're trafficking
because he wouldn't know them by name
necessarily and you have to keep track
of them and you know since Giselle
probably had a list of the girls
but but the list of the clients
you think he would keep a list of
clients
how many of them do you think they were
I mean don't you think he could remember
you know 30 to 50 of famous people
I I think he could remember what 50
famous people did
without any prompts
you wouldn't have to put him on a list
can't you remember everybody you ever
had sex with
there are some things you remember
if you found out that you know
uh Bill Gates was receiving a rusty
Sanchez
would you ever forget it
no no there's some things you don't need
to write down because you would never
forget them
so
uh that I asked to uh I did a little
Twitter poll I said how many of you
would be in favor of of producing
something like a Client List however you
put it together
if you knew for sure that it would be
innocent people on the list
would you be in favor of the public
seeing the list if you knew for sure
they were all guilty
and over 60 percent of the people who
answered said yes
they'd want to see a list
including people who are not guilty
who would be considered from the from
the moment the list was published would
all be considered Guilty by the public
sixty percent
of the people who answered that said
yeah they're still worth it because the
people who are innocent they can explain
why there isn't
that is so not how things work in
America
in America you don't
put people on again on a probably guilty
list and then make them defend
themselves
that's messed up
right so I'm actually against
a list being produced but I'm certainly
in favor of
if the FBI have evidence to convict any
individuals of course
of course
but I don't want to see a list of that's
a mixture of totally innocent people
that maybe he wanted to Blackmail later
mixed in with a list of pedophiles
no no not in America in America I don't
want to see that list ever
ever ever not even after the people are
dead I don't want to say that list
because they still have families
so
I think you need to check your thinking
on that
and the standard that I would want to
suggest to you is if you were if you
were one of the people who was innocent
but he had you in a list of addresses
because he did some charity work and he
seemed to know everybody famous
do you think that would be fair if you
were on that list
anybody
see I mean you have to do the shoe on
the other foot test on this one the
dershus test you just have to do the
shoe on the other foot because you can't
make standards for your fellow citizens
that you would not be willing to suffer
yourself
if you think you'd be okay
being on a list of pedophiles when
you're innocent if you're okay with that
well all right then your opinion is
consistent if you're not okay with that
and I'm definitely not okay with that
then maybe you should say innocent until
proven guilty and let the FBI go after
individuals if they have evidence
we do worry that the FBI is not doing
their job which is actually a good
question
now there were some people when I
mentioned this stuff online
who thought it would be really clever
that since I was bringing up the topic
they could suggest that maybe the reason
I don't want to see the list is that I'm
on it
that's not funny
and I will block you forever
and it doesn't matter
if you thought it was a joke if you
think it's funny
you may think is funny but you also
would be blocked forever and there's no
coming back right I'm not going to
change my mind if you say that in public
on Twitter you're not coming
back
you understand that
so I just want to be clear
I I can take a joke
but that's not funny
that's not funny at all
right
um
let's talk about Soros
so I've been tracking this weird story
trying to understand why this Soros
think these liberal prosecutors are
better when it's so obvious that they're
destroying the country
and here's the best answer I have Soros
in Soros owned words he said that the
data is on his side
and he says that the cities in which the
progressive prosecutors have been hired
have a lower crime rate
after after the progressive people are
in there lower crime rate not higher
lower
so I'm waiting for the comments
but you know that's right
because the reason the crime is lower is
that they're not arresting people
they're just not arresting people
now if it's also true that violent crime
went down
that might actually be true depending on
when the study was taken because
violence spiked during the pandemic
but didn't it or do I have that
backwards did violence Spike during the
pandemic pandemic
violent murders and stuff
or do I have that backwards
right the murder rates
so here's my here's my point none of us
believe that that data could be true
because that it the the data that says
that the progressive people letting
people in a jail
ends up with lower crime
is only because they're not charging
them
right you're all on the same page right
the data couldn't possibly be useful
because if you stop charging people with
crimes then the data shows there was no
crime but has nothing to do with how
much crime there was it's just that
you're not keeping the records anymore
now apparently there was only one study
that Soros looks at to defend his
position and it was some brief little
study that I don't think anybody knows
anything about
so here's my point
instead of calling him Satan
which buys you nothing
how about going after his data
you know is there no one who could fund
let's say a proper study
to somehow try to capture the fact that
people are not being charged and
whatever else is not being picked up by
the survey we saw to actually find out
what the data says
because if it turns out that not
punishing people for a crime
gives you less crime
well I'm going to be pretty surprised
but I'd like to know that I mean that
would be a shocking impossible to
imagine result
but hey I'm open I'm open to an argument
you know could be wrong the reason we do
data is because you can't just look at
stuff and know what's going to happen
that's the reason you look at data
because you don't know just by looking
at it
so
I would suggest that you knock off the
anti-semitic wants to conquer the world
he's just evil wants to destroy the
fabric of America and go after the data
just just create a stronger data story
and see if you can sell it but it makes
me think that the data doesn't
back the anti-soros view where we
already would have seen it
unless it's just impossible to gather
the data I don't know
but I would love to see you sorosaurus
son defend that point of view
to actually say yes we know this is
working
because of the the study
the data says it's working and so we're
going to keep doing it because it's
really working
but apparently there's only one study
if there's only one study and it goes
their way that's the end of the story
you have no argument if they're using
the data
to make their decisions so you're going
to have to fix the data fix the data by
you know doing a study
um you want us to work well somebody
should so if there's so many people who
are sure that uh
the Soros is destroying the country and
I'm one of them by the way I'm not
defending Soros it does seem to me he's
destroying the country
like this seems really obvious to me
that he's destroying the country
I just need to know why
and if it turns out it's really because
of the data
then that's where the battle should be
the battle should be over the data
and if you think that the problem is
something about him
Maybe
but I wouldn't start there I'd start
with the argument he's making and see if
you can counter the argument he's making
if you're not going to argue that his
data is wrong and all you're going to do
is say oh he's he's part of the world
you know alleged Jewish conspiracies
trying to destroy the world I can read
his mind in his evil Lee Satan and he's
trying to make up for his youth helping
the Nazis I don't know maybe
Maybe
but if he's starting with the data and
you're ignoring the data
you're not really taking the fight to
him are you
you should take the fight to him where
the fight is with the data
all right
then if he ignores the data that's
stronger than his data well then you
have to go to
whatever is phase two
but I feel like you skipped to phase
three where you're condemning him for
being Satan without questioning the data
first
which I I don't think the date is true
all right
um
you would not be surprised to know that
AI is already composing music and it can
take two genres and put them together
so you can say uh write me a new uh
Nirvana song even though Kurt Cobain is
is dead and I listened to the AI written
Nirvana song
put on my headphones because I wanted to
really you know listen to see if it was
doing right
and I found myself listening to the
entire song
do you know why
it was pretty good
it's pretty good
yeah I I couldn't
I I feel like I wouldn't have been able
to know if a computer had generated it
I thought that it
um it the pattern of a song well
enough that there were definitely Parts
I was grooving to
so it wasn't just oh that sounds like
him I was actually head bobbin I I was
getting into it
I listened to it several times
and then I saw Brian romelli Romel I
always pronounce his last name wrong
sorry about that
um he did a mashup in which he uh
he said
do the Beach Boys song Godly knows but
do it as if the Beatles were performing
it
and suddenly you listen to it it's
actually it sounds just like the Beatles
performing a beach boy song
and it sounded just like the Beatles
now
the first thing that I say as a creative
person is hey it's not creative
all it's doing is mashing together
things that are known but can it create
a new thing because even the new thing
it wrote for Nirvana was obviously
derivative
you know yes Nirvana did nothing but
create new albums like AI created
they wouldn't be famous for very long
right so they would have to innovate and
change the way the Beatles did I mean
the Beatles early music completely
different from their later music so
humans humans are adding mistakes and
experimentations and stuff
so at least the humans have a little
advantage
because here's what I wouldn't want to
listen to Forever
suppose AI said I could give you
infinite Beatles music
it'll all be new every day it'll be a
new song but it'll be in their Style
how long would that stay interesting
would you say to yourself I love the
Beatles now I got a new one every day
or would it all start to sound a little
too alike
a little too similar
because I think it ends up being generic
I think it would turn music into
elevator music eventually
and the only humans have the the flaws
and the emotion and the the
you know the propensity to air
and it's sort of the errors that make it
interesting
you know I've said this before when I
was learning to play drums
I thought I was hitting the drums
exactly as they should be hit but it
didn't sound like music
and really you have to play it wrong to
make it sound right you know adding the
stank or the attitude or the funk those
are all things that are basically
changing your timing from perfect
to less than perfect but somehow it's
better
is the less than perfect part that makes
us feel human and gives it that energy
so I don't know if you know maybe AI
could do that too maybe AI could say oh
I need to put some errors in there to
make it sound good
but I think humans will still be
creating new things faster than machines
for a while
because we can test it on ourselves I
say this all the time when I'm thinking
of a new idea I'm also instantly testing
it on my body
do I Bob my head if it's music
or do I not Bob my head right yeah do I
laugh if it's a joke or do I not laugh
now a I can't do that it can say I think
this is the form of a joke but again
tested against its own sense of humor
so
until that happens you know real
humorous is going to have an advantage
all right
um
here's my suggestion about
AGI Advanced general intelligence that's
one we're afraid of
so we're afraid of the AI That's like a
actual sentient thinking entity
but here's what makes a human a sentient
entity
that we're thinking all the time even
when we're not doing a task
will AI think all the time
the AI that we occur you currently use I
feel like it doesn't do anything until I
ask you something
then it does it and then it comes back
and then it's idle it's not sitting
there thinking oh why doesn't he ask me
a question
it doesn't have any kind of loop of
self-inspection right
but if we build a artificial general
intelligence
the only way I would be afraid of it
is if it could sit there and think
on its own
in other words when you're not using it
is it processing and and thinking about
how its ideas fit together
is it thinking how it will answer the
question if it's asked will it come up
with some hypotheticals and some
imagination well it's just sitting there
if it does it's dangerous
would you agree
if it just sits there and thinks without
humans asking it for a task it's
dangerous
but if it only responds to tasks by
doing the task
is a little bit dangerous
but not end of humanity dangerous
so you can see how for example it would
turn off your your energy grid
accidentally
but not because I thought about it
not because it thought oh humans are bad
machines are good kill all humans that's
the part that you should never never
program into it so where I'm heading
with this is we're all trying to think
how we can create legislation
that would keep you from making the AI
that would destroy the world
and I think the simplest legislation
would be you can't build an AI that
thinks independently
it can only do things
so it can do things all day long
but it can't just think
have you ever heard anybody bring that
up
because I haven't heard anybody frame it
that way
I'm only afraid of it if it can think
when it's alone
think about it just consider that model
I don't know if this is a good idea or
not because I'd have to know a lot more
about AI to know that but
commonsensically
I'm not going to be afraid of something
that gives me a a good Google result
or summarizes an article
right because as soon as it's done
summarizing the article it has no
thoughts about the article has no
thoughts about me
has no thoughts about what it did or why
I asked it to do anything it has no
thoughts
as long as it has no thoughts
I'm safe
or or at least the danger comes down to
you know one percent of what we imagine
and I don't know that anybody would want
to build a machine that could think
why would you do that
all it would do is you'd be creating
artificial suffering
you can actually create a machine that
suffers
because it would look at its own
thoughts and start to come up with maybe
mental health problems you might
actually invent poor Mental Health
in in a computer
so is there any reason that your
computer needs to think
when you're not using it
can you think of any utility for that
other than making it dangerous
there's no utility to it
as long as we keep the AI just do my
task and then rest until you have
another task I think we're fine it may
be as simple as that
all right
um
but I'm also going to allow that if
anybody who knows AI is listening to
this they may be slapping their faces
and saying no why are you saying you're
so stupid he's ignoring the biggest
risks
and maybe I am
but if somebody could easily explain
them to me I would be smarter
all right
um
do you believe that the Durham report
told you
that Obama and Biden both knew that
Clinton was Hillary was going to do the
Russia collusion hoax knew it was fake
knew it was a hoax
and listened to it in the room and then
either okayed it or we're fine with it
they didn't stop it do you believe that
happened
because the Durham report suggested that
happened right or at least they were in
the room when it was discussed
I didn't talk about back move yet
um
I believe it
yeah I'm not 100 sure
but I believe it
and
have you noticed that there's no
consequences for that
so somehow we're acting
as though that was just business as
usual
that the president and the vice
president
okayed the biggest
disinformation operation
that the United States has seen that we
know of
and it was basically a coup
it was essentially a coup attempt
and that we just know it
we know it and we're just not doing
anything about it
because there's no specific law that was
broken is that why
why in the world are we complacent about
that why is that not the biggest story
that we're it's the only thing you're
talking about every single day it's
because it's not Trump
that's the only reason right
if any of this had been Trump imagine
imagine if we knew for sure
that Trump and Don Jr cooked up the
biggest hoax in American history
what if you knew that for sure like we
know that Obama and Biden were part of
the the origins of it
can you imagine it being ignored
it's all you talk about
it's so weird that the mainstream Media
or whoever is behind everything
it's so amazing that they can make you
not care about the most important things
in the world
and they can do it easily
just don't put it in the news
if they don't put it in the news we're
trained to think it's not important so
that's all they have to do just I'll put
it in the news end the story it's the
easiest thing in the world
and who's going to prosecute right
all right um
I saw at a music exchange with on
Twitter
and which David sacks had some opinions
about how things were going over there
in Bach Moot and otherwise and somebody
mocked him online
for saying that he's never let anybody
into battle and he's no military expert
now David sacks not being the average
Twitter user
uh he responded by saying that not being
part of the military industrial complex
is actually an advantage in analyzing
military situations
now I don't have a mic to drop so I'm
gonna I'm gonna unhook this one
just so I can drop it
come on
seriously
all right I'd like to repeat his line
actually not being part of the military
industrial complex probably makes you a
better analyst
yeah
there we go I had to drop that break
because it's true
it's funny because it's true
it's totally true the the military
industrial complex are paid Liars
they're paid
indirectly they're paid
to lie
so so this guy is arguing that you
should get the good information from the
people who are paid
to lie
not not the person who's proven that
he's a excellent analyst of world events
no not that guy who has nothing to gain
he's just an internet dad basically
trying to trying to help us think better
no I think I would I think I would take
David sack's military
military opinion of which he has no
experience
over the experts absolutely yeah we
don't live in a world where that doesn't
make sense
double negative
all right so um here's the update on Bak
moot
as you know the Russians have claimed
that they've completely captured bakmut
but the ukrainians are quite Plucky and
they insist that they still control a
pile of rubble that's approximately uh I
think it's about
six feet in diameter
and goes to almost four feet in in
height
um
so
that's why Ukraine controls that
pile of rubble
but hey hey they still control that pile
of rubble and they're going to turn
things around any moment now they're
they have their eye on
it might be a little premature
but they have their eye on
another pile of rubble
yeah they actually think that they could
maybe consolidate their control over the
little pile of rubble that's six feet by
three feet tall but they're looking at a
pile of rubble that's nearly eight feet
tall
nearly eight feet tall
and they think they can take it and the
new Rebel has a diameter of almost 20
feet
so if you added those together
the the six foot diameter pile of rubble
that the Ukraine says they control I
mean I don't know for sure but they say
they control that little pile of rubble
they could almost triple the pile of
rubble if they were successful in
gaining control of the other Rubble
what the hell is going on
the the whole Ukraine situation has
become so absurd
that anything anything you say about
them sounds like a joke
just talking normally about Ukraine
sounds like you're joking right parity
and reality have merged
that we don't know what we're fighting
for exactly but it's really expensive
and we're pretty sure we're winning
it's all nuts it's completely nuts
all right
they lost you as Sean pebb
okay that's a old reference
yeah so we we understand Baku is
tactically significant so there's
nothing there but anymore
but it is the it is sort of the front
door to larger attacks that seems to be
the case
all right
why don't we ever see video from the
Ukraine war
good question now I do see video
but it's Ukrainian propaganda where the
Ukrainian soldiers are all very happy to
be there
have you noticed the ukrainians are
singing and dancing and laughing
and and they're all big the ukrainians
are all like six feet tall but if they
capture a Russian and that's on the
video the Russian will weigh 85 pounds
they'll be surrounded by you know
several Ukrainian military people who
were like six foot four
the ukrainians are really good with the
propaganda
they make it look like their soldiers
are just delighted
delighted to be there all volunteers
I'm not sure that's exactly what's going
on
yeah and then the Russia propaganda is
just as good
the Russian Liberation people are
currently invading Belgrade
what
yes it's all propaganda from both sides
there's nothing we can believe
uh Malcolm Nance came back he survived
all right
but now we're hearing that those f-16s
are going to make that much difference
so one from they gotta have f-16s it'll
make all the difference too yeah yeah
f-16s aren't going to make that much
difference for a variety of reasons
all right
um
YouTube
that's all for today I'm going to talk
to the locals people
who are special
and thanks for joining
see you tomorrow
