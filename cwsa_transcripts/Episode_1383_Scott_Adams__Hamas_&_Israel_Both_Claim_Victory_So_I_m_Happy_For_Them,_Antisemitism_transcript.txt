try this again with no technical
difficulties
first live stream died so you missed the
simultaneous sip if you were waiting for
that
but you can do it at home on your own
um and now we're back
so wait for a few seconds for people to
pour in because i know you want to i was
just saying that i
ate out for the first time without a
mask yesterday at any point
part of the process and it was
delightful it was delightful
so i saw a story that says the uh
the guards in the epstein jail where
epstein died
they have admitted falsifying records
but i don't recall ever seeing what they
falsified did anybody see that
and did it make any difference and does
that have anything to do with who killed
him
so that's a weird story because it feels
like it should be important but
maybe it isn't who cares
um
so i guess fauci has dr fauci has said
that by july 4th
70 of americans should be vaccinated
that's the target and if they are we're
going to be in pretty pretty good shape
now july 4th as i told you
probably the day that americans just say
well we're gonna we're gonna thank you
andrew
we're just gonna make up our own
decision about masks and i'm going to
skip ahead i was going to talk about
this later but
um there's a great great article
in the atlantic there's a sentence i've
never said before
have i ever said there was a great
article in the atlantic
so the atlantic is not really a credible
publication but derek thompson
who turns out to be a really good writer
so if you want to just see good writing
just somebody who can put together good
sentences and make a point
derek thompson is really good and he
wrote
an article talking about the mask
mandate changes
and in texas in particular but then
extended the point
so apparently the when the governor
removed
the mask mandate in texas people were
predicting oh no
it's gonna be doom because we'll all get
infected with our masks
but in fact that did not happen and the
infections and deaths continued to go
down
now what derek asks is why
why what is the reason that when texas
got rid of the mask
mandate keyword mandate
why was there no increase in
uh infections or yeah why did things
keep going down
and the answer is two possibilities
as derek points out number one maybe
masks
never worked maybe maybe they were just
always a placebo
but as derek points out by pointing to a
number of studies
the experts are still pretty unanimous
i mean close to unanimous the masks
do make a difference you just they don't
make much difference outdoors they don't
make much difference
if you're vaccinated or a kid but in the
right situation masks work
so the science still strongly suggests
that masks work so what would be the
other possibility
that getting rid of mask mandates would
cause
infections not to go up in the comments
you want to take a guess before i give
you the answer
and the answer is totally non-intuitive
most of you believe mass don't work but
let's say the the scientists say they do
just for argument
uh
i i i never know what to do when i'm
talking to a wall of skeptics
maybe it doesn't make any difference
well somebody just tipped me five
dollars to take a sip
because apparently if you missed the
first part of the
livestream where i had to restart you
missed your simultaneous hip and i know
you need it
so here you go are you ready
simultaneous zip coming at you
that would be the makeup backup sip
just as good as the original um
but here's the second reason that maybe
the mask mandate changes had no
impact on results and it goes like this
nobody paid attention to the government
that's right when you look at states who
had mask mandates and then they
they removed them the people didn't
change
nobody did anything differently the
people who liked masks
kept wearing them the people who were
not wearing masks and were
you know bending the rules kept bending
them
the businesses for the most part that
were going to require them
some did some didn't the ones that
didn't probably were the ones that were
smart
you know like let's say a big box store
people aren't that close
so basically what we learned is that the
government
didn't have much to do with it and do
you recall
the the most i would i would say one of
my most
counterintuitive uh predictions
from last year and i knew
i knew this one was looking good but i
didn't think anybody would agree with me
my prediction was that we would never be
able to untangle
whether leadership in one place one
state or one country
was good or bad that we would we
actually wouldn't be able to tell
if the decisions made by the government
even made a difference and that there
are so many variables
that government leadership which you
would think would be the biggest one
might not even be discoverable in the
data you might not even see any effect
and apparently that's what we're seeing
so a year later after i said that
leadership wouldn't even show up in the
data
leadership isn't showing up in the data
even with masks you know basic thing
so um i'm still open to the possibility
that masks work
so little or in such special cases that
maybe it didn't make that much
difference to the overall pandemic you
don't really know
but i do think this science is quite
unified in saying that they do work
if you use them in the right situation
um
so uh tom cotton made an interesting uh
remark senator cotton
um he was talking about critical race
theory being taught in the military
and he said this quote if i were in a
foreign intelligence service
i can think of i can think uh a few
things that would be more destructive to
morale and unit cohesion in the united
states military
than critical race theory the idea that
we are somehow simply representatives of
our race
as opposed to american patriots who are
wearing the flag of our country in
defense of
common ideals now that's a lot of words
to say what he's saying
i think i might have paired a few of
those words off of there
but it's a really good point
isn't it if you were a foreign adversary
and you wanted to destroy the u.s
military
cohesiveness what could you think of
that would be better than critical race
theory
it would be hard to think of something
if you were intentionally trying to
damage the military
i don't know if you could think of a
better idea than that
which makes me wonder did they
did they is critical race theory
actually being
promoted by our adversaries and we don't
know it
and if they're not promoting it why
wouldn't they
why wouldn't they it would be the most
obvious
thing you could do to promote the idea
that
you would would cause inner turmoil in
the united states
i can't think of anything that would be
better for china
i can't think of anything that would be
better for russia
to have the united states fighting with
itself about who's the racist
so there was a time maybe
five years ago i would say in my in my
evolution of understanding of the world
five years ago i would have said
yeah i get the point you know i get that
if a foreign adversary was so clever
that they thought they could do this
yeah maybe they'd do it but not really
but in 2021 when we know how easily
a foreign adversary can you know move
the algorithm
can decide what we see can decide what
trends etc i mean i assume they have
that power that's an assumption
um it would be crazy not to do this
that i don't see any chance that china
is not using its you know behind the
scenes
trolls or whatever else they they have
um i can't see that they wouldn't push
critical race theory it's just obvious
that it's bad for the country
from their perspective it's probably
even more obvious
so i'm not saying that's happening but
if it's not
i don't know why i mean it would be hard
to think of a reason it's not happening
so um i told you that july 4th was going
to be
independence day no matter whether the
government told us we were done
or not now i'll use the the texas story
about
the leadership didn't seem to change
what anybody did
it's going to work the other way too
when people are done with
masks we'll tell our government
that's the way it's really going to work
in the real world
the the people are in charge we just
don't always act like it
you know we we're happy to have the
government take over especially in an
emergency
but the reality is that people are in
charge they always have been they
and in this country there's a good
chance that they always will be
especially because of the second
amendment so
i've got a feeling that july 4th will be
independence day
and it won't matter what the government
says just as
the mass mandate being removed didn't
make people wear fewer masks
we're just going to make up our own mind
at this point and i don't think there's
anything wrong with that
in fact i think it's an advantage i'd
like to give a shout out to monica
lewinsky
for winning the internet yesterday with
a tweet
so an account called uberfax asked this
question
i think it was yesterday what's the most
high risk low reward thing you've ever
done
and monica lewinsky retweeted that with
the emoji of two eyeballs just looking
to the side like
what is the most high risk low reward
i've ever done
says monica lewinsky and it was sort of
rarely do you see a perfect tweet
that was a perfect tweet
there's nothing you could have done you
could think all day you could put a
team of scientists together and say
make us a better tweet you know to this
at least on retweet at this point
and you couldn't do it you couldn't do
it monica lewinsky
reached into the void of infinite
possibilities
and pulled out the one of infinity
that was the perfect tweet
congratulations nicely done
and i like the humility of it i like the
sense of humor of it
i've always liked monica lewinsky as a
person
um linda tripp not so much but that's a
different story
well here's the good news uh there's a
ceasefire
between hamas and israel and i don't
think it could have worked out any
better because hamas is claiming victory
and israel is also claiming victory
good job guys um when i saw that there
was fighting and
people dying and stuff and missiles and
and all that
tunnels i said to myself well this is
going to be bad
you know maybe both sides will come out
worse
or because it's a war maybe one side
will win but then you got a losing side
and that's not good
nobody wants to lose a war but it didn't
go that way
um as luck would have it both sides won
and and then they stopped but i don't
really understand why they stopped
because this is such a good thing for
both of them
hamas got a big victory israel is
feeling good about degrading hamas
it was a win-win scenario i don't think
we could have a better situation
than a war in which both sides won so
that's pretty good oh that's right
it's really just the leaders who won the
people just
got killed yeah it was good for the
hamas leadership
because they showed they're tough maybe
consolidated some support
it was probably good for netanyahu he's
got other problems
and this made him look strong and
capable and
pretty good now i've heard some people
say that israel
should try to give some peace over there
instead of fighting
why why would they do that have you ever
asked yourself
why because you just take it for granted
that peace is better than war right i
mean duh
peace is better than war but is it
hamas and israel just had a war and they
both say they won
so if you're winning
winning is better than doing nothing so
i would say that in some cases
war is better than peace
now what would happen if israel
decided and hamas decided it won't
happen but
suppose they decided to have peace
would that be good for them no
no it wouldn't be peace would be the
worst thing for israel
how many of you understand that point
that
peace would be the worst thing for
israel because at the moment
israel is gobbling up land right here's
a settlement
well maybe all of jerusalem is ours you
know so
sort of like picking apart oh these
water rights we'll take these
yeah this the street will control
if your country is growing like
physically growing
it's expanding you don't want peace
because peace stops the growth this is a
period in which
for the low amount of deaths that israel
is experiencing
it's a really good deal you know per
death
per square mile it's a good deal
all deaths are tragedies of course but
if you're looking at the
bigger picture of long-term israel
israel's security having more land is
better
you know more buffer zones spread out
your populations
bigger population better economy so
peace would be a huge strategic mistake
for israel
and for the hamas leadership peace would
get them killed
if you're hamas leadership and you said
you know i got an idea
why don't we have some peace they would
be
instantly killed by their own people
because they've been convinced they
they need to conquer israel or whatever
so
is it crazy to say both sides won
not at all israel got stronger tested
out a bunch of equipment
degraded hamas and continues to have the
moral a little bit of moral cover
as they gobble up land they totally won
that there's no hyperbole there
whatsoever israel won
but so did hamas not the people
the citizens lost but the but the
leaders won
they got exactly what they wanted so it
is a weird case in which they both won
so your your uh sympathy can be with the
victims of course
but these are two
leaderships that wanted to fight and got
what they wanted
and one it's hard to feel bad about that
um
uh yeah and somebody on twitter asked me
you know what could we do
persuasion-wise or shake in the box to
get
hamas to want peace to which i say
nothing there's nothing you can do there
is nothing you can do
that would change israel or hamas's sort
of
permanent war stance there's nothing
because they want it
and it works and it benefits them
you'd have to make it not work and i
don't know how you do that because it
does work
all right there's a
survey i think this was an axios article
that nearly uh 7 out of 10 black
americans say police treatment has
gotten
worse in the past year
and about the same percentage believe
police shootings of black and brown use
have become worse than that time
according to an axios
ipsos poll so
since a year after george florey's death
suggesting that the relationship between
black americans and police
has gotten worse
where in this article is the
self-awareness
that would say something like and the
reason that these polls have gotten
worse
is because of us meaning the press
do you think that the do you think the
data would support
that police were worse to black
americans in the past year
the year of george floyd the year of
black lives matter
and you really believe that the police
got extra bad
to black citizens i mean it's possible
but i need to see some data because i
feel like it might have gone the
opposite direction
i feel as if maybe there were you know
fewer cases of police abuse because they
were
more cautious because of the george
floyd thing
but if it's true that seven out of ten
say things are getting worse seven out
of 10 black americans
then that is their reality their reality
is that it feels worse so at least
psychologically
is worse who caused that
who's the bad guy in the story the ones
reporting it
so the press can create a problem
assign the problem to somebody else
and then report it this this problem is
caused entirely by the press
entirely and and they
and they report it without even
mentioning
that they caused it they meaning all the
press not
specifically axios but how do you skip
that part how do you skip the only part
that mattered
which is why do they think that
it's either because the data suggests it
or because they've been
you know bamboozled by the press it's
one of those two things
which is it how do you leave that out of
the article
well i think we know the answer is the
press
i got to say more about this whole chris
cuomo andrew cuomo thing you know
governor cuomo
and apparently chris cuomo's brother
works at cnn it was reported he
participated in a strategy session phone
call
about the sexual allegations charges
against his brother
now i guess he's apologized said it was
a mistake got lots of
criticism etc and i don't buy into any
of it
like just none of it now first of all i
understand the point of conflict of
interest
so the people who disagree with what i'm
about to say
please don't explain to me what conflict
of interest is
because i know what it is and i know
that it had they had it
no doubt about it conflict of interest
but you know what else they had
pretty much full transparency was there
anybody who watched cnn who didn't know
that chris cuomo was the brother
of andrew cuomo no it was the most
transparent thing ever
does anybody think that that family
members don't talk to each other
and give advice nobody believes that
everybody knows if family members talk
to each other and give advice
do you care that chris cuomo did it in a
way that was
at least public enough that a story was
written about
it there were lots of witnesses
i'm happy he did it in front of
witnesses i'm happy he was transparent
he never hit it he admitted it said it
was a mistake which
i don't agree with i don't think it was
a mistake it was a mistake in terms of
how it looked
but i don't want to live in a world
where you can't talk to your brother
let me say this like three times i don't
want to live in a world
where i can't talk to my brother
anytime i want about any topic i want
period i do not care if the government
thinks it's a conflict of interest
that's too far that's way too far
all right now i think it would be
reasonable for the government to maybe
ask for transparency you know for
everybody to understand that it's a
brother situation
that's fair because then you can
calculate your mind
how much you care about it let me ask
you this
is anybody giving don lemon a hard time
for his conflict of interest with
governor cuomo
what you say there is no conflict of
interest because don lemon is just a
news reporter he's not a brother he's
not a brother
but his colleague is the brother
do you think that don lemon doesn't take
into account
that his close colleague is the brother
of the governor
of course he does because he's a human
right you know criticize don lemon if
you like
but he's a human you could put anybody
in that position and of course
they would be biased by not wanting to
throw their co-worker under the bus
imagine seeing chris cuomo in the break
room after you just did a show
throwing his his brother under the bus
how's that going to go right so yes
i get there's a conflict of interest but
it's the entire cnn
there's no cnn host who doesn't have a
conflict of interest
because their colleague is his brother
right chris cuomo is just one of the
people with a conflict of interest why
are we ignoring the rest of them
and again as long as everybody's
transparent i think that's as good as
you could do
it's as good as you can do all right
um apparently telehealth has exploded
and about
half of the people on uh medicare
uh used who who needed a doctor did it
by phone in the past year
and um that's real good news
and i wanted to uh to begin a little
series
i may do more of them i'm not sure
called heroes of the pandemic
i wish i had some kind of like a musical
score to introduce this
heroes of the pandemic so these are
people who did
really good stuff that maybe you've
never heard their name
so you're gonna hear it for the first
time and i'll tell you a little story
i've told you some of this but i'll
add a little detail you didn't know so
when the the pandemic first broke out
uh the government the u.s government
and people in it said some version of
this
uh what do we do now does anybody have
any ideas
and literally the government sort of put
out
all of its feelers to and i'm just going
to say this i know how it sounds i know
how it looks but
it's just accurate they put out their
feelers to smart people
and basically they said hey smart people
do you have any ideas
you know like what should we be doing is
there is a way we could do more
executive orders that would be useful
this is something we should change is
there a rule that should be
uh struck for the pandemic
and uh you didn't see this part of the
story because it happened all
you know under the hood but under the
hood
the smartest people in the country were
very active
very active because the government
immediately just sent out his feelers
and plugged in
like this giant machine like that the
the people who were operating sort of
like
as independent units suddenly just
became part of it
like a machine with you know any idea
that was from
any smart person in this network that
almost immediately was formed
uh any idea just went right to the the
right person immediately
and was you know vetted by the other
smart people etc
so there's a great story here about what
happened that nobody was watching
which is the personal connections that
formed
spontaneously because everybody said the
same thing
if it's an emergency what do i do like
how do i help
what's my contribution now many of you
were with me
since since then and you know that um i
took
a responsibility for helping you get
through it psychologically you know i
said well what can i do
you know what what's something i have a
unique ability to do
and uniquely i thought that i could help
you
not worry more than you needed to
i mean it was certainly a situation that
called for a little worrying
but i didn't want you to think this
civilization was going to end
that the economy was going to crumble
that we were all going to be dead
and so i did my very best to persuade
you that
by a year from then which is
right now the things would look
the way they look now which is the
economy is
roaring back we did not run out of food
zero people starved think about that
think about what the what the heroes in
the
food services and distribution chain
i mean think about what those people did
risk their lives
didn't know what the total risk was risk
their lives
to keep us fed successfully one of the
most amazing things
all right so here's uh one of the other
small stories so one of the people who
is reaching out from the government
was a jonah shumate chief of staff i
believe for rick
crawford and of arkansas and uh jonah
was familiar with me follows follows
maybe watching right now
follows the live streams etc and
reached out and said do you have any
ideas and i did you've heard this story
before
and my idea was to do an executive order
to get rid of the
restriction that didn't allow doctors to
do
telehealth across state lines which made
no sense in the year 2021 right it
didn't make any sense
so so jonah reaches out to me i say yeah
you know we should get rid of that
that restriction about state lines this
is exactly the right time to do it
and it's exactly what we need it took
about
10 minutes for jonah to get that idea to
the president's chief of staff and for
me to hear
that he got it and that he liked it it
was like 10 minutes
i mean i may be exaggerating a little
bit but it happened almost instantly
and within i don't know just a few days
it wasn't long the next thing you know
there's an executive order in which he
got rid of
that restriction and
so credit to jonah shumate in
representative crawford's office and um
that was the kind of self-organizing
stuff that was happening
massively just all kinds of
self-organizing
stuff and it was just beautiful
it was just a beautiful thing to watch
and you didn't get to see it
you know it was all it was all happening
under the hood but
uh one of the most amazing periods in
history someday when the real story of
the pandemic is written
you're going to find out stuff you you
just had no idea
um thank you jeff so
heroes of the pandemic anti-semitism is
breaking out everywhere apparently adl
says there were nearly 200 reports of
possible anti-semitic incidents up from
131 the week before the
hamas conflict so there does seem to be
a
a major uptick in these crimes
um and of course uh i don't know if joe
biden has spoken out
yet about anti-semitism in this country
spiking we'd like to hear from him
wouldn't we
now of course the squad has
biden's nads and a little
lock-up tube there and i don't know he
can do that
i don't know if joe biden can say
there's too much anti-semitism in the
united states
it seems like it should be an easy thing
to say but maybe you can't
so uh ezra klein had a interesting
tweets and article i think it was an
article but it was a series of tweets i
saw
that violent crime is spiking in the
cities so
homicides are up 25 to 40 percent
in 2020 um largest single year increase
since 1960
so it's this gigantic you know crisis
and he's he's warning the world again i
guess the the left-leaning world
that whenever you have a massive
increase in crime
there's a fairly predictable outcome
what is the predictable outcome of a big
rise in violent crime
that's right
the big outcome is you get a republican
leader
because people elect republicans when
crime gets out of control
crime's out of control so
you're going to see a lot more
republicans if if history is our guide
and in this case i don't know why it
wouldn't be
because it seems it seems like it would
you know
repeat the way it normally does so now
you've got
cities that are uh hotbeds of
anti-semitism
i think is mostly happening cities
you've got
crime is under control you've got no
real reason to commute anymore
you've got traffic you've got pollution
and despite all that you've got high
prices it's like being in the city
doesn't have much of anything that you
need anymore
so you can get any form of entertainment
anywhere because most of it's digital
anyway
so you don't have to go to the opera in
person etc
and i think cities are obsolete
and here's a bigger reason why chemical
and biological warfare
and terrorism imagine if you will
that the united states evolved over some
number of years
to not have major uh
major cities you know the city has just
become something else
so that you don't have 10 million people
in one place
because if you have 10 million people in
one place your pandemic is going to
you know be fueled by that closeness
your if they ever had a biological
attack
it's going to be devastating because
people are too close
so i'm wondering if we're reaching a
point where for homeland security as
well as pandemics as well as
lifestyle as well as avoiding crime that
the cities just go away
can anybody give me a good reason for a
city
you know historically they made perfect
sense because you didn't have much
communication
travel was a little bit harder
and travel was a little bit harder
so i just don't think we need them
anymore all right
tulsi gabbard called out uh racism
against white people
that's good to see thank you tulsi
appreciate it she was calling out
specifically uh mayor lightfoot
who said she would only give interviews
to black and brown people
so clearly obvious anti-anti-white
racism
and only one politician in the world
called it out
seriously just just one politician
nobody else had anything else to say
about that
just one person she should be president
just for that all right i mean if you
can't say that
out loud you you can't be president
if you can't say that out loud that this
is a case of
anti-white racism you just shouldn't be
a leader in this country
apparently the white house is demanding
that
that reporters submit their quotes
before they're printed so that the white
house can say yes
we really said that that's actually
fairly common
uh among low-end publications
even when i'm interviewed it's not
unusual for them to run the quote by me
to make sure they got it right
that's just fact checking right so fact
checking is fine
but i guess the publications don't want
to make sure that their quotes are
accurate
so that so the news is complaining
that the white house will force their uh
will force their news to be accurate and
that's a problem apparently
now because it also gives them more
control over that over the quotes
but um
all right matt gates uh the luckiest
accused guy in the world
um and i've got i'll be just a few more
minutes and i get around
but matt gates uh apparently the guy
who's accusing him
this greenberg guy
has a history of once before it is now
reported
uh falsely accused somebody who was
running against him for office once
of um of uh you know
was it improper yeah some kind of
improper sexual thing
so the guy accusing matt gates of
improper sexual thing
is documented to have made up
similar accusations in the past
come on seriously
seriously the biggest one of the biggest
stories in the country
and what are the odds that the guy who's
accusing him
is guilty of falsely accusing people
just like this
that's like the most perfect thing that
ever happened for matt gates
let me ask you another question
apparently some former girlfriend of
matt gates is going to testify
so when you hear that do you say oh no
it's curtains for matt gates
because his former girlfriend who may
have been
had access to knowledge or whatever is
going to testify
i wouldn't assume this is going to go
wrong for him
because i don't know about you but most
of my ex-girlfriends don't hate me
do your ex-girlfriends hate you maybe
some
but i have no reason to believe that his
ex-girlfriend's gonna be on the other
side
i feel as though it's at least equally
likely
you know given that we don't know what
their relationship was after they were
x it seems very likely that she likes
the guy
it seems very likely that she will she
will give a friendly testimony that
could be good for him
now let me ask you this are we
seriously saying that this is
prostitution
if he offered any kind of money for
somebody he was wanting to have a
relationship with
where do you draw the line let me ask
you this
if somebody is a prostitute for a living
it's their job
and you offer them money and they give
you sex well that's prostitution right
you could argue whether it should be
legal or illegal but i think we'd all
say oh yeah that's
that's what that is that's some
prostitution right there
but what if i'll just take an example
what if a billionaire single guy
met a woman and said hey how would you
like to go on my
private plane to france for a night
and the woman says yes is that
prostitution
because you know they're going to sleep
together on the other end
and you know that she was enticed by
the financial value and the what it
could give to her and this experience
is she a prostitute because she doesn't
do it for a living
she's just a woman who is at least
partially
influenced by some money
so what happens if we find out
and i i have a feeling it's going to go
this way that the women involved are not
full-time at least full-time or at least
not known to be
working prostitutes what if they're just
young women
who are impressed by power and money and
maybe it did make a difference
maybe it made a difference that he paid
for a hotel or
that they had a little extra cash to buy
dinner that night or something
is that prostitution i feel as if
even if he's guilty i don't care could
we at least find a crime that somebody
cares about
can we find a victim what was
now obviously if there's any underage
stuff that that becomes its own category
so at the moment i'm not talking about
anything underage and by the way there's
we've seen no evidence of that right you
and i have seen no evidence
there's anything with a 17 year old it's
been alleged but no evidence
if it turns out that all he did was he
was generous with women
and it influenced their decisions even
if it influenced their decisions a lot
i just don't care it was just people
doing what they wanted to do
willingly transparently i mean
come on let's let's uh let's grow up and
stop acting like we care about that
stuff because we we plainly don't
care about that stuff all right um that
is what i wanted to talk about today
there we go and
uh yeah the epstein thing the guards
the guards falsified some documents but
we don't know anything about that
so maybe we'll find out more let's find
out more
uh if you're still talking about it they
win yeah that's the problem
anything you talk about they win what
about crypto
i don't have a current opinion on that
and i've got to go
run and do something else and i will
talk to you oh somebody else has my
audiobook
going well i couldn't believe this but a
lot of people are buying
the the audio version of hatterfield
almost everything and still win big
because i just re-recorded it now it's
in my voice for the first time
it was a voice actor before and i'm kind
of amazed
and totally surprised that a lot of
people who have already read it or
already heard it
with the other actor are still buying
this one just to hear it in my voice
now i did not expect that
but there were so many people who asked
me to record it in my own voice
i thought well if so many people want it
it must be
something they want so i gave it to him
and i'm just blown away by the response
so thank you thank you for all of that
all right that is all i have for today
and i'll talk to you tomorrow
