foreign
good morning everybody and welcome to
the high light
of human civilization
and uh if you'd like to take your
experience up to levels that I don't
think anybody can even imagine
well all you need is a mug or a glass a
tank of Chelsea style and the canteen
Joker flask vessel levitic eye and fill
it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee enjoy being now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dope means
of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens now go
ah
yes let's go private over here
well there's a
lot of fun things to talk about
um
and uh let's see first of all there's an
AI created clip of South Park
so AI wrote
directed
and animated a little South Park episode
I saw Brian romelli tweet saying that
this was you know looking like the
beginning of the end of Hughes creating
well I didn't say it that way but it
looked like the beginning of one person
being able to create an animated series
just tell it what topic and create some
crease a little show for you
however
I watched that little show
just to see how good a y a I was and
uh it can't write
it can't write at all
right yeah I I consider it Ad Agency
quality writing
now if you're a professional writer
that's like the deepest insult
because ad agencies are the worst
writers
have you seen a commercial
they don't hire humorists to write the
commercial
if you're an AJ Ad Agency you think you
use skills so people who studied some I
don't know advertising think they can
write jokes
so that's why all of your insurance
commercials are so lame
uh I've got a good idea for a joke how
about I don't know let me think uh come
up with something original original I'm
working for the Ad Agency something
nobody's seen on a commercial
I've got it
we're going to make a white male look
like an idiot has anybody done that yet
on an insurance commercial
I feel like that'll be groundbreaking
adult white male who's incompetent in
everything I think that will be shocking
and amazing uh people will be talking
about it they could go viral
that's what Ad Agency I think
the ad agencies think what is everybody
already done before that wasn't good and
maybe we should do some more of that
so the writing is terrible now ai of
course can never write South Park for an
obvious reason
do you know the obvious reason
because the only thing that makes South
Park
funny is that it's inappropriate
that's all that's the whole joke I mean
you're extremely clever and well written
and yeah it's a it's a national treasure
so South Park is amazing
but it wouldn't be funny if they if they
could never be inappropriate
so so AI only can be appropriate
and South Park is only funny if it's
inappropriate how could it ever solve
that it has nothing to do with how good
AI could be it's limited by humans to
never be good it's designed to be bad
is actually designed not to be funny
so
that here's the other thing that I'm
going to add that you just you won't see
anywhere else
as far as I know this is just my own
personal theory that I've never seen
anybody else say
part of what makes you enjoy
humor writing
is imagining that the people who wrote
it
or in some cases performed it are going
to get in trouble
now you don't think of it that way but
if you don't feel danger for the writer
or the presenter
then it doesn't it doesn't really uh
trigger you it doesn't become viral it
doesn't become anything
it's the sense of danger of a human
being that makes it interesting to us
right because if you said to me you
Scott there's something dangerous
happening to a toaster
a block away
I'd say what yeah there's something to a
toaster a block away and I'd say is it
my toaster
no a toaster
well it's somebody's good toaster
they're rooting no it's it's not even
really a new toaster it's actually a
broken toaster that somebody's abusing
would you care
no because it's a toaster you wouldn't
care at all so when AI writes something
even if it could say something
at the moment it can but you could
easily imagine you know they could teach
it to do that if they taught it to be
dangerous
you would say to yourself so what
there's a toaster in danger
so AI is putting itself in danger by
just repeating some patterns
that we we take as provocative but
nobody's in danger
yeah you'll never want to watch AI art
because you'll know it didn't come from
a person
because the amazing thing about art is
that a human made it
if you've ever been confused and thought
that the amazing thing about art is that
you enjoy looking at it
do you think that do you think the
reason that you look at the great
Masters The Da Vinci's you think it's
because you like how the picture looks
literally nobody likes how those
pictures look
you you would you wouldn't buy that
photo if it were if it were not made by
da Vinci
it's the fact that a human made it
that's the entire art
it's not art without that it's not the
picture has no value
even the greatest artists in the world
you know the the Jackson Pollux you know
depending the impressionist it doesn't
even matter what what genre you're in
the only thing that makes it art
is that a human being made it
and if you don't think that's going to
be true for music as well
that I don't think you understand music
either
music is interesting because your brain
says wow people made that I would like
to meet with those people
that's it
if you're the greatest composition and
song that took any trick that you could
make a hit song and put it all in one
song so it had everything
but you knew I ate it
you'd listen to it once
you say oh that was actually a pretty
good song the AI made there you'd never
be interested again
because it because it wasn't from a
human
people are interested in themselves
period
if you don't understand that then then
you don't understand really anything
about your people about to care about
themselves and that's that's the end of
the analysis now you say Scott Scott
that's crazy they care about their
that's caring about themselves
their family is just an extension of
themselves right if somebody in your
family dies that hurts you right they're
not just separate entities although
they're also that they are you
right when you see somebody who looks
like you getting hurt that's you
that's you the reason you care less
it's terrible to say it you care less if
somebody looks the least like you
if they get hurt I hate to say it but
it's just the way we're all wired the
more somebody's like you the more they
are you in your mind and the more you
care about them
and a is the the most unlike you that it
could be it just doesn't matter stuff
that looks like you if you had a
photograph
a photograph of a person
would you like love it and want to fall
in love with it no it's just a
photograph it's just an image
so
I think all of the technologists
are missing the maybe the biggest part
of what AI is trying to master
the biggest part is that we will never
be interested in a machine's work
we will use AI to do functional stuff
that makes things faster you know does
things faster basically just you know
better or faster more convenient that
would be great
but no it's not going to do art
it's not going to do art because it
can't
under any condition you can't do it
because you never wanted to look at the
picture and you never wanted to hear the
song
if if you don't understand that and you
never wanted to hear the joke
you don't care about the joke the song
or the picture you care that a human
made them and you wonder about the human
you put yourself in position you know
you couldn't make those things they
impress you you want to make
that's
but without that understanding the whole
field of AI at least the art related
part of it is just absurd it's just
demonstrations of things that will never
be real
but AI still has lots of useful purposes
but I don't think art right away is
going to be part of that
all right
um
so Rand Paul's office in Kentucky was
destroyed by a fire I don't know if they
figure out the cause of that yet
do we know if that was arson
is there a climate change
all right you got me I was not expecting
to laugh at that
climate change
that was kind of perfect
that's like the old joke about typing
the the comments showed up I think it
was the timing of the comment it was
just like the moment I said climate
change
all right that was pretty funny uh it
wasn't climate change but I'm seeing the
comments we don't know what it was right
so there's is there some suggestion that
it might have been intentional
is that still there's still a
possibility or not
well I'd like to say that
um Rand Paul
he seems unkillable
so so far he survived a mass shooting
right during the softball game he was a
Survivor that he survived being attacked
by his viciously attacked by his
neighbor
survive that
and sort of survive coven somehow
somehow we survived covet
I'm not I don't even think he ever
double massed and somehow he lived
anyway but
um and now his office is
destroyed by fire
you have to ask yourself
you know and of course there were
coincidental things he was going to go
after fauci and he doesn't like the war
in Ukraine so there's always a reason
there's always a political race that
would be true of most of the prominent
Senators at any time
I would just like to say he's the maybe
one of the bravest people who's ever
worked in government
I mean he's a brave mofo I I just like
I'd just like to take a moment
acknowledge
that when people take these jobs it's
not always for the power
sometimes they're Patriots
Rand Paul as far as I can tell
isn't doing it for the money
as far as I can tell I don't see any
indications to that and he takes
difficult stands
which I believe are completely
um principle driven even when I don't
agree with them when I disagree with
them
generally he'll State his principle and
I'll go
okay well that's consistent
so even even when I don't like his
opinions I like his opinions
can you say that about everybody
you can't I would say it about RFK Jr
when I don't like his opinions or don't
agree with him
still totally respected because he shows
his work
right he says it's this study this is
why I believe it
that's all I'll ask of anybody I don't
ask you to be right all the time that
would be unreasonable so Rand Paul's in
my
you know sort of highest level of
government credibility
he puts his life on the line
doesn't walk away
doesn't appear to be lying about
anything
can you even think of a time he was
accused of blind I don't think he's even
been ever accused
it's like it doesn't seem to be part of
his deal he's just trying to make
something better it looks like to me
so just uh kudos to one
politician who while I don't agree with
everything he says that's not really
mentioning Thomas Massey who is somebody
I also often call out for uh extra
respect
because of the rational the rational
approach he's bringing again now
somebody I'll agree with every time
but he always brings the goods
always brings the argument right and
that it's never silly it's never stupid
sometimes you just don't agree priority
is different or something but smart
people good Patriots
I'm glad we have them all right let's
talk about summer news
you know what summer news is it's the
kind that's mostly made up just so we
have something to talk about in the
summer
well along that those lines uh are
probably drunken vice president I'll
just say probably because she acts like
she's drunk in public
but that's all I know for sure
right I don't know she is
I just know she acts like a drunk and if
you're not asking the question is she
actually drunk
I I believe you're not doing your job as
a good citizen as a citizen who's you
know has any interest in the company
country
I feel like it's a fair question
are you drunk right now
in fact in 2023 it's the most it's the
most reasonable question you can ask
as soon as you get into a disagreement
on social media I've taught you this
before
If a troll comes after you in the
comments and you're sure they're just
it's like they they don't want to
understand
they're probably drunk like actually
literally
if you looked at you know the population
of the planet at any given time from the
afternoon to the evening what percentage
of people who drive by you on the
highway are drunk
probably 10 percent
probably 10 what percentage of people on
social media are the ones who are the
terrible trolls
no different
it's probably not a coincidence
you know that that the the amount of
Alcoholics of the amount of trolls seems
to be similar
so it won't bother you as much to see a
troll a comment if you just say to
yourself
probably drunk
you wouldn't be wrong a lot
but uh drug Kamala Harris was railing
about the State of Florida allegedly
having in their new curriculum something
that is insulting to black people and
anybody who cares about black people
because it said quote uh let's see how
is she I want to see how she paraphrased
it
um
she said quote just yesterday in the
State of Florida they decided middle
school students will be taught that
enslaved people benefited from slavery
now do you do you think that that was
true
do you need me to do an extended
explanation
of why that didn't happen
why why Florida isn't actually teaching
people that slavery was sometimes good
do I need to get into any of the details
or will you stipulate that it's obvious
on the surface that nothing like that
happened
you know nothing like that happened
right
all right so here's the closest thing
that did happen
so this is summer news this is somebody
misinterpreting something in a really
obvious way like a real obvious
misinterpretation and then getting
really angry about it
so first comes the misinterpretation and
then there's the mock anger do you think
she's really angry
do you think she woke up and thought oh
I'm so angry about this
no no she's not angry and nobody who's
talking about it cares
it's just summer news it's just
something to talk about here here's the
actual statement
from part of the curriculum I guess
uh it says quote instruction
um so I guess the teachers are being
instructed how to teach the history
instruction includes house slaves
develop skills in which in some
instances could be applied for their
personal benefit
so slaves developing skills that could
be applied for their personal benefit
turned into uh why is Florida saying
that
the slavery was good for slaves do you
know what this personal benefit means in
context
if you keep it in context do you know
what personal benefit means
it means I'll give you an example
this is my understanding it means that
if you were a slave working in the field
which you can imagine would be you know
among the worst of these slave jobs if
you could figure out a way to let's say
learn how to repair wagons
right or to shoe a horse right put
horseshoes on a horse
probably better work
so that would be a case where a slave
could go from the worst thing you could
possibly do do something a little less
worse still a Slave
nobody thinks that literally nobody
thinks that and Kamala Harris doesn't
think it nobody who agrees with her in
claps like say a lot
none of them believe it
they might act like they believe it they
might argue with you yeah with Stern
looks but they don't believe it this is
just summer news
how about that Jason Aldean song that
people are calling her a racist
how many of them do you think actually
believe there's some in the song that's
racist
probably nobody
no I've said that even I like got the
vibe but when you look at it you're
looking for the racist stuff it's just
clearly not there
but I can see why it's provocative
so if somebody said hey the media has
primed us to have a bad reaction
material that's that's a good take
that's a good take but if you say it was
racist and yet there's not a single
image you could point to that would back
that or song or there's nothing in the
in the words or the imagery that would
suggest that
this is just summer news
if you got even a little bit worked up
about the Jason Aldean situation you
were getting worked up
by drunken trolls and people who just
need something to talk about none of
this stuff is real
it just isn't
all right
I told you that I agreed to talk to
Roseanne on her upcoming part podcast I
was thinking about Roseanne the other
day so thinking about what she got
canceled for and I don't I don't need to
you know go into this specifics because
you probably remember them anyway but do
you think that in the real world there's
even one person
who believed honestly
the Roseanne was bigoted I I think they
accused her being anti-semitic and at
one point of uh offending a black woman
that she didn't know was black
nobody oh but you couldn't find one
person in the entire world and certainly
nobody knows her you're like I'll bet
you couldn't find one person who would
back that oh yeah in private oh yeah you
should see what she says in private and
I said the same thing about myself when
I got canceled
the first thing that happens when you
get canceled you all know this they look
through your entire history
to find out all the supporting bad
things you did that for some reason
nobody noticed until now and when you
sum them all up oh my God this new thing
must really be indicative of your nature
did you notice that there was none of
that for her
none of that for me
none you don't you don't think that
people poured over everything we did as
soon as we got canceled of course they
did and what they find
Decades of the opposite
decades Decades of consistently being
the opposite of the accusation
and still
that fact doesn't the or the story don't
you think the poor the story should be
well after 40 years of being this way
there was this one thing that people
thought might invalidate that 40 years
none of this is real
there's nobody who cares about
Roseanne's opinion
or mine
do you think there's anybody who woke up
and it's like you know I was gonna have
a good day
but there was this cartoonist
who said that thing that I took out of
context and now I can't have a good day
no nobody cares about my opinion they
they use the opinions of famous people
as just a focus point to put their own
views into it
so it's never about the person they're
just a conduit for people's opinions and
that's about it
don't take any of it seriously unless
you get canceled in anyone all right
um so as you know Vivek ramaswamy is
getting a lot of attention for a great
campaign a lot of people who
like Trump
probably are liking him as well maybe
not as much right maybe they still
prefer Trump but the the Venn diagram of
people who think you know they like
Trump's Vibe or at least what he's
offering policy wise they're liking the
fake for similar reasons
but if you want if you want to hear the
best reason
yeah this this might be the moment when
I went from uh liking Vivek a lot
to loving him
I think I've crossed over to some kind
of man love
all right here's what he tweeted after
there was yet another embarrassing
Kamala Harris video
so Vivek tweets
that Kamala Harris makes the most
powerful case I'll see in my lifetime
against race and gender quotas and
government if only she knew it
wow I don't think
has anybody accept Trump ever said
something that Direct
that's really direct yeah Standing
Ovation right now this this tweet
didn't make a much of a impact when he
did it was it two days ago
can you imagine in any other world that
two days ago he could say this
that Carmel Harris is a the best
argument in his whole lifetime against
race and gender quotas in government
he said it as directly as you could say
it you know why there was no controversy
or pushback
everybody agreed
yeah now Trump trump made the arms a
little bigger so now you can play inside
his space right so because Trump is so
brutally you know Frank on his opinions
it just made it acceptable that you can
play Within those Realms he's he's
already created so I don't think Vivek
could have said this I don't know
six years ago
I think it would be the end of his
career
but today you can say it not only
because it's obviously true but because
our conversation has been broadened so
you can now say that and you can
actually just go on with your life now
I'd like to endorse that
so I can say it too
a couple errors is obviously a diversity
higher
obviously
obviously
now that doesn't mean that all diversity
hires are going to be incapable like she
is
literally nobody thinks that
but some but surely in our you know
weird world where you protect everybody
you know pretend to have opinions
somebody's going to pretend
that I think that if you're a minority
hire you could not be qualified
literally nobody believes that
literally nobody yet that's the way we
play it we act as if there's somebody
who actually has that opinion
have you ever met anybody who had the
opinion that you couldn't have a
qualified black vice president it's not
even a thing literally you couldn't find
one functioning brain that would have
that opinion nobody
but can you say the Kamala Harris is
somewhat obviously not qualified yeah
you could say that it's pretty obvious
to everybody I'm sure I'm sure the
Democrats see it as well as we do I mean
the honest ones
so kudos to Vivek for being so direct
this fits perfectly in his uh
in his policy preferences to get rid of
all hiring preferences so it's right on
Target and again he's just killing it
he's killing it
now um
the most dickish thing you can say in
these situations I'm going to say it
anyway
because you know all the candidates are
running for first place nobody's running
to be a vice president right
but it has to be said
he would be perfect for Trump
you would be perfect
uh my microphone is plugged in so if
you're hearing it low there's some
problem on your end
the YouTube Sound is actually
better
than the other sound all right
um
so Trump was uh did a little video about
Biden basically he's saying that Biden
is a sleepover sleepwalking us into
World War III
and it's all because of a country that
gave the bidens millions of dollars
now I gotta say again
the Trump is the best
as simple framing
we've never seen this before
like a lot a lot of people are good in
smart and good at framing you know if
they're fake is great at it but this is
just like other world Leaf right it's
just he gets right to like that feeling
you feel
like he skips all the intellectual stuff
it goes right at that thing you're
feeling in your chest
this is exactly what I feel in my chest
that we've got a president who's
sleepwalking us into World War III
for the benefit of a country that gave
him millions of dollars through Barista
primarily
that's exactly what it feels like and so
so Trump is that the exact thing you're
thinking as you're thinking it
damn
he's just so good at that
just take a moment to appreciate
and again you know I'm not I'm not going
to be slobbering all over Trump's
you know entire package so to speak that
was poorly worded uh I'm gonna I'm gonna
try to call
um you know the
I'm going to call this races objectively
as I can right so I'm going to say good
things about anybody who's doing good
things including Biden if he does some
good things
all right uh but you can't beat Trump
for simple framing
all right there's a story
my favorite summer story so far is that
Hunter Biden went to visit his lawyer
and of course wherever he goes that
Paparazzi are there and so his lawyer
his lawyer comes out on his balcony and
smokes a bond in the photographers are
getting a picture of the lawyer smoking
a bong well a whole Hunter's inside
doing God knows what
do you know what the funniest part of
the story was this is my favorite part
of the story
the Press said they didn't know what was
in the bong
well
um
nobody asked me to be an extra witness
in this case
but I volunteer
uh
if you'd like you could interview me to
see what my feelings are about what was
in the bong in fact I'll ask Dale to do
just that
Dale
could you interview me and ask me what's
in that bong
well we see it's a bong but uh we don't
have any information whatsoever about
the content
of what he's smoking
it was a bong
and scene
no there's not really a second thing you
smoke out of a bong
[Laughter]
not really I mean maybe it's happened
once but I don't think it was lettuce
yeah I don't think he was looking
through through the ingredients in his
kitchen he was like
paprika
I wonder
I wonder
no I don't think that happened
smoked a bomb
would uh would this be a story if he'd
had a glass of wine on the balcony
anybody if if he'd been photographed
with a glass wine with dinner
nobody would care
is marijuana illegal in California where
this alleged bonging happened totally
legal
totally legal
it's a nonsense
and uh just a personal note
if I were Hunter Biden's lawyer I don't
know how I would do it without doing
bongs
I mean I think there's a way but it's
not obvious to me
so
yeah it's just personal
um so the Box trial the Mar-A-Lago boxes
oh secrets
now you remember all the secrets that
are in the boxes right do I do I have to
go over it again
all the secrets that they've told us are
in the boxes
oh wait
nobody has told us there's anything in
the boxes
no nothing at all we don't have a single
piece of information that there's even
one thing in a box that anybody would
care about
I'm not saying there isn't but isn't
that interesting then nobody can even
give us a for instance
how about just a for instance well we
can't
but I will tell you there was a detailed
battle plan for Iran
okay don't need to tell me the battle
plan
that would be cool but just there's
something like that in the Box
anything just anything what's your worst
one you don't even have to tell me
everything in the Box just pick your
worst thing nuclear secrets is it the
nuclear secrets
I don't know
but the timing is exact but generally
speaking the Republicans would be done
so we would have a situation where Trump
would be the Nazi but also possibly a
convicted felon
uh potentially facing jail time
if his appeal failed right so you assume
if he got convicted there would be an
appeal
so that he would
still become president
there's nothing that would stop him from
being president right even if he got
convicted
If he if he were out on Bell
or he's appealing it
I mean it's not like he's a Flight Risk
right is Trump a Flight Risk where can
he hide he's the least flight risky guy
of all time you wouldn't even need bail
would you
I don't think you would you just say all
right we everybody's keeping an eye on
you
well
um
so this is my first exposure to the
details of this story but can somebody
answer this question
doesn't this give him perfect timing
to use the prosecution as part of his
campaign to to say the government is
corrupt and trying to rig the election
by taking him out so wouldn't it help
him in the election
at the same time he could just pardon
himself after it's done
I would vote for him just to Pardon
himself
I would
I would vote for him just to Pardon
himself
policies
I just vote for him to Pardon himself
that would be the end because I don't
see the prosecution as being something
that would have happened with another
person
I'm not saying he did or did not commit
any technical violations it might have
been
in fact probably I just don't think they
rise to the level
the you know response so
I think I think so far it looks like it
could work in his favor
because they're never going to tell you
what's in the boxes
they're just going to wave their hands
dangerous boxes and eventually the
longer you go without hearing what's in
the box the less likely you think
there's anything you care about
yeah there might be some secrets
but do they matter
does anybody care
I doubt it
all right Trump has said
that there are a lot of passionate
voters out there more passionate than
ever and things would be quote things
quote would be very dangerous if you
went to prison
now I'd like to show you the faces of
the people on CNN when they heard Trump
say the most obvious thing in the world
that it could be dangerous
if one of the leading candidates is put
in jail on charges that don't look
credible
now
CNN decided that that was a threat so
I'd like to show you CNN face
when he said it
oh
is that uh uh
a threat
I love CNN face
I don't think MSNBC is quite the same
way but CNN always does the face
you know when I say you Joy read or uh
any of the people in MSNBC
their own
right
it seems like you know versions of their
own face but on CNN it's like they're
actors who have to act extra disgusting
disgusted
like the Jake Tapper face
and then Trump
walked to a helicopter
you know like like they're they're
 and fart and cloth at the same time
so
MSNBC has dumb face
Maybe
anyway
um yeah so that trying to turn Trump
into a dangerous insurrectionist because
he pointed out the most obvious and
well-known fact in the world that if you
illegitimately jail a major political
character
people might protest
I don't know that might surprise you
all right uh Trump's lawyer his new
lawyer cleverly and smartly is demanding
uh cameras in the courtroom
can we give a hand for Trump's new
lawyer or play that right cameras in the
courtroom
now
should there be cameras in the courtroom
I don't know
that's not the point
the point is if you're a new lawyer and
you and you're going to be presenting
your case as it's a it's a ridiculous
case and it's political oh yeah whether
or not you get cameras
is also a second question but the first
thing you should say
is cameras
because he just reframed the situation
his new lawyer just successfully framed
the situation as an illegitimate
government process one in which you
can't trust that unless you better get
some cameras in there so the public can
protect itself get some cameras in there
we want some cameras
now does the person who's accused of a
crime usually asks for the cameras
yes or no the person who's the defendant
when does the defendant ask for cameras
I've never heard of it have you have you
ever heard of it
it's a baller play
imagine imagine being so confident of
your case now that this is what he would
portray we don't know if he's confident
we know he's portraying a confidence
just
to this uh that's a good lawyer so first
step you know the first step we see in
the public
bullseye
the innocent man wants cameras in in the
courtroom
perfect
good job
all right uh let's see uh by the way his
new attorney is named John lauro
normally I wouldn't even care what his
lawyer's name is but he's a good lawyer
so maybe you should know his name
so far anyway that's a good movie all
right um
so President Biden has overruled the
Pentagon
for choosing his
uh
a new member of The Joint Chief staff
so they recommended some gentleman I
don't know his name uh but Biden picked
Admiral Lisa francetti to lead the Navy
so she'd be the first woman if she's
confirmed to be a pentagon Service Chief
and the first female member of The Joint
Chiefs of Staff
um
so uh
the Pentagon wanted somebody else so uh
does that sound like a diversity hire to
anybody
just asking
does anybody interpret this as she's
clearly not the person for the job
yeah
uh
now
I feel bad for
um
for would she be
she's Admiral she's not a rear Admiral
I'm not sure what a rear Admiral is but
it's probably lucky she isn't one but um
it could be that she's actually the best
person for the job I wouldn't rule it
out it's possible
you know maybe Biden is really good at
hiring maybe she's the best one for the
job but nobody's going to believe it
should you hire
people for your Joint Chiefs and staff
if the public
ly assumes that they're unqualified
now
pretend that they think she is but
nobody really believes that do they
privately
you said you think somebody privately
would say yeah I think I think they
focused on picking the right person I
doubt it I doubt anybody would think
that and again this is terribly unfair
if it turned out that Admiral franchetti
is actually really great
they're terribly unfair
and
did I create the situation
I'm just reading the news
he created the situation where he very
overtly and with nothing hidden chose
somebody based on gender primarily
let me ask you an even more provocative
question do you think women should be
heads of any military service
I want to see if anybody says yes
somebody says yes if they're gay okay
that's not fair
all right uh
almost everybody's saying no now is that
just because you're a concern I see one
yes is that because you're a
conservative group
or do you think this would be a general
feeling
I mean I don't think
would not be among the progressives
I feel the military is the one place
where the mission has to be first
I guess that's easy to say and it
doesn't look like they're doing that
so not only is Biden you you know
sleepwalking us into World War III
but he's consciously
intentionally
and publicly making sure that we don't
have the best people running the
military
that's what it looks like
would anybody disagree with that
characterization that he's moving Us
close to war
that part I think you agree I mean I'm
not sure war will happen with Russia but
clearly we're you know creeping that
direction
at the same time he's degrading the most
important part which would be the
decision-making and maybe even maybe
even the trust
I don't know how you could be more
incompetent more obviously and more
publicly
it would be hard to imagine
anybody starting you know or looking to
crawl toward a war that could destroy
all civilization while simultaneously
promoting somebody who's clearly
even according to the Pentagon
not not the right person
yeah
so
um apparently we care about making women
happier happy more than we care about
defending even the country
it actually the priority is clear
so
how in the world could he win
re-election
it's just mind-boggling like if you just
look at the objective facts it just
doesn't look like as possible
but yeah we also don't trust the
election so anything's possible
well I hesitate to bring up this next
story but it's a big headline lately so
I was a big sigh
RFK JR says that Ivermectin totally
works because there are 99 studies that
show it doesn't the Show does and that
only a few studies that say it doesn't
work and they were funded by Bill Gates
and they have problems with them
he says further evidence of this is that
there are two states in India one that
used uh hydroxychloroquine I think it
was did
some people had lots of vaccinations
and there's a country in Africa I forget
which one where they have a lot of
problems fireworks chloroquine and they
did well
without vaccinations
uh do you like his facts did those sound
pretty credible do you think there's 99
studies the show works and only a few of
the show don't
it don't it doesn't
um and that Bill Gates funded them
and that there are clear examples in the
real world
of where either hydroxychloroquine or
I've I've worked because you can just
see it you can see the area worked and
you know there are they didn't use they
didn't get the good result do you think
that's true
all right yes and no are the wrong
answers
yeah yes and no we're both the wrong
answers
there's no such thing as reliable data
about this there's no such thing Bill
Gates doesn't have reliable data
RFK Junior doesn't have reliable data
I'm pretty sure that these 99 studies
were
um
observational and retrospective or very
very small and flawed
and that when somebody did a meta a meta
study where they sort of sum up all the
studies
you know they got some kind of an
opinion but meta studies are basically
astrology it's not even science
I I've said that argument too many times
to do it again but is basically what
assumptions you make when you do the
analysis the outcome so it's not a
science at all you pick some assumptions
and you're kind of done it's just what
assumptions you picked
so there's nothing about science
that should flow from your assumption
right issue from tests if it flows
directly from your assumptions well I
assume this big test over here this
biasing the results I assume that's
worse than some of these little ones so
I'll take this one out
it's not a science it's somebody's
assumption about things
so
um
I would say that RFK Juniors take on
this
would be the same as anybody's take who
believed data or
what data was accurate and what data was
not it's just not a thing
there's nobody you can look at any data
and know anything about it about
ivermected
because the the topic itself is too
politicize
you would just assume that it's
distorted by money somehow
one word
so I'm not going to say that it works or
it doesn't work I'm going to stick with
my opinion from the very beginning
I don't believe the data that says it
works or that it doesn't work I don't
believe either one and I don't believe
that we have any
business now actually let me amend that
we might actually have good data but you
might never see it and you wouldn't know
what was the good data versus the bad
data so anybody who has something like
certainty
that's the only wrong opinion
if you said to yourself you know I've
Loved These studies I gotta say I'm I'm
leaning in RFK RK Juniors direction I'm
leaning in that direction
perfectly reasonable
do you get that
and if you said you were leaning the
other direction perfectly reasonable
but leaving is as far as you can get
right we're so far from actually knowing
that it's the knowing that bothers me
and so I think RFK Jr would be more
solid
if he said that I don't like any of the
studies but there's another there are
enough studies that show that it was
positive that wouldn't it be good to
know for sure something like that
but the certainty I think is a little
off-putting to me because I think that
the day supports it certainly
it might support leading in One
Direction or the other
all right uh Blaze media
which is no good friend to Fox News I
guess
um the broken story that there's a
matched donation
Fox News so if you give some your I know
your church I guess they'll match it you
give some money to this or that they'll
match it but
um apparently there was no limit
on at least if it was a charitable uh
entity that you could give to
so they found out that some people are
giving to a satanic temple something
called the Trevor Project that must be
bad for conservatives Planned Parenthood
the conservatives don't always like
uh and what else Southern Southern Law
Center which is amazing
now
is this a real story
or is this a summer story
the details are probably right I mean I
would guess I somebody somebody did
you know screenshots and you know it it
seems like it's well documented so I
would say the facts of
probably right
probably right
do you care
do you care that there was some troll
uh or even maybe just one person that
Fox News who was literally a member of
the satanic temple or thought it would
be funny
and gave a hundred dollars to him just
to see if Fox News would match it
none of it matters
Fox News can give us money anywhere it
wants in this case it said we'll give it
please want to give it and then they
didn't put restrictions on them is that
good or bad
is it good or bad that Fox News did not
put restrictions on charitable giving
it's good it's good it's not bad
that the outcomes in this case would be
sub-optimal
to you know most people or some people
at least the satanic temple people you
know be objectionable to most people
but it doesn't really matter that double
donation from Fox News
you're probably talking about two
hundred dollars
do you think you're talking about
Millions you know that it would have
been a flag if there was even one
donation to any of these entities
so
and
am I angry that there's somebody at Fox
News who's donating to Planned
Parenthood
no
all that tells me is that Fox News is
willing to hire people
who have different opinions than some of
them do
how is that even a problem
now I get that there are customers and
most of the hosts would be out of one
side of that issue
but the fact that they're willing to
hire you if you're on the other side of
that issue is not a weakness
does that feel like a weakness
it's totally a strike so I'm going to
back Fox News on this I think Blaze
media is a little over there
competitive skis it's just a summer
again it's a summersity nobody cares
literally nobody cares
all right here's another one uh did you
know that d d e i
which had been diversity equity and
inclusion now as an a at the end
they're sort of going the lgbtq plus
Direction where you keep having to
adolescence so they've added a to the
end for accessibility
so that's uh d-e-i-a
anyway the Wall Street Journal editorial
board was talking about a
uh let's say
uh there's California community colleges
are required to take into consideration
you know the principles of Dei
and you're the bullet points from The
Wall Street Journal of these specific
things that these community colleges
should do
all right this is how seriously they
take it so the bullet points are
promotes and incorporates Dei and
anti-racist pedagogy
pedagogy
literally have never said that word out
loud do you know why I've never said
pedagogy pedagogy do you know I have
never said that out loud
because it's a douchebag word
and I'm not a douchebag well
maybe I am but I don't use that word
I had to correct myself maybe I am I'm a
bit of a douchebag but
never use that word
who are you writing for do you think
that half of the readers of the Wall
Street Journal know what that means
pedagogy pedagogy
they're probably no more than half
I'd guess 25 percent
anyway
so they're gonna let's say promote and
incorporate it so promoting and
incorporating so far so good right
because we knew that was happening
promoting and incorporating but let's
see if it goes further develops and
influence a pedagogy okay you and
or a curriculum they're and or
curriculum
uh that promotes are race conscious and
intersectional lens
um that's bad a race conscious teaching
that should be exactly what you don't do
so that should be illegal but it so that
would be illegal in Florida right
the thing that's being recommended or
actually required the thing that's being
required in California
is literally illegal in Florida is that
true is required here and illegal there
can you think of any other any other law
that's required in one state and illegal
in another
give me another example required in one
statement illegal in another go
now guns are not required
looting
abortion is not required
well I suppose it'd be required to offer
you might be right about that
income tax well you know state tax uh
that's that's reaching license to drive
now it's required everywhere
pre-arrange crapping photo ID it's not
illegal to have photo ID
it's not illegal to put on a seat belt
it's not
pot is not required anywhere yeah
there's no other example is there
right there are lots of examples of
things that are legal in one and not
legal another but you can't come up with
an example of something that is required
government required in one state and
government illegal in another state I
want to see if you now voter ID
if you walk into the voter ID place and
show your ID nobody's going to arrest
you if it's not required
I think this is unique
that is required in one state and
illegal in another
but that should tell you something
all right um
contributes to Dei and anti-racism
research and scholarship contributes to
it
you have to contribute to the in to the
research and scholarship
what's that mean
you have to contribute to it like
financially
or you have to work toward it
a big deal advocates for and advances it
most of these bullet points are just
saying you got to work on it in
different ways
I assume these bullet points were
written by a unqualified person
uh
participates in a continuous cycle of
self-assessment of one's growth and
commitment to Dei an acknowledgment of
any internalized personal biases and
racial superiority or inferiority it's
literally just mind control
based on this I would recommend that
nobody go to college in California
like you should just skip Community
College
this is the most absurdly
inappropriate thing you could ever put
in a college absurdly inappropriate
but there we are all right
um
lately there's been a bunch of stories
about Dei professionals
who have been fired or quit or downsized
whatever and they usually show their
picture
have you noticed anything
common or similar about the photos of
the people working in that field
actually a lot of them are white yeah
yeah your your first impression was it's
going to be you know people of color but
now there's actually you know a healthy
number of them are white
um women mostly women
have have they all been women
not all of them ninety percent
it's like 90 women isn't it
yeah 90 women but that's not what I'm
going for you're you're talking about
body weight no I don't think the body
weight I haven't seen anybody overweight
who's doing that job in fact they all
look normal weights me no it's not that
it's crazy faces crazy eyes
they they are people with crazy eyes
and crazy smiles
and the first the first few times I saw
it I thought well that's just my
imagination
playing tricks with me or or maybe it's
uh
I don't know you know maybe it's just a
coincidence
but the more stories I see and the more
of those pictures
I'm starting to think it's like some
other issues we talk about
whereas it's mental illness
that's just been systemized
it's systemic mental illness
so we're we're fighting systemic racism
which I believe is a real thing and
important
with systemic craziness we're actually
hiring the craziest people to work on
an important issue
now do you believe that you can tell if
somebody is batshit Crazy by looking at
them
how many of you think you can tell by
looking at them if somebody's crazy
as as we evolved so that we can tell if
somebody is sick or crazy or lying not
every time
but where we've evolved and need that
skill
you can spot them right away
and the Dei photos look like pictures of
very unhealthy people mentally unhealthy
people
now so I'm just going to say it
has nothing to do with race or gender
they do look like Disturbed to people
who were drawn to they were drawn to a
profession
partly because of whatever is bothering
that's what it looks like now I can't
read minds you know I have no poll
information there's no science behind it
but
I don't I'm tired of ignoring it I mean
if if every time I see pictures of Dei
people and they look crazy
how am I gonna how long do I do I have
to ignore that
when can I point it out are we there
I mean I can do it you can probably
because I got free speech in a way you
do not
so I asked myself if if you were looking
through all your photos you're looking
for a good profile picture and as you're
scrolling through your selfies
you realize that you can't find one that
doesn't have crazy eyes
what's your best play I did a poll on
this on Twitter I gave people two
choices if all of your selfies have
crazy eyes
your two choices are
uh hide all of your photos
or become a Dei professional because
apparently that's the one place where a
crazy eye photo is perfectly acceptable
oh yeah
we'll hire this one
all right uh 88 said become a Dei
professional and 12 said hi dear photos
all right uh here's an up Ukraine update
fairly early on
in the Ukraine situation a lot of people
were pro-ukraine they put their
Ukrainian flags and their profiles and
stuff
it was still literally fog of War things
were just developing
Ukraine was an ally Russia was not you
know so it made sense if the US and NATO
were going in on a side that people
would kind of take the side of the
leaders
but a lot of time has transpired
we see now that so far we've not got a
good result the latest thinking is that
nobody's going to do any
counter-offensive or offensive
to walk on land mines until the end of
time and basically keep their borders
the way they are
so
under these situations and the times
going by and what we've learned about
the bidens taking money from barisma
allegedly
Etc
can we conclude that if you still have a
Ukraine flag in your profile and you're
not actually Ukrainian
there's probably something wrong with
you
and probably you're deeply brainwashed
and somebody said today on Twitter
you've heard it before but you know that
they don't take seriously a thing that's
said by anybody with a Ukraine flag in
the profile
now when people started saying that
my first reaction was well that's a
little
that's a little bigoted or I don't know
stereotyped or that's a little crazy
but
standing from today's perspective
with what we know about the whole
situation and lots of time has
transpired and it doesn't look like
we're getting any closer to a result
kind of embarrassing to have that
and if you still have that in your
profile I swear to God I can't take you
seriously
because it's almost like a tattoo on
your forehead this has brainwash me
brainwash me please
hello could I please be brainwashed a
little bit do believe whatever you're
telling me as long as it costs a lot of
money to buy a lot of weapons
the most important thing is we're buying
weapons lots of lots of weapons
so that's what the Ukraine flag to me
just looks like you're lost
and again I I think that you could be a
reasonable person and have nuanced and
different views on you know whether we
should or should not be helping Ukraine
I think a reasonable person could be on
either side of that
even if I you know strongly disagree
reasonable people are on both sides
uh but I wouldn't believe anybody was
reasonable if they had a Ukraine flag in
their profile the first thing I think is
oh I can't talk to you
but I'm sure that I'm sure there are you
know equal things that people say about
other people
same kind of thing that's just where I
am at it
that I can't take anybody seriously with
that flag
all right well the latest on the Ukraine
situation is they're completely bogged
down the counter-offensive is not
working Russia is in no risk whatsoever
folding or falling apart there are more
stories about
um
internal dissension and people being
rounded up and all that stuff I'm sure
that's true
but uh
we haven't seen progression lately
uh and I don't think Russia is in
trouble of of any kind of coup does
anybody think Russia actually is falling
apart
as long as they have money they're not
falling apart
yeah Putin's firmly in control it looks
like
what's that
uh
Elijah Wood talking about
zelinski's addiction is that on the news
it's not on serious drugs
then I'd have to question his capability
if he's not at least on math
or some version of it
Adderall or something if he's not on a
if he's not on a performance in the end
saying upper
then he's the wrong person for the job
I'm just going to say that directly I
don't care how illegal those drugs are
if the guy who's in charge of saving
your country
isn't uh you know getting the energy he
needs he better go get it
I just assume anybody in this situation
is on some kind of meth or Adderall or
some version of it
don't you
you say cocaine but I don't know
you know meth would be smarter in his
case
I don't know if he's snorting anything
but I would say for sure a person in
that situation I would if I were him I
would be on some kind of stimulant
because there's no way he's ever going
to go to sleep thinking he did enough
work
remember his life and death
you don't want somebody to say you know
I'm going to get a good eight hours of
sleep tonight
that's the last thing you want to hear
from your War leader you know what I
want to hear from my War leader I've
been up for three days I'm still doing
well
don't I don't feel like I need any sleep
yet
and I say to myself okay well you're on
math
and then the second thing I say to
myself is thank God
I've got leaders awake
do you want a sleepy Joe making your
award decisions
well uh yeah we'll send you some bombs
uh foreign
good for him
just means he loves his country and he
doesn't want to sleep through a war
but I don't recommend drugs to you
because keep in mind that if he's doing
drugs and I just assume he is I mean he
would be smart enough to be on
stimulants
but
I just wouldn't trust him if he's not
yeah so you could have you there's a
downside
duh there's a downside to drugs so he
could get addicted it could be really
bad later in his life he could die even
overdose you know he could have um if he
did too much he could have some it's
like like all bad I get it but in terms
of the risk reward I doubt anybody in
this situation would not be on
stimulants probably
it's probably pretty common
all right that's all ladies and
gentlemen
