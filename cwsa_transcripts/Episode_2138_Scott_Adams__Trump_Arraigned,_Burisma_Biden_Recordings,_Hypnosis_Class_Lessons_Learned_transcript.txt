oh no
good morning everybody and welcome and
congratulations to making it to the best
show in the history of civilization and
all shows anywhere ever it's called
coffee with Scott Adams and it's the
best thing ever and if you'd like to
take your experience up to levels that
no one's ever seen before all you need
is a cup of mug or a glass a tanker
jealous has died the canteen Jugger
flask of vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
dopamine the other day I think it makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens now go
and uh good morning to all you clankers
welcome all clankers
well
I don't know if you noticed but uh the
other day Elon Musk
uh tweeted that he was looking for a
vice president of Witchcraft and
propaganda
Witchcraft and propaganda
so I replied to it and I said
I need to know if there's a commute
because I feel like I'm perfect
when you think Witchcraft and propaganda
what
what image pops into your mind first
it's me right it's me witchcraft and
propaganda I'm all about it
and uh I think I'd be perfect for the
job except I don't want to commute does
anybody know if Elon Musk Minds if I
work remotely
well
luckily for me
I know he does mind but that's the first
thing I'll change
huh
let me put it this way
if you were applying for the job of Vice
President of Witchcraft and propaganda
and the first thing that came up is you
can't work remotely
if I couldn't change his mind on working
remotely
what kind of Vice President of
Witchcraft and propaganda would I be
it's the first thing I'd do
and then after I changed his mind on
that he'd say my God I never thought I'd
change my mind on that you must be the
best vice president of Witchcraft and
propaganda ever and then I would get the
job and then I would ask for a raise
because I would feel like it was already
being put upon
that's just how I am
well Amazon is rumored I'm not sure how
credible this is rumor to be thinking
about offering free phone service with
their Prime setup
do you think that's going to happen
do you think you think Amazon is going
to offer a free phone service
I don't know maybe in some limited way
I don't know exactly how that play works
but I do like the fact that they might
be looking to bundle up anything that
looks like a generic service
and phone service is very rapidly
becoming generic can't tell one from the
other
so maybe there maybe that does make
sense in the long long run
well no surprise the inflation rate is
coming down a little bit
uh
experts thought it would be 4.1 but it's
all the way down to four
which isn't which isn't really terrible
it's not terrible all there really
matters when you have four
what's the only thing that matters when
your inflation is at four
all that matters is what direction it's
going
right if it continues going even slowly
in the correct direction of lower
inflation we're fine
now I don't know how we're fine I don't
understand the math of how that's even
possible
but if it keeps coming down
we're probably fine and I thought that
would be one of our biggest problems but
it looks like Europe's having a little
more trouble they might be in
recessionary situation
but once again Warren Buffett's Sage
advice is looking
like Sage advice I don't remember how
many years ago it was the first time I
heard Warren Buffett say
invest in American companies
that's never been wrong
I'm paraphrasing but the idea is you
know should you put your money in you
know some basket of foreign countries or
or a basket of American companies
if you just said American companies from
day one and you'd never put your money
anywhere else
you'd be pretty happy
yeah it's pretty much that simple at
this point so once again it looks like
the American
um
economic experiment if you will
is the winning experiment it looks like
we're doing it again
now some of this might be political
because you can imagine that all the
levers of government you know might want
Biden to get reelected so if there's
anything that can be done to make the
numbers look like they're going down
they'll probably do it
so I'm not sure if we can trust the
numbers
but at least it's not going up quickly I
think we'd notice that
so this looks like good news there's a
lot of good news breaking out
all over the place I don't know if
you've noticed because you know the news
doesn't cover the good news as much
but the lack of bad news is pretty good
news
when was the last time you worried about
the supply chain
I have to tell you that our supply chain
problems from the beginning of the
pandemic that was the one thing I
worried about the most but also thought
we'd have a really good chance of
handling it
it looks like we have it looks like the
collective wisdom and work of the human
human beings of
solved it I mean I don't see a lot of
problems I've got one shampoo I can't
buy anymore but I don't know I don't
know if that's why I guess there's some
meds that are still hard to get
but they they seem to be somewhat
specific problems not not a big supply
chain problem
I think we're in pretty good shape in my
opinion climate change does not look
like the end of the world
right it looks like uh new batteries are
being invented every day new battery
technologies so it looks like we will be
able to store as much green energy as we
can create
that wasn't always the case it always
looked like maybe we can create energy
but we can't use it at night you know or
we can't use it when the wind isn't
blowing but now it looks like that's
solvable looks pretty solvable
so we got a lot of solvable things the
the other thing that was a complete
disaster still is is education
but I've never seen so much activity
toward uh school choice have you and
then you add on top of school choice the
AI possibilities the the possibility
that a poor kid could get
something like an identical education to
a rich kid maybe I mean I don't think
you can get all the way there rich kids
always have some advantages but you can
close that Gap quite a bit
so I would say that almost everything
including the stock market the stock
market's been kind of strong lately
almost everything is traveling in the
right direction I would also say that
the
let's say the abuses of government
may have peaked meaning that the
American public and its uh let's say
it's visibility into what the problems
are is very high
and I I think we're on the way for some
kind of Correction now that correction
might look like a republican victory in
the next election
um I I've never I don't know if I've
ever said this directly
but in my perfect world
the presidency does trade hands between
the Democrats and Republicans worst case
scenario it just stayed in Democrat
hands or a state in Republican hands
either one of those would be disaster
you need them to be competitive and they
are right right now I would say if you
were going to say from just a
competitive standpoint
we have a really good competitive setup
because the Democrats are really
offering something different
than what the Republicans are offering
you know it doesn't look like the unit
party to me to me that looks like a
genuine competition and I would also
like to complement a number of the
candidates
uh my my impression of the optimism for
America is very high right now
that that may be strange to hear but my
American optimism
quite High and a lot of that has to do
with the fact that there are a number of
quality candidates have emerged now
mostly on the Republican side but there
there are at least three Republican
candidates that I would say okay that's
I'm I'm happy with that President and
there's at least one Democrat RFK Jr who
I you know again I'm not saying I agree
with any of them on policy I'm just
saying that they would be serious
credible
patriotic smart Americans who are what
you want in the job
so that all looks pretty good to me the
only thing that could go terribly wrong
would be re-electing Biden
to me that feels like the only thing we
could get wrong and I don't think it's
going to happen it feels like it feels
like everything's lining up to make that
not happen but I'll talk about that in a
little bit
all right
um
there are things that I learned around
40 years ago
when I learned to be a hypnotist so I
took classes to be a hypnotist became
certified and some of the things I
learned then I tried to convince people
were true it's something that hypnotists
know that regular people are not exposed
to
and for 40 years I've been saying you
just wait you're going to find out
and and this is what is happening 40
years later let me give you an example
40 years ago I learned that human
intelligence was nothing but pattern
recognition and there was nothing
magical to it it was mechanical
and it wasn't that's all it was there
was nothing to it but a mechanical
process now to be a hypnotist you have
to know that if you believe there's
something magic happening in the other
mind what would you do with it how do
you manage Magic
all right there's some magic happening
in your brain let me see if I can work
with that you can't work with that
but you can work with the idea that the
brain is a machine and there are a
certain set of inputs you put in those
inputs just like you're just like a user
interface for a computer you hit the
right user interface you get the right
outcomes and that's why hypnotists
observe so we've known for a long time
that the brain was not magic it was just
a little machine and the hypnotists know
where the buttons are but you didn't if
you didn't know where the buttons were
it looked magic to you but if somebody
showed you the buttons look look you
just push this button and you make that
person do this other thing it's right
here just push it watch push that see
push say
if you're a hypnotist you've seen that
so many times that you already knew that
intelligence would be easy to reproduce
not easy let's say inevitable it was
inevitable that computers would
reproduce that form of intelligence
because it wasn't special
and that's what Sam Altman said you know
the CEO of open AI so he said the other
day that what he learned from AI the
process of creating AI is that
intelligence was not magic it was just a
a property of matter
if you just arranged physical objects in
the right combination it created
intelligence
that's exactly what we knew as
hypnotists 40 years ago now here's
another one there's a new thing that the
uh and by the way the the science and
this is so stupid that it made me laugh
but there's a study that says that obese
people have different brains
meaning that they don't get food rewards
with a small amount of food
so if if I go eat a potato
because I really like potatoes
so you you can just imagine ice cream or
something in your own example I just
really like potatoes
I don't know I just like them in every
form you can do anything to a potato
when I would like to eat it
so if I go eat a potato
the science says that after a few bites
my brain would light up with dopamine
and then say whoa Great Potato you you
are perfectly happy now you're seated
so that's that's just how my brain is
organized it's just a property of matter
right did I did I mention anything about
free will
no there's no free will in the story my
my brain lights up with a little bit of
potatoes and if you sit down right next
to me and you eat the same potatoes at
the same time even if you like potatoes
if you're obese
you're gonna you're not gonna get the
same light up in your brain
you're gonna have to eat like twice as
many potatoes to get the same amount of
dopamine Now where's the free will
where's the free will
there is none this is perfectly explains
everything the hypnotists Learned 40
years ago well really hundreds of years
ago when it was invented
but I learned it 40 years ago
and and I learned it this way my
hypnosis instructor who was himself
quite overweight
when he said he understood the whole
secret of overeating
and he said I like to eat
that was it everything you need to know
everything you need to know about
obesity and weight was in that one
sentence from my hypnosis instructor I
like to eat
now what he meant by that was he likes
to eat more than you do and if you like
to eat as much as he did you would weigh
as much as he did
end of story he likes to eat
that's it
now
what this study of obesity showed
because it's stupid science what they
did was they gave the same amount of
food and I think they did it with a
feeding tube so they weren't even
conscious of the taste buds or anything
just the food directly into your body
and then they could they could test your
brain to see what lights up
and what they found is that even if the
obese people lost weight
they still didn't get the benefits that
skinny people did of getting their
dopamine which is exactly what we were
taught in hypnosis school which is it
didn't matter how heavy the obese person
was if you can force them to lose weight
they would just be a person who still
needed to eat more potatoes
you still need to eat more potatoes than
I do it doesn't matter what you weigh
because you're that's the only way you
get the dopamine eat more potatoes
or whatever
so
um
the AI is and also science are just
catching up to where hypnosis was 40
years ago
really a hundred years ago it's just
that I learned it 40 years ago is that
amazing or is that just amazing to me
because I I've been saying for decades
that when you learn hypnosis
it's a superpower you're it's like
seeing around corners you can just tell
what's true before other people can tell
it is it is that important to learn it
all right
um
yeah I'll see what else I also have a
prediction that's born out of that same
experience that the so-called AGI which
is the form of AI that everybody's
worried about not the current form the
current form is a large language model
meaning that it's just looking for
language patterns so it doesn't have
anything that you would call
intelligence per se it's just copying
things I'd seen before now it looks
smart
and do you remember do you remember a
prediction I made before any of this AI
stuff took off and I said that the only
way AI would look humanish you know the
only way it would act like a human is if
you made it stupid
because if you made it smart we would
just disagree with it and we say well
it's broken
this thing doesn't even like pronouns it
must be broken
right so so
[Laughter]
here's my prediction
the the prediction is from the experts
the experts say that someday we'll have
this thing called AGI artificial general
intelligence as opposed to the llm so
the artificial general intelligence is
the one that's literally going to be
smarter than humans and here's my
prediction
it can't be made
is logically impossible
now I think I'm the only person who has
this prediction and the reason I'm the
only person who has this prediction is
that every one of you are saying the
same thing you're all saying the same
thing well that's stupid Scott
you're definitely going to be wrong on
this one because every expert says it
can be done it's just a matter of time
but do you know every expert doesn't
know how to do it they'll also tell you
that they'll tell you they don't know
how
it's not it's not like a fusion
if you tell me that Fusion Energy is
coming I'll say you know that's down to
a question of engineering now because
they've solved the physics they just
haven't solved the engineering of how
you put the parts together to make them
work but they will because it's just
trial and error and eventually they'll
get there you might take 40 years but
they'll get there it's just engineering
but with AGI nobody even knows a theory
there's not even a working hypothesis of
how that could work so the the large
language models they have a theory you
just look for the patterns and you know
that'll give you intelligence and it
worked
but here's why I think you'll never get
artificial general intelligence I don't
believe that a human can program
Intelligence above their own
intelligence
because you wouldn't know what it looked
like and if you could program it to be
smarter than you that would make you
smarter
or or at least or at least you wouldn't
know if you made it smarter than
yourself and you might think it was
making mistakes
so here's what here's what AGI will do
better than humans it'll be much faster
obviously
it will no more facts
so you'll have more facts they'll access
them faster and it might be able to
organize them faster and even better in
some ways so there are a whole bunch of
things that AGI will do that will be or
or that AI will do it'll be
mind-boggling and great but here's what
it will not do here's my prediction of
this counter to every prediction it will
not do common sense and logic better
than the smartest human ever
ever
that's my prediction now I don't know if
I could ever be proven right because it
would always look like we're just it's
just around the corner well Scott you've
been right so far
but I think they've got it now
I think it's going to be like the walls
are closing in
I don't believe we'll ever get there
now we'll definitely have an AI that
looks and acts like a human but looking
and acting like a human is because it
will make mistakes it's the mistakes
that will make you surprised that it's
not a computer as soon as they made one
that was genuinely smarter than you
which is impossible I think
uh you'd have all kinds of problems
recognizing it as being smart
you you just wouldn't know what to do
with it
so I don't think we can make one that's
smarter than us we can make one faster
and maybe more organized or something
like that but not smarter per se not not
common sense
slash logic
and and I will accept that 100 of you
disagree with that
right well can we can we stipulate that
just about everybody would disagree with
me
that's why that's why it's fun it
wouldn't be fun if you all agreed with
me
all right but keep an eye on that so
today is uh Trump's court hearing there
will be massive publicity and security
arrangements and
blah blah blah and that'll be the news
today
um
so dershowitz uh
I believe he's modified his opinion on
this a little from the first opinion I
heard now the first opinion I heard from
dershowitz Ellen dershowitz was that it
looked like there might not be that much
of a legal risk in the long run
that most of it's covered under a
non-criminal statute and the part that
might be a problem the phone call could
be easily defended against just by
saying he didn't let the person read it
he just sort of waved it at him and said
hey look at this
Secret
now I thought that was a pretty good
argument
and that he had sort of dismissed the
the problems but as of the Wall Street
Journal and today's editorial by
dershowitz he does looks he says the
case is stronger than he expected
so now he's he's ramping up the let's
say the the cost benefit analysis to
have a little bit more cost in it
um
but but he does of course point out that
the technical
legalities aside
separate from you know the law you're
going to have to decide if this is good
for the country and the legal system
does incorporate that
so it could be that maybe he should be
indicted on some technical basis but
maybe everybody's better off if he's not
that would be a reasonable outcome
but here are some questions I have
number one
as a citizen of the United States would
you be okay
if somebody was taken off the field
whether it was a Biden or a trump
doesn't matter what side
for a victimless crime a victimless
crime because there's no allegation of
any damage
no allegation of damage
a victim risk crime I would not be okay
if a Democrat was removed from office
for a victimless crime
absolutely not
and certainly not if there was a
reasonable defense
right
now it could be that Trump would lose
you know maybe 12 euros would find
against him but you could never say it
wasn't a reasonable defense could you
because the reasonable defense looks
like this
I was president
I get to decide what's a secret
and so by the mere act of removing them
that was my decision there's no
requirement for me to say the words out
loud or to fill out a form
I was the president I moved them that's
all you need to know end of story now if
I were a juror I would be convinced by
that argument
and I will be convinced if Biden said it
because I don't I'm trying to be as much
as possible trying not to be biased
politically you know just trying to look
at it as a citizen and how would you
want to be treated if you were in that
situation right
um
so yeah the fact that it's victimless
and the fact that if it if the shoe were
on the other foot I definitely would not
be in favor of removing the president or
even a candidate for that reason
and
of course you're going to hear a lot of
people say in the next
week's No one is above the law
now
I've mocked that before but I'm
upgrading my mocking
when I hear anybody say that now I think
one of the crassensteins said it on
Twitter no one's above the law
I hear the I see it I see the Gollum and
I hear the gollum's voice when I hear it
but at the end of it I add my precious
so when I hear somebody say no one is
above the law
uh in my mind it turns into that wins
Above the Law my precious
try not hearing that the next time you
hear it
it's a pure Golem statement no one is
above the law my precious
yeah you'll never not hear that again
you're welcome you're welcome that
that's uh
that is uh one more reason that Elon
Musk should hire me as the VP of
Witchcraft and propaganda because once I
put that little Golem thought in your
head
good luck getting it out
all right
um
personally I believe Trump will not be
found guilty
my my view of the uh
my legal
my totally uh unqualified legal opinion
is that there's just too much of a
defense there
I don't think you I don't think you can
get 12 jurors
to decide that a process that doesn't
have any written requirements
hasn't been followed and therefore a law
has been broken
really you broke the law that doesn't
have any any details
how in the world could you not
um
how in the world could you
not win that case I mean it just feels
like the most winnable case of all cases
foreign
I knew that you would be saying that I
look like Gollum and so in anticipation
of that
because I am so good at anticipating
uh I prepared something for you and sure
enough in the comments on YouTube you
look like Gollum Scott you'll look like
Gollum
and so I
capture this photo
of AOC
looking like Gollum
now if you think I'm making fun of AOC
you're missing the point
I'm not making fun of AOC
here's my point
I believe that 100 of of humans
to have at least one photograph that
makes them look like Gollum
it's just a hypothesis do I do you think
there's somewhere in the world a
photograph of me looking exactly like
Gollum
yes yes there is
but but here's the weird thing if you
said uh Scott do you look like AOC
what would you say you say no no you
know Scott does not look like AOC two
totally different people but then you
asked this question does AOC look like
Gollum
huh
kind of yes
does Scott look like Gollum
huh
kind of yes
but does Scott look like AOC you kind of
know
so I think we've developed the Golem
theory of photography
everyone looks like a Golem sometimes
it's all about lighting
all right
um here's a question
can Trump call himself a journalist and
then get out of all of his legal
problems
this is just for fun this is not an
actual you know actual suggestion and I
I got this idea looking at a Glenn
Greenwald tweet
in which he talked about the fact that
if the New York Times have the same
documents that Trump had
it would be totally legal
so in other words Trump is not allowed
to have in his possession documents that
the New York Times would be allowed to
have now let me let me remind you Trump
already knew what was in the documents
to him nothing was being revealed he'd
already seen them
but if the New York Times had him they'd
be seeing him for the first time that
would actually be a secret being
revealed
but it would be legal for the New York
Times to have them because they're the
Press
so they could have them and reveal them
at the risk of any danger whatsoever so
they could actually cause victims Etc
all legal
but Trump who is the actual president
the the the the
determiner in Chief of what is
classified and what is not already seen
them did not show them to anybody as far
as We Know
and that was illegal
so could he cleverly solve his problem
by by classifying himself as a
journalist which in my opinion requires
no no clear no uh qualifications
whatsoever
what does it take to be a journalist you
just say you are one there's no other
requirement
so you can just say I'm a journalist
just like the New York Times I've got
this truth social this is my platform
and I publish on it so I'm publishing
things here and I'm just like a
journalist basically when when Matt
taibi and Michael schellenberger
did long Twitter threads about the
Twitter files were they acting as
journalists
yes they were they're acting as
journalists even though they were just
tweeting now they also wrote a separate
sub stack articles but when they were
just tweeting threads
they were being journalists
when Trump tweets a thread why is he not
a journalist
well only because we call them the
politician he calls himself that
all you'd have to do is say I'm a
journalist and it's all legal
am I wrong
what would be the what would be the
problem with that
if it's legal for the New York Times to
have them
and I guess that would be a question so
I'd need a fact check on that is it
legal if the New York Times had them
then he can just say yeah I'm the New
York Times too
yep same job
but no you're running for president well
people who run for president have other
jobs
you can still have another job while
you're running for office that's my
other job I'm a journalist
well no even though I'm not serious
about the idea because I I know it's not
something they would actually do what
would be wrong with it
do you think the jury gets to decide
whether he's really a journalist
how does that work why does a jury get
to decide if I'm a journalist
there's no law that says that that
doesn't make any sense if I'm a
journalist and I'm if I'm writing things
down
about the news and I'm publishing them
how am I not a journalist
s
all right I just put that out there
because it's fun
um
here's what I think is the Gavin Newsom
play
as I said in a tweet yesterday or so
the reddest of red flags is that Biden
is not actively campaigning
and he's running for office president
and it looks like the polls are you know
competitive so it's not like he's going
to win automatically and he knows it
so what are two reasons you could give
me why somebody in this situation would
not be aggressively campaigning
now one of them is he's unable
but
is he really wouldn't they at least try
I mean at least they'd give it a good
try if you you know here's what I think
it's possible he's just unable and they
haven't figured out what to do about it
so I guess there are three possibilities
one possibility is they feel that the
election is so rigged
or will be
that they don't even need to try hard
they just have to say oh we're gonna
he's gonna campaign on his record
meaning he'll just do the job and he
does a good job so I really like them
so so one possibility is he's so
confident he doesn't need to campaign
does that sound real
not really the other possibility is he's
not planning to be the candidate
as he knows it
because he's planning it uh he's just
waiting for the last minute why would he
wait for the last minute as opposed to
letting the the field just compete in
her normal primary why would you let why
would you wait to the last minute and
then drop out
what benefit would that give you
well hold that question
hold that question what benefit would
you get if you waited to the last minute
and that was actually your plan to wait
till last minute all right hold that
thought now let me change topic slightly
so the the Democrat who's making the
most noise lately is Governor Newsom
so Newsome is proposing a constitutional
amendment about guns probably has no
chance but it gets him in the news he is
attacking Governor DeSantis every chance
he can which doesn't make sense for a
governor it's not really the Governor's
job to attack another Governor but it
puts them in the news and then he did
the ballsy play which I'm I'm going to
compliment him on he went on Hannity
because if you can't go on Hannity in my
opinion you're you're not ready to be a
president
and I would say that you know you could
reverse that if there's if Trump was
let's say unwilling to talk to Jake
Tapper or Joy Reed or something then I
would say he's unqualified I would say
that's that's disqualifying if you're
not willing to talk to a journalist on
the other side
that's just not good enough you've got
to be able to do that
so Newsome is showing you his
presidential chops by walking into the
lion's den sitting down with Hannity
and that he sits down with Hannity and
what does he say about Trump
he said that during the pandemic
Trump was excellent I'm paraphrasing
you said that there were no politics and
Trump was 100 percent
helpful to California no criticisms at
all
Now isn't that interesting
do you know what it sounds like
very presidential
it's very presidential
is very presidential to say that the
thing that Trump did right he just did
100 right there's nothing else to say
about it
I like that now Newsome you know he's
got some rough edges he wouldn't be my
first choice for president but
he is good at this
like he's a he's a let's say a skilled
politician good and bad he's skilled at
it this was very skillful
going on Hannity was smart it was just
flat out and smart and then
um based on what I read about the
interview it looks like he nailed it
because if you can go on Hannity and
give an unambiguous compliment to Trump
but then also you know hold your
criticisms for the things that are
worthy of criticism that's a really good
presidential
strong
kind of a play and I thought he did it
well
now
why why is it that Governor Newsom seems
to be the only one
who you think of as maybe a presidential
possibility
and did I hear he's related to Nancy
Pelosi is that true
is Gavin Newsom related to Nancy Pelosi
or is that just one of those internet
things
that's true right now do you think that
someone who's related to Nancy Pelosi
might have an inside track
do you think that might give him a
little inside track all right here's
what I think the play is I think Biden
is going to wait until the last minute
and everybody including Newsom is going
to say oh yeah he's definitely going to
be the candidate oh I'm not running for
president
oh oh what do you oh what are you even
asking that that no we have a candidate
for president no no no no no no no not
ready for president
and then at the last minute Biden jumps
out and there's no other candidate whose
name you can think of
I can't even think of what name the
other candidate all right RFK Jr right
but the RFK Jr is a little too far
outside the Deep State you know he he
would take the Deep State down
but I don't think Gavin Newsom would
I think he just slot right in into that
existing structure just perfectly
so I think the play is to freeze other
Democrats out of the race
it just doesn't work on RFK Jr because
he doesn't give a what the
Democrats think
at least the leadership
which is exactly why you like RFK Jr if
you do
how much do you like a Democrat who says
 the Democrat leadership
you know I got to do what I got to do
you like that right
so
um
Gavin Newsom would probably get all the
traditional Democrats I I think
in a fair fight he could take RFK out
just because he'd have so much support
uh from the
from the big structure from the Democrat
Party so I think RFK Jr is going to look
like the the Bernie if if they had a
serious Challenger
now if it goes to the primary and the
only person in the primary against Biden
is RFK Jr well I like irfk Junior's
chances a lot in that case
if it gets to that it's looking very RFK
junior-ish however if Biden drops out a
day before
you know the primary the actual
convention or you know the decision
making
he's the guy you're going to think of
and then the Democrats are going to say
gosh we we never anticipated we'd be in
this situation but what are we going to
do it's an emergency time's running out
oh who will it be who will be our great
savior
gotta do something oh there he is he's
already in the news how about that
everybody knows his name how convenient
and he's related to Nancy Pelosi oh
he'll have all the help he needs
um
all right
so that's what I think the play is I
think the play is for Biden to drop down
at the last minute and freeze out the
other candidates
while Newsom is raising his profile by
doing things that aren't exactly running
for office but look exactly like running
profits
all right the other big story which I
don't believe a bit is that there are
allegedly 17 recordings of abrismo
executive talking to the bidens two of
them with Joe Biden and the rest of them
with Hunter
in which allegedly if you were to hear
these secret recordings
you would hear evidence of bribery five
million dollars a piece
and all run through lots of different
secret accounts so nobody can track it
um
now do you know where the recordings are
has anybody told you where those 17
recordings are physically where do they
exist do you know
no it hasn't been nobody knows nobody's
mentioned that right is the only person
who has them the barisma executive
that's that's the only one who has them
well I have some uh this is breaking
news so I have some information about
this those 17 recordings they're
actually being kept in the same facility
as the 12 UFOs
so it's sort of a combined uh entity
they'll they keep all of the UFOs there
they're about 12 now one of them's as
big as a Coliseum and another one if you
go inside it's bigger on the inside than
the outside so these are the facts that
we know but also all 17 barisma
recordings are kept in the same secret
facility
so that you'll never get to see them
yeah they're all there the Tardis is
there and the and the Battle Star yeah
the Battle Star is there too
so
um I just got to say I don't believe
that these exist or if they exist they
don't say anything useful
what do you think
do you think the walls are closing in
or does this seem a little bit too on
the nose that that you have 17
recordings of the exact crime that
they're suspected
Maybe
let me ask you this do you think that
either hunter or Joe Biden
would be sophisticated enough to get
into this alleged you know massive
bribery money laundering situation
and yet they would say things on a phone
call
that would incriminate them uh
criminally on a phone call
you think you think that the vice
president of the United States would
trust a phone call
knowing that it's the vice president
every foreign entity is going to be
trying to get that call
now there's nobody who trusts a phone
call who does that kind of business that
is in person only
you you don't do that on the phone
if if there's anything I can tell you to
get away with your crimes never ever
admit a crime on a phone call are you
 kidding me
have you ever had somebody record your
calls that didn't tell you about it does
anybody have that experience has anybody
had their phone calls recorded I have
I've had it at least two occasions I've
had people record my calls without
telling me I found out later so later I
found out but yeah I had calls illegally
recorded on me more than once
did I say anything in those phone calls
that would incriminate me
no do you know why because it was a
 phone call
don't say anything on a phone call that
would incriminate you I don't care if
you're like the lowest level criminal or
you're just talking with your
friends
don't ever say anything illegal that you
did or the other person did on a phone
call do not
ever ever
been anything illegal on a phone call
all right
uh thanks to AI this story seems a
little bullshitty to me but I'll read it
anyway the Beatles are going to have a
new album that would include a digital
AI version of John Lennon's vocals now I
guess it's based on some of the vocals
that they had in some kind of recording
but the song itself didn't exist in this
form
so Peter Jackson's working on that with
Paul McCartney and I guess we'll see it
later this year I'm going to make a
prediction about this song
it might get a lot of attention
because it would be cool and Ai and it's
the Beatles
I do not think that you will love this
song
I do not believe that it will stick in
your mind and become a favorite for you
forever
and it has to do with the fact that once
you know AI made it I don't think you're
going to appreciate that the same
and it goes back to my theory that all
art
is an expression of the artists
suitability for procreation and that's
actually what you're responding to when
you look at the art
if it's AI you can't reproduce with an
AI so it just won't have the same hit
just won't give you the same same charge
so I think it will be fascinating and I
will definitely want to hear that thing
but I do not think it will be a hit
except for the novelty of it
all right over in Ukraine there's still
no useful news whatsoever
um
here's something I wonder is it because
the news organizations don't have money
or they don't take risks anymore because
didn't we always have reporting from war
zones until Syria
it wasn't it
the battle against uh Al-Qaeda is where
the the news just stopped covering stuff
in the war zone anyway because it was
always too dangerous right
just way too dangerous but boy does it
seem like it's missing
and here's a question I asked will any
news organization ever get to the point
where they could have their own
loitering
um drone
just to look at the ground and just see
what's happening
because we we get all these videos from
you know a Ukrainian drone and here's
one from a helicopter Russian helicopter
and of course they always showed the
other side getting blown up
so but
couldn't there be a permanently you know
just a permanently hovering news drone
that's just looking at stuff in the
ground
couldn't do it now obviously somebody
would try to shoot it down
but
maybe they're not that expensive maybe
you just have 20 of them and you just
you know send up another one when you
need it I just don't know this is
there's enough
I don't know that there's enough money
in the news business anymore to do
something like that you know because
you'd be talking tens of millions of
dollars probably
anyway the the lack of news goes beyond
what I could expect just by the fact
that it's hard to get news it feels like
something else going on
anyway so some stories of some of these
weddings something else is winning blah
blah blah blah
did you know that back in 2020
the AP which is an organization that
tells you what a style to write in so
they'll tell you what words are allowed
and you know what references or slang
what is not slang and that sort of stuff
and
the AP decided in 2020 that they would
capitalize the b in Black for black
people but they would not and then in a
separate opinion the next day they
clarified that they would not capitalize
the W in white
uh what do you say about that other than
it's as as a comment said racist as
it's not even just a little bit racist
is racist as
that's seriously racist now in my
capacity as a professional writer
I hereby reject the AP style guide
and I adopt you know Chicago style guide
or New York Times or something but I'll
use I just won't use them so I would say
that this disqualifies the AP as a
reasonable guide
because they don't get to tell me what
to write
just just to make it clear the AP
doesn't tell the professional writers
what to write the professional writers
tell the AP what's what what is the
standard but we do it first and then the
AP decides what they liked right but
they don't get to tell you
all right AP doesn't tell you at a right
you tell them or the professional
writers do and then they respond and I'm
telling them
I'm capitalizing both
capitalizing both now the reason I like
capitalizing both is because it adds
clarity
right if you have a lower case then
maybe the word is going to refer to just
the color of some object but as soon as
you capitalize it then all that's very
clear you talk about people so anytime
that you can add Clarity that's
generally better writing
so there's no question which is better
writing no question at all the clear
um the clear Straight Ahead honest way
to do it is to capitalize both
so that's what I've been doing since
since B was capitalized I've capitalized
w
and that's the rule so AP you're wrong
and you need to catch up
the rule is capitalize both
I will make it the rule because I am the
vice president of Witchcraft and
propaganda
not to mention disgrace cartoonist
all right
did you ever wonder what people who were
multiracial feel about this whole thing
you ever think about that
I feel like the multi-racial
segment of the population is the least
served
because you imagine like oh you know I'm
proud of this and I'm proud of that and
then the people who are made of like
four different things are like well what
what the hell am I on four different
things do I get to participate in this
am I discriminating against myself how's
this work
now I've often said that
one of the reasons I don't feel bigoted
against people of different types is
that I always felt like I was a mutt
like I always felt like I was a mixture
of several things
at one point I thought I was Native
American but turns out I got Elizabeth
warned on that I don't have any Native
American blood
but
for most of my childhood I didn't think
I was identifiable as one obvious thing
to me this is how white the town was I
grew up in that this is like super white
if I thought I was a combination of you
know German and Irish and British and uh
Dutch which I am I thought well those
are all different things
so I'm a combination of like all these
completely different things scotch and
German
but if you talk to somebody black
they're going to say well that's the
same thing
don't tell me you're you're Scottish and
British or your Scottish versus Irish
the same thing I don't see any
difference but when I grew up that was a
difference
yeah I mean it was a difference when I
grew up so I always thought I was not
one thing I just thought I was some soup
of things so when I looked at other
people
I never thought oh I'm this thing and
you're you're not my thing you're a
different thing I just said I'm a soup
you're a muffin or soup but we're both
food like it my mindset was not black
and white it was more like mutton muck
so what
we're all mutts so what that was sort of
my my hypothesis at the time
all right
yeah the whole black and white thing is
a political construct it doesn't it
doesn't exactly comport with how I see
the world
and the fact that we call somebody like
Obama black
do you ever stop to think that if being
black was so bad
wouldn't people try to get away with
calling themselves white if they were
half white
or wouldn't they at least say hey I'm
half white if being white was the good
part
clearly not
if if only one of them is capitalized
and anybody who's anybody who's even 25
black wants to call themselves black in
America
uh
so the Discrimination is so bad that
you'd rather call yourself that
so
anyway
that ladies and gentlemen is all I
needed to say today is there any story I
missed that is of great interest to you
and you wish you knew what I said about
it
um
Meghan Markle don't care
oh you're using her as an example of of
a black woman who's not black
Meghan Markle is 25 percent
black
is that right
but does she call herself black
see I just don't understand it I I feel
like if all the people who were at least
two things got together we could rule
the world
and just make all the people who are you
know only one thing
the
I saw a Conan O'Brien was doing a thing
where he got his uh DNA check and he
said that whoever checked his DNA was
amazed that he was the most 100 Irish
person they'd ever seen
yeah he has zero of anything but Irish I
don't even know how that's possible that
doesn't seem it doesn't seem possible to
me like I don't know how you could not
have
something else but
but when I look at Conan and O'Brien I
see somebody who could theoretically be
proud of his ethnicity in theory because
he's exactly one thing
if you're a combination of two things
you're just like everybody else yeah if
you're at least two things even if those
two things are kind of close together ah
you're just a mutt this this whole I'm
white and your black thing is just
complete
you know political theater
all right
although it's not theater that we treat
each other differently
all right uh YouTube I think that's all
we got for you today
and uh
uh did I hear Ben Shapiro's take on the
pride flag yeah his I guess Ben
Shapiro's take this so the pride flag
was being flown at the White House and
he was saying that uh
nobody died for the pride flag or
something
so so he didn't feel like it was like a
regular flag where Patriots die for the
the values of the flag and then other
people said uh
we went to war so that people could be
LGBT gay if they wanted to
LBGTQ not gay uh which I thought was the
better argument
so while I understood what Ben was
saying in a
you know say uh opinion context
um I'm pretty sure that the people who
were fighting for our freedom were
fighting for all of our freedom
it wasn't like fighting for some of our
freedoms I think they were fighting for
all of them
like all the freedoms so that would
include
um
certainly they were fighting for that
flag indirectly in the sense that it's
part of freedom
but I get his point I get his point I
you know the the question of whether
you're putting we're putting too much
uh let's say emphasis in one area of
concern
I think that's a good
point to make we are definitely putting
a lot of emphasis in one area that for
most of us is irrelevant
right
how many of you actually interact with
somebody who's Trans on a daily basis
let's say not daily but let's say a
regular basis how often do you interact
with a trans person
I don't have any contact
you know it's like every single day I'm
forced to talk about the news about
trans this and trans fat it's like they
don't exist in my life
I know they do exist obviously I'm just
saying that I have no contact
I at least that I know of
now I have in the past in you know prior
jobs and stuff I've had contact but it
never mattered
it never mattered it was never anything
of concern it didn't matter to the
person I associated with it didn't
matter to me it just wasn't on anybody's
mind
but to say that it matters now it just
is so not
part of my experience at all
right
um
historic was one right
thank you
uh
yeah how does Hooters handle it what
about all the uh
trans who want to work at Hooters how
does Hooters handle that
I wonder if they can all right that's it
for you YouTube I'll talk to you
tomorrow lots of exciting things
happening today so don't uh don't stop
watching the news bye for now
