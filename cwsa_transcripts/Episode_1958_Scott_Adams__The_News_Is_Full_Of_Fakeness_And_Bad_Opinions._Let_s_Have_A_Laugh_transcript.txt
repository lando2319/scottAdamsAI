good morning everybody
and welcome to the highlight of
civilization it's called coffee with
Scott Adams there's never been a finer
thing that ever happened in your whole
life
and if you'd like to take it up a level
it's not hard all you need is
a copper mugger glass
a tanker Challenger flask
a vessel of any kind filling with your
favorite liquid
I like
I like coffee stop doing funny memes
while I'm trying to do this over on the
on the locals platform they can do
photos in their comments
you're killing me you're killing me all
right it's time now for the
the
dopamine end of the day the unparalleled
pleasure go
oh yeah
is the mug picture wrong oh you're right
I just realized that the finger grip is
a little bit wrong
it should be a two finger grip two
inside yeah good point
well here's a little lesson on how to
handle your critics
um Tech magnate Mark Andreessen
wakes up to find that there's a meme
going around
in which there's a like a competitive
playoff kind of a grid and people are
being asked to vote on the worst people
in Tech
the worst people in Tech and Mark
Andreessen is one of the so-called
competitors
for the worst people in Tech
so he wakes up and sees this is trending
on Twitter and he replies
seriously though any day the Communists
are still in favor of voting is a good
day
pretty good
pretty good
pretty good you know the best you can
hope for is that your retort is more
clever than the attack and that's
definitely more clever than the attack
all right there is a thread by Cliff
Sims
who I guess worked in the dni under
Trump and he tells this story about he
tells two stories about dealing with the
Press
and how the Press just won't listen you
know they come in with a narrative now
he's talking about Natasha Bertrand in
particular but people were asking
Ratcliffe the head of the dni
uh
when the 100 laptop thing came out the
Press was saying
um some people are saying it's Russian
disinformation
and Ratcliffe who would be the one
person in the world most qualified to
know if there's any evidence for Russian
disinformation
said from the start no there's no
evidence whatsoever is Russian
disinformation
and then how did it get reported
well you know might be Russian
disinformation there's just nothing you
can tell you just there's no expert
there's no fact there's just nothing you
can say to the media that will stop them
from writing the biased bias thing but
you have to see Cliff Sims full uh
thread it's in my Twitter feed this
morning if you want to find it or just
go directly to Clifton's
um fake news this morning some of you
might have seen there's a some kind of
house oversight Committee hearing
and uh Congressman Michael Cloud was
talking to a representative
in Colorado in Colorado there was some
witness who was testifying I think it
was this morning maybe yesterday
and the witness said
that for kids thinking about their
gender confusion
that
um the age of consent for mental health
therapy is 12.
in other words if you're a 12 year old
apparently at least within the school
system I think maybe the medical system
too you can ask for medical
mental mental health help
but
um
it's just the the mental health part and
apparently they have the right not to
tell your parents now if there's
anything dangerous going on
of course parents have to be notified
immediately but just in terms of giving
them therapy
I didn't know this but the law is 12
years old I think it might be 16 in
California I'm not so sure I don't might
be different by state but here's the
fake news bar to Congressman Michael
cloud
tweets out in today's house oversight
Committee hearing a far left Democrat
witness said that parents have no right
to know if their kids are going through
sex changes
that never happened
and then he tweets the
the person testifying who doesn't say
that
she she talks about mental health
therapy
talking to him
now you could argue whether you know
they should be allowed to talk to a
mental health expert at the age of 12.
without parental consent
that's a fair discussion
but they but they're not talking about a
12 year old
Julian read read I'm just saying that he
tweeted something that says the opposite
in other words he tweeted the actual
Witness
I listened to the whole thing she said
and she very clearly specified mental
health therapy she'd never set a sex
change operation a 12 year old could get
this is a terrible rumor this is really
bad because you realize that 40 percent
of the people on the right will forever
believe this happened
there's nothing I can do to make people
think this didn't happen this is like
the the drinking bleach hoax once it's
out there
it's just out there and so now now
politics will be completely dominated
by a fake belief that 12 year olds could
give sex to age operations without
talking to their parents
that's not true
that's not true
and you know there's a congressman
tweeting it today
all right
and by the way if it turns out I'm wrong
about that and the 12 year old can get a
sex change operation without their
parents being involved if I'm wrong
about that
we need to fix that right yeah can we
all agree
there's no way that can stand that can't
stand but it's not true
so if anybody can you know make a case
that that's true let me know there's no
way that's true
all right
so musk has apparently some people would
say reversed his position but I don't
think it's that clear
on web um Twitter accounts that track
the location
of airplanes or people
so if your Twitter account is dedicated
to just saying where somebody's going to
be
specifically celebrities and famous
people
um then you will be banned on Twitter
now prior to that he had actually said
explicitly that that would be okay but
apparently he had some security concerns
of his own
and it wouldn't be surprising if that
influenced his opinion but he reports
that this is a musk tweet he said last
night a car carrying little Lacks
now I don't know who Little X is
a rapper famous rapper Maybe
Little X
that's his son
oh my goodness okay I did realize it was
a song okay
um
but was followed by a crazy stalker
thinking it was thinking it was Elon who
later blocked the car from moving and
climbed onto the hood
and you say he legal action against
whoever I know
somebody but uh
what do you think about that do you
think that musk reversed his opinion
or do you think he's just acting to
block things that are obviously inciting
violence
because here's what changed what changed
was the environment
right when whoever was started tracking
musk's airplane because I think that's
maybe where it all started there was a
Twitter account that would just say
where his airplane was going
that was before musk was really targeted
so much
because it was either what he was
thinking about buying Twitter or hadn't
yet
but once he bought Twitter
his own personal security
was a different situation
and if his own personal security is a
different situation then
telling telling the public where he's at
could be physically quite dangerous
right
um so do you think that if somebody is
the type of person who could be targeted
and musk is clearly that type of person
do you think that it it incites violence
to Simply track him and say here he is
at this at this time does that incite
violence
it does accidentally
yeah it does not by intent
well there could be intent I mean you
can imagine somebody having intent but I
don't believe the the original tracker
had that intent but in terms of does
that have that effect
absolutely
does it have the intention
that's not an Evidence but does have the
effect
of inciting people because they know
where you are and they're already mad of
course absolutely now I heard some
pushback saying that musk was saying he
would only ban to you if he did things
that are against the law
right things are against the law
but is it against the law
to tweet that somebody's airplane is at
a certain Airport
no it's not against the law so is musk
now being inconsistent
because he says we won't do anything
that's you know not against the law
all right well here's the argument for
him
inciting violence is illegal isn't it
or is it
is inciting violence legal or illegal
I thought it was illegal maybe it
depends where you are in the context but
is is he supposed to wait until somebody
gets hurt
because that's when the the law is
broken when somebody gets hurt
he's he's changing it before somebody
gets hurt
is he compatible with the law or is he
incompatible with the law
he's saying if somebody does this
somebody might get hurt
but he's stopping them from doing the
crime
but he's also stopping people from
mapping information that would not be
part of a crime so he's doing both
all right what
why are you here Sean
uh some somebody's on on here just to
bother me Sean could you just off
like I'll I'll delete you after I'm done
so you're not going to be on the
platform when I'm done but looking at
your comments and you're just he signed
up for my subscription service just to
be an to me apparently
so what the is wrong with you
really
just get off the platform could you quit
today I'll get rid of you
let me
let me make a note so I can get ready
later
sorry I have to just do this
all right sure that's the last time I'll
put up with your your face God
um
all right
let's go back to the show
all right well no it's not a troll see
the problem with trolls or a very
specific thing there's some people who
are just broken and they need to hurt
other people in public for whatever
reason I mean this person's just
broken so you're you're out of my life
forever
all right
um
so uh one thing I learned in 2022 here's
a little tip for you
would you like a tip on safety
if you're the Kinder person
that somebody might want to kill
and you know there are lots of them the
kind of person that somebody might want
to kill
it's a good idea to let somebody that
you don't like that much borrow your car
I think I've heard at least three
stories this year of somebody who got
attacked because they had a borrowed car
have you heard those same stories
like I think I've seen or three of them
this year right wasn't there the was it
the Russian
maybe it was the Russian whose daughter
blew up because she was borrowed the car
and then
there's a story about something about
the Beatles that I heard
I think one of the other there's some
celebrity who lets somebody else borrow
their high-end car
and got in trouble yeah there's a whole
bunch of stories like that but basically
if somebody's trying to kill you
love somebody that you don't like that
much borrow your car that's that's my
advice all right Trump said that he's
going to make a major announcement today
does anybody have any guesses what that
is he says that we need a superhero
now do you think he's talking about
himself
we need a superhero
because that would be so cringy it's
hard to believe he's talking about
himself now he did show a meme of
himself as a superhero
so it could be he was just referring to
the meme
and it's not really directly related to
the announcement so maybe the superhero
thing is just a diversion as it's just
because there was a fun Meme and has
nothing to do with
anything is that what you think
do you see you think the major
announcement and the superhero Thing are
disconnected right they're just two
things that happen at the same time
because yesterday I was speculating that
he was going to say Carrie Lake had
joined his team or was going to be his
vice president pick or something
now
if he did that
it would basically just throw the the
chessboard on the floor wouldn't it it's
basically just the whole game is up at
that point at that point everything is
up for grabs because if he has just an
ordinary vice president he doesn't have
anything
I think it'd be hard for him to win he's
seeing some crushing polls you know with
DeSantis easily beating him into polls
and stuff
yeah somebody says it it could be a Dean
Kane related announcement
but would that be a major announcement
if let's say Dean Kane
joined his team in some capacity that
would sound like we need a superhero
maybe it's something like that he's so
good
Trump is so good at making us curious
he's always been doing this and it works
every time I hate that it works on me
but I'm actually genuinely curious when
he's what he's got going
uh Dean Kane played Superman in a I
don't know maybe 30 years ago version or
something like that it was a long time
ago
now now by tradition
I don't think there's a law about it but
by tradition presidents don't pick vice
presidents until they're nominated right
that's the tradition but there's no
reason for it is it
is very obstacle to doing it there's no
downside
there's only an upside if you pick the
right person
Adam West's already dead yeah
so
is Trump
um is Trump clever enough to know that
he could regain the
uh the news cycle and maybe they can't
keep Kerry lake off of Twitter
what about that
if he picks his vice president he can
pick a vice president who's not banned
on the social media and that he could
have the vice president just tweet out
his whole campaign
that would be interesting wouldn't it
now the other possibility is that the
the announcement has something to do
with truth social but I doubt it
I doubt it
now I don't think I don't think it's a
Dean Kane thing so what would be big
enough because here's the thing I don't
think Trump is likely to disappoint
I don't think it's in his nature
Trump to say there's something big and
then roll out something small would you
agree would you agree that Trump would
never say there's something big coming
and then roll out with something small
right so
you know he uses hyperbole so he's
always going to say it's bigger than it
is but it's not going to be small
so what is there
yeah any and he says we need a superhero
which makes me think it's something
about a person now he might be the
person
but I don't know the smart play
would be announcing Carrie Lake before
you're supposed to because the first
thing that would happen is the news
would jabber forever about how you're
not supposed to name your vice president
right that's like that's like free money
because it's so easy to talk about
that that's how you know it would be a
story everybody would talk about oh
historically we haven't here's the
reason we don't but why did he do it why
is it different this time is there
something special about Kerry Lake that
it makes sense is there something
special about the landscape of the news
where it makes sense is everything
moving faster is there really a thing
called Trump time
see what I mean you could talk endlessly
that's not really even terribly
important
it's like a little tradition with no no
special backing to it
so
if that's what he has in mind
it would be brilliant
if it's not what he has in mind it
better be good
it better be good
because yeah he's he's teased it would
be big
and if he teases something big and
doesn't come through
now it's not going to be a lawsuit
because he said
uh could be it could be a lawsuit if if
you're sure that the superhero part is
not connected to what the announcement
is
I guess that's possible yeah I'll give
you that that's possible but I don't I
don't feel like a lawsuit is a
like a big announcement
do you
like would Trump say a lawsuit was a big
announcement
it's got to be people
it's got to be it's got to be a human
there's something about a human being
like all it's like a glaring signal
because it's Trump trump doesn't make a
big announcement about paperwork does he
you think Trump's going to make a big
announcement about paperwork
I don't think so a legal process
that that would be so counter to his
instincts
of you know being a good promoter and
what what actually excites people all
right
is anybody blown away as I am
that we still don't agree as a country
whether the vaccinations were
unambiguously a good idea or
unambiguously a bad idea now I don't
want to hear anything about
myocarditis in young men
stipulated
I'll even stipulate it
can I beg you can I beg you not to
mention it because we all already know
it
I'm just begging you just don't say it
we all know it okay there is no
conversation
about young men that part we can agree
on right are you right is it but the
rest of the people
all right I will stipulate
that the data is sketchy for young men
okay stipulated
okay I simulate that so you don't have
to say it
but let's just say uh for uh older
people
and I would be curious just to see where
you're at right now now my current
opinion is how would I know
that's my current opinion how would I
know
so I think there are three opinions and
two of them are unsupported
right if we can agree on this stipulated
part
that young men seem to have a greater
risk with a vaccination everybody seems
to know that now but for not that group
for the people older older than that
just older
forget about kids that's a whole
different conversation but for the older
population how many of you think that
the vaccinations were more good than bad
or more bad than good go
just for the older people
older only older only
oh wow I'm surprised
I'm very surprised
yeah there's a big difference between
the locals and the uh the Youtube people
YouTube is says more more bad than good
and locals is more good than bad
by the way either way it proves my point
how in the world could we be here
and not know that
that I mean how could it be
is there anything more important than
that like literally how could we be at
this point and still disagree
about whether the vaccinations worked or
didn't for older people only older
people only older people
I have to say that every time
how is that even possible
now uh so the three the three opinions
are it was the VAC the so-called vaccine
oh here's the other thing can I could I
do another stipulation one more
stipulation
I never ever
want to hear you tell me
that you shouldn't call them
vaccinations because they don't stop the
spread
everybody knows that everybody knows
that
I will stipulate it if you'll please
please stop saying it I know
simulated
so I was listening to a little clip by a
comedian Dana Gould it was very funny
one of my favorites but his routine was
it's interesting because in his bubble
he said
basically that how could anybody be
against the what he called vaccinations
which I stipulate icipulate icipulate
that when he used the word vaccination
icipulate
that they don't actually stop the spread
of transmission
it's just something he said
um and he said
how in the world
are we let's say going against the
experts I'm paraphrasing
basically he said
everything that we do in life we're
trusting experts so why is this
different
he says I use my zipper I don't know how
that works but I use it anyway
so his view was everything
that you do is because some expert told
you it was okay
it's no different so why wouldn't you do
the vaccinations
totally totally good point right
and then he mocked his brother
for not getting vaccinated because his
brother said he he doesn't know what
goes into those vaccinations like he
doesn't know how that works
and then Dana said
again paraphrasing
that you don't know anything works like
it's a crazy point just because his
brother doesn't know how that works his
brother doesn't know how anything works
that's you know technical
so how do you make any decisions
and
I tweeted that and I made the following
observation
who is more likely to screw you
somebody who knows more than you about
the topic or someone who knows a lot
less than you about the topic
over the course of your life have you
been more screwed by people who knew
more than you
let's say crypto
crypto would be a good current kind of
thing why do you think that uh Sam
bankman freed could build you know his
company FTX and get away with it
because he knew more than you know he's
the expert
right
uh
a hundred percent of the people who
you are the ones who know more than you
that's how they do it
do you know when people uh do like
Financial scams on you or they you know
do insider trading
is the insider trading happening because
they know less of you
no it's because they know more than you
that's how it works it's the knowing
more than you that's the whole trick
everything depends on them knowing more
than you they can't fool you if you know
more than them
okay I don't know how more clear that
could be
the people who know less than me almost
never fool me
do you know why because they know less
than I know
that's why
it's only the people who know more than
you in politics in economics you know
every every form of Finance
crypto everything is only the people who
know more than you that are screwing you
um doc Anarchy has another great threat
that actually need to be subscribing to
his sub stack to see it all
but he's going after the AMA and the
medical
and medical studies
and once you see how often the people
who know more than you have
intentionally lied to get a drug passed
you would have to have no context in
your life whatsoever to think that
vaccinations are safe because the people
who know more than you told you they
were
the worst reason
now there might be I'm very explicitly
not giving you my opinion on whether
these so-called vaccinations that don't
vaccinate whether they're more good than
bad
how would I know
I mean seriously how would I know and
somebody's going to say oh do your own
research Scott it's all out there no it
isn't
nothing I believe is out there because
everything out there would be put
together by who
what would be a general description of
all the people who put together those
studies you think I should look into
like a general description of them are
they people who know more than I do
right so I can't check their work
I can't check the work because I know
more than I do now I can check some of
them I mean some of them just are like
screamingly obviously but I
can't check all of them because they
know more than I do David Gould
all right
um
I'm thinking of creating a
sort of a version of me that's like the
dark version
I can't you know it's like everything
like me but it's like opposite me
like wherever I have a socially
appropriate opinion you know dark Scott
would be the one that's the opposite
because over on Reddit there's a version
of me that's dark Scott and I I can tell
when they come over to Twitter because
they all have the same misinformation
so over on Reddit they believe I was Pro
mask
I actually led a anti-mask campaign
they think I'm pro-vaccination
I delayed as long as I could until I
wanted a vacation got the minimum I
needed for the vacation and never looked
back right so that's that's Pro
vaccination do I think the vaccinations
helped me I don't know I just know I had
a good vacation that's all I know I
don't know anything else I had to make a
choice
cost benefit no information I just made
the one where I could have a good
vacation
um so there and then
um what was the other one
uh oh oh also on Reddit they believe
that I'm in favor of digital passports
so so dark Scott is in favor in favor of
digital passports masks and vaccinations
and I promoted all of those things
all opposite all opposite none of that's
true now on Twitter mostly people know
that
but when the people there's a bunch of
trolls coming over I think it's because
I'm not positive
but when I started hitting Tick Tock
hard
I started getting a lot of trolls on
unrelated topics
and one of one of the um
consistent ones I think they're from
Reddit but they could be just Chinese
trolls one of the consistent ones is a
tweet in which I was
uh questioning people on digital
passports for vaccinations which are not
vaccinations really I'm going to
stipulate that they're not actual
vaccinations
don't want to start any rumors
so
I wonder if that's China
is it a coincidence I'm talking about
canceling Tick Tock and then suddenly
trolls with all the same message are
hitting me now here here's my take on
digital passports here's why it confused
people
I talk about both sides of every issue
if you talk about both sides of every
issue somebody can you know just delete
the conversation and take one side of it
and say that's who you are so that's
what happens on Reddit
but I think that's maybe just Chinese
trolls I don't know
but here's my take on digital passports
whether it's for vaccinations which I
simulate
or not actually vaccinations it's a
misleading word
stipulated
um
here's why people think I'm in favor of
digital passports because I've said
do you know they can do all of that to
you they can track everywhere you are
right now
and they can turn off all your finances
anytime they want
what do you think happened to SBF
the the FTX CEO
do you think they knew where he was
yes
they did
do you think they could turn off his
banking
yes
the government just has to care about
you that's all they they simply have to
care about you and they can do anything
they want you know they can send people
to your house with guns right
they can drag you out of your house put
you in a little cell
they can do anything they want
now would it be inappropriate illegal
um yeah
yeah but they have all those tools so if
you give them and and here's what people
said they said okay Scott I got I got
that they can get you know for all
practical purposes they can track you
everywhere for all practical purposes
yeah January six people
already and they can also turn off your
banking for all practical purposes but
you don't want to make the mistake of
making it easy right
so that's the pushback no if you make it
easier they're going to use it more
right
anybody agree with that if you if you
make it a digital passport and they can
just push the one button and you just
disappear from the grid
that's worse right
now you know what's wrong with that
right let me tell you what's wrong with
that
the person who is capable of making that
decision about you
they don't push the button
they don't they don't have like a
dashboard at their big old desk and
they're sitting there like I don't like
that tweet that Adam's just sent Adams
and there's the Adams button boom you're
gone
you think the person who makes the
decision pushes the bottom
no
they say to an underling
make this person go away
and then the underling does extra work
but does the boss care
no the boss doesn't care
do you think the uh I don't know
district attorney or whoever is going to
be tracking and turning off somebody's
uh resources do you think the district
attorney does it himself
no there's some underling you know puts
the paperwork together to do whatever
needs to be done so I don't think it
makes any difference
I don't I think they can turn off
anything that can track you anywhere
it's a very small difference now did
that sound like I'm in favor of digital
passports
did it
I think it's fair to say that if he had
digital passports for anything it would
provide you some conveniences
it would take away a little bit of
freedom because you write and make it
like a little bit easier
but the difference is so trivial
it's probably a trivial difference now
did I say I'm in favor of it did you
hear me say I'm in favor of digital
passwords no I just said it was the
potential risk in the potential upside I
just described it I simply described it
that's a
so I I can't call myself dark atoms um
because there's a movie out called Black
Adam
very confusing you know The Rock has a
movie out so I can't be Black Adams
that would be confusing
so I guess I'll have to hold off on that
[Applause]
what else has happened
um
you know Rubio is uh and a couple of
Congress people are trying to stop tick
tock to ban it and Rubio was talking on
Tucker's show about that and
to Rubio's credit
allow me to give Senator Rubio a little
compliment
he was able to describe the risk of tech
talk accurately
he described it not not only in terms of
the privacy because they collect all the
information that's only part of the risk
and maybe the smaller part he accurately
can explained that they could use it to
influence and probably did and he had an
anecdote of where they probably did but
whether the anecdote is true or not
it demonstrates that it's a thing they
can do very easily
now let me tell you why this is really
clever and something's going to happen
here
really soon
have you ever heard anybody argue for
keeping tick tock
like a a person in Congress any any
politician any kind no not one
not one
and Tucker said do you think you have
enough Democrat votes
and I sat there watching that saying
what
you have them all
there's no Democrat vote you don't have
there's not a single person who is on
the other side
and then I said to myself are they
really going to vote against it
just because it's there's a Democrat uh
what is a bipartisan bill
are the Democrats going to vote against
a bipartisan bill because a republican
likes it but it's also bipartisan
so here's what I think is going to
happen
we're going to find out who China owns
for the first time we're going to have
unambiguous evidence I would say proof
because real literally there's no other
argument
if anybody votes against this bill
and and doesn't have some clever reason
that you haven't heard yeah there might
be some clever reason that I haven't
heard yet but if somebody votes against
it and doesn't give you a reason they're
owned by China
no doubt about it
check check my reasoning
check my reasoning because this is a big
accusation
there's no there's no counter argument
nobody's ever offered one the news has
never reported one
and even when they talk about the bill
it's bipartisan and neither of them are
aware of anybody who has a different
opinion
there's no awareness of any different
opinion
for the first time we'll know for
 sure
who the Traders are
we're good to know for sure
I'm not wrong we're actually going to
find out who the Traders are because I
think if they're bought off they're
still gonna have to vote for China
and it's going to be right there
it's going to be right there
and you know some people are saying
Mitch because he's his wife is
chinese-american
I think that's both unfair and also
let's keep an eye on them
is racist and unfair to assume that you
know McConnell is going to be in the
tank for China because his his wife has
some connection yeah I know it's a
Taiwanese connection I understand the
difference but
I don't think that's fair
but on the but on the common sense well
let me let me separate it
as a citizen of the United States who
loves his Constitution and says
everybody's innocent until proven guilty
it's totally unfair
to think that Mitch is in the tank for
China because his wife who's Taiwanese
or has a Taiwanese connection
totally unfair
but in the common sense world
which is a different world right there's
the Constitution what's right and how do
you how do you want to you know what
kind of society Do you want to build
in that world
don't come close to this topic right
that that's off base
but in the real world people are
influenced by their spouse
there's no exception to that you don't
think Trump was at least a little bit
influenced by Melania sometimes I mean I
don't know what topics but of course he
was you can't not be influenced by your
spouse that's not a thing
so you got to keep an eye on him but I
think it's unfair to just assume there's
something bad going on there
all right um this census picks up the
free money again
so Florida is going to hold the medical
establishment accountable who says
DeSantis so he's got a grand jury
and it's going to investigate mRNA shots
and big Pharma and they're going to
investigate cardiac related deaths tied
to the MRNA vaccination
now I don't have a prediction of how
that will go
well I'm not not entirely sure what
their fact finders would find and if I'd
believe them anyway
so who knows but the part that's salient
is as free money
are you telling me that all the other
Governors could have done this
is that true because there's some
there's some rule in Florida
that there's a law that says you can't
mislead stuff people about medical stuff
but is there only one state that has
that law there's only one state that
says you can't mislead people about
medical stuff
that feels like maybe that's a little
more common than one state
so why in the world
why in the world
is only Florida
picking this up
and the answer has to be the obvious the
DeSantis can recognize free money
and every time he walks by a table with
free money he's like hey
does anybody own this money
and everybody's like and then he just
like Scoops it up and takes his free
money
you know you this is like two points of
Support over Trump
this is free
like you can imagine DeSantis looking at
this you know I don't know who had the
idea whatever but what he's evaluating
whether he should do this he's probably
like okay if I do this my approval will
go up two percent compared to Trump
and what's what's my downside
and they'll say well they'll think
you're a like a vax denier
and then he'll say I'm not doing that
I'm getting people who know more than I
do
to to figure out what's true I'm the
opposite of knowing what happened
the opposite is I don't know what
happened
so I'm getting some smart people to
figure out what happened
it's pretty easy to defend
you know no matter where it comes down
you could say I didn't tell you where it
was going to end up I told you it's
important and the people care and we
have to look into it that's my job my
job is not to tell you where it ends up
so I mean it's a perfect position it's
it's completely logically
morally ethically it's just clean
it's like the cleanest
thing a politician could ever do
why is he the only one who ever sees it
it's just free money just sitting there
he picks it up
all right uh Rasmussen I asked uh I
think it's likely voters is the economy
better or worse in the past year
your opinion please is the economy
better or worse in the past year go
better or worse in the past year in the
past year is the key in the past year
better or worse
it's not obvious is it I don't know
either I have no idea
I don't think we'll know for a long time
probably we can point to things that are
worse
and we can point to things that are
improving
but is anybody smart enough to net that
out
you know I mean I guess you could look
at the GDP and say that's a net but not
really because inflation subtracts from
the GDP
I know that this is one of the few times
when I look at a survey and I say yeah
that makes sense
makes total sense that people are mixed
because probably if you lost your job it
looks worse
if you've if you don't own things that
appreciate with with inflation it looks
worse
so I guess it just depends what TV
you're watching and
you know what's happening to you
personally
yeah
so to me it looks like it's a little
better
totally subjective and you could talk me
out of that opinion in like a second
like I'm not wed to it at all but I'll
tell you just my impression but I think
I have you know optimistic poisoning you
know I'm basically
you know optimism driven
Dao's down five thousand well not today
right
you're not talking about today are you
yeah down two percent
yeah so and you all know that the market
gets frothy at the end of the year
's here's a little uh personal
investment tip it goes like this
stocks always get frothy they they jump
up and down toward the end of the year
because there are a lot of people who
are saying um I need to take my gains or
my losses and this this calendar year so
people are doing a lot of moving around
just for tax reasons but also there's
something that gets into our psychology
about the end of a year
right there are lots of
rumors or not a rumor
there are some historical Trends about
year ends
where people will look at the history
and say oh it always goes up in January
where I think it goes up does anybody
have the actual number the number of
times that the market is up in January
compared to December it's uh like
seven out of nine something like that
does anybody have the actual number
there there is a history to January as
being good
uh and and recently we've violated that
Trend I think
 you money causes optimism
you know I I I'm barely rich
you you should have a few divorces and a
lot of inflation and then have
newspapers get whacked and then get
canceled by one of your bigger clients
yeah now I'm definitely for for me
personally
my economic situation is way down
I mean it doesn't matter because I'm at
retirement age but in terms of earning
income well as well as assets
probably down
30 percent
since before Trump
something like that
um no I'm not broke yeah I'm not
complaining
yeah I hear you I hear you I I will
stipulate
that I'm not suffering
we can all agree on that okay you don't
have to mock me for it
um
all right yesterday I did something
fascinating
I joined a spaces where there's the
audio conversation so it's just audio on
Twitter and the topic was reparations
and
um a big percentage of the audience were
black Americans I assume based on their
profiles and what I could hear and I'd
never been I'd never had the privilege
and I think it was a privilege actually
to be exposed to opinions that are so
different
from my own
it was actually kind of
it's like really good it was really
interesting just to hear somebody who's
so different
so different in an opinion and I didn't
catch it all so there may be some
nuances I missed so I don't want to I
don't want to characterize the whole
thing but there was a pattern that I
noticed
and it goes like this
people in favor of reparations didn't
understand how Economics work
and would speak in public as if they did
which tells you how deeply
their lack of understanding of Economics
is
now I want to make sure that we don't
get don't like drift into racist
territory here
because you do know that the black
community in America
is very vocal about we need more
economics training
personal finance and economics you've
heard that right that's a real thing and
that and that is a real in my opinion
that's that's a sign of systemic racism
meaning just the system not with any
intention but sometimes the system just
gets you into a situation that nobody
intended and one of those is
I believe that white people in general
this is not true of all people nothing's
true of all people
I think white people sort of pick it up
by osmosis
like you you just pick up
economics just by hanging around it
is that true and I'll give you a
specific example
and I didn't realize that I'd gotten an
entire economics lesson as a child until
I saw somebody else on Twitter
mentioned that his mother
gave him two rules I hope I wrote those
down I'd be so bad if I didn't
um
and the two rules were
uh
one was life isn't fair
oh what was the other one
life isn't fair and nothing's free thank
you thank you very much yeah so he said
his mother taught him life isn't fair
and nothing's free
that's exactly what my mother taught me
exactly life isn't fair
and and if he didn't work for it you
didn't deserve it basically nothing's
free
if you unpack that
that's the entire theory of economics
I didn't even realize that until this
morning
it's the entire theory of economics
life isn't fair nothing's free if you
just took that little that little seed
and just say all right what does that
mean like what like what does that imply
free markets
capitalism it's all there the entire
thing is there
with just life isn't fair nothing's free
because what that told me to do in life
is what
find my advantage
that other people didn't have why
because life isn't fair
and my mother told me that specifically
life isn't fair go go where it's unfair
in your favor
so I went exactly where it was unfair
in my favor
to college
because I knew as a young white man in
America during those years if I went to
college
I could pretty much own the world
and so I did I just found my unfair
advantage and I took it now if you're
black in America
what are you going to do what's your
unfair advantage
do you have any
yes you do yeah you have plenty
unfair Advantage number one you could
get more funding to go to college
now I'm not I'm not ignoring all the
disadvantages
we will simulate
that being black in America comes with a
bag of disadvantages
but they're but life is unfair
so find where you have an advantage go
to any you know get your college
education that's more likely paid for
than not
go to any Fortune 500 company and apply
for a job with your college education
and they will favor you over pretty much
everybody
that's your advantage you can just walk
into any company and they'll hire you
if you're qualified
I can't do that
it pretty much only black people in
America can get any job they want if
they're qualified
white people can't get any job they want
if they're qualified they can work in
their field
pretty much every time right like if
you're if you've got some skills you can
work in that field but if you're a black
American you can get close to 100 of
jobs you apply for if you're qualified
because there's a preference it's an
unfair Advantage at the moment that they
should take advantage of and do you have
you ever heard me bitching
uh that black people have that like
little narrow advantage opposite I
recommend they take advantage of it
because I'm doing it if I find an
advantage for myself I'm going to be all
over it
that's how the system works if you find
an advantage for yourself that I don't
have
please exploit it
that's how my system works better you
exploit your advantage I exploit my
advantage if it's legal we exploit our
advantages and then the whole thing
Rises that's how it works
let me give you an example of how the
participants did not understand
economics one one proponent of
reparations
said people don't understand that when
you do something
that helps black Americans that
everybody else does does well too so
it's almost like it's free
have you ever heard me say that
have you ever heard me say that if you
did reparations it actually might be
good for everybody I have they have so
I've made that same point
that anything that helps Black America
helps everybody right now what's wrong
with that
you see what's wrong with it
in the context of reparations it's not
yes or no reparations
that's not how you do economics that's
not how you do decision making
here's how you do it and this is
something I learned but maybe maybe
black Americans don't have access to the
same
out of the same mentoring or something
but here's what I learned you have to
make the right comparison
the comparison is not reparations yes or
no it's not like there's a bucket of
money
that sits there unspent if we don't do
reparations
reparations have to be compared to all
other uses for money
you all knew that right
the money is not ear barked
you know with the government collects
taxes and they raise debt to pay for
things but they get to decide on all
those things and all of those things
have to be weighed against all the other
things
so if you're going to say reparation is
yes or no that just shows you know how
to understand how anything works because
it's not even the right question
you can't get the right right answer to
the wrong question that doesn't move you
forward here's the right question
if you add let's say reparations were
going to cost I know
what trillion dollars or something
just pick a number the question is what
else could you use the trillion dollars
for
and if the answer is giving money to
everybody who's poor
or or fixing all the schools for
everybody
which would be better for the economy
well almost certainly it would be better
to give two poor people extra help
than it would be to give one poor black
person some extra reparations and one
rich black person some preparations
am I wrong if you found a poor you know
chinese-american uh
and a poor black American and they're
both really poor and you helped those
two people don't you get more bang for
your buck than if you helped one poor
black person poor black American and one
uh well-off black American
there's no question right so the people
were saying that helping black Americans
helps everybody therefore that's my
analysis that's just somebody who
doesn't understand really basic
economics
here's something else that one of the
speakers said people are worried that it
would cause inflation but they don't
understand that it won't
that printing money we don't have a
trillion dollars of giving it to Black
Americans won't cause inflation why
because it would help the economic
activity
so that would not hurt inflation it
would boost the economic activity so you
don't have to worry about inflation
does anybody see a problem with that
do you know where inflation comes from
it comes from every boost of economic
activity
it comes from printing money and
throwing it into the system no matter
where
it doesn't matter where you put the
money it's all inflationary and and so a
gentleman argued that it wasn't
inflationary by its nature
by its nature it wasn't inflationary
because it was good for
you know the economy
now
that is the least understanding of
Economics you could ever have
now it's not a reason not to do it
I'm not saying that you should not do it
because of inflation I'm saying you
should at least understand it
you know understand the interplay
between putting money into the system
and inflation
so
I my experience was and by the way
nobody pushed back
that I heard I didn't hear anybody raise
their hand and say oh you know I had
just a correction any money you put into
the system is inflationary there's no
exception to that
is there is there any exception to that
I mean this wouldn't be one but maybe
there is uh
so
there's part of me who believes
that we don't have a
[Music]
a racial and philosophical divide
we have a knowledge problem
and that people have similar knowledge
end up in the same place
where economics is involved
and you have this weird situation where
Black America is practically screaming
that they know they need fine personal
finance and economic
education and they're asking for it to
be included in in schools and stuff I'm
totally on board with that but don't you
think that's one place where the
Republicans can not only agree with
black Americans completely but the more
aggressively they help them get what
they're asking for in that domain
the better off everybody's gonna be Am I
Wrong what Republican is going to be
worse off because black Americans are
you know brought up to speed on finance
that's just all good right there's
nothing bad about that in any way
yeah teachers unions are the problem
once again you were correct
um
and that ladies and gentlemen
is a conclusion of my exciting show was
there anything I missed today I feel
like there was a story I missed
Milton Friedman yeah Milton Friedman
sort of a challenging place to start I
wouldn't start anybody with Milton
frieden
I'm a fan
but I wouldn't start there I'd start
simpler
uh handing out money to people for
nothing never works
well here's the problem with never
never make sense when the environment is
similar
but we're as we enter the AIA
Singularity and the age of robots
we might have to rethink that giving
money to somebody for nothing doesn't
work
it might always be true I'm open to the
fact that there's nothing that could
change that
but
there might be no other alternative
there might just not be enough jobs
we'll see
uh subtract BLM riots from reparation
debt well yeah
yeah and here's the other thing I've
said this before if you were going to
calculate how much the reparation should
be
how would you do that
well if you understood economics
and here's the problem again the per the
yeah you would compare to Nigeria or you
would compare to wherever in Africa the
slaves were originally taken from you
would say how is that local population
doing
compared to the people who had The
Misfortune of Being slaves
and I think you would find that the
descendants of the slaves are doing
better than the descendants of the
people who uh captured them
probably the people who captured the
slaves and sold them but stayed in
Africa themselves probably not doing so
well
I don't know probably not
a supremacist
somebody just called me a white sip
premises okay that's pretty clever
see that that's why I accept my uh
inaccurate name CLA Adams because it's
funny
as long as it's funny I'm okay with it
right
humorous is good
all right um
start with Hayek
have you been to a school in Baltimore
how can you genuinely blame that
situation on the teachers of the schools
or the Nea
easily choice
that's how it's done
yeah the the teachers unions
make it impossible to have an option
if they had a more of a free market
School in Baltimore you don't think it
would be better
if the kids who went to the school that
totally doesn't work the public one
had an option
of going to some kind of a private one
that did work you don't think anybody
would make that choice
now I know what you're saying you're
saying that Baltimore it looks like the
people are the problem is that what
you're going to say like if you're
actually there it just looks like it's
just a tough neighborhood and nothing's
going to work
but there's always somebody
in any group who can get out and they
don't have an option now
all right
here's the question somebody asked me he
says you Trump meaning me Trump certain
 to Santa scary Lake Tulsi uh and
Georgie Milani on a desert island for a
year who's the boss all right let me
think
me Trump service DeSantis
Carrie Lake Tulsi gabbard
Giorgio Milani on the desert island
who's the Boss
no no that's a tough one
that's a tough one it's a tough one
because I always say me
that would be me that'd be me
it would be me
now I wouldn't necessarily be
um
in charge
so I wouldn't necessarily be the the
leader
but I'm pretty sure I would get what I
wanted
so here's here's one of the tricks in my
my book that I'm just finishing
so
um I've got a chapter on knowing who has
the power
and lots of times we we mistakenly think
that the person has the title of boss
has the power
but there's so many times that's not
true
and the primary time that's not true
is if somebody has a better idea
in my experience the person with the
best ideas
is always in charge
whoever the boss is is almost irrelevant
if the boss says in a meeting and
there's one person who comes up with an
idea that's just clearly obviously the
right thing to do what's the boss going
to say
don't do that
now Whoever has the best idea is always
in charge
so when you ask me about the island
you were probably thinking all right
who's the alpha like who would be the
most
uh let's say power-centric person who
would become the natural leader and I
think that would either be Trump or
cervich or DeSantis probably
because I think on an island it would
end up being male
because if you're on an island
there's no social anything the men are
in charge
I mean maybe Kerry Lake Rises to the top
but not really I think the men are in
charge if it's just no law so then you
would say who's the most Alpha you know
and you look at okay who could win a
fight
from that group like if it turned it
like if it turned into a cage match like
he he would win the fight
so does that make him the leader of the
island
well
I still say that how the island is Run
for the benefit of all is a question of
having the best ideas
so regardless of whether the strongest
or the you know if it's Trump or whoever
whoever has the best ideas is still
going to get
the biggest influence
so who has the power
the person with the title the best ideas
what would you say in your way of
viewing
does the boss have the power because
they have the ability I guess to fire
somebody or does the employee who is
indispensable and has all the good ideas
to be as easy the employee has all the
power
now you could argue it but as but as a
way of living and going through my life
I walk into every environment thinking
I'm in control
it's not true
right it's not true but I never walk
into a room that I don't think I control
because I I have enough skill that if I
needed to I could
it's just usually you don't need to
who would eat first
uh Carey Lake's lawsuit she is a lawsuit
against Maricopa is that the one you're
talking about
yeah
so I don't know if there were any
lawsuits
that we'll find does a lawsuit
have to find standing it does right I
don't know enough about the law but
won't the court say the same thing that
they always say which is the election's
already over
or something like that it's like we
don't we don't listen to cases where our
ruling would have no there's no point to
it
because we're not going to go back in
time and change it
right
but maybe if they're just suing some
individuals or something maybe it's
different I don't know
yeah Karen Lake says she has evidence of
malfeasance now here's what you need to
do
how many remember when the initial
claims of election malfeasance came up
in 2020 you remember I said soon early
and often I said that most 95 of all the
claims you hear will be
and that I didn't know if five percent
would be true
but I could guarantee that at least 90
would not be true
have I done
wouldn't you say that 95 of the claims
were definitely not true
so far which has nothing to do with
whether it was fair or not
separate questions
I'm just saying there will always be ten
to one uh untrue statements at least
if not all right at least ten to one
so now you say Kerry lake is now one of
the ten
and she has claims that she even has a
whistleblower right so so it doesn't
even matter how how strong the claim
sounds right but
so would you say that the existence of
The Whistleblower
plus whatever you think about Carrie
Lake's own reputation and credibility do
you think that those two suggest that
this will be in the five percent
or will it be in the 95 percent that
turn out to be almost every
time
2000 mules hasn't panned out
has it
in my opinion 2000 mules has not been
demonstrated
to some level of certainty I would say
that's another one that hasn't panned
out which doesn't mean it's not true
it just hasn't panned out
yeah
so I would say
that
I don't have an opinion of whether Kerry
Lake's um
claims are accurate or enough that they
wouldn't change the election so I don't
have an opinion on that
I do have an opinion that if I were
looking at it from space
I would say there's a 95 chance it
either can't be proven
or it'll be shown to be irrelevant to
the courts because of what the courts
consider their domain and what isn't
is that fair is that is that is a fair
position I genuinely don't have any way
to know if her claims are good and I
also don't have any sense of whether she
could be fooled by false claims
because I think we all can I mean you
remember me thinking that the Kraken was
real
right I consider myself a sophisticated
consumer of news and when somebody with
a good reputation stands in front of the
world and says I'm going to show you the
Kraken tomorrow
I believe that
I mean I just took it on face value it's
like oh good reputation you would make
that kind of claim unless you had the
goods
and then it turns out
um I think she was bamboozled
I think she believed that but she was
Bamboozled so do you think is there
anything that you know about Kerry Lake
that would tell you that she would be
less gullible
than Sydney Powell
what is it you know about the two of
them
you would say oh Sidney Powell was
gullible in that case
but Kerry Lake would never fall for that
trick
I don't know because I've seen even
myself Fall From That Trick right how
many of you fell for it how many of you
thought that Kraken was coming didn't we
all fall for it
I'll bet you 80 of the people watching
this live stream fell for the Kraken
because you thought Sidney Powell was a
credible person because the news told
you she was I watched Fox News and Fox
News kept saying oh
yeah Cindy Powell she's the real deal
been around forever good reputation I
believed it
now I also believe
Kerry lake is smart and capable and has
a good reputation
exactly what I thought about Sydney
Powell
so having made the exact mistake before
of listening to a what I thought was a
credible high-powered successful woman
telling me something in the woman parts
unimportant a high-powered successful
person
telling me something was true and I was
going to see it tomorrow
I don't know you kind of believe that
for at least a day until it doesn't
happen
all right so here's the other thing you
need to know about Carrie Lake
um and her situation
so this is independent from the
personality
this would be true of anybody in her
situation
they would be in cognitive dissonance
you could take Kerry Lake out of this
situation just take her out and plop in
anybody you choose the smartest wisest
person you know just put them in their
exact situation how would they feel
exactly the way she feels
the the evidence and what we all watched
would make anyone feel the way she feels
but does that mean she's right
no it means she had a perfect situation
for cognitive distance
she had the trigger look for the trigger
the trigger is there the trigger is she
was positive she won that was her world
view or that she would at some point she
was probably sure
and then it didn't happen
that's a trigger for cognitive
dissonance anybody you put there
would think it was rigged anybody and I
think the same for Trump
Trump is different because he'll say out
loud it was rigged as many times as he
wants no matter how many times you tell
him not to
so that's different about Trump but you
don't think that everybody who loses an
election that's close and sketchy
looking thinks it's rigged they all do
of course of course they do Trump leaves
what anybody would believe in his
situation Kerry Lake believes what
anybody would believe in that situation
including me right so if it turns out
she's wrong
trust me I would have been wrong in that
same situation and so would you so would
you yeah she's a she's in an impossible
situation it's basically a cognitive
dissonance of vice grip
she could be totally right
I'm not gonna I don't even have an
opinion what's likely honestly she could
be totally right
but she is in the grip of cognitive
dissonance where whether she's right or
wrong she's only going to see one side
now if that side is the correct side
well good for her but her level of
certainty
and the amount of evidence she says she
has which sounds pretty pretty important
uh you can't really trust it at this
point
in the process
are you are you kidding me that Trump
made a major announcement it was super
digital trading cards
oh please tell me that wasn't it
oh oh really
oh God
yeah
do you see the pro the uh analytical
problem that I made here
where I was speculating that you might
be announcing you know Carrie Lakers VP
Kerry lake is VP is what old Trump might
have done
2015 Trump might have done that like if
he had been in this situation in 2015.
like old I think I think past Trump
would have
made a bigger play
I don't think past Trump would have said
it's a big announcement about digital
trading cards now is it a fundraiser
is he using it as his fundraiser is that
what it is
yeah it's a oh it's a trump card or is
it a trump card
yeah it's like he quit huh doesn't it
look like he's just playing it for
um business purposes I mean that's what
we thought the first idea ran and he
surprised us
all right I I just have to see on
Twitter what people are saying about
this
actually I would look on Truth social
because it's probably on there right
let's find the actual announcement
drum Trump
you've probably already found it and
you're telling me right now
but I'm looking down I don't see it
all right my official Donald Trump
digital trading card collection is here
these limited edition cards feature
amazing art of my life and career
uh
get your cars now 99 each
all right
I I think I know who the artist is but I
have to confirm that
if the artist is who who I think it is
it's somebody you're gonna like
somebody you've seen on Twitter
so
Trump trading cards for 99 dollars
wait is this for the campaign for who or
for himself
it's just a Christmas gift
Trump digital cars or nfts
well
so you may not know this about nfts so
an nft is a digital it's usually art
digital art that because of the
blockchain you can know who the real
owner is and if anybody has a copy
they're not the real owner because only
the blockchain tells you who the real
owner is
so but one of the things that a
um nft does that's different from
regular art is that if you create it
with a feature that would give you a
percentage every time it's resold to
anybody anytime in the future because
you can do that because everything goes
back to the blockchain
you can make a huge amount of money
selling something for a dollar
let me make the case let's say that
Trump sold one card for one dollar
and that's it
and but he said anybody who resells this
I get 10 percent
so the dollars that resells it for two
dollars
and he gets 10 of that the two dollars
sells it for four dollars and Trump gets
ten percent of that
he could make a billion dollars
all that matters is people sell it and
resell it that's all that matters
if they do if they like if they like
trading and trying to build a you know
try to build a full set and stuff
then they'll be buying and selling
and he would get 10 or whatever he
specified of every trade
well you say nobody would buy it at 99
dollars
would you buy it at 99 if you knew you
could sell it for 120.
because it's almost guaranteed that you
can
it's like free money the first people
who buy it are just going to be flipping
it over for free money
that's how nfts work
so you'd have to think that nobody would
buy one
for you not to buy one if you thought
people would buy them this would be the
day to buy it because it should be more
expensive every day after this
that's why people get in fast
yeah you know it'd be weird if this is
that this could easily turn out to be
the main thing that happens like it
could be bigger than the election like
you could actually make a billion
dollars like that's within the realm of
possibility you can make a billion
dollars
all right well
um I think you'd agree it doesn't look
like he's running for president really
does it
is there anything do you remember when
Trump first got elected in 2016. that he
and Pence immediately went on this tour
as if they were already in office like
months before they're in office they
were traveling around acting like they
were already on the job and I kept
saying how brilliant that was because
that's your first impression and
you don't think that if you were
seriously trying to get reelected you
don't think he'd be out there every day
already
you think this you think that announcing
the digital greeting cards is what he
does if he's really running for
president
he still sells out in stadiums because
he's entertaining yeah but wouldn't he
be selling them out today you know
wouldn't there be a rally this weekend
and the one after I mean I think you'd
have to be um
at least a rally a week mode
you know a year before the serious
campaigning goes on if you're serious
and maybe maybe he'll kick into it
pretty soon all right we'll see
um yeah I think the DeSantis poll
kicked his butt a little bit
maybe 0.02 percent of people have heard
of nfts yeah but that didn't really hurt
the nft market well I heard the nft
market is probably FDX and just the
collapse of crypto in general
um
yeah he might he might need to move he
he might need the money just for his
legal battles
um
what's the Dilbert nft going for good
question want me to check
uh I don't have my password with me so
never mind
um I don't think anybody's buying it I
think whoever owns it is just sitting on
it
um
his announcement when he said he was
running was terrible too yes
crypto crash coming big time
you you can do the math
happy eye doc
everything's public you know how many
you know how many subscribers I have and
you know what you pay for it
um
is being ruthlessly mocked on Twitter
about it even on the right
yeah I'm not surprised
um
if I had to make a prediction and I will
the destruction of the crypto Market
reminds me of the early personal
computer Market
do you remember when personal computers
were sort of a big thing and there were
a whole bunch of little companies that
made personal computers
but you knew it was going to be you
thought it was going to be you know IBM
and Apple in the end now IBM didn't make
it to the end
but
I think I think I think crypto is going
to weigh the go the way computers did
which is there's no way crypto goes away
I think there's just no way it goes away
but all the the coins so-called
will go away so all of the the weak
competitors will go away
I think Bitcoin will still be standing
don't make any Investments based on
anything I say about crypto it's my
weakest category right if you thought I
said something smart in some other
category that does not extend to crypto
I'm just treading water with everybody
else on crypto but it does seem to be
that the likely thing
uh the likely thing is that to be maybe
two standing in the end maybe it's
ethereum
for its functional purposes maybe it's
Bitcoin because it's the one everybody
knows I don't know but I think there'll
be at least two in the end
but I don't think that uh it's going
away
uh looks like 23 rates are going to
persist in real estate correction yeah
did you find out who Satoshi is yet
well I didn't
um
now you know what's interesting so you
know that
um associated with my startup that is no
more we created a token called the wet
w-h-e-n now the interesting thing about
a token is that once you create it it
never goes away
right like it doesn't wear out or you
know it doesn't time out it's just there
forever so someday of the future if
anybody wanted to create a business
around the when token they could go to
the one exchange where you buy them
I think there's probably one left and
you just buy them all
for some you know almost nothing and
then you would have a crypto you would
yeah I think hotbed is hotbed IO is the
only place and
if it's still there I'm not even sure if
it's still there
um
no I didn't finish the Ed Calderon
interview
anyway
uh yeah the Senate band uh tick tock on
government devices now how in the world
can they ban it on government devices
and then not ban it on the Public's
devices
when was that now also the reason that
the when is likely to have future value
do you know why
do you know any that the when crypto
that currently has basically no value do
you know why I think it will have a
value in the future
because of the name the name
someday somewhere
for some function
somebody is going to need a token
that says something about time
because somebody's going to build a
company or an app
that they have a Time related element to
it and they're going to say why would we
invent a token
when the when is almost free we'll just
we'll just grab it and incorporate it so
if you want one who has a perfect name
and is already created and you don't
have to worry about it being wrong
because it's already there
somebody can just adopt it put it in
their own company and then you know
whatever few shares I have might have
some tiny value
it's uh w-h-e-n
yeah whn
all right that's all for now I'm gonna
go do something else I'll talk to you
tomorrow
