everybody it's Thai
for the best oh not this time
sorry
don't I always tell you that this is the
best part of your day
but not today
no for all of you for some of you
I'm going to blow the top off your head
for many of you you're going to get
really pissed off if you watch this and
some of you might die
let me say that again in case you
thought that was a joke
watching this live stream could kill you
literally
because I'm going to say some things
today that I do not intend
because it would be unethical in my
opinion I do not intend to change your
mind about any medical decisions
but the content will do that
it's not my intention
it's just I'm going to give you some
truth about something that maybe you
hadn't thought about
and it will have the effect of changing
some of your minds
don't watch this
if you don't want a cartoonist
to accidentally
change your medical decisions
this warning is 100 real
right it's not reverse psychology and
that it's not a marketing trick I'm not
trying to get you to watch it because
it's naughty or it's you know
provocative it actually could
kill you
all right do you hear that
just just hear that as clearly as you
can watching this live stream could
 kill you
all right now I feel like I've done my
ethical Duty
right none of this is a joke
none of this is a joke could
kill you
I'm not trying to that's certainly not
my intention but we're just going to try
to talk about some truth and see what
happens all right so bail out now
if you don't want to be any part of the
vaccination
persuasion even accidentally and I know
a lot of you don't like that topic and I
would invite you to come back tomorrow
and I'll talk less about it
but before that all you need to enjoy
this to the maximum extent is a copper
mug or glass tanker jealous of Steiner
canteen jug or flask a vessel of any
kind
fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamines of the day the
thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip it
makes everything better except the
coronavirus go
ah
all right now I'm going to be
easing into the topic all right you'll
know it when it happens
and I'm gonna I'm gonna repeat the
warning because people are joining and
miss the original warning but I'll
repeat the warning a little bit but
first did you know that today Akira the
dawn's album dropped featuring
uh my vocals
and if that sounds weird
uh is not turns out it's a new genre
genre a music in which uh Akira the Don
takes samples from podcasts and uses
that as the lyrical part and then he
adds the musical stuff in the back and
you would be amazed how well that works
because the the podcast
uh tend to be content that has some
meaning because he chooses it for that
purpose and it's not just mine I think
Jordan Peterson's on there some other
people
um and uh take check that out you will
be surprised
right you will be surprised is is worth
checking out only because well even if
you didn't care musically
check it out because it's a new genre
and it's it's worth looking at just for
that alone
well Larry Elder got uh got hit by an
egg
by a woman in a gorilla mask when he was
campaigning for the governorship
California
and as every smart person is asking
today uh
would this be covered by the news
exactly the same
uh
if if he were a Democrat
wouldn't all the news be you know it's a
big racist thing it's a guerrilla mask
he's black throws an egg at him
somebody's saying in the comments that
the egg missed
well if the egg missed I guess the yolk
is not on him
all right
um
yeah you know this is one of those
hypocrisy things that there's not much
there's not much depth to the to the
comment it's just every time you see an
example where the news is clearly just
propaganda
because the way they treat these things
is so different left and right that you
just can't even take it seriously in any
in any possible way
all right uh
here's a fake news alert fake news alert
great news alert
this uh comes to me via Twitter and Adam
dopamine
Adam points out that the breathless
reporting on Florida's coven surge
seamlessly shifted to stories about
Mississippi and Louisiana
hmm why is it that all that talk about
Florida
sort of just sort of softly while you
weren't looking sort of just started
talking about two other states
because the surge
collapsed
that's why
The Surge
collapsed so whatever Florida is doing
you know they had I guess three surges
that were pretty bad but at the moment
it's going pretty well
so
watch your fake news try to try to miss
you know change your direction it's a
little case of misdirection hey look at
this hand look at this hand forget about
this one yeah look at this one look at
this
all right um
University of California professor is
suing the school system
um because uh he says he has natural
immunity against covid but they're going
to require him to get the vaccination
anyway
now
how do you lose that argument
let's say you're smart enough to be a
professor
at at Berkeley
right so it's a you know top university
if you're a professor
at a top university
and your argument is pretty Ironclad
which is that if you have natural
immunity you're you know you're better
off than people who have two shots
now how does he lose that argument
I mean maybe
seriously how do you lose it it feels
like that's the most slam dunk argument
anybody ever had no maybe it has
something to do with you can't verify
easily whether somebody has antibodies I
can see maybe they'd require you to have
an antibody test maybe that's not
practical
because how do you really know somebody
had covet they could just say they had
it and not get the vaccination so there
might be some practical reasons
but this guy's gonna lose his job
for not being protected against covet
when he is more protected than just
about everybody on campus
how does he lose this I mean he might
he might that's the scary thing right he
might actually lose this
I don't know how you could lose it but
he might
um
Chris saliza over at CNN he's an opinion
guy
and he wrote this sentence on an opinion
piece it was kind of shocking to see it
he said for the last two weeks or so I
have been carrying around in Anger
bordering on rage regarding the chunk of
Americans eligible to receive the
vaccine who continued to refuse it
have you seen that
I don't think I've run into anybody who
would admit to having rage about
unvaccinated people
are you seeing that
in your in your personal bubbles
because I think you know my audience
doesn't really uh have much Crossover
with CNN I don't think but
I haven't seen anything like that
and I I'm pretty sensitive to hate you
know you can spot it pretty easily I
haven't really seen it
but I'm I'm gonna guess there's some of
it out there because I doubt Chris
Elizabeth is the one angry person about
this topic
somebody says I haven't seen it in real
life but you've seen it on social media
yeah social media became the the place
where the outrage goes to goes to thrive
right
uh all right so there's that let's talk
about Biden's six-prong plan I'm not
going to get into the details you
probably looked at it already but one of
the clever things is he's using OSHA
uh to push his mandatory vaccinations
for
um Ford uh at least people in the
government government workers and he's
encouraging private companies to to have
mandates as well
[Music]
um
but OSHA is kind of a clever way to do
it
would I be complaining if Trump had
found this clever workaround to get
something done let's say it was
something else you know not the
vaccinations because that just becomes
political as soon as you hear it but if
I had heard that Trump
used this clever workaround
uh and I thought it was good for the
country
I don't know if I'd complain I probably
wouldn't I'd probably say well yeah he
did what he had to do cut through some
red tape used to work around it was good
for the country
so I don't think the question about
whether OSHA has or has not Authority
just personally
doesn't bother me that much
I know he should and I get the argument
that if you if you become a dictator and
you just start making up laws and
finding some rationalization for them
instead of using the system
could go to hell
but
I don't have the same rules during a
pandemic if it's a pandemic
I give my government a little extra
power
because I want them to have it if this
is one of their little extra powers that
they they took for themselves I say
that's within the scope of things I'm
I'm going to call acceptable during a
pandemic
anything that lasts beyond the pandemic
we've got to talk about and if any of
this happened outside the context of the
pandemic I'd be completely opposed to it
right but you throw in the crisis part
and you could argue whether we're still
in the crisis or not I think that that's
a fair argument at this point but anyway
I'm just telling you it doesn't bother
me but I do see the red flags so if
you're telling me Scott Scott you're not
seeing the gigantic red flag here of the
precedent assets I do see it but I just
don't think that crisis
examples are going to be as sticky as
maybe you think but I see the risk
all right
Let's uh I have to give you my warning
once again I said it in the title if you
don't want to be convinced to get
vaccinated
turn this off right now and I I mean it
and it's not reverse psychology right
it's not a track
if you don't want to be accidentally
convinced to get vaccinated because that
might happen
I'm not going to do it intentionally
because it's unethical for me to do that
all right
yeah so with my with my blessing those
of you who don't want to be part of this
please please sign off and come back
tomorrow
come back tomorrow but for those of you
who stay
I'm going to blow your head right off
for some of you
okay
now let me start with this
if I ask you this question most of you
are reasonable people and I know that
you made your decisions about
vaccinations or not based on reason and
risk and you thought it through would
you agree that all of you no matter
which decision you came by
would you agree with the statement that
you thought it through
in the in the comments can you please
confirm that you thought it through
right no matter what it was you decided
you thought it through and some of you
came to different answers
now second question
second question
if I were to alter and you accepted it
one of your biggest assumptions
could it change your opinion
now I haven't told you what the
assumption is yet right so so you can
hold on that but if I were to change
your most important assumption
could it change your opinions
just yes or no if I change your
assumptions and you agree with that
change you'd go oh yeah I hadn't thought
of it that way if I could do that just
just one assumption
I'm not going to give you any new data
no data will be presented
I'm just going to change one assumption
and if that big assumption was Central
to your decision could you change your
mind
do you know what I'm doing to you right
now
all right I just primed you
so I made you commit
to a change in assumption would change
your opinion
if I had not done that it probably
wouldn't because confirmation bias would
kick in
and even if I successfully changed your
assumption you would just move to a
different argument
it wouldn't change your outcome
because people don't really change their
minds based on new information but
I just primed you
and if you said yes Scott if you change
my most basic assumption
I could I'm not guaranteeing it
but that would be a condition which
could change my decision
now that you're primed
let's talk about some things and I'm
gonna I'm gonna ease you into it okay
now remember if you're just joining us
late if you don't want to be talked into
getting vaccinated sign off now
because it might happen
right seriously sign off if you don't
want to be talked into it it would be
unethical for me to talk you into it
without adding any new information
but I think I will add a new
understanding in a minute we'll get to
it okay I'm going to get to it
um there are a number of vaccinations
that are already required as most of you
know if you're a kid in the United
States and you want to go to school the
things you have to get would be included
by seventh grade you got to get tetanus
diphtheria pertussis booster you got to
get your verticella that's the
chickenpox to get in kindergarten you're
you're required to have polio diphtheria
pertussis your first doses measles mumps
and rubella the MMR Hepatitis B
vaccination and and chickenpox of course
so those are all the ones that
um you're required to get
now how many of you
and and the requirements vary by state
so there's a big difference in in you
know how they're mandated
so I'm not making any argument about
them being similar in mandate
so you got that it has nothing to do
with the the government mandate I'm just
saying that they are mandated
in Most states to go to school
now apparently there are a number of
people who find workarounds that they
don't have to get vaccinated I heard
there are 800 000 unvaccinated people in
the country who don't even have these
vaccinations
so I guess you can get around it but
that's the situation now
here's your assumption
speaking now to the people who have
decided not to get vaccinated
is one of your assumptions that these
other vaccinations and by the way if
you're anti-vaxx in general this has
nothing to do with you
if you're anti-vaxx for all vaccinations
I'm not even talking to you
that nothing I say will be relevant to
you if you've said no vaccinations
have a nice day you don't want to watch
the rest of this there's no appointment
all right if you thought the childhood
vaccinations are okay because they've
been around so long that the side
effects are well understood
and and the coveted vaccinations are
newer
so let's say your biggest reason for not
getting vaccinated is that the
traditional vaccinations have been
around long enough that we would see all
of the side effects and we'd have a
really good understanding of the
long-term risks
because how could you possibly know the
long-term risks of a vaccination that
just came out this year it's not
possible Right
so you've got the the vaccination that
comes out this year
with completely unknown long-term risks
would you agree how many would agree
with me the statement that the coven
vaccinations have unknown
long-term risk everybody agree we
couldn't possibly know it you can't know
the future right now how many would
agree with the next statement
that we do know the long-term risks of
the childhood vaccinations agree or
disagree we do know the long-term risks
of the childhood vaccinations
go
agreed disagree
why would you disagree with that
not really not really they've been
around for decades
what do you mean
somebody says yes yes so I'm seeing your
answers sure we know the risk now
clearly we would recognize if if any of
these long-term kid vaccinations if they
were giving long-term problems you'd
know about it by now right
because you look at the the database
of all the long-term problems
uh what's the name of that database
listen I'm forgetting what's the name of
the database where they collect all of
the long-term problems and not the fares
because the vares is more of a short
term
problem but what what's the name of the
database where they collect the problem
say 10 years after the vaccination
what's that called
no not fairs theirs would be uh closer
to the time you got the vaccination
but let me give you an example I I guess
I'm being unclear when I was 49 years
old I got an exotic voice problem called
spasmodic dysphonia was my spasmodic
dysphonia entered into a database
such that people could look at it and
say Here's somebody who got the
polio vaccination when he was six years
old or whatever it was and now he got
spasmodic dysphonia at age 49.
is that in the database
it's got to be in the database it's in
the database
because
how in the world could you know
that my spasmodic dysphonia is
completely unrelated to the vaccinations
I got as a kid
how would you know that without a
database there's no data
right
now which database which database do
they use
to test the combinations of childhood
vaccinations
because we know that they test each
vaccination extensively right I mean we
all know that they do extensive testing
on vaccinations
but which database is it where they do
they they look at not only the one
vaccination but the combination where
they test what if we give you three
different vaccinations that are all
required but we give them about the same
time and you're six years old or
whatever age
which database is that in
none right it's not in any database
so your biggest assumption
is that we know the risks of those other
vaccinations
we don't
and let me tell you what expertise I'm
bringing to this conversation
medical nope
scientific expertise
nope
am I bringing my virologist credentials
nope
I'm the creator of the Dilbert comic
strip
if you can find a better
expert
to predict the likeliness the likelihood
that big corporations are gathering data
40 years after they needed to
seriously
seriously
do you think that these big companies
are really tracking this data long term
come on
all of you
all of you people who said
I don't want to get the the new
vaccination because it's not as known as
the existing ones
you think you know the risk of the
existing ones
do you no you don't because nobody
tracks it
you're pretty sure somebody was tracking
that weren't you
try to Google it
see if you can find
any data that tells you 20 years after
you got the I don't know chickenpox
vaccination
you you showed me the data that says 20
years after that that you can tell
what's happened
here's another problem
here's another problem what happens if
almost everybody gets the same
vaccination
how do you know what trouble the
vaccination caused
because everybody's vaccinated
almost everybody
right you can't tell
let's take an example and by the way
this is not this will just be an example
for conversation I'm not making this
allegation we know for example that the
average rate the average levels of
testosterone in men has been falling for
decades
right
has anybody studied
whether the the lower testosterone that
seems to be all through the population
could be caused by vaccinations I don't
think that's the cause let me be very
clear I don't think that's the cause
but did anybody study it
how about obesity
we've got crazy obesity problem do we
know exactly why because I've heard
different opinions it's everything from
fast food to too much air conditioning
to too many video games to whatever
but has anybody studied
our uh weight loss or weight gain and
whether you got vaccinated
no now do I think that vaccinations
cause weight gain later in life no I do
not I have no reason to think that but
today by studying
how about my spasmodic dystonia
probably 30 000 people who got it and
you know since I've gotten it how many
of them were asked about their childhood
vaccinations and if they were asked
they would all have the same experience
so you wouldn't know
you would just say oh everybody got
vaccinated and some subset of them got
this problem
let me tell you
what I know with complete certainty
nobody is studying the long-term safety
of existing vaccinations
nobody
so if you made your decision about this
vaccination
based on the fact that the other ones
have been studied for a long time and
this one hasn't
you need to check that assumption
because it's your main assumption and
it's baseless
it's baseless now I heard somebody say
but Scott the the new vaccines at least
two of them are a different platform
different technology and we have much
more experience with the older kinds of
vaccinations and the new one just you
know introduces this new kind of risk
does it
how do you know that
how do you know it isn't safer
it seems to me that the experts are
quite unified on the question of if
there are going to be side effects they
happen quickly
in other words if you've watched people
for a year
you pretty well have a good
a good uh good idea
but what happens after a year
right because so we've watched all the
vaccines for a year or so
but have you watched them longer
I doubt it and if you did did you do it
right I mean even if somebody did study
it would you trust the study and we know
that half the studies are
somebody's saying that the MRNA vaccines
are safer
now if you happen to be an expert in the
field
I could imagine that you would say to
yourself well the nature of the way
we're using this should be safer because
we have a pretty good idea with this
vaccine you know grabs onto and it's not
grabbing onto things that look dangerous
but
if you could tell just by looking at it
that it's not dangerous you wouldn't
need to test it right it you don't know
mRNA is safer or less safe
it can't be known right you don't you
don't know about looking at it I mean
you don't just look at it logically and
say well logically this should be safe
you still have to test them because your
logic can't get you safe enough right
so
if now let me do a little uh check on
you here
how many people until this moment
believe that we did have pretty good
information about the long-term effects
of other vaccinations
how many of you just had an oh
moment and said oh my main variable
is completely just a guess
I'm seeing no's and yeses I see one oh
not me nope me don't be a crab get the
jab Charles says
uh somebody says but this was immaterial
to my decision yeah if for some of you
that wasn't part of the decision
so this wouldn't make any difference to
you
all right uh
let me
let me ask you one final question
is there anybody here
who was anti-vaxx at the beginning of
this or at least anti-covet facts at the
beginning of this live stream
who when they realized that they
couldn't
know the difference between any of the
vaccinations with long-term anything how
many of you are reconsidering your
decision not to get vaccinated based on
just this
I'm going to watch comments go by for a
moment because I want to see
now most of you should not be that would
you know 90 should should dig in
uh
yes I am
I'm considering let's say
let's see just looking at your
rephrase please uh rephrase this
question
the question is how many of you are
are unvaxed
and now reconsidering that because one
of your biggest variables just fell
apart
all right a sad realization yes
okay
so I am saying yeses go by now remember
my warning uh my warning was don't get
your medical your medical decisions from
cartoonists right
and and I I would encourage any of you
to unfollow me or stop following if you
didn't like this
because this is pretty much you know the
kind of content that I have so yeah
don't follow me if if you don't like
this
um
and I'll say again
that if you find out my assumption is
wrong and there is some kind of Magic
database I don't think so but if there
is
then reconsider
um all right
now when we're talking about vaccine
um persuasion
you convince me to be more
skeptical
all right all right that's it for uh
today I just wanted to see if I would uh
change any Minds it looks like some of
you did change your minds generally
persuasion does not you know change
everybody right away a really really
strong persuasion would get
five percent of the audience
that would be remarkable if you could
swing five percent of an audience with
persuasion you'd be the best Persuader
of all time
um
all right
uh
uh well I'm looking at your comments and
I see them
no anecdotal evidence of existing
vaccines being safe isn't a thing
there's there's no way you could capture
problems just by looking at people and
saying oh this this guy's got a headache
and he got vaccinated
and this other guy doesn't have a
headache oh but he got vaccinated too so
you really couldn't tell
all right that's all for now I'll talk
to you
tomorrow
