do do
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams there's
never never
been a better time or as Joe Biden would
say
annoyingly
and if you'd like your day to reach
Galactic Interstellar levels all you
need is a cupboard mug or a glass I take
your chalices die in a canteen yoga
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure it's the dopamine
hit of the day the thing makes
everything better it's cold
simultaneous sip it's going to happen
now
go
ah yeah that's good
you can feel the synchronicity
everywhere it's happening
well I got stories for you today all
kinds of stories by the way this will be
my second test
of trying to use the Twitter algorithms
to my advantage
so I'll tell you what I did yesterday it
didn't seem like there was more traffic
yesterday
could be a coincidence it could be
because Stephen Crowder doesn't do a
show on weekends it could be I'm not
competing with Crowder uh
but
what I did was I turned some of the text
of what would have been a text tweet
into a screen grab and then posted it as
an image in theory
Twitter is going to see that there's an
image with my tweet and give me more
traffic
I also removed the link from the main
tweet and I said it's in the comments so
you can find it pretty easily
and I'm hoping that Twitter doesn't know
that I commented to my own to my own
tweet
if it doesn't now
then the link will follow the tweet and
everybody will be happy traffic will be
through the roof
we'll see I'll let you know I'll let you
know probably tomorrow because I don't
see the total traffic numbers until I
quit
well Laura Logan had an interesting
tweet she said it really is quite
staggering that Elon Musk could fire all
those people from Twitter and it made no
difference whatsoever
what did they do all day
now I commented that I think about that
every day
and somebody questioned why I would
think about that every day
because it's so interesting
didn't he fire 75 percent of Twitter
do I have that wrong could be a fact
check
I thought it was about 75 of the entire
staff I think all he kept was the
technical people
for the most part right so it turns out
that the engineers were doing all the
work and everybody else was just
talking and drinking good coffee or
whatever they were doing I don't know
they were probably imagining they were
doing something
I'll tell you a true story from my
first oh I don't know 16 years of work
life
I asked myself
how different the world would have been
if I had never done any of the work I
did
because I worked for two big
corporations I thought how would this
Bank be different
how would customers be different if I
just never existed and nobody else did
what I did just it just never happened
in the answer was it wouldn't be any
different at all
but I I spent years and years working
hard every day and then one day I woke
up and thought
I don't think any of this matters
like none of it
I do analyzes of you know this or that
and people look at them and do whatever
they were going to do anyway it never
made any difference I had a job that was
completely
completely useless
for years and there it wasn't even one
job I changed jobs a number of times
none of it you can see in any kind of
final result so that's why I had Twitter
interests me it's sort of a Dilbert
thing
all right here's another sign that
things have gone way too far
do you remember when 60 Minutes could do
an interview with a controversial person
and you'd say to yourself let's say a
dictator something like that and you'd
say to yourself whoa this is going to be
really interesting
and it wasn't like you were voting for
The Dictator
you know like I don't know maybe they
did Castro or something I'm not sure if
they did but let's say they did
I'm not like oh I sure like Castro I'll
go I'll watch that interview with him
I would say instead oh that's a valuable
service they're telling us what this
dictator is saying
and I don't remember anybody ever
boycotting 60 minutes because they had a
provocative person on
this probably happened but like it seems
kind of a rare thing but apparently
tonight 60 minutes we'll have Marjorie
Taylor green
and on Twitter people are just going
nuts and they think they have to boycott
60 minutes and never watch it again
for Marjorie Taylor a grave
I'm positive they've had murderers on
there am I wrong
you don't think they've ever had anybody
who was a like a murderous dictator
I'm pretty sure they have
and Marjorie Taylor green is going to be
your your Bridge Too Far
yeah
I was okay when you talked to Pol Pot
they never talked to Pol Pot but let's
just go with this that was okay when you
talked to Jeffrey Dahmer and Pol Pot but
Marjory Taylor green well that's just a
that's just a hill too far I can't hit
the left
does that seem
crazy
it seems crazy did they talk to David
Duke
because that feels like somebody they
would have talked to
yeah perfect example
and can you imagine that the Democrats
would learn Nothing by listening to
Marjorie Taylor green I think they would
I think they would learn something not
just useful for themselves but useful
for politics in general completely
productive thing
poor 60 Minutes is trying to be at least
a little bit
you know fair about who they talk to and
they're going to get canceled for it or
something or at least semi canceled
yeah or
uh
yeah so whatever
happens there will be interesting all
right
we're going to get to some controversial
stuff here ready
um
so here's some of the people who
complained about Marjorie tiller Creek
congressman Adam kinzinger
why is he complaining about Marjorie
teller grade
big on 60 Minutes uh liberal commentator
Eli mistell
it was the guy who looks like a big
Q-tip they bring him out to insult
people like me he he actually was one of
the people who was brought on to talk
about me as if he knew anything about me
gun control activist David Hogg
and others
but yeah they're very they're hopping
mad hopping mad
wow
um and so I would like I'm gonna tie
back another story to this at the moment
so don't forget this story we're going
to tie back to it but first
um is anybody seen Matt Walsh doing his
videos about how reparations should be
calculated
I'm enjoying the show so much
and here's why I enjoy the show
um first of all I kind of wonder if he
might have heard this reframe from me
because I've I've not heard anybody else
say it and the reframe is this
that the proper way to calculate the
economic part of reparations would be to
compare black Americans who descended
from slavery in America today how are
they doing today
compared to somebody who had never been
part of slavery and stayed in Africa and
how are they doing and if
and if you think that the people in
Africa are doing much better that would
be clear evidence that slavery was an
economic you know disaster for black
people
and that therefore reparations would be
in order now I'm not not including any
psychological you know Elements which
could also be part of reparations but if
you're just doing the math of the
finance that's the way you do it now how
do you think
how do you think the woke part of the
public
took to that
do you think they said you know
Mount Walsh
that's a pretty good point you've got me
there let's use your math no it didn't
go that way it didn't go that way you'd
be surprised to find out but because
what he said is a hundred percent
unambiguously true
and accurate the arguments against it
were not the best
and I'm going to read some of the Tweet
arguments against them
just so you can see what happens when
you say something perfectly irrational
in public
all right uh one of them was from let's
see the Amazing Atheist he calls himself
and he says that uh that Walsh saying
that you would compare Americans today
to people who had never been part of
slavery or still in Africa that that
comparison is quote
that analogy that is like justifying
rape because a lot of people were born
from it
that was the argument
that's like justifying rape
because a lot of people were born from
it have I ever described to you
boy analogies should not be used in this
way
yeah rape is just another topic that has
nothing to do with this and if you think
that that other topic which simply might
have reminded you in some way
of an unrelated topic it's still an
unrelated topic you can't learn anything
from that
so I wanted to respond to the tweet this
is like justifying rape because a lot of
people were born from it I wanted to say
that analogy is like saying a football
teaches you a lot about being a pig
which doesn't make any sense really
except you know footballs are made from
pigs I guess but
what do you think about it's like does
that make sense
just because I said something is like
another thing
is that an argument
no no I it's just an observation that
one thing reminds me of another thing
that's not an argument
is nothing okay yeah I know it's pink
skin I get it
all right so that was interesting then
uh then there's this approach I saw a
number of people take the same approach
uh the blue-collar intellectual podcast
something named Julian had this to say
on Twitter now our pundits are making
pseudo-intellectual arguments
so a number of people said he was making
pseudo-intellectual arguments what's the
difference between a pseudo-intellectual
argument an argument that is logically
correct
the words it's the words that's it
um making these pseudo-intellectual
arguments defending slavery
defending slavery
do you think that Matt Walsh
defended slavery
do you think that happened in the real
world
of course not
what happens when you see people's best
argument requires them to hallucinate
something absurd so they have something
to attack
what does that tell you it's cognitive
dissonance yeah cognitive distance
if somebody simply had a counter
argument
you know you'd see something like an
argument you might agree with it you
might not but that's
uh that's literally a hallucination
oh he's defending slavery and this
wasn't the only tweet that said that
that was the most common the most common
response was he was defending slavery
okay nothing like that happened
nothing like that even remotely like
that happened he was describing it
when you describe a thing you're not
defending it
that's crazy talk
all right
uh and then he he finished by saying you
sound like a dixiecrat so there so you
got your hallucination
your your uh two insults
pseudo-intellectual and dixiecrat and no
argument
it was just basically a bunch of words
and an insult and that was the best
argument now given that he's making a
math argument
or I could say economics would be better
don't you think that an economics
Counterpoint would be the right way to
go
well you pseudo-intellectual dixiecrat
with your with your defending slavery
okay
um
and let's see Nicola tweeted and people
pay the daily wire to get nonsensical
drivel like this packaged as
intellectualism
do you think that Matt Walsh packaged
his presentation as
intellectualism
that's literally the opposite of what he
was doing he was talking plain obvious
common sense
and and there's a he's literally wearing
a
a plaid like you know Lumberjack shirt
just sitting at his desk with no necktie
he has no college degree
and he's just simply talking common
sense
and they're like oh get away get away
from us with your plaid shirt common
sense intellectualism
how about an argument about saying what
he said wrong
couldn't do it I looked at all of the
comments I only saw one comment there
might have been something similar to it
that was actually a good point
here's the good point it's not just
academics
reparations are sometimes about you know
pain and suffering now you could argue
but the people who had the pain and
suffering are no longer with us well but
then you could argue that some of that
pain and suffering carried forward in
various ways so that's an argument you
could agree or disagree with that
argument but that would be an argument
would you agree whether or not you like
the argument
it's an argument sometimes reparations
are about
how people feel
that's there's a precedent for that so
but anyway the economic argument is
ridiculous I'll tell you wait a minute
but a few more comments
why does the daily wire continue to
justify slavery
number one Matt Walsh never Justified
slavery or anything like it number two
the daily wire which pays him
certainly didn't justify any slavery
I mean can you imagine can you imagine
if uh you know Ben Shapiro
was watching the Matt Walsh video
imagine if he had had actually Justified
slavery
you don't think he'd be gone tomorrow or
at least there'd be some you know
correction or apology or something like
that yeah no it's these are absurd takes
on what he was doing here's another one
justifying slavery uh here's another one
make no mistake this is not ignorance
this is racism
is it
how are you reading his mind
because there was nothing he said that
was racism
or even close not even close
so you would have to literally be
reading his mind to say make no mistake
this is racism
okay
how about uh
um another one said did he just create
an all-new informal logic and formal
fallacy
that is how you say I don't like your
common sense did he just create a new
informal logic and formal fallacy sounds
like word salad a little bit and then
the Tweet goes on from
Matthews the moral Butterfly Effect
everything in history is amoral because
it's possible we wouldn't exist if it
didn't exist
it's just word salad
I mean people are going nuts because
they really don't have a logical
argument all right here's a nay Eritrea
says this is the very reason why one
should at least attend college oh
so the problem is not the argument the
problem is that the person who made it
didn't go to college
that's the argument
how about here's what's wrong with your
argument
wouldn't that be cool
um
Matt Walsh has never attended college
but provides comments on anything and
everything
really do you think the person who wrote
this would be willing to defend just
sort of in general the people who didn't
go to college shouldn't have opinions on
Twitter
do you think that that's some you know
would they would they stick with that
opinion if you removed it from Matt
Walsh
I don't think so
these These are people who are literally
just in cognitive dissonance or they're
just going crazy I don't know what it is
but they're not arguing his point
whatsoever
all right do you know why they can't
argue his point
there is no argument against it
there isn't one
right
I've got a Kill Shot coming that you're
gonna love don't tune out yet you want
you want to stay tuned for this all
right
let me explain why Matt Walsh's
comparison is correct and I'm going to
compare it to the correct way it's done
all right
now
I did go to college
and the classes I took very much taught
me how to make the correct kind of
economic comparisons right
um here's the correct kind
the thing you did or the thing that
happened
compared to
what would have happened if that thing
didn't happen
so far are you with me
you compare what did happen
to what could have happened correct
everybody that's that's a logical
comparison what you did actually do to
what probably would have happened if you
hadn't done it
what that makes sense right and that's
what Matt Walsh is recommending look at
the people today compare them to the
people who did not have this you know
Holocaust of slavery
how are they doing
that's the correct comparison
and
people who have degrees in economics and
mbas would agree with me people who have
degrees in art history would say that's
totally wrong
it's because they would not be trained
in this technique let me tell you how
it's currently being done nobody's ever
told you this before this will be the
first time you've ever heard this
the current way reparations are done is
comparing a black person in America
today
to what would have happened if they'd
been White
I'm pausing for effect
do you feel it
that's what they're doing they're
comparing a black person today as if one
of them are their options had been to
turn white
it was never an option to turn white
it wasn't it wasn't a path that could
have happened under any scenario
but the current way they calculate the
economic part of reparations and again I
will acknowledge that reparations can
have a psychic psychological effect
that's a separate argument but a good
one yeah I don't discount that
did that just make your brain just spin
in his head that's actually what they're
doing right in front of you they're
comparing a black man in America to well
the alternative what about if he'd been
White
I don't believe there was a single slave
who got that option all right slaves
you're all freed some of you might want
to be white uh just fill out this form
your life will be awesome from now on
believe me you're you're on the you're
on the fast track now
now just think about that Matt Walsh
said compare the people who went through
you know were the product of that
experience to people who didn't have the
experience logical common sense
correct according to people who went to
college to study this very thing
but instead every politician that I'm
aware of every pundit
every other person who's talked about
this as far as I know has missed this
simple fact
black people never had an option to be
white
you don't compare two things where one
happened and one was impossible
right now you could argue oh it was
almost impossible not to have slavery no
you don't get that because there were
people who were not slaves as long as
you have the control group you're done
now how many of you are just having a
moment about this what do you realize
that they literally are comparing black
people today to pla black people who
could have just turned white and had a
better experience
now I'm adding a little bit of hyperbole
to this I think you recognize it but
that is the comparison they're saying
black people aren't doing so well white
people are doing better give us money
you didn't have the option
I'm not saying that's fair
but it's not how you calculate
reparations you don't calculate it as if
you'd been a different color
doesn't work that way
all right Vivek ramaswamy continues to
be awesome in his messaging and
reframing
when I grew up uh actually when I worked
at Pacific Bell
employees had to sign the Forum that
said we agreed
that diversity is a strength
you actually have to sign the form
and I refuse to sign the form
I think I'm the only one in the company
who refused to sign it and I refused to
sign it not because it wasn't true
not because it wasn't true
but because there was no evidence
and I said how can I how can I confirm
this is true do you have a study
this is based on on what
because it might be true and by the way
I think it's probably true
I I think diversity is a strength now
like everything else you know you could
go too far and then it's not right but I
have a hundred percent convinced that
having you know varied personalities and
varied opinions gives the company better
vision
better Vision on on the audience so
certainly in a whole bunch of ways that
are good for society you want everybody
to feel they have a chance you want
everybody to have equal opportunity and
all that
but um
generally speaking it is not a true
statement to say diversity is always
good or always bad
it's kind of depends right the right
amount good
the wrong amount bad but I didn't think
it was just an obvious universal truth
to say it's good without some evidence
so I refuse to sign it at the risk of
being fired
what do you think happened
oh we just lost all the comments on
locals
looks like it's having a moment here I
might have to reboot this
well I don't know if locals could hear
me so I'm going to quit this and restart
I don't know if this works
give me a moment
um
yeah well no looks like locals is dead
well probably it'll be people will be
streaming in that's my guess
oh we're back hey there you are all
right we got comments back
all good where was I all right so Vivek
ramaswami's uh gave a speech and he said
diversity is not our strength oh by the
way to to finish my story when I refuse
to sign the document this was in the 80s
to say diversity is a strength not
because it wasn't
but because I didn't have any evidence
I'm no expert
why why am I certifying this thing that
I have no evidence about
so I didn't sign it at the risk of being
fired
so my entire career
because it was a requirement it wasn't
optional you had to sign it
and they just said all right
but I didn't have to sign it so I'm the
only one in the company who didn't sign
it so if you think that the first time I
ever took a chance of getting canceled
was you know a few weeks ago you're
wrong it's probably the third or fourth
time maybe the tenth time
I I also just just a little background
in case you haven't heard this story
back when smoking was still legal inside
in the office
um I also risked my career to make that
stop
and they ended up changing the policy
instead of firing me so it's I do have a
history of putting my entire career on
the line when there's a point I think
I'm just not willing to let go of
so it's a pattern it didn't just come
out of nowhere anyway so Vivek says
diversity is not our strength our
strength is what unifies us across our
diversity without that we're just lost
in the desert
I love that
have I told you how good he is at
communicating my God that's just perfect
yes so he's allowing that you know
diversity is more like
I think we should stop saying diversity
is a strength or a weakness or anything
else
here's what we should say
diversity exists
that's it
like we're well beyond the point where
we should be arguing about whether it's
good or bad
like how does that make sense it's like
arguing whether
oxygen is good or bad well there just is
oxygen well I suppose oxygen is good let
me come up with a better example it's
like arguing whether that one cloud in
the sky just the one that one in cloud
in the sky is good or bad well it just
is
there's nothing you can do about it it's
just it is there so diversity just
exists
arguing about whether it's a strength or
a weakness is a waste of time
but
talking about what unifies US is
definitely worth doing
because we're short on Unity so I love
the fact that without you know throwing
away diversity as you know like it
doesn't exist he's just saying we need
to look at what unifies US instead of
what divides us and that's exactly what
I want to hear
from my presidential candidates
so
all right I think this next story is
real
but it doesn't sound real
can somebody tell me if this is real
that trans activist Dylan Mulvaney
is
her face is on the new Bud Light beer
that bud Budweiser made
a beer with a trans activist on it Dylan
Mulvaney
and apparently celebrating uh
girlhood
now
here's here's my comment on that
don't you wonder how the internal
conversations went
do you do you wonder if there's a Dei
unit in Budweiser well let me think
I wonder if Budweiser has one of those
diversity equity and inclusion groups
well
let's look at their products lately
oh yes they do yes they do
now
I don't know if you've noticed but the
normal way a corporation works
is there something called a CEO
and then a lot of people have different
opinions about stuff but the CEO makes
the decision
what do you agree traditionally that's
the way it worked do you think the CEO
made this decision
Maybe
right I'm not a mind reader I'm not a
mind reader so I don't know
but here's my Dilbert filter on this
here's what almost perfectly certainly
happened
hey the Dei people say we need to show
more inclusion and here's a perfect way
to do it we'll put you know Dylan
Dylan on the uh the Bud Light
what do you think the CEO said
I'd like to do my impression I don't
know who the CEO is my impression of the
CEO in the meeting where that was
presented to him
if you're listening on a podcast I just
did a hilarious face of somebody stunned
into silence
um I cannot believe
there's no part in my brain that says
that the CEO was thinking yes yes that I
knew we needed to do something and until
you suggested
putting trans activist Dylan Mulvaney on
our on our beer cans which are almost
the most male oriented product in the
entire world that's not literally a tool
that you'd put in a toolbox or maybe a
really jacked up truck
but those would be the three most male
oriented brands in all of the world
Budweiser
do you think that the CEO said yeah
I think we should be you know bending a
little bit more in this direction I
don't think so I think the CEO said oh
 I can't say no to this right
because the CEO would get canceled
the CEO is not the decision maker
on this stuff now the CEO might be a
decision maker on other stuff operation
stuff but in terms of how the company
was going to present itself
I'll bet it wasn't the CEO
I'll bet it wasn't I bet the CEO said I
can't say no to this
and that put
the least trained people in the company
in all likelihood but do you put the the
most qualified people do you put them in
charge of your Dei unit the answer is no
you put your least qualified people
there because you think you know if if
you wanted an engineer
you'd want a highly qualified person but
uh somebody complaining about
inclusivity that doesn't take a lot of
skill set
so we'll put them there so we've we've
managed to create a system in which a
highly qualified CEO
is no longer in charge of the company is
big decisions not all of them
but this was a big decision you know
what face you put on your product that's
a big decision and I don't think the CEO
is in charge
what do you think do you think the CEO
would have made this decision
without it being brought to him with a
little bit of pressure
of course not there's no no Co would
have done that
do you know why
because people have a bias against trans
why would you put on your product
something that you know
40 percent of your likely buyers
would have a reaction to it that wasn't
positive
now I'm not defending those 40 percent I
think people should be more open-minded
and I think adults should be able to do
whatever the heck they want and that
includes Dylan Mulvaney who I'm
perfectly happy
I have no complaints with Dylan Mulvaney
by the way in terms of the the lifestyle
Dylan wants to live
fine with me
but if you put it on a beer can you're
in the realm of economics
and I'm not sure this fit is fitting as
well as they should
all right and so here's my take on that
on vivek's comment as well as the Dylan
Mulvaney thing
uh I think diversity has many benefits
and they're real
but you can't make it your operating
system
you get that
it can't be your go-to operating system
the the wokeness and the diversity
it has to be just an important factor
that you know competes with the other
important factors as soon as you make it
your core operating system
you're dead
that's the end of your efficiency you'll
have to bow to other forces
well DeSantis continues his uh unbroken
pattern of doing uh awesome state things
that is a great way to run for president
without running for president all right
here's the latest and this goes in the
category of free money
free money it was laying there on the
table for every state so every state
could have done this well only the
Republican states could have done it but
only he did it and we keep seeing this
pattern it's like wait a minute you can
do that
that sounds like a good idea you can do
that and the other states didn't do it
like it's hard it's impossible not to
notice
how many things DeSantis does
that other people should have thought of
or other people should have done and for
some reason they didn't and he just
doesn't it's it's it's a super strong
technique here's the latest
uh apparently he's going to sign a bill
that's going through the Florida
legislature that is going to ban Dei in
Florida universities
could could you imagine anything more
popular with his base or the ones who
matter if he's going to run for
president
that's like the most
simplest free money
baller strong leader
that just has everything
that's a home run right there home run
so let me say this
I don't believe DeSantis is this smart
he's very smart
very very smart
but this smart
suggests an advisor
do you agree
that that this looks like there's an
advisor who's really really good at
advising like really really good at
advising
that's what it looks like no it's not me
it's not me it could be somebody I've
influenced but it's not me
yeah I know I've never had any direct or
indirect contact with DeSantis I have no
connection
but I'm a fan let me tell you I'm a fan
of this style of politics it's just
really strong
um
so he's looking to abolish the Dei
bureaucracy I have a question now if he
can abolish Dei in universities
because the government has some control
over them would it be impossible or
illegal or unconstitutional
if he did the same thing for companies
operating in Florida
what do you think
is that legal or maybe it's impractical
because companies tend to operate across
States
say it's illegal I'm assuming it's
illegal or else he would have done it
right
but States states can pass laws about
how companies operate in their state
that's routine they do it all the time
it feels legal to me but I don't know
why he's not doing it
so I'm sure he's looked into it it's
illegal for private companies why would
it be the state can make private
companies do all kinds of things can't
they they can tax them they can put
requirements on them
why would that be different
huh
um yeah
uh so I'll just say it's an open
question I would say that he could do it
that's my guess
yeah ban everything you don't like
Governor well a governor should ban
everything they don't like
that's why you hire them
they should pay on everything they don't
like that's the job
ban everything you don't like and then
promote things you like that's the job
all right
see what else is going on oh here's my
one of my favorite
ones oh I should say that uh DeSantis
also
re-named Dei
so you know the last few days I've been
saying that it's not persuasive
to just come up with alternate uh
alternate words that the acronym refers
to so instead of saying oh Dei is
diversity equity and inclusion if you're
a Critic of it you might say that those
letters mean three different things
and I've been saying that's not
persuasive you know you know it's clever
but it's not persuasive well DeSantis
just did it
DeSantis just did that he said
Dei stands for division exclusion and
indoctrinization and that has no part in
our public institutions
now
let me let me clarify or you could say
I'm admitting I was wrong okay you could
have it either way
when when a candidate for president does
it
it works
do you see the difference
if you and I did it but no candidate for
president was doing it it wouldn't have
any power
it's because he said it
and because who he is that that infuses
the power right the reason I saw it is
because he said it
right if you say it on Twitter
uh
thank you John
um I appreciate that
so anyway yeah if if Trump had said this
it would have been super persuasive
DeSantis saying it and I I should have I
should have picked up on this so this is
on me I should have told you that if
somebody famous says it it's different
and not just famous it wouldn't matter
if I said it right do you get that if I
said it no power whatsoever does Santa's
saying it well we'll see we'll see it
gets quoted a lot maybe people will pick
it up if if uh if Trump had said
something along those lines
I think people would have picked it up
yeah
all right
um
but uh on Twitter Marty bloodfest had
this update for CRT
calling it creating racial tension
CRT creating racial tension
that's pretty good
that's pretty good
and I wondered if there's a persuasion
play in which you try to convince people
that's actually what it means
you know if this were not 2023 I'd say
well that's a stupid idea you're not
going to convince people that your
public school system for example is is
teaching a class on creating racial
tension you're never going to convince
anybody that's real
but in 2023 you could you could actually
convince probably 40 percent of the
public just by repetition I'll bet you
could get 40 percent of the public
to believe that's what it stands for in
the real world that that's what it
stands for
40 of the public that's my estimate why
because 40 of the public can be
convinced of anything if you try hard
enough
I mean it's a low estimate it just
depends how much you repeat it if you
repeated it enough
eighty percent of the public would think
that's what it meant even people who
used to like it
now I doubt I doubt that could be
repeated enough to get to the level I'm
talking about
but if it were repeated enough it would
convince 40 of the public or more
but that's what it meant
all right favorite story of the day this
is just my personal favorite The
Washington Post uh has been fact checked
a couple times on Twitter and I love
that you know Twitter's now adding the
context or Community notes
so if you tweet something that's
factually wrong
Twitter will automatically append the
correction to your Tweet
now I live life in fear that that's
going to happen to one of my tweets if
it does I'm getting rid of that tweet
right away
I'm deleting that tweet right away
because that that's that's pretty
embarrassing if they're attaching it
right to your Tweet that's embarrassing
so uh Glenn Kessler
who he works for the Washington Post he
tweets us a new fact checker
he says and it's based on an article in
the Washington Post he says the
incendiary claim that George Soros funds
Elven Bragg
so he's basically saying that you know
that's not true that George Soros funded
Ellen Bragg
not true he says and this is the
Washington Post oh by the way the
Washington posters who canceled me
everybody else canceled me mostly
because they did first yeah the
Washington Post canceled me
because they couldn't tell the
difference between a group or a video
and a real one
and in other words I got canceled for
fake news not that I didn't say the
thing I said but the context was wrong
the context was wrong here's the correct
context if if the Washington Post had
not been a disreputable lying rag
here's what they would have said
cartoonist says something really
offensive
but what did they say
racist rant
what was their evidence that it was
racist
there's plenty of evidence that it was
offensive I did that was offensive
intentionally
offensive was a fact right offensive is
a fact what is racist
racist assumes they know what I'm
thinking what the context is and why I
did it
if they knew all those things and they
conformed to that view
that it's a racist rant well then they'd
have something that would be a
legitimate story but they never asked me
what I was thinking they never asked
about the context they just played the
video
that's a rupar
do you think it's a coincidence that I'm
the most famous person on the internet
for uh for outing rupar videos
such as the Covington kids find people
hoax
the drinking bleach oats they're all the
same it's stuff people really sad
but as soon as you take it out of
context it changes form
so the Washington Post is a fake news
entity that I've been slamming for fake
news four years
did did the Washington Post tell you
that I'm one of its biggest public
critics when they canceled me
does that does that feel like important
context oh we decided to take the comic
out of our newspaper for what he said
and then you leave out the fact leave
out the fact I'm one of the most
prominent critics of their newspaper and
have been for years
in public not privately in public I've
been criticizing the people who paid me
in public
routinely I did it all the time
so yes Washington Post is a entity that
is largely in the political stuff is
fake news
mostly fake news I'd say now that
doesn't mean some of the stuff isn't
true it just means the way they package
it is intentional fake news and it's
pretty obvious now I say intentional
even though I can't read minds but
I don't think there's much question
um
so here's the context note that Twitter
automatically added to Glenn Kessler's
tweet
says readers added context blah blah
Soros donated one million to the color
of change pack
the largest individual donation it
received in the 2022 election cycle days
after it endorsed Bragg for district
attorney and pledged more than a million
dollars in spending to support his
candidacy
how much do you love
the Elon Musk
spent 44 billion dollars
to wrestle Twitter into a legitimate
platform
and he did it so successfully that it
just fact-checked the Washington Post to
ask
standing ovation
this is for Elon Musk
for giving us the semblance of free
speech and less fake news
standing ovation
that's
that was worth 44 billion dollars right
there you know not just this tweet but
the fact that he's added these contacts
notes to clearly intentional fake news I
mean this is clearly intentional fake
news so much of it is intentional
so good for you Elon Musk
um so you know the story about the New
York Times said they won't pay to be
verified I guess companies would have to
pay you thousand dollars a month or
something but still affordable
um now you understand don't you do you
understand why the New York Times
doesn't want to be verified on Twitter
because Twitter will be calling them out
for fake news
there's no way around it because the New
York Times is also a purveyor of fake
news quite routinely
and now the community knows it's going
to be calling their tweets out as
 so they would have to pay a
thousand dollars a month to be pilloried
and shamed on Twitter
and they're thinking well if we're going
to get
pilloried and shamed maybe we don't want
to pay for it and maybe people are going
to you know read the New York Times no
matter what right so I think the New
York Times is going to get
almost as much attention whether they're
verified or not but I can kind of
understand why they wouldn't want to pay
and I imagine that entities that um
don't worry about being called down for
fake news
I think they'll just pay
because they'll be like oh we like more
visibility that would be good I'll pay
for that and the the ones who don't want
more visibility where they get fact
check are like oh I don't think that's
worth paying for oh no no I don't think
the New York Times and Washington Post
are going to benefit from more
visibility on Twitter
because that visibility is going to be
connected to fact checks under fake news
um
here's an argument I saw I was testing
my reframe that the opposite of woke is
authentic
so one of the ways I can test a you know
different way of looking at something is
I tweet it
and if I get a lot of reviews that means
other people liked it
so when I tweeted the opposite of woke
is authentic
I got over 200 000 views which is quite
High
quite High so it suggests there's
something there but I think there's a
better
there's a better Twist on this
and I'm going to give it to you in a
moment but first a comment from Riley
white lum
which is a weird name for a White Guy
white lum
he was describing he says they're woke
which is actually pronounced w-o-h-k I
guess that's the way we pronounce it is
an adjective derived from
African-American vernacular English
meaning quote alert to racial prejudice
and discrimination
uh and then he says y'all projecting
meaning me the literal antonym to woke
is ignorant
okay yeah
so I guess he got that from uh
Wikipedia
so got me good there
but uh here's my update instead of
saying that woke is the opposite of
authentic
here's a a better reframe you ready for
this
clear your mind and imagine you heard
this in the wild for the first time
that woke is a performance not an
opinion
woke is a performance
not an opinion
now
remember all the comments to Matt
Walsh's points about reparation and how
to calculate them when I read you back
the comments
couldn't you see that those were
performances
those were performances woke is about
how you perform
so do you think that the CEO of
Budweiser agreed that putting Dylan
Mulvaney on the can would sell more beer
do you think they thought oh this will
sell some beer or do you think that the
CEO said in the performance
in a performance
yeah yeah
damn straight we need more inclusivity
on our cans let's get Dylan Mulvaney on
the phone I'll call her can you I'll
call her myself I am oh I'm so into this
idea I'm so into this can we get her in
here today can somebody get here in here
today let's get on this
is performance
and it's mostly white people performing
so they'll get you know pat on the back
it's like oh a good boy good good job
good job that's just the way we wanted
you to act let's perform I'm more awoke
than you are
performance
now
now that you've heard that reframe for
the first time
watch How often it pops into your head
because the next time you see somebody
woke you're gonna say
is that their real opinion
really
or or is this more about the performance
you're putting on
take take the 60-minute story I told you
about Marjory Taylor green
the people who are tweeting that they
want to boycott it in 60 minutes is dead
to us
do you think they care
do you think that they watch 60 Minutes
every day
almost nobody does
what percentage of the country even
watches 60 Minutes or even watches
the news
five percent five percent Maybe
but so these people who I'm sure
probably don't even watch 60 Minutes are
telling you in their tweets look at me
look at me I love wokeness so much that
I won't even watch 60 minutes it's not
an opinion it's a performance
do you feel that
let me just check in with you
you feel it it's a performance and
here's why this is useful
if you get into an argument with
somebody and you treat them like they
have an argument
it would be like having an argument with
the people commenting to Matt Walsh's
tweets
they're not in it for the argument
they're in it for the performance they
only need to show the other people who
are watching the performance that they
went at you hard that's all
they don't have to show their argument
is good they only have to show they went
at you hard
that's it performance
so I would dismiss the woke
as performative
it's like performance accepted very good
if you'd like to be part of the
conversation about what works and what
doesn't work
that would be great but if you're just
going to perform
I'll watch the performance I'll grade it
I'll give you a grade I might even
recommend it if it's a good performance
I'll retweet it
but let's not confuse your performance
with anything that's real or useful yeah
performance accepted There You Go
performance accepted
nice
yeah or polite Applause very good nice
very good woke performance
all right so we'll try out that reframe
uh
60 Minutes is the new Lawrence Welk you
have to be a certain age to understand
that and I do
and I do
ah
you want to hear something that will
alarm you if you're under a certain age
all right
when I was a kid
there were so few channels on television
you know basically three and
two of them didn't work so well because
we had rabbit ears and I would lived in
the country so we basically had one good
Channel and one you could watch okay and
one that you couldn't really watch
and the one you could watch okay had
this Lawrence Welk Show which was this
old boring big band you know with a band
leader and I would actually sometimes
watch that
you can imagine a child watching the big
band we not not fun
but there was just nothing else to do
there was no other form of entertainment
during that hour and you'd be like I
guess
I guess I'm watching Lawrence Welk now
and I would actually
be in the room when it was on yeah
that's how terrible things were
before smartphones
terrible terrible
all right
um
apparently you could all see and hear me
on locals when the chat disappeared so
you didn't lose any
didn't lose anything I guess
all right that ladies and gentlemen
is the completion of
the best live stream you've ever seen
now locals subscribers are going to get
a little extra but I'm going to say say
goodbye to the YouTube folks thanks for
joining always a pleasure
best live stream ever
