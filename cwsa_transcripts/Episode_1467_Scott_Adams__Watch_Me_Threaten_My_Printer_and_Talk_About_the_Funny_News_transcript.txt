buddy
how are you
oh we've got some problems here with
light
i'm gonna fix that
don't go anywhere
don't go anywhere
hold on
nope
turns out my microphone will not reach
that far
so i'm going to fix this the poor man's
way
by turning the camera
all right just imagine if you will
that over there in that direction uh
god has just shown up
and
he's got some things to say he's pretty
pissed all right
how would you like this to be the start
of something special
you would right
well you came to the right place for
that
because it's time for
the simultaneous sip and what do you
need for that a cup of mugger glass a
tanker chelsea steiner canteen junk to
flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
have i mentioned i'd like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopey of the day the thing
that makes everything better except my
audio my lighting and my video and the
content
but everything else is better it's
called the simultaneous sip and it's
happening now go
well i don't know how your day went
yesterday but let me tell you about mine
um
so yesterday is christina and i my wife
we decided that we wanted to get a
really good night's sleep
so yesterday was the day
that we were going to
exercise get really tired
i was going to enjoy a
larger than normal dose of indica and
the idea was that by
bedtime
we were going to be really really tired
and ready for bed
well part of our plan worked well
the part of the plan where we got really
tired and ready ready to sleep
that part
really good
the part that didn't work out as well
is when i got a knock on the door
uh last evening
from my neighbor who said there's a
gigantic
water leak
gigantic water leak in front of your
house to which i said
gosh i hope that's not my problem
but it was my problem because the water
leaks started just on the other side of
the
town's responsibility
and a giant geyser of water was coming
out of my lawn
and flooding the street
now what do you do when it's the middle
of the night
and your water has gone crazy well you
call the emergency plumber
now
i don't want to tell you what it took
to get temporary water to my house
because there's a
kludgy setup that took hours to complete
and
all the creativity in the world and me
working with two different plumbers at
two different times i mean it was just a
mess
so
i thought to myself
well
my idea of uh going to sleep early
because i was exhausted
turned into getting three hours of sleep
and here we are
so this is your show
brought to you on three hours of sleep
does not getting enough sleep make you
cranky
has that ever happened to you anybody
anybody have you ever had a problem
with
uh you get a little tired and sometimes
your mood is a little off
well that's the kind of day
when you know you have audio problems
and you're worried about the crackling
and you're thinking
i don't want that to happen
then part of your lighting system breaks
for reasons that aren't clear
so we're a little bit in the dark today
trying to use a kludgy setup
but at least my printer would work
right i mean
i mean
yeah sure a lot of things are going
wrong
but at least my hp tango printer
would be working like a champ
no
no it's not
and
i couldn't get it to work
this morning
and so
uh if you'd like to say goodbye
to my hp printer this would be a time to
do it now
i don't know if a lot of you are
mechanically minded
you may not be mechanically minded but
let me teach you a little engineering
trick
if your printer doesn't work
once or twice
that's no problem just try it again
maybe recycle it if it doesn't work
three four five times in a row well
maybe you need to
try uh reloading the software or maybe
get a repair or something but if it
doesn't work
45 times in a row
well then it's time to go to plan b plan
b involves
making sure that all of your other
electronic instruments are aware of
what's going to go down
computer
you see this
digital phone uh screens
coffee warmer are you all listening
all right lights ring lights i know
you're not listening ring light but this
ring light is still listening
uh we got the stereo the tv are you guys
all paying attention
everybody
lights all right
all right
what's going to happen to your printer
friend
you're not going to like it
and i'm hoping you're all learning a
lesson because
your printer is going to have a long
fall from a high height
it's fighting back
i knew this was going to happen
wow
uh that will be a special episode that
i'll be doing after everybody's awake
it would be going out the window right
now
but there's at least one member of the
household who may or may not be awake
yet
and i don't want this to wake them up so
i've already ordered a new printer
and then later today
i'll set up my camera so that you can
see
the actual destruction of this one
because it needs to be destroyed
throwing it out the second story window
i mean if you've learned nothing from
the taliban and isis
that works
all right
now did you all see the uh
the video of chris cuomo uh partying and
dancing
has anybody not seen the video of chris
cuomo dancing on vacation
well he did he did a dance that i'd like
to teach you it's called the the white
person dance
and i think i can do it
if i can if you don't mind a little
demonstration
so this is uh chris cuomo
on summer vacation
dancing and watch watch the moves
carefully because a lot of people
you know you're not as good at dancing
as i am so it's going to take you a
while to get the moves i'll try to do it
in slow motion first so follow along
this is slow motion
watch the
shoulders
the overbite is optional chris didn't
use the overbite but you can
okay i hope you're getting all the moves
then you do this
and then
like that all right that's the slow
motion version
now let's put it all together we'll take
all those moves try to integrate them
into one move
and i think
looks like this
now i hope you all got that
if you're listening
if you're listening on audio
i'm so sorry you've missed the best show
ever
but those of you watching on video i'm
pretty sure that you've learned
something that you can add to your
talent stack a lot of you didn't know
how to dance properly
but thanks to chris cuomo
problem solved problem solved
all right also trying to figure out why
my audio is sometimes crackly
so if it starts crackling again i'll put
my headphones on and at least determine
if it's on my end
so i can at least test my own equipment
so afghanistan withdrawal is going great
and by great i mean
worst debacle in the history of losing
war since vietnam
quite a feather in our gap
but you know what i feel as if
the only way that we could end that war
was if two presidents tried to do it
that was like a two-president operation
you needed
you needed trump to get it going
and then republicans would say yeah get
out of there and then he needed a
democrat to finish the job
so i think it actually worked about the
only way it was going to work
right it was it was messy but we didn't
want to get out of there
now
of course getting out of there means
leaving our allies to be slaughtered
which is the worst possible look for a
country
and it looks like that's going to happen
you know we're we're going to flail
around and try to save save some people
but
i don't think the taliban are going to
be too happy about anybody who is a
little friendly to the
american
regime there
okay
and
i feel as though uh
gnome blum on twitter
uh
talked about the strategy here for
afghanistan apparently biden's strategy
for pulling out of afghanistan
was to pull out of afghanistan and then
pretend we didn't know it would go so
poorly
that's actually the strategy
pull out and act surprised that things
didn't go well
what the taliban is trying to take over
what
they're making gains
very quickly
what
are you telling me that
kabul the capital is being
surrounded what
that's their strategy
i think i did that pretty well
better than the cuomo dance really
here's a another episode of
permanent
news
now permanent news is news that i can i
can give to you every single day
and it will never be different
it will still be called
news
i don't know why because it's never
really new
but here is your
permanent news
well it turns out there might be some
problems getting the infrastructure bill
passed
that's your
news
this time nine democrats are threatening
to withhold it unless they
uh i don't know vote on the first part
or whatever it doesn't matter
it doesn't matter just can i can i just
summarize this with
congress has a nine percent approval
rating which is about nine percent too
high
nine percent too high
uh let's talk about vaccine hesitancy
so of course famously republicans seem
to be resisting the vaccinations but
also only 27 percent of i think black
adults
are vaccinated
how many times in the last several years
have i told you that black americans and
republicans
need to be on the same team
they're so often on the same team
that it only makes sense that they work
together i mean yeah at some point
that point is just going to become
obvious
like i feel like there's going to be
some kind of tripping point
where the the black public in the united
states says
wait a minute
nothing nothing was working
black black lives matter didn't do
anything
turns out
turns out not much much happened
but there are all of these situations
where republicans and
black americans line up like school
choice
vaccine hesitancy
a lot of stuff i mean it's pretty long
list so they have more in common than
they think
and i think someday they're going to
figure it out
but 27
i've seen a number of clever articles
and tweet threads
on why would it be
that
people in this country would be
let's say not trusting the experts
is there anything that's happened in the
last several years
that you could think of
that would cause anybody to be skeptical
about experts and about your government
anything anything oh that's right
every single story in the news
because they're mostly fake
everything and the news and the news
that was real
we thought it was fake
so the there was only two kinds of news
last year
news that was totally fake
and news that at least 30 percent of the
country thought was fake even if it
wasn't
so basically we had completely fake news
and 30 fake news
and we're supposed to believe the
experts this time now i got the
vaccination so i believe them enough
you know to to make the choice
but man do i completely understand
completely understand anybody who says
um i don't want to put anything from the
government into my arm
so i get that
so how is uh joe biden's record looking
um i think you're going to see his
approvals sort of drift lower but let's
just take a tour
through the things that will be on
biden's record now to be fair
i like to say this about trump
and i'll say this about biden to be as
balanced as i can muster
there is some stuff that's just going to
go wrong during your your time
and it's just going to be on your record
right
so some of this stuff is
by no means biden's direct fault but
he's definitely going to get blamed for
it so here's the list
so we've got the withdrawal from
afghanistan that looks like a disaster
would that have been better if trump did
it
well trump says yes
are you surprised trump says he could
have done that better we'll never know
but i don't think afghanistan was going
to be a smooth withdrawal
so if if trump had done it maybe it'd be
better who knows maybe it'd be worse
don't know no way to know that
but we do know that whoever was
president was going to have a stain on
the record
trump or biden this happened to be biden
all right so afghanistan's looking bad
the pandemic's not solved again not
biden's fault is it
i mean i would say biden did a
reasonably good job on the pandemic it's
just there's something she can't solve
so we still need masks and we're still
in the pandemic so again it might not be
biden's fault but
he's in charge
gas prices are up that is biden's fault
china and russia are moving more
aggressively than ever cyber in every
other way
that's definitely briden's fault but
would things have been different under
trump
don't know
no way to know but it would have been
trump's fault had he been president and
the same stuff was happening but it just
happens to be biden's fault now
inflation
again whose fault is that bipartisan
right i mean there were enough people
who voted for stuff
that that's it's at least bipartisan but
we had to spend a lot of money to get
out of the pandemic probably
um so biden gets stuck with that bill
too how about the infrastructure bill
could be one of the things he succeeds
at
but not yet
at the moment at the moment it's not
successful so we'll wait on that
climate change is getting worse and i
don't see biden doing enough
that that would look like he made a
difference so it's going to look like
biden didn't do enough on climate change
that's going to look like a failure too
again
probably wasn't anything he could do
but he's in charge
um what about the income inequality that
used to be a big deal
with the occupy wall street stuff but
now we just sort of forgot about it
well we've got we're putting
billionaires in space at the same time
the regular people you know
are just out of work
it looks worse
but people aren't complaining about it
still it looks worse under biden
the iran deal probably looks worse to
more people than it looks good i would
think
so iran probably is worse than trump
might have done but we don't know you
know we don't know that that would be
pure speculation
how about
did biden bring the country together
did he bring the country together now
now we don't have trump so we're all
unified now no nope nothing like that
happened so he didn't keep that promise
i doubt trump could have either
um countries still divided how about
immigration immigration worse
much worse
trump definitely would have done better
on immigration depending on what you
know your point of view about what needs
to be done he would have been done
better
and then let's let's give him his
positive stocks are up
if this had been trump
we would have given him credit for the
stock market being up
so we give it to biden biden's in charge
i don't know if that's enough to cover
to
you know compensate for the other stuff
and the economy i'd say is recovering
well
and you have to give that credit to
biden even if he didn't do anything he's
in charge that's the way it works so
it looks terrible overall
but at least the economy is relatively
okay except for gas prices and then
inflation
i just said inflation
stop saying inflation dude i just i just
talked about it and i'm talking about it
a second time two times not enough for
you
it's the only thing i'm going to talk
about twice
do you think he can handle that
all right
yes so inflation's up and that could
kill the economy and kill the stock
market increase
uh but it's slow moving so if you're
going to look at just the persuasion
angle of this
i don't see how biden or somebody or
even kamal harris
could get re-elected with this record
it doesn't look like it it doesn't look
like you could get reelected but it
demands who you run against and what
happens six months before the election
so one of the worst things about the
country right now is that if somebody
takes any side for any reason
the other team
democrat or republican they just have to
take the other side and so we get this
weird situation where
in terms of the vaccinations everybody
got what they wanted
and everybody's unhappy
what
so the people who wanted vaccinations
got them
so they're happy the people who don't
want vaccinations
so far haven't gotten them
so aren't they isn't everybody getting
what they want
vaccination people got vaccinations no
facts people got no vacs
now of course there are pressures from
you know various entities emerging so
somehow we managed to find a way
where everybody got what they wanted
and was unhappy about it
think about that
everybody got what they wanted
vaccination if you want it no
vaccination if you don't want it
and we're still unhappy
we found a way
to give everyone what they wanted
and we you know we had to dig deep but
we found a way to be in each other's
throats over it
okay
now i get the argument right you know
what you do affects me that's everything
that's everything
everything you do
affects other people unless it's you
know trivial just walking across the
street but if you have a healthy
unhealthy lifestyle it makes my health
insurance go up
because you're in my pool i mean
everything you do affects other people
i'm not sure why it matters this time
now of course hospital capacity is a big
deal but
we're still waiting to see
what that really looks like
um
and here is what i call a segment called
least surprising news news that's barely
news
the least surprising news is that
china refuses to cooperate in the
further world health organization
coronavirus origins
probe
how surprising
china is not going to
participate in the probe that would make
them look like a pariah
and
be terrible for the future of the
country
surprising
well uh in other non-surprising news a
recent poll
said that uh
59 of democrats have a favorable view of
socialism
what
59 percent of democrats are now in favor
of socialism
now
doesn't it depend
what people imagined when the question
was asked if you asked me if if i'm in
favor of socialism i would say yes
i would say yes
it just depends how you define it if you
define it as social security
yes
if you define it as replacing capitalism
no no
i like capitalism
but i also like a little bit of
socialism
all right it's about a mount it's not
it's not a binary you're not either
socialist or a capitalist
we're we're some kind of a blend
and i think the blend makes sense how
much of each you get is a big deal but i
don't trust any poll that asks people
about socialism because everybody's
defining it differently
and certainly too much of it would be
bad
uh well the latest news is that russia
is totally ignoring biden's threats as
they
as they've ignored america's threats
forever doesn't matter who is president
and
they're still interfering in
america's elections and in our social
media
trying to the the reporting is that
they're trying to just stir the division
in the country
uh but here was the most interesting
point i saw from someone who seemed to
know about russia that the russian
intelligence agencies are competing to
impress the boss
i'll bet that's true
because it looked exactly like that in
2016.
remember the uh terrible memes that the
russians did that tried to divide us you
know some were pro-trump some
pro-hillary
uh more of them were pro-trump i guess
but they were mostly trying to so you
know dissent
but when you look at them they were so
poorly done
the memes they couldn't have made any
difference it didn't even look like a
professional operation and i said to
myself at the time
that doesn't look like putin ordered
that
are you telling me that putin ordered
somebody to make a bunch of bad memes
that are so bad they look like high
school project and that that came from
the top
i hope not
i mean i'd like to think russia was a
little more competent
than a few bad memes that wouldn't make
any difference
so to me that always looked like an
independent operation
meaning that the
the
what was it the click farm or whatever
they were
probably somebody came up with that idea
and it wasn't putin but maybe they
thought putin would like it
so
now there's at least one other person
who knows more than i do
about russia
who's saying that that's probably what
the model is uh competing intelligence
agencies trying to impr impress the boss
the troll farm thank you the troll farm
looked to me like an independent
operation because it was just so weak it
just didn't look like it came from the
top it looked like it came from somebody
who was trying to press the top
so we don't know but it has that feel to
it
so apparently in the summer of 2020 this
is the reporting on it
uh these russian operatives they use
social media to spread extremist
viewpoints about black lives matter
huh
are you telling me that
some element of the black lives matter
story was determined by russia
propaganda
it was
it was
but reportedly
now what do you make of the fact that
russia doesn't care one bit how much we
threaten them with their cyber stuff
they don't care one bit
apparently they've made no changes
very much the way china
made no changes to their fentanyl
shipping even though we asked them and
they said yes and all that
i guess that's the category that you
just say yes and then you don't do it
because there's no way to punish them
is there
i'm sure we're already doing cyber stuff
to russia don't you think
don't you think russia is maybe paying
us back
because we never see the reporting of
what we're doing to them
it's not nothing
i'm sure we're doing something
yeah but we don't hear that reporting so
it looks like all just russia against us
and maybe it is
maybe it is just russia doing all the
bad stuff but
i kind of doubt it
don't you
let me
get back to my feed here i lost it every
28 minutes
this time sound on its own
come back to me
bear with me one moment
almost back
there we go
all right so i'm back
um
remember i told you that if biden won
the election that uh republicans would
be hunted
well
more evidence of that every day so miles
taylor i guess he used to work for
homeland security an ex-official
he says that the radical this is on
msnbc
so he says that
radicalized elements of the republican
party
now represent a bigger threat to our
democracy than organizations like al
qaeda and isis ever did
now
that sounds a lot like
trying to make republicans seem like
isis
doesn't it or worse than isis
um
that
is the kind of language you hear before
things get really wet
and
i don't think that's going to happen i'm
betting against it strongly betting
against it i don't think this you know
we're going to lead to any kind of
full-scale
you know armed conflict against each
other i just don't think we have that in
us
you know if you read the room it doesn't
look like it's there
but man when you hear this kind of
rhetoric
um
it's
it's hard to feel comfortable about it
but feel comfortable about it anyway
these are crazy people
florida
speaking of
no matter what you do right the other
side is going to say it's a mistake
right down the line so here's florida
governor desantis
once again
i don't know how he comes up with so
many
things to do that make headlines and
look leaderly
but man he just does one after another
nobody's doing a better job of
let's say managing the media and the
state at the same time nobody's even
close he's doing by far the best job of
managing
his his brand as well as the state
but he's rolling out a new treatment
plan in which they'll have these mobile
clinics for
regenerons monoclonal antibodies now if
you're following all the covet stuff you
know that this regeneron stuff
is like magic
you know
you get the regeneron
drip going if you've got coven and
you're going to feel better really fast
so we know that works
and we know it's a big deal but it's
also fifteen hundred dollars per dose
so what did the liberals say
uh
i saw a few critics say that masks are
you know basically costs nothing
and vaccinations are free
but why are we pushing these
regeneron
treatments that are fifteen hundred
dollars per dose
well
allow me to talk to you who those who do
not have economics degrees
the vaccination isn't free
the vaccination isn't free
it's just
the the end user isn't paying wasn't
free
do you know how many billions of dollars
the government put into vaccinations
a lot
a lot of billions
it's the opposite of free it's like
really really really expensive
it's just that maybe you don't pay it
when you get it
and how in the world can you be angry
about mobile
regeneron clinics
that are definitely going to save lives
definitely they're going to keep people
at hospitals
everything about this plan is great
i mean it's expensive
but everything about it is great
so um
but of course the critics had to
criticize it anyway
all right here's the uh
the
here's the most optimistic thing
i've ever said
most optimistic thing i've ever said is
is there any possibility that the uh
coven vaccinations will
cause you not to get the common cold
did we accidentally cure the common cold
did you get reinstated
i'm seeing a message from carpe duncan
that
he's talking about reinstatement i guess
on youtube
so carpe dante
ah crackle is back yay all right hold on
a second we're gonna test the crackle
i'm gonna see if i can hear it on my end
i wanted to hear the crackle
oh yeah
a little bit of crackle is it my phone
let's see if i put my phone over there
is there any crackle
uh release the crackle somebody says
yeah i'm not getting it on youtube the
crackle seems to be uh only when i talk
see if any of my stuff is causing this
crackle bear with me
it seems to come and go right free the
crackle
microphone maybe copper tape
all right
all right well
here was my optimistic thought for the
day uh we know that or we think we know
that if people have been exposed to
other coronavirus they
um
they're more likely to have a good
outcome if they get
the covet right so i think that's
established
as much as anything is i guess
so would you agree with the following
statement that we the science agrees
that if you have
uh if you've had other colds regular
colds
and viruses you might be in better shape
to fight off the coronavirus
but
is it possible that the coronavirus of
vaccination would cause you to do better
against the common cold
or is the small change that they they
make in these viruses unrelated to the
other
coronary viruses
is it possible
um
just that two vaccinated friends dieth
covent wow
you said uh you had a hunch it was the
phone the the phone didn't make any
difference when i moved it
but i did buy a new printer so i don't
need to use the phone for my notes next
time uh well by monday or so i won't
need my phone
and the phone didn't seem to make any
difference when i moved it around
all right
um
the vaccine isn't cure and covered so it
won't cure anything else well cure is
too strong a word but it might
it makes me wonder if if we're going to
make some headway on the common cold i
could easily see us getting vaccination
boosters every year
to get rid of all the cold and flu
stuff but maybe we'd be worse off if we
did
the other day you said you didn't know
anyone who had a cold last 18 months
but everyone
that had coveted but everyone thinks
they already had cove and even though
good point
so some uh there's a comment on locals
that said i said i don't know anybody
who
says they had a common cold since the
pandemic started but there are a bunch
of people who believe they had coveted
before you know it was covered
uh i don't think any of them are real
coveted or almost none of them i think
those are common colds but lately have
you ever heard of anybody in the last
six months
i haven't
uh somebody had a cold and and tested
negative for covet
so there definitely are
colds
going around
but it feels like fewer of them now the
kids are back in school so we'll see
um
have i been keeping up on ade
no
let's see about the spike because part
of the vaccine target
yeah so it depends on how similar the
spike proteins are somebody's saying
no cold since vaccinated somebody says
you can be infected with both at once
yeah it makes sense
um
mike pompeo is losing weight somebody
says that's a tell for getting ready to
run for office it is a tell for getting
ready to run for office
but uh we'll see if that's real
all right that's all i got for now i've
got to go do some stuff
and i will talk to you
later
