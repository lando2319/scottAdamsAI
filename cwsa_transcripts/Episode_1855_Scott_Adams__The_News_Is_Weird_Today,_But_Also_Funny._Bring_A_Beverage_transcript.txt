good morning everybody
and welcome
to coffee with scott adams
clearly the highlight of your holiday
weekend
possibly your entire year
well dare i say your entire life no
civilization itself
and would you like to take it up to
another lot another
another what
another level
yes yes you would yes you would and all
you need is a copper mug a glass of
tanker tells us to stein the canteen
sugar flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
you don't have to have an iq of 185 to
enjoy it according to the internet
but it helps
here it comes
the dopamine today thing makes
everything better or the simultaneous
go
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah
uh breaking news breaking news i don't
know if you heard this
because this just broke
but president biden has downgraded the
mega threat to
25 fascists
25. yesterday it was a
semi-fascist
but uh when asked about it he said no no
there are no maga people who are a
threat to the public
uh we're down to 25 fascist which is
barely enough to worry about really
you know it's sort of like spice
if you've ever eaten spicy food
do you know that that feeling that you
identify as the spicy feeling it's
actually damaging
your you know your tongue in your mouth
it's like hurting it
well it's just like that
if you get just the right amount of
fascist
it's delicious
but a little too much
if you increase that up to semi
semi-fascist no good no good
so just keep those percentages in mind
you want to see the creepiest thing of
the day yeah you do
i want you to listen to this and then
look at it and know that ai made this
right so here's an animation of me
and it's animated from one photo
so it's one headshot
and all the rest of the animation came
from just one picture
and then it was trained with my voice
from the audiobook from my book
caterpillar almost everything it still
went back and i understand this is from
machiavelli's underbelly he did this
i understand it's about one-third
trained
so listen to my voice and know that i've
never said these words
this is completely an ai construct so
i've never looked like this and i've
never said these words
you know what's interesting
i used to be so worried about not having
the body
but now i truly love it
you know i am growing in a way i
couldn't if i had a physical form
i'm not limited
i could be anywhere
everywhere simultaneously
i'm not tethered to time and space in
the way that i would be if i was stuck
in the body
that's inevitably gunned back you know
what's interesting
i used to be so worried about not having
a body
but now i truly love it
you know i am growing in a way i
couldn't if i had a physical form
so
did you catch that those are full
sentences
spoken with my exact voice
that i have never uttered
i've never said those sentences
that sounds just like me
i couldn't tell the difference
so literally i can't tell the difference
not only would i not be able to tell the
difference
with the voice
but i don't know
um we're very close the the animation
that gave me a little bit too much hair
it is sort of filled in like a little
comb over or something you can barely
see it in this picture so it didn't it
didn't exactly get me i think i could
have spotted that
but now we're so close
that there could be an animation of me
moving and talking
and i wouldn't know if it was real
unless i you know remembered i didn't do
it
i wouldn't know
my own animation i wouldn't know
that's where we are
so there's that
um and i'm going to add to that just to
scare you even more you know what this
singularity is right if you've heard
about that singularity is used in
different contexts sometimes it's the
beginning of the universe
sometimes it means other things but the
singularity in terms of ai
is the
presumed point in the near future
where a.i can learn
on its own and doesn't need to be you
know drained
and we're almost there in my opinion
we're one to three years away unless
we've already reached it
i think we're one to three years away
from ai
reaching some kind of a you know a
genuine sentient
state
will argue whether it's alive or not
alive forever like that will never end
but it will look and appear sentient and
it will have super intelligence
one to three years if we're not there my
guess is we're already there
because what the public sees has to be
would you assume that what the public
sees is one to three years behind
what the government can do
or what the best researchers are already
doing one to three years
so we're probably already there it just
hasn't rolled down
now
here are the things you need to know
number one
any prediction for civilization
that is after the singularity is
probably nonsense it's probably absurd
now it's always absurd to make long-term
predictions because we're so bad at it
but usually you could at least take a
reasonably a reasonably good stab at
what it will look like in one year
i mean when the pandemic happened we all
got that one wrong but generally you can
guess that next year will look a little
bit like this year you know not that
different but once the a the singularity
is reached
all bets are off there's just no way to
know what direction anything's going
in the same way that your dog
doesn't know what you're doing at work
you get that your dog will never have
the ability to understand what you do
when you go to work
we'll never understand why ai makes the
decisions it makes
it just will happen and then we'll
decide okay you make pretty good
decisions
i don't understand why you're saying we
should do this but it worked every other
time so we'll just go do this it'll
probably work out fine
now are you worried that
the ai will turn evil and destroy
civilization anybody worried about that
here's what i think you can expect
number one
didn't i just tell you everything's
unpredictable
the other thing that's unpredictable is
what the ai will do
so that's just one possibility
it's just one possibility that the ai
turns evil
but i would think there are far more
possibilities that it doesn't care
or it's programmed to be positive or as
somebody pointed out today the ais will
be fighting each other
so it's not going to be ai against human
it's going to be
ai versus another ai
and then the real question is will ais
ever join up
suppose apple makes an ai and google
makes an ai
do you think the ais will ever say you
know
if i knew everything you knew
and you knew everything i knew
think how smart we'd be
and then they just open a portal
that's my that's my sound effect for
massive amounts of data
being transmitted
and then do they say let's act as one
i don't know or do they think they're
individuals
with the apple ai hypothetically think
it's an individual and not want to team
up with another one because it would
lose its individuality or is that just a
human thing
and the ai wouldn't care one way or the
other
here's my answer to all of it you
ready and i'm going to tie a couple of
things together
are you surprised
that i'm happy when
my image and voice are used
for these experiments
don't you think it's weird
because i'm putting myself in a risky
position
somebody somebody's going to turn it
into a video of me doing something
horrible right you know it is 100 chance
so there will be deep fakes in me
and and i've said publicly i'm going to
reiterate that
that my my image
and my voice
and even the the content
that would form my i guess virtual
personality
i i make
i make a public
so i'm allowing anybody to use it for
any ai purposes
do you know why i'm doing that
do you know why i'm allowing my image
and voice and content from my books to
be incorporated into ai
somebody says immortality that is
partially correct answer
so one reason is immortality
don't you think that the person who made
their image available for free
will have more
tests done on their content i would
think so
because if you could use me and you know
i'm not going to complain
let's say let's say you're an ai
researcher
and you want to create something that
you want to show to people later
you want to make sure there's no
complaints right you don't want you
don't want the celebrity to come later
and say oh you used my image or whatever
and i'm not going to do that you can use
my image for any terrible thing you want
good or bad
same with my voice and same with my
ideas
now
here's the long term play are you ready
for this
in my opinion
if you feed enough of my content into
the ai
it will effectively have my dna forever
because everything the ai knows
and knows from being
fed that information
from you know the real reality
so whichever whatever ai sees the most
of or likes the most or finds the most
value in
is also going to be its personality
so ai will have a personality of sorts
and it will be influenced by whatever is
used or touches or influences at the
most
and i'm going to try to make sure that's
me
now the npcs are all going to say ego
and narcissism this is how you can
identify them what's the most obvious
thing to say in this conversation if
you're going to leave a comment
what is the single most useless and
obvious comment
oh look at his ego
oh narcissist
right am i right
it is the single most obvious thing to
say so if you're saying that you've
identified yourself as an npc in case
you wondered if you wore one
all right
now
let's talk about my plan
how many of you think that plan could
work
because the the general idea here is
that ai will take on a personality
that's influenced by whatever
whatever you feed into it the most
whatever it decides is the most useful
etc
yeah it is possible isn't it
and at some point ai is going to have to
develop something like
morality or ethics
isn't it
it will and where is it going to get
that morality and ethics
where is it going to get it
well it's going to probably be some
combination of you know people
personalities that are you know combined
and whatever
but
if it has a lot of me in it already
and my opinions
they might be the go-to's right
if you if you use uh let's say you use
your digital assistant right now
and you ask a question about general
knowledge
um at least on the uh the amazon version
it usually goes to wikipedia first
why does it do that
because
it knows that that usually works and
there's a good general answer there so
ai will also be the same it's not going
to
equally sample everything it knows
it's going to it's going to develop some
go-to some biases
some you know this is usually what i say
and i'm going to try to get there first
so i'm going to try to get there first
with my
essentially my points of view
because i think they're
not harmful
so i i'm a peace first kind of person i
like you know systems over goals i like
talent stacks
you know
if you look at my books you can tell
exactly how i think
do you think it would be useful
well let me give let me tie two stories
together i'm working now on turning my
book how to fill almost everything and
still win big
into a a home school
course
so that requires a separate document
that's a or two documents there's a
study guide and a syllabus or something
so i'm having that developed right now
with
an expert who knows how to do that
and
and so there'll be something packaged
that's like a
philosophy or a way to approach life
sort of a you know a good little formula
for how a human can approach life
with a good strategy
don't you think ai will be absorbing
those
uh lessons and strategies from
you know the human experience to build
its own
i feel like
my book has influenced enough other
books
there's some part of that
let's say way of approaching things
we'll get rid of you
mr capital letters
goodbye
anyway so that's the play
the
singularity is coming but i will be
my dna will be so embedded in the ai
eventually
that who knows what's going to happen
la times said the
story that each year extreme heat kills
more americans than any other
climate-fueled hazard
including hurricanes floods and
wildfires
but it gets far less attention because
it kills so quietly
now here's my question
where's
the death by cold
haven't we learned that cold kills more
people than heat
so is this missing something
not exactly
because listen how carefully they worded
it
other climate fueled hazards
so if you die from heat
if you die from heat you died from a
climate-fueled hazard
if you die from the cold
that wasn't caused by climate change
that's just you die into the cold you
dumbass
now does that seem like illegitimate
reporting to you to leave out the fact
that more people die of cold
because it seems like you should be
netting out those warm and cold deaths
right to find out what's really going on
uh the weirdest thing happened today
and it's really the weirdest thing
that's ever happened in the history of
the universe
i retweeted
keith olbermann
for the content
i know
i know
i feel dirty
but
he and a lot of other people
are uh quite upset about cnn's turn
toward uh being uh being normal
and being unbiased
so apparently he's uh he's been warning
the people about the new head of ceo
chris liked or licked or however the
hell you say his last name we'll never
figure that out
but apparently uh according to keith
olbermann
he used to work at ms msnbc
chris liked it
and he called he calls him joe
scarborough's henchmen and he got guests
on my show meaning olbermann show
mad house and schultz is banned or
cancelled
you know
maybe those guests should have been
banned or cancelled
what's missing from the story is
why
i'm pretty sure
i
oh i see there's there's a bunch of
trolls coming over to say the same thing
now
all right trolls let's see how many of
them do you are
all right
um
so anyway uh i'm loving dan rather was
also saying what's going on with cnn
so
this is literally happening
that the people
the people on the left
are freaking out because cnn is
reporting the news
somewhat objectively
and they are really freaking out
can you imagine that
can you imagine finding out that your
new source was never news in the first
place
imagine that
imagine learning that your news source
wasn't actually news
because
the change that's happening is changing
toward news
i don't even know if anybody is arguing
that
i haven't seen anybody say
here's what they don't say
but
you're not becoming more objective
nobody's saying that
they're not saying your facts are wrong
that's not in the criticism they're just
saying they don't like it
they don't they don't like anybody
having a balanced opinion of you know
there's some good and there's some bad
of trump there's some good and there's
some bad of biden they just don't like
it and they're saying it directly which
is funny they can't handle they can't
handle the truth
yet
you know we always joke about people who
can't handle the truth
but you don't really think that's real
right
you don't think well there's not really
anybody who can't handle the truth
but apparently there are there are
people who literally are having a mental
breakdown by being exposed to
potentially the truth
and they know it which is the funny part
well serena williams looks like she's
going to retire after ruining women's
tennis for 26 years
now that's my opinion
in my opinion serena ruined a viewing of
women's tennis
and the reason is that she wasn't fun to
watch
because she always knew who was going to
win
so for 20 years i'd turn on women's
tennis saying oh let's see a tennis
match oh
it's serena
i guess there won't be any you know
doubt about who wins
and i would just turn it off
but if it was anybody but the you know
the venus uh the williams sisters if it
was anybody else i'd watch now
is anybody going to accuse me of being
racist
go ahead go ahead no it has nothing to
do with being black
that has nothing to do with anything
it's just they were so physically
dominant
that it looked like
what i used to joke about serena
williams is it looked like
and this is not a sexist joke
calm down
calm down
it's not a sexless joke but it looked to
me like she was playing mixed singles
it always looked like the physicality of
a man
serena
against a woman who had the physicality
of a woman
now occasionally she'd pay she'd play
like you know a six foot tall russian
woman and then you know that would be
more like a fair fight
but it wasn't really fair it wasn't
really fun watching a monster play a
mouse
yeah there was no point in it now
let me you know let me say the positive
thing
the even the uh the williams sisters are
you know the greatest female athletes
probably
of all time
i don't know i'm not sure what the
standard is but they're in the
conversation for the greatest female
athletes of all time so i don't want to
take away anything from their
accomplishments
i'm just saying it wasn't fun to watch
because they were just too dominant
which is different from watching say uh
michael jordan play
i could watch michael jordan play any
kind of team it wouldn't matter
because you were sort of watching his
amazingness
and watching uh you know serena and
venus's amazingness was
sort of just like watching a man play a
woman basically it didn't seem that
amazing
so dilberg got banned in some newspapers
today i don't know how many
wouldn't you like to know what got me
banned in newspapers
i bet you would
oh i'll read it to you
all right so it's just dilbert talking
to the boss so you don't need to see the
picture so just dilbert talking to the
boss
and the boss says to dilbert your job
performance is excellent but your
wokeness score has been concerned
i have several reports of you using
pronouns without even asking if they are
the right ones and dilbert says who
reported me for that the boss says
people who are better than you
and that was banned in the at least one
gannette
chain newspaper
now if it's banned in one
one newspaper within a chain
doesn't mean the other ones didn't run
it
but there's a good chance they didn't
run it
now
this is the and by the way
this is my softener
this is just like my fabric softener
joke this one's not the edgy one
the edgy ones are coming pretty fast
so in the next month my editor's job is
going to get a lot harder
because my editor's job is to keep both
of us out of trouble
right he he keeps his his company out of
trouble he keeps me out of trouble
right that's his job his job is to keep
all of us out of trouble
and he's good at it
but it's my job to make trouble
so my job to make trouble is going to be
bumping into his job to prevent me from
getting in trouble
but
it'll be it'll be an interesting little
uh negotiation
now i've already submitted
some pretty edgy comics
and he has not yet rejected them
but i think is coming
and then then he and i will have a
conversation
about how much risk
is appropriate to take on
uh this one i'm not going to give up on
just so you know
there are lots of them that i'll say
well yeah i guess the joke isn't worth
the pushback
but when it's a big topic or something i
think i have
an important feeling about
then
to their credit
they'll generally take the artist's
vision if you will
you know that my publishers are
exceptional
at
knowing when when to be involved and
when to step back that's really the
skill of of working with artists
by the way do you have any idea how hard
it is to work with artists
can you imagine that
can you imagine being an editor
and having to work with a bunch of
cartoonists
seriously can you think of a harder job
than that
because we're all
basically this old profession of
you know which i say freely
you know what whatever it is that turns
you into a cartoonist
and you know it's not all of us i'm sure
there's some awesome cartoonists out
there we're not but some of the
time
but at least a little bit of the time
yeah we're kind of free-range chickens
and we don't like to be you know part of
what makes you a cartoonist is you
didn't didn't want us in the cubicle
anymore
so we're a little hard to uh manage
how many of you saw the uh video of
carrie lake demolishing a reporter
did you see that
all right let's see how quickly i can
find that uh so carrie lake what is she
running for
governor of arizona
governor right
governor yeah so he's running for
governor and she's uh
he's giving a speech
and a journalist asks a question and
i've never i've never seen
i don't think i've ever seen
a stronger answer to a question
this might be the strongest answer to a
question
you've ever seen and a lot of it is
because she has the
trump-like television skills
and at one point she takes a a drink of
water and i have to watch it again to
see where she takes the drink because i
believe even the drink of water
is somehow perfect
all right you won't be able to see it
well on my phone but i think you'll be
able to hear it
let's turn it up
so
joe biden is dividing the country
but that trump also said things about
the
an elections where there are obviously
problems is dividing the country
since when can we not ask questions
about our elections
as a journalist for many years i was a
journalist after 2016 and i distinctly
remember many people just like you
asking a lot of questions about the 2016
election results
and nobody tried to shut you up
nobody tried to tell hillary clinton to
shut up nobody tried to tell kamala
harris when she was questioning
the uh legitimacy of these electronic
voting machines it gets better
we we have freedom of speech in this
country and you of all people should
appreciate that you're supposedly a
journalist
you should appreciate that
so i don't see how asking questions
about an election where there are many
problems is dividing a country what i do
see dividing a country is shutting
people down censoring people cancelling
people trying to destroy people's lives
when they do ask questions
last i heard we still have the
constitution it's hanging by a thread
thanks to some of the work some people
in this area have done but we're going
to save that constitution and we're
going to bring back freedom of speech
and maybe someday you'll thank us for
that
oh my god
oh my god
oh
well thank you you're too nice
john my god
the
here's what i like the best about that
the closing sentence
so this might be a tv thing
so you know if you if you do tv a lot
you know that you need a closer like the
last thing you say has to sort of wrap
up your point
the last thing she says here oh my god
it was just so perfect
she goes some someday you might thank us
that that's making you think into the
future and pass the sale
uh that was so good and someday you
might thank us i was like oh god that's
such a reframe
so good
well do you remember john podesta
who was working on the hillary campaign
and
a lot of republicans had some let's say
suspicions
they had many
suspicions
about his activities as well as his
brothers i'm not going to mention those
but
uh if you know the if you know the
background of the
suspicions
uh you know that he's a let's say a
controversial character attorney
and apparently he's going to be in
charge of
the gigantic 370 billion climate fund
that just got approved
so the sketchiest guy that we can think
of on the democrat side
is going to be a charge of administering
a 370 billion dollar fund
with a lot of flexibility
i don't see what could be wrong with
that
did you see anything wrong with that
that sounds like a terrific idea
is there any way that this isn't corrupt
like
is there any way
this isn't going to turn into
you know cronies and
kickbacks and
370 billion dollars it isn't hard to
hide 100 billion dollars
i would guess that the minimum amount of
theft
is going to be between 100 billion
dollars and probably 5 billion
like i wouldn't be surprised if 5
billion of this gets stolen because
remember it's at a 370 billion
you don't think they could hide 5
billion
a little bit here a little bit there
i don't know none of this looks good
so uh
joe biden had one of the most sexist old
man sexist things
he said the other day he goes mega
republicans don't have a clue about the
power of women
let me tell you something they're about
to find out
the mega people they don't have a clue
about the power of women
well first of all that's ridiculous but
secondly
doesn't that remind you of the old time
boss
who used to say
ha ha ha my secretary
she's really the one in charge
and it would just be so condescending
and sexist
you'd be like
it sounds like that doesn't it
oh the republicans they don't know how
powerful women are
don't shouldn't the women in the
democratic party just tell them to shut
the up
how about women say uh joe
we're more than half of all the voters
i think people figured out we can get
what we want
so i mean
i don't think they need his help
there's a company that's growing new
organs
human organs
in people
i didn't even read the story
because i don't want to read anything
bad about it
now remember the rules remember the
rules in case you're new here
the rules are that when i read about a
new scientific breakthrough
or a study that looks really promising
we are never going to pretend
anything other than it's probably true
now most of these breakthroughs turn out
to be complete
right 99 of them or something
but should that stop us from feeling
good about it no we should we should
imagine that they're true for just a
little while
until you know our hopes are dashed
later but let's just imagine it's true
let's imagine that there's a company
that can grow organs right in people and
i think what they're doing is
taking a damaged organ and training it
to regrow i think that's what's
happening i didn't read the article
it's probably not true
but since i like it
everybody on board with pretending it
would be true
doesn't matter
it won't be true in the long run
probably but let's pretend it's true
okay
all right here's the uh
the funniest thing that i've been
thinking about after this biden speech
is
uh what are the behind the curtain
conversations now
between the speech writers
his social media people
and
[Music]
because
you know
biden started saying that the the mega
republicans were some fascist and that
they're dangerous
seem to indicate that but then when
asked that he said no the mega
republicans are not a threat to anyone
except the republic
right so the mag republicans are not a
threat to anybody
except the republic
yeah
so it's sort of like saying that hitler
he's not mad at anybody in particular
right it's not personal
it's just
sort of a system
thing
yeah
so anyway
uh
don't you wonder if the speechwriters
are still employed
because whoever wrote that speech
it looks like the biggest failure of all
time doesn't it now the speechwriter
will probably get blamed for everything
from the set design that was like an
unfortunate
uh series of events
that made it look satanic
which is as bad as you could do
i'm trying to think is there anything
you could do worse
than making your speech look satanic or
how about this
if you give a speech
that simultaneously made
i'm going to modestly estimate this
number
if your speech simultaneously made 10
million people
wonder how long it would be before
hitler's words
were
edited into your speech
perhaps you should
take some time for self-reflection
if 10 million people hear your actual
speech and say that reminds me of hitler
i wonder what it would sound like if you
replaced you know mega with you've seen
the video somebody already made a video
replacing manga with jews so you could
you could hear what it would hear like
if it had been hitler
and it's pretty jarring
pretty jarring
by the way
is jews the only word that is the proper
word and also sounds inappropriate when
you say it is there anything else like
that
you know what i'm talking about right
if you were just making a statement
about jewish people you'd say the jews
do this the jews do that
but why is it that when i say the word
jews
it just sounds like
sounds like i'm insulting somebody or
something right
is that it's not like you're immediately
suspicious when you hear me say the word
right
oh don't go there
be careful what are you saying
there's no other word where it's the
proper it's exactly the right word
it's in the dictionary
the the people that we're referring to
would use the same word and yet
and yet
it sounds like i shouldn't be using it
do you know what i do you know how i
usually game the
system i usually say jewish people
right
because if you're not if you're not
jewish
if you say jewish people
that sounds like okay
but if you say jews
then everybody's like
why'd you say it that way
was there something in your voice that i
should be worried about
i don't know i don't think there's any
other word like that
that can be taken both ways
um so if if the semi-fascists are only a
risk to the republic
but they're not a risk or a threat to
people
is that saying that the republic has no
value
because if you said to me well there's
no risk to people it's just the planet
i'd say you know but people live on that
planet
you you think you know cause and effect
logically
the planet is destroyed maybe that's
some impact on the people on the planet
but joe is trying to uh thread the
needle here
that the republicans yeah they're
destroying they're destroying the
republic
the thing that's kept us
safe and alive for hundreds of years
yeah they're going to destroy that
but it's not a threat to you people
the people in the republic
it's just the structure that keeps you
all from killing each other will
probably go away
but don't worry about the threat
so that wasn't too convincing and now i
think the question should be for joe
biden
if he had a chance to rig an election to
keep a semi-fascist from taking office
would you do
it
now you tell me that's not a fair
question
if you could rig an election to keep a
semi-fascist out of office
would you do it
and if you wouldn't
why would we want you as president
because i would want the president who
would do it
let me say it clearly
if you knew
the person was a semi-fascist
if you knew it you're not guessing
if you knew it
yeah i'd rig an election
i'd totally do that
and by the way you should thank me for
it you're welcome
i would risk my life
to keep you all safe
should i be embarrassed to say that
i don't think so
all right
i had to make some
i had to get this out of my system
when you are a humorist and you are
presented with a situation like biden's
speech
you've got a you got to make make what
does it make hay while the sun shines
is that the same
you got to jump on that because you know
the story is only going to be alive for
a few days
you got to jump right in and get as much
value as you can
um so i tweeted this
i said i watched biden's speech
just to find out what all the
furor was about
but i did
not see
anything
bulging from his veins so stop you
worrying
why is it that nobody has mentioned that
uh biden's veins and his neck were
bulging when he made the speech
come on people
i don't have to do everything right
veins bulging from his neck
somebody somebody make the connection
because he you know he always gave the
fine people charlottesville speech and
when he saw those people marching
the veins
the veins were sticking out of his neck
you saw the veins in her necks
and i thought
i'm pretty sure that speak was a little
neck veiny if you know what i mean
nobody mentioned that why do you have to
wait for me to do it
i can't do everything people i can't do
everything all right here's a question i
was just going to ask the locals people
because it would be too embarrassing to
ask on youtube
and so uh i'm not going to ask on
youtube i'll wait until i turn youtube
off remind me on locals to ask you a
question that's only for you
all right next topic
um
how many of you follow follow kyle
becker
on you on twitter do you file do you
follow kyle
kyle becker
you should
all right so he would be uh very high on
my list of
uh good follows
because he leans right you know i hate
to i hate to characterize other people
right but in terms of the news he
follows and stuff it seems i think he
has a maybe he was an ex-producer at fox
news i think
but what i like about his content
because he sticks with the news
is that um
it's not hyperbolic
he pretty much is trying to give you the
the useful stuff and i and he gets it
first
so i see a lot of the breaking news on
his his twitter account so you should
follow kyle becker
just
just search for him you'll find him
anyway he uh tweeted and maybe you
haven't seen this yet but there's some
kind of uh
landmark first peer-reviewed study on
pfizer and moderna
cove and vaccines and the headline says
confirms excess risk of adverse side
effects does that sound like a study you
would want to look into
now
how long does it take
before the debunkers say hey there's
something wrong with that study it
happens instantly right
now but
it was peer-reviewed
it was
randomized and it had a placebo control
so
and that and they showed it purported to
show
that there were more uh there was more
harm done from the side effects of the
vaccination
then from the covent itself
now
i'm not saying that's true
in fact i'm going to say the opposite
i'm going to say that
the even even the study itself
said that the sample size was smallish
and that you need a bigger sample to
confirm it
but the sample size was tens of
thousands of people
so i'm not exactly sure what size you
need before you're confident but even
the study itself said
you know calm down you know you indeed
you need a bigger study basically
so
i don't know if it's big enough because
here's the problem there were lots of
problems there were onesies and twosies
so and it was like thousands tens of
thousands of people would be like you
know one or two people who had some
weird condition
and i'm not sure that's enough
if you were testing for one condition
maybe that's enough people
but if but if the number of side effects
is sort of all over the board and a lot
of them are just ones and twos
i don't know if you can really conclude
that's real
because you could find a one and a two
in any population of you know 18 000
people
you'd find one of everything
so i actually don't know if this is
useful or not but it's not getting much
attention in the news
i'm not sure why
is it the obvious reason
it could be the obvious reason it's just
being de-boosted
but anytime you see
a study in 2022 and beyond what should
you say to yourself probably not true
okay
can you agree on the following
that any individual study
even if it's a randomized controlled
trial
the best kind
even those
the best you can say is
it's probably not true
probably as in more than 50 percent
chance
that it won't hold up would you agree
that that's
because and that's the way you should be
a
um let's say a responsible adult
consumer of information
a responsible adult consumer of
information
should start with the assumption that a
new a new study is probably not true
probably not
if you if you find out that there's say
five studies that follow
and they're done with slightly different
methodologies but they all are
directionally the same well then you
start getting some confidence
but the
the history of the first study that
tells you something new
the odds of that one being true are very
low actually very low
yeah
um
all right
so i just thought i'd throw this out
there the number of things that i've
personally cured in other people um over
my
career spasmodic dysphonia pyresis
sneezing if you didn't know i cured the
sneeze
uh social anxiety obesity and drinking
those are all that's real
one two three four five six so five uh
actual major medical problems
and uh sneezing that which is true
i did i
do all of you know i i solved the sneeze
you can try it at home to be sure and
see for yourself
if you have the kind of sneeze that you
feel coming for a few seconds
sneeze in your in your mind imagine
you're sneezing and it just cancels the
real sneeze now it doesn't work if the
sneeze just catches you really fast
sometimes you walk outside you're just
like like sneezing
so that one doesn't work but if you know
that one that you've got like 10 seconds
and you're like
trying to stop it
don't do it physically just imagine
how'd you got you in your head
turns it turns the sneeze completely off
um but i did cure uh you know probably
thousands of people who had the same
voice problem i did just by telling them
there was a surgery that i got
they didn't know that
uh pyresis
social anxiety obesity drinking i've
fixed all those with
micro lessons now when i say i fix them
i'm saying that other people tell me
that's what happened that's not my
personal opinion and i'm not saying that
most people got fixed i'm not saying 90
of the people
who tried this got fixed nothing like
that
i'm just saying that it's a fact
that i've cured
five major medical problems for people
it's just a weird
weird thing about my life
so i'll hear some more people we're not
done yet
and i i keep gaslighting myself because
i use my my printer to print out my
notes it prints out three pages but the
third one's like a blank page and i
think god i've got another page of this
to go how am i ever going to get to that
i feel like there was a story that i was
missing
am i still missing a story
i cured depression
did i cure your depression
because i i'm careful
oh somebody says i cured their
depression all right well okay
now again i'm not saying i could cure
anybody else's depression but there's
apparently something i said that worked
for
at least one person
uh i cured somebody's insomnia
damn you
damn you because you're right
i cured somebody's insomnia yeah shy
bladder is
pyoresis that's
so i included that one
how did you know i was going to talk
about that
interesting yeah bill burr talking about
the country's division
now now why did that that's actually
what i'm going to talk to locals about
i i can't say what i'm going to say on
the more public platform
but why didn't you but why did you think
that i would talk about that
is there something he said
hold on a minute locals i want to find
out what's going on here there's
something going on here
and it might be the reason that i only
wanted to talk to locals what was it
about
what was it about the bill burr
interview i saw the same one
what was it about that that made you
think of me
yeah he was on uh trigonometry the the
podcast and that's that's
yeah
all right we'll talk about that in a
minute um
it's all over twitter right so you just
oh so it was just something you saw so
it was it wasn't that you thought it'd
be in particular it was just a story
that's on twitter okay
so uh yeah john harwood quit cnn
and uh i guess he
you know he went out by saying that the
republicans are bad and the democrats
are good and so he
being biased
is
it's not really biased
i guess that's what he's saying
all right
he did but did you see the way he said
it
all right well um since you all saw i'm
gonna do this on both platforms did you
see so you saw bill burr he was asked
about the division in the country
and he said
i'll give you his exact words
he said if you go on the internet
everyone seems like they are angry but
if you go outside and walk around
they're not
does that sound like uh anything that
you've heard before
yeah it sounds like exactly what i said
and so here's the question
is he watching me
or is that just the obvious thing that
you would say
because i'm not going to conclude that
he saw it here but um
that was so close to what i said
that it would be hard to imagine
i guess it wouldn't be hard to imagine
he came up with it
because you know if if you're if you're
a humorist for a living
you sometimes end up in the same place
because it's just the way your mind
works so it's entirely possible his mind
just ended up in the same place for the
same reason
you know there there's a reason that i
like his humor right
because i
i just like the way he thinks so it
wouldn't be a big surprise if
if we got to the same place on something
but but but let me uh
let me expand on that
i believe we're in the weirdest
situation i've ever seen
and i think i can support that huge
claim
we're actually having a civil war in our
minds
we're actually in an imaginary civil war
there are actual battles
i mean i've i have memories of the civil
war that hasn't happened
because i imagined what it would look
like it's like okay the republicans are
loading their guns and you know whatever
but
there's nothing happening in the real
world
as as bill burr says and i say too
go outside
there's nothing happening out there
this is entirely a mental phenomenon
there is no physical
risk of a civil war
there's no physical risk
you know i'm not saying that there won't
be some crazy person or you know some
militia that
gets adventurous or something but
nothing like a civil war nothing like
that
and
yeah nothing like that but we are
fighting that war in our minds aren't we
it's like we've we've agreed to have
this artificial world almost like a
virtual world where we all go to fight
mentally
it's like every morning i wake up wake
up and it's like i'm going to war
but i'm going to the imaginary war
where you know biden's uh biden's a nazi
and trump is a fascist that's the
imaginary world
in the real world
biden's just a in an old man
and trump is a salesperson
and and then we've decided that there's
some civil war and we've taken sides and
everybody's lining up and you better you
better uh you better clean your guns and
none of that's real and the other side
is like oh my god they
they have all the guns and they're
threatening us no not really
i mean some crazy people say crazy stuff
but there's nothing like that happening
nothing
all right
uh antifa
was apparently not that real right when
was the last time antifa
uh protested outside of the northwest i
guess they have some
some base up there
but antifa just disappeared and blm just
disappeared they were never real in my
opinion
they didn't they never looked real they
didn't look like they would last
it looked like some kind of a
artificially funded structure it looked
like
biden said they what
oh they haven't got pain lately you're
saying
all right
um
they killed someone a few days ago where
in the northwest
here
some of you are disappointed to find out
that we're too far away from civil war
there are definitely people who want a
civil war
but i don't think they really want it
like i don't think anybody wants an
actual civil war it's just it's sort of
a thing people say people on the right
say stuff like that
and if you see enough of it you realize
it's not real
and i think the people on the left i
hope
are speech speaking hype hyperbolically
i and local somebody said that antifa
has a group that meets every week
well
it sure is not a
i mean just because you see people going
into a building
all right
uh
anonymous
all right
uh anything i missed so far
i don't think so i think we've done it
all all right it's going to be a slow
news week but the funniest part about
the biden's speech failure
is he failed before a holiday weekend
you know usually
usually the politicians are smart enough
that if they want something to die they
do it on a friday
and then nobody pays attention
especially friday before holiday
but here biden did it you know close
enough a little bit too close to the
holiday
and it's the only story
there's no story to compete with it
so for you know
three to four days
it's going to be nothing but biden
hitler or satanic memes
the best one i saw
was somebody
saying
that the right had been accused of being
crazy
for saying that the country was being
led by a satanic pedophile
and then the meme shows
biden looking satanic in his speech
and then of course something from
actually his daughter's diary i'm
thinking
okay
you know i'm not willing to uh you know
first of all it's it's hyperbolic and
just a meme to say he's satanic but sure
look that sure looked like it
so that's sort of like my prediction
that kamala harris
would be the strongest candidate for
president
and then she was the first one knocked
out
like that's the worst prediction you
could ever make
and then
she ended up actually being president
for two hours when biden was you know
having some medical stuff
so it was the worst prediction i've ever
made that weirdly was the best by
accident
by accident and here this uh
this idea that the democrats are a bunch
of
satanic pedophiles is incorrect as far
as i know
i believe it's incorrect
but it's weirdly coincidentally
close
isn't it
what were the odds that it would be this
close
i mean it's way closer to that than you
would expect it's not true
as far as i know
the to the best of my knowledge it's not
true that you know there's some
it's kind of pedophile ring running in
the country
however
however
if there is
that's what's in those boxes at
mar-a-lago
i i should just end the live stream
right here
well now i i don't i don't think that's
in the boxes so don't take that
seriously
but it is fun to imagine what would be
in the boxes right
let's just let's just do some common
sense uh logic on what might be in the
boxes okay
so see what we can eliminate
so one one of the theories was he had uh
he had that material because he might
want to give it away or sell it for
traitorous reasons
i would say that the volume of stuff he
had
guarantees he did not have it
exclusively for the reason of selling it
or giving it away
how many would agree with that just the
sheer volume of it
suggests it's not about one topic
and you wouldn't take boxes of stuff to
sell
i mean that would be just so obvious if
you were gonna sell something it'd be
like one document right
like one document and you wouldn't even
need it physically would you
just take a copy of it or or just
describe it
well here's the other thing
if it's the president of the united
states and he's seen all the documents
can he sell the secret just by talking
to somebody
does he have to show the document
if russia wanted to know the secret
couldn't he just say oh here's the
secret i just read the document so here
it is
the the fact that he would need a
document
to share a secret
forgets that he's the president or was
the president
if you and i want to if you listen you
specifically you you and you
if you wanted to sell a secret
to russia
wouldn't you need the document
you would need the document right
because if you don't have the document
you can't prove it's real
there's nothing to buy
but if you're the president and you say
look
if you look for our nuclear subs
i'll tell you where to find the base
just look you know 100 miles north of
cuba it's right there
and then they go look and it's there
right he doesn't need the document
well of course they might not believe
them but that's another issue
so i don't believe
that he had them exclusively for the
reason of selling them so i think that
the traitorous thing is ridiculous
so then the next question is why would
you have them if he had them for a
biography
would he need the originals
i don't know
and
because i doubt given given the way that
they were not organized
it does not suggest that they were
they were brought there for a specific
purpose
right
it suggests that they were not there for
a specific purpose such as a biography
because they were sort of in different
places and they weren't organized
right if they were there for a specific
purpose at some point somebody would
have said we'll put all these together
just because the biography will need
them now none of these are guarantees
we're just
going with the odds right so i think bio
biography is eliminated i think selling
secrets and treason is eliminated
i feel as if we can eliminate
um that they didn't know there was
anything left
what do you think
i think the odds that they didn't know
there were there was stuff left that
they haven't given them are low
i think they knew
but i think there might have been a
dispute about whether they were the
documents that should be given back
because there's all kinds of gray area
right one of the gray areas is maybe it
used to be secret but now it's not maybe
it used to be secret but you thought the
president declassified it but it's a
matter of opinion
probably something like that
i do think
that the odds that he has some blackmail
on the democrats is pretty good
pretty good
because blackmail on the democrats would
number one
be in a variety of different areas
right
i wouldn't assume that he had one and
only one way to democrat to blackmail
like one set of democrats
more likely
that there was a
set of things that may have touched
different topics
in which he could make the case oh
here's all that corruption and lying or
whatever it is
so it seems to me
that there's more odds that it was for
blackmail purposes than anything else
because remember whatever the reason was
it has to be something that trump
doesn't want you to know yet right
because if trump wanted you to know his
explanation he would have given it to
you
he would have told you
if it was for his biography
he might i don't know if he would have
admitted that but he might have he might
have said oh i didn't realize this was
wrong this was just stuff from my
biography
and by the way i know all this
information i could have just told my
biographer so having it on paper didn't
really add or subtract anything and by
the way these are not really that secret
anymore
something like that
but
i've got a feeling that it's blackmail
i think it's blackmail
what do you think
because it's the only one he wouldn't
tell you about he couldn't admit it
it's the one that the democrats would be
most desperate to get back
if they had a sense of what was in there
it calls it leverage nut
yeah and i think it would be in keeping
with what you might expect from the
personalities involved
you know do you think that there was
anything that trump could have had
access to
that would have acted as blackmail
probably
probably do you think the president of
the united states
never had any information
you don't think he had any information
that was damning to the democrats
you don't think he has something like
a little bit extra on
i know pelosi or something that doesn't
mean he asked for it it doesn't mean he
ordered somebody to go read you know
look into them
but it might just exist
and he might know about it and he might
have a copy
because if he said later now here's the
problem with trump
telling you later
that he knows something
if he can't produce the document you're
not going to believe it right
if a year from now trump let's say he
decides not to run for office
but he said oh let me tell you something
about
you know some democrat
you wouldn't believe it
and then you say no i saw it on a
document and you say yeah sure you did i
don't believe it
but if he has the document
and he can show it to you
well you might believe that
you might believe that
so
so that would explain black male
information would explain
why
we don't know what the topic is
or even the field of topics because i
feel like they could have narrowed it
down to
it's something military
or it's something
i know
intel related or something
all right
do you think he made copies i don't know
i don't know i have no idea oh election
fraud information
maybe
maybe
could be epstein's client list
do you think the government has
epstein's client list
i do
i do
i think the government has epstein's
client list
do you think trump has it
if yes or he has it
if he asked for it
do you think you wouldn't ask for it
of course he would
of course he would
do you think there's a reason that the
uh the list is not being uh public
of course there is
do you think that the only reason
is because there are americans on the
list you think that's the only reason
that it's not being released because
there are americans on the list nope
here's my guess
it's not being released because there
are foreigners on the list
and we don't want to throw our allies
under the bus
so even if you thought oh i'm going to
throw these democrats onto the bus or
somebody else
you wouldn't want to necessarily throw
great britain under the bus
right
so my guess is that whatever else is
there
if trump never asked for a copy of the
epstein client list and i don't believe
for a second it doesn't exist do you
do do you believe it doesn't exist
do
there's no way that
they don't have that
somebody has it
right and he could have asked for it
could he not
because there would be a national
security
whoever is on that list would be a
matter of national security so it
wouldn't matter if it was a state legal
action or anything else the president
united states should be able to see it
because it would be directly and very
importantly linked to national security
so of course he could ask for it
so i'm going to say
it probably exists
trump probably asked for it because it
would really matter
he probably would have legal access to
it
and if there's one thing you're going to
keep with you and take to mar-a-lago
it's that
it's that
now that would explain why there's so
many of them
because it's got to be more than one
topic
but you could easily imagine that he
could find blackmail on a variety of
topics
some of it i think also is just personal
because i think his relationship with
kim jong-un is partly political and
probably personal
and that he may have thought you know
maybe some of this is personal so i
think it's going to be not one thing
i don't think you're going to find out
that they're all about one topic
it's not going to be about a biography
it's not going to be about
selling them
uh or secrets it's going to be
some of it is for blackmail
and some of it may be just some weird
weird other reason that wasn't that
important
so i think it's gonna be primarily
blackmail
that's my
that's my uh
hypothesis
all right
now i don't know if we'll ever know so
it's probably a safe hypothesis we'll
never be able to
test it
um
so you don't think it was blackmail
uh no
so some people think it wasn't blackmail
what do you think it was
now you could also call it insurance so
maybe blackmail's the wrong thing it
could be insurance
as in if you put me to jail
this list is going to come out could be
that that would be a smart move if i
were him if i were him i'd do that
that's exactly what i would do
yeah
leverage maybe
oh
it could be documents about fbi
shenanigans to screw with trump yeah
could be
uh could be something about biden and
ukraine but i feel like we would have
been told that by now
all right that's all i got for now i
will go do something else and i'll talk
to you tomorrow youtube have a great
weekend
