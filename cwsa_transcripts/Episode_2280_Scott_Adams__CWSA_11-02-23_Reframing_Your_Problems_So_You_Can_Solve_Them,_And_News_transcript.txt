good morning everybody and welcome to
the show that you've been waiting for
it's called coffee with Scott Adams and
if you'd like to take this experience
which is already practically orgasmic up
the levels that nobody can even
understand with a human mind all you
need is a cup or M Glass a tankered chal
orstein a canteen Jugger flask a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee join me now for the
UN the unparallel pleasure the dopamine
h of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous zp and it happens
now so
good well I know a number of you who are
streaming in well I think I'll wait to
make this announcement in a little bit
uh but we'll start with
this if you were a uh subscriber to the
Dilbert
reborn comic either on the locals
platform Scott adams. locals.com or you
could be subscribing on the
xplatform um you would know that I've
introduced a new character called uh
Jennifer Jennifer is her first name or
last name is z
z and her friends call her Jen Z J gen Z
and she's a stereotypical genz and she's
dealing with all the Discrimination that
people have about the Gen Z workers so
yeah Jen will be working on that today
gen Z new character also I've uh I think
I'm going to keep doing this
probably um I'm starting to publish the
dilber comic only in digital Forum this
year because it's too late to make a
paper one because I got cancelled and
sort of set me back a little bit next
year I'll look into making a paper
version but for now if you wanted to
gift somebody the uh daily
comic I would recommend that you sign up
for the uh if it's all you want is the
comic just sign up for the uh I'd
probably sign up on the xplatform
because that would be $3 a month CU
that's so for you know $3 * 12 you get
the daily dber reborn that's new every
day but I'm also including one page a
day of the Dilbert calendar and the
approach I'm taking is that it'll be the
10 years ago comic so whatever is
today's date the 10 year ago matching
comic will run on the
calendar and if you wanted to gift it
you could buy yourself a uh
subscription and then just email it to
your spouse or friend friend do whatever
if they want in paper they can print it
out and they would have two Comics a day
coming to them by email for example all
right um also if you wanted to get a
Dilbert mug they're running out if you
need one for Christmas as a Christmas
present you better hurry because they're
always limited uh production and if you
want one of those you should go to the
xplatform and look for Erica at uh her
uh X profile is z Erica z i a e r i CA
Zia Erica all one
word and that'll show you where to get
the mugs all right um did you know that
there's a professional cuddler that's a
job so there's a woman named Ella she's
48 years old and she's a single woman
and she will cuddle with you for $150 an
hour
non-sexually non-sexually cuddling I
would totally pay for
that in case there's anybody who's too
embarrassed to say oh I'm not such a
loser I'm such a loser I wouldn't I
wouldn't admit that I would pay for
somebody to hug me oh I would totally
pay for it in terms of things that could
make you healthy you know the the dollar
per value if you could afford it I mean
of course it's like everything you'd
have to be able to afford it but if you
could afford it I would definitely pay
for that yep no doubt about it I would
pay for that service
once or twice a
week um so that's just so you'll feel
less embarrassed if you decide you want
to do it you can just say I'll do it
just say well you know that cartoonist
guy does it or I would all right
um Mr Beast do you know Mr Beast he's a
monster of social media has the biggest
or one of the biggest social media
presences in the world and part of why
he is so famous as he does does cool
things and people talk about it and for
Halloween he handed out
iPhones every kid who came to the house
got an
iPhone now that is amazing now he's he's
super super rich from his social media
work so he can give every kid an iPhone
I don't know how many gave out but one
kid he gave a a pile of cash gave him a
$10,000 pile of cash I think it was a
little girl can't remember if it was a
boy or a girl but there's a video of him
just handing is it the pile is about you
know I it's 4 Ines tall or something
it's just a big pile of cash so the
trick or treat treater comes up and he
hands her a big pile of cash and they're
like really can I keep this yeah big
pile of cash $10,000 keep it it was
actually amazing amazing um
entertainment so he's very good at what
he does so certainly understands the
public let's talk about uh don Jr
apparently he testified in this case
about the property values of the Trump
properties and whether they were
inflated or deflated or whatever and uh
he gave this
answer that should have been the only
headline that the entire story about the
Trump people you know allegedly
inflating or deflating their property
taxes to get benefits Don junr
says and I'm paraphrasing my accountant
does
that what uh apparently 90% of the
public will learn for the first time
that the executives don't really make
too many accounting decisions on their
own they kind of hire big expensive
accounting firms to do that for them now
they might ask some
questions but they're not going to do
something illegal because the boss told
them
to doesn't really work that that way the
big accounting firm they're not going to
take your word for it if it's just crazy
now now they do take your word for stuff
that that's part of what they do they
they will say we did not audit you know
the data to see if the data is correct
we're just you know doing the math on it
to pay your taxes so they do always have
an out but if you if you told them
something that was patently
ridiculous they're not going to just
take your word for it they're going to
do a little checking so I would be
amazed if Trump got in trouble for the
evaluation stuff I think that just
always comes down to there was some
accountant who thought it was his best
estimate of things and that's the whole
story somebody in the accounting world
made an
estimate all right so I expect nothing
to come of that um you may know that uh
there was some controversy about uh
windmills off the east coast
killing whales and I think 75 whales
have died recently washed up um really
really obvious whale death I mean
there's no doubt about it something
suddenly was killing whales and it was
the same time as the the big windmills
went in and there's obvious causation
you know the humming disorients them or
something so um you may know that the
the same
Erica I mentioned with the mugs uh had
been advocating to and the at least the
new build builds and Michael sh
shellenberger was part of that and it
looks like they got some victory here um
so the orad company that was uh they
abandoned the projects they had planned
to build off the coast in New Jersey now
that doesn't that doesn't help the ones
that are already there I guess right so
the windmills that already exist
probably still going to kill whales it
might be more to go more to do on that
but uh at least there was enough
pressure to stop a new a new project for
killing more whales so advocacy
Works look at that good job Erica save
some
oils all right ABC News
Australia at this weird headline uh a
year after Elon Musk bought Twitter X is
now a quote worthless platform some say
is no longer safe for
activists
really really it's a worthless platform
that activists can't use what what would
make it less useful for
activists what what would that be would
it be
violence no no Twitter doesn't cause any
violence because of the change of
ownership no is it uh because because if
you're an activist you're not allowed to
have an account no no you're allowed to
have an account so you're allowed to
have an
account oh oh I know it's that Twitter
has algorithms that suppress certain
people if they don't like their opinions
right oh no it's not that because that's
what Elan musk got rid of he got rid of
the fake algorithms so let's see they
can sign up they can say anything they
want just like everybody
else what makes it
worthless oh could it be that Community
notes are attached to things that are
obvious and that much of
activism is just obvious could
it be that now that the conservatives
are not suppressed that when somebody
says something that's terrible
there's a lot more people saying that's
terrible because they're not
suppressed could it be that freedom of
speech doesn't work if you're your idea
is batshit crazy doesn't work as
well does it that whole freedom of
speech is really you up isn't
it
sorry if you ever thought that ABC News
was like a legitimate news entity nope
definitely not a legitimate news entity
they are just activists who are mad that
they can't control the
world all right I would like to give you
now the reframe of reframes I call it
the alpha reframe I'm going to give you
reframe that for some of you I like to
do this it's like you know for some of
you this will be completely
life-altering I'm simply going to tell
you something just a few sentences that
for some of you will completely change
your life in a positive way you ready
for this here's the ultimate
reframe the usual reframe goes like this
and I think a lot of you are in this
category I have trouble sleeping how
many of you would say that's true of
yourself I have trouble
sleeping pretty much everybody right all
right here's the reframe instead of
saying I have trouble sleeping say I
don't exercise
enough now I already told you about this
one but I'm going to extend it that's
what makes it the alpha
reframe if you exercise enough will you
sleep better not 100% of the time but
pretty close my own experience is that
when I exercise enough
I always sleep and when I don't I almost
can't no matter what else happened
doesn't matter if my day was good or bad
or what tomorrow looks like nothing if I
exercised I go to
sleep now that's not enough I haven't
stopped there if you exercise enough
you're going to get enough sleep if you
get enough sleep and I call this by the
way you've heard of twofers a twofer is
where you get two benefits well if you
exercise in order to fix your sleep
that's two benefits you got to exercise
because you had another reason to do it
oh I'm not exercising just to be uh
handsome or good-looking or healthy I'm
also fixing my biggest problem is I
can't get to sleep that's a TW fur this
is a six
fur six benefits you
ready exercise helps you sleep what does
sleep help you do improves your diet did
you know that sleep improves your diet
if you're tired your body will register
hunger that's not a genuine hunger it's
just one of those feelings that have a
crossover yeah it's like thirst
sometimes you think you're tired but
you're really thirsty because you're
dehydrated some of these things are
tricky the thing you feel isn't
necessarily the thing that's going on so
you fix your exercise to fix your sleep
your sleep fixes your diet your sleep
fixes your mental health your sleep
fixes your relationships your sleep
fixes your performance at work and
therefore your potential in your
career exercise sleep diet mental health
relationships work performance six
 benefits from exercise it's a
six
for and so the next time you say you
can't sleep tell yourself godamn it I'm
going to exercise
tomorrow you can even use
that you should swear at yourself you
should get mad at yourself you should
say God damn it I'm an I need to
I need to exercise tomorrow and when I
say exercise I mean a long walk right
you don't need to hit the weights I like
weights I I highly recommend doing at
least lightweight training at every age
but but just take a walk right now
there's nothing stopping you from
standing up and walking out the door and
walking around the block unless you live
in a dangerous neighborhood like San
Francisco all right so that's your Alpha
reframe it's a
sixer there's a uh painting that just
sold at an auction in New York for $
46.5
million uh the top of the painting is
yellow and the bottom is blue and that's
it that's it I think it maybe is
suggestive of the Ukraine flag or
something but I has anybody ever heard
of this guy Mark
Rothco do you think you could have made
a painting that was just yellow at the
top and blue at the bottom and that's
it no well uh apparently Elon mus said
the other day it might have been on Joe
Rogan uh a number of these very
high-priced art things are tax evasion
and money
laundering yeah
so you're telling me that Hunter Biden
after all that pressure for being the
you know the the sketchy money guy goes
directly into the business that is the
most obvious money laundering business
in the history of the world the most
directly
obviously thing now I ask
again have you seen a video of Hunter
Biden making one of his paintings and
I'm not I'm not talking about the one
where he's blowing paint through a
straw okay because I do believe he can
blow paint through a straw but he also
have paintings that look like they're a
very
highlevel skilled person made them
wouldn't you love to see about 10
minutes of Hunter Biden making a
painting wouldn't
you now I don't think there's any uh law
that would force him to show you that he
he paints them
himself I don't think you can force
anybody to do that so it is kind of the
perfect public crime it's one of the few
crimes you can just do right in front of
everybody it's like hey everybody
selling the
painting it's pretty good business to
get into until they cat you put you in
jail all
right um does any does anybody think
there's any chance that Hunter is just a
legitimate artist in paintings nobody
thinks that's real
right right but isn't it amazing that
even though we know it's not real it
makes no difference in the real
world Hunter will just do it right in
front of
you
yeah
so there's that all right here's a story
that uh really tore me up this morning
let's see if I can get through this
so it turns out that uh Run
DMC um which one was it
run I I get I'm confused but I think it
was run
run which which which artist was it the
one who has the uh well one of them had
spasmodic dysphonia and that's the voice
problem that made him so sad because he
couldn't rap CU he had the same voice
problem I used to have it's the same one
that uh F K Jr has where the vocal cords
clench and he talks about how he tried
to get treatment using Botox shots but
he passed out during the botox shot now
if I've never describe to you what the
botox into the vocal cords process looks
like I'm just going to say it's the
scariest thickest needle you've ever
seen in your life and it goes through
the front of your throat and it doesn't
stay there it penetrates the entire
front to get to the back because that's
where your vocal cords are the first
needle is just a numb you so you don't
scream when the second one goes in does
it hurt well you'll feel a needle in
your
throat poking around it doesn't know
exactly where to poke because
everybody's vocal cords a little
different so there's a little bit of you
know technique about it when you get
that shot if it works it only works for
a few weeks it sort of numbs your vocal
cord so they have a hard time clenching
but you would talk sort of like this you
you talk sort of like sort of like you'd
done you'd uh take gas from a balloon or
something so so if you a public
performer there isn't any really way you
could be a rapper you could be
understood but your your voice would be
like this forever and that would only be
good for a few
weeks if you're lucky and then the boat
Talk starts wearing off so you have to
time it so when you get the new shot it
hasn't doubled the amount of Botox
because you got it too soon so so you
never know quite how much poison you
have in your vocal cords because it's
sort of a judgment trial and error kind
of thing and each trial and error
involves a giant needle through your
neck uh I've done it so I'm not talking
hypothetically I've had had this
procedure um
apparently the rapper just passed down
cold like that th this is the scariest
 you've ever seen in your life
honestly I've never done anything
scarier and after a few treatments of it
I think I did three maybe I said uh no
thank you I will live with my disability
and I'll try to figure out something
else eventually through my um let's say
tenaciousness and the fact that I'm a uh
uh there's no way to say this other than
to just say it directly I'm a high
functioning individual in a modern
society so I was able to chase the
ground a cure which was very hard to
find and I had to like travel I mean I
had to search the world I had to use
every Google alert every time there was
a suggestion of a cure I would track it
down right so I was a wild man do you
know why I was such a wild man do you
know why I said I will stop at nothing
to fix this problem because I was
suicidal I was 100% suicidal the only
reason I didn't is because other people
depended on me but my own life was
garbage the quality of life was way
below the line of being worth living
wasn't close there was there was no way
to have joy or a good day every day you
woke up was a bad day because you were
like a ghost in the world you couldn't
have conversations you couldn't you
couldn't nourish your relationships you
couldn't make a phone call couldn't
answer the phone couldn't order at a
restaurant just imagine what that would
be like all right so uh and apparently
the rapper from Run DMC uh was suicidal
and he ended up um with an addiction
problem as well
and Etc now
I think he still has the condition as
far as I
know uh but why did he not get the
surgical
cure do you know why he didn't get the
surgical
cure anybody want to take a
guess well why don't you take a Google
search for spasmodic
dysphonia and then see what Google tells
you are the treatments it's going to
tell you both
Botox and also Botox and also Botox do
you think it will refer you to the
surgeons who can cure
it check for yourself see for yourself
now here are the things you know these
are things you know for sure oh and I
can tell you this for sure after I got
cured and I realized that the reason
other people were not being cured is
that they simply didn't know there was a
solution so I did a fairly aggressive
public relations thing there was a big
spread on me in People magazine how I
cured my voice problem and you know I I
did other interviews and I talked about
it on social media and I just wanted to
create a base so that if anybody ever
Googled spasmodic dysphonia I would be
the first person to come up and then
they would see my story and then they
would know there's a
cure do you know where my story is now
after I got
cancelled it's gone I don't think you
could find it too
easily now what about the surgery itself
because you know I'm not the only person
who got it I'm not the only person who
knows about it in fact the the person
who did my surgery sits on the board of
directors of the spasmic dysphonia
foundation or whatever it's called the
organization
right go Google it now here's here's
what we know for sure
there's lot there are tens of thousands
of people in the United States who have
spasmodic
dysphonia we know that for sure we also
know for sure that it causes you to have
suicidal ideation I've been in groups of
spasmodic dysphonia people they'll all
tell you the same thing yeah I
considered it why don't they do it
always the same reason other people they
they have some responsibility so they're
hanging around that's it if you gave
them a choice of is this worth living
quite a few of them would say you know
honestly it's not I only do it for these
other people now how many people do you
think didn't have anybody that they
needed to support
enough that didn't stop
them probably there's no way to know for
sure probably there are people who could
have been cured by
surgery who killed themselves
because the Google
search did what it
did did it do it by accident do you
think the Google search is the Way It Is
by accident nope probably not no way to
know um so I can't I can't make it a
certain allegation it just seems to me
that when you with the truth people
die and this looks like a real clear
example
of
somebody I'm not even going to say who I
don't know who but it looks like
somebody with the truth and I'll
guarantee you somebody
died yeah your algorithm can kill you if
they hide the
truth now do you think that Run
DMC even today do you think he knows
that there's a surgical
cure probably not probably not cuz he
can't go gole
it all
right and did canceling me get somebody
killed possibly canceling me might have
killed people because they couldn't
google me
anymore here's a clever little thing
changing the topic a little
bit um anyway that that just tore me up
this
morning but anyway um you know how the
Sphinx is kind of a mystery how it got
built and it looks like it's been eroded
by wind or water or something and we
always talk about it it turns out
there's a new hypothesis that looks
really strong and I feel I feel bad for
the
Egyptians because their uh let's say
their reputation keeps like going down
you remember when you thought the
ancient Egyptians built the pyramids for
sure so ancient Egyptians
awesome and then people start saying I
not so sure I don't know if it was the
ancient Egyptians I'm like really give
them something right yeah give those
ancient Egyptians a a little bit of
credit you know maybe they did but you
know they lots of uh YouTube videos
supposing something magical
happened uh but now the Sphinx another
big sort of Egyptian success story I
guess um they did a test and they found
out that the Sphinx can be formed like
90% of its shape can be formed by the
wind that's right if you if you have a
desert where there's some hard Parts you
know something is harder than something
else then if the wind is blowing past
that the the sand will blow away but the
you know the stiffer hardened Parts
would remain behind and they did test
and they found out it it often looks
like a
sphinx if you just if you just have hard
parts and soft parts and blow on them
they turn into a sphinx and by that I
mean the body is just sort of a a
rounded
rectangle and sometimes there would be
something that looks like a head just
cuz there might be a Harden thing that
happened to be in that position so the
speculation is that the ancient
Egyptians discovered it and said hey
look at that that thing if you sort of
squint at it it looks like an animal you
know on its hunches or whatever that is
and then they said I got an idea let's
like put a nose on it and you know build
it down a little bit make it make it
look like a
lion so it's possible that it was a
natural uh at least the the interior of
it was natural and then they sort of
coated it and carved it up a little bit
and turned it into a sphinx apparently
there's some other examples of it around
the world so anyway I don't know if
that's true but it's
fun well I guess Biden was giving a
fundraiser talk and there was some uh
craze
protester uh yelling at him and then he
made the following claims in public he
said he convinced BB that would be
Netanyahu to you to call for a
ceasefire which apparently never
happened and he talked to Cece which I
guess is the Egyptian leader to convince
him to open the
door which also never
happened now that's the reporting I I
can't I can't be sure they never talked
or that he never said these things but
it's reported that he made two claims
which are like
wildly
important they just lied just made it up
now I don't know I don't know what the
truth is there but that's that's the
allegation uh
apparently they sent K Harris out in the
aftermath of the October 7th Slaughter
in Israel you know the most worst
terrorism you know really I've ever
heard of I've never heard of anything
worse than that honestly uh so they send
K Harris out in that context to
uh try to convince people to reduce
their
islamophobia so she thinks thinks uh too
much islamophobia and that's her that's
her message she wants to she wants to
get out the word that there's too much
islamophobia now how how do you
interpret
this how could she
accidentally read the room that wrong I
mean talk about the wrong reading of the
room I mean if she had gone out and said
you know we don't want any
discrimination in any Direction and then
call down anti-jewish discrimination as
well as anti-islamic discrimination I
would say good job that's what I would
say I say good job that's about what we
need we we need a a leader who goes out
there and say hey stop hating each other
for these reasons that'd be great but
now she decided to go a full uh got
counter this
islamophobia and it makes me wonder was
this a
prank
do you think there was any point where
they said all right for sure we don't
want her as our future president what
could we do today to reduce the chance
she could ever be a president hey I've
got an idea what is it let's send her
out right after October 7th to say
there's too much
islamophobia and then also anti-Semitism
right no this is the beauty of it not
even going to mention not even going to
mention the
anti-Semitism what that would be like
insane I know that's the whole point oh
I get it now we're going to send her out
and see if she's dumb enough to go full
you know countering anti- countering
islamophobia which is good and we're
just going to leave out the other part
right after October 7th exactly and that
will guarantee she's never president and
I think it worked it did guarantee that
she'll never be
president um so
well do you think K Harris uh has been a
big move forward for uh black women or
women I feel like she's doing such a bad
job that it's hard not to think she's a
minority you know diversity
higher like she looks like the the
prototypical diversity hire mistake you
know where you
overcorrected it's like okay we like
diversity that's great but you may have
over corrected in this case it may be
the most prominent diversity hireing
mistake of all time well I guess it is
wouldn't you say I I would argue that a
lot of people would say Obama did a good
job I know I know my audience doesn't
like to hear that but a lot of people
would say that how many people are
saying that com Harris is nailing it no
serious person there's no serious person
who think she's doing a good
job so that's a step backwards for uh
black people black women
women pretty much everybody but women
are doing great in MBA uh classes now
women make up um half or more of MBA
classes I guess since the 80s women have
been getting into college and graduating
at higher rates than men
so women are uh doing great
educationwise uh thanks to tremendous
effort on top of the uh NBA schools to
make sure that white men don't get uh a
fair Shake in America that's just
another way to tell the story both true
both true that the colleges are doing a
great job increasing diversity
especially for
women 100% good job also doing a great
job of making this a shitty country for
white men uh reducing their chances of
success great job on that
too here's a question that David boxen
horn on the xplatform asked and I don't
know if there is an answer to this but
if you if you've heard of anything like
this let me know David asks uh and he
says I've asked this twice on the
xplatform without getting an answer I'll
ask it a third time has any important
Muslim religious leader you know key
word religious leader condemned the
Hamas attack as being un
unlam condemn it for being
unlam have
they it's a good question isn't
it
so how are you going to fight
islamophobia if you don't have any
important Muslim religious leaders
condemning the Hamas attack as being un
Islamic if the religious leaders think
it's Islamic then islamophobia makes
perfect
sense it it would be crazy not to be
islamophobic if they don't condemn it in
fact it's almost a it's almost an
invitation to be their
enemy
right I would say it's an invit to
hate
now but but let me just say I would
condemn as lhob in general like I don't
think there's any there's no good reason
to just hate somebody because of their
religion but if their religion includes
some code that says it's okay to do what
happened on October 7th well then I
would say it's perfectly good to
discriminate like crazy because that
would be self-defense now now I've said
this before um discrimination bigotry
has no place when it comes to you know
hiring renting a place selling a home
having a personal relationship who you
marry you know where your kids go to
school like all the normal things of
society no discrimination should be
tolerated for these reasons you know
race religion any of that stuff gender
so I think we're all on that same page
however in the context of
self-defense you can do anything you
want and if that requires you to be
islamophobic to survive go do that for
selfdefense yeah so nobody's ever
countered me on this point that
discrimination in normal Civil Society
completely
unwelcome and destructive to the societ
Society but if you're trying to stay
alive discriminate all you want and you
should you should discriminate as hard
as you need to to stay alive but no
harder if you're discriminating you know
just for entertainment or whatever that
be crazy but for
sure if there's a group that has decided
that your life is worthless you should
take that into consideration in your
self-defense keeping your family safe
all right but don't discriminate against
individuals
um have you noticed that uh television
is now
unwatchable so obviously you know that
the the Israel is doing their best to
frame this situation to get support you
know of course that the Palestinians and
the supporters of Hamas are framing the
situation in a way to get the most
support what what that means in the
Practical level is that if you turn on
the TV somebody's going to be describing
the vicious death of a baby or possibly
a
mother I can listen to some of that
because I I need to understand you know
how dire the situation is I can't listen
to too much of it so um my new thing is
that the moment the propaganda comes on
and by the way when I call it propaganda
a that's not an insult it's also not a
call to have less of it in the context
of war the propaganda is also a weapon
and Israel is in an all- weapon War so
if they have a weapon they can use use
it you know they have the right of
self-defense and short of a nuclear or
you know maybe gas attack that's banned
all tools are on the table and
propaganda is just the tool
so when you watch the news just be fully
aware it's not news during this war you
know all the news of this area is just
propaganda it's propaganda on the left
it's propaganda on the right but none of
it is really an attempt to tell you
what's going on in some balanced way
because it's War now that's why I told
you early on and I'll remind you I'm not
trying to be
objective about the Israel Gaza thing
I'm not even trying to be objective I'm
taking
sides and I'm taking sides because the
October 7th thing was so beyond the pale
of civilized behavior that it has to be
addressed in the most aggressive way
possible now you might say but Scott
what about the history of the region I
don't
care that's it I don't care about the
history of the
region not at all not even a little bit
and you can't make me care there's no
story you can tell about the bad things
that happened probably probably bad
things happened one side was worse than
the other maybe I don't care I don't
care if one side was worse maybe maybe
these people should have a right to
return so I don't care it's all history
and it's their history it's not even my
history don't care what used to
what happened in the past don't care you
guys can care and kill each other over
it but I don't have to care what I care
about is what's happening today and what
happened today you know this month is
something that Civilization
cannot cannot let go un
addressed and that's the only thing I
care about so when I say I'm backing
Israel in their actions that doesn't
mean I back everything they do you know
the way they do it the specific way they
do it I'm just saying in general they
have a full right to
self-defense somebody says I'm a puppet
I promise you that if Israel had done
this attack on the Palestinians I would
be
anti-israel I promise
you do you not believe that do you do
you think I would have been okay if the
Israelis had attacked the gazin and
ripped babies apart and I'd be like well
you know they had a good reason no I
would not no there are some things that
don't even they're not even in the realm
of
politics I would consider what
Hamas did and what they've done to their
people as mass brain
damage so you have a you have a
population that are just brain damaged
at this point that their brains are not
compatible with modern
civilization that's brain damage
because brain damage would be you know
you can't function in the world as it
exists whereas other people can they
can't function in the world as it exists
that's brain damage so I'm not in favor
of the brain damage
people I'm in favor the people who are
functioning people who did
not um well they suffered a terrible
thing and I don't want to see that
happen anywhere again so there should be
a maximum response but
um as far as the question about you know
the two-state solution and the uh blah
blah blah about the Palestinians it
probably is
terrible that they probably have some
argument to make you know what I think
about their
argument there's nobody who had a better
shot at success than Gaza do you know
why because they had
funding they had a good
location and they had if they had gone
you know if they' gone in any civilized
Direction they would have the best
trading partner in the world in that
part of the world because they would
have a you know connection to Israel if
they had decided to go that direction
and you know you add the
location and the the fact that they're
right in a nice good economic
area they could have easily been um you
know a paradise very easily they chose a
different
way now I do feel Sympathy for the
regular citizens who are not especially
political but you know get dragged into
it but you know I don't have a solution
for
that all right it is what it is so don't
watch the coverage
um yeah if if the coverage is just going
to be more making you feel bad just turn
it off don't don't watch that
um the Hamas
leadership now here's one of those
situations where there's there's an
obvious right answer in my
opinion the Hamas leadership apparently
is operating in the open at least in
Cutter
and here's how I think Israel should
handle it they should give the host
country a reason aable deadline to turn
the person
over um just to be
polite but either way they should make
the host country completely understand
that that person is going to be dead and
by a certain
date you could put a date on it you
could just say uh after this date if
you've not handed him over to us after
this date make sure you're not standing
within a block of anywhere he is
because he's going to die and then they
would say my God that would be a war
against Qatar if you did that if you
attacked him on our soil and then Israel
should say yes that's what it
is and then they should say you will pay
a huge price for this and then Israel
should say give us the
bill give us the bill we'll pay
it but he's going to be dead we have to
take away from you uh you have to
reframe this you want to reframe it away
from a
negotiation and into a how do you want
them to die if they if they imagine
they're negotiating you're in the wrong
frame there's no negotiating that guy's
 dead Israel is going to kill him
with
certainty they need to make qara know
that in this case this is not normal
business this guy's going to die there's
going to be a lot of exploding wherever
he is after this
date you do what you want Qatar do
whatever you want get whatever Revenge
you want he's going to die in this
statee he can either do it on your
territory or ours that's the only choice
you
have that's how I'd play it and I think
just in general um the leaders need to
have a little more skin in the
game all right uh there's a story about
uh Bridgeport Connecticut
a judge has decided that the election
was uh very rigged and the ballot boxes
were stuffed uh the the exterior ballot
boxes what do you call them the ballot
drop off places um and they've got a
video of people stuffing them you know
obviously and apparently it's just it
was just so rigged that the judge was
just couldn't even believe
it
now here's a question suppose oh I don't
know
Suppose there had been no video on those
dropboxes oh we'll call them dropboxes
thank you drop boxes Suppose there had
been no video and no
Witnesses would anybody know that the
cheating
happened my understanding is that they
were stealing ballots somehow and
throwing away the ones I knew were
against them and stuffing them with ones
that who
knows how how much of what was what
happened in small race could have
happened in any race and also gotten
away with
it it it's hard to imagine that the
Democrats are still sitting there
thinking well it must have been a fair
election because the courts didn't catch
anybody do you know how dumb
that
is there there are some things that are
opinions and there are some things that
are so stupid that you just have
to call it out as stupid if you think
the election was fair because nobody got
caught you're a
idiot now if I said I know the elections
were rigged I'd be a idiot right
is that fair if I said I know they're
rigged because I don't I mean it
certainly there's certainly
indications there are suggestions their
allegations right but personally I've
not seen something that that convinces
me somebody found something that would
prove the elections were were wrecked
proof because I think that no matter how
much you suspect no matter how much your
anecdotal observations confirm it you
still need the goods right we still live
in a world where you got to produce the
goods maybe it'll happen someday who
knows
but if you're if you're confident that
the election was fair because nobody
went to jail for rigging it you're a
idiot how could you live in the United
States and see that every institution is
corrupt and just think that that one is
the good
one I mean you'd have to be super super
dumb to think that you know a national
election is fair or not
fair now if they found proof it was
rigged then you know you might have
something that you could be sure about
but you don't have that so being unsure
is the correct logical place to
be but if you were unsure but you had a
opinion about the
likelihood then you'd also be in good
shape uh the likelihood is that every
institution is corrupt those are the
odds right the odds are any institution
that's been around while is corrupted by
now because everything that can be
corrupted gets corrupted eventually
there's no exception to that if it can
be corrupted it'll get
corrupted all right um remember the
shooter Robert card the guy in Maine who
killed a bunch of people um we still
don't
know what pharmaceutical drugs he may
have been on if any do you think we'll
ever know that do you think they'll ever
tell us
or do you think that big Pharma is
powerful enough to make sure that that's
never in the
news I don't think it'll ever be in
network news because they're all backed
by big Pharma but it might you know may
come out in some internet
platform all
right uh you all know uh live streamer
stickon Hammer 666 let's just call them
sticks um he's saying that that YouTube
is you know massively shadowbanning him
and yeah he and he's right he's right of
course and I realized that one of the
biggest benefits of the
xplatform is it gives you a standard
which you can compare to your other um
social media
experiences so in my case my YouTube
channel has stayed basically flat no
matter what all right there'll be a few
bumps like when I got cancelled but
basically then it goes right back to
same number in fact I can tell you the
number of viewers today
6600 right I I don't know the detail but
I will tell you the answer that when I
turn it off it'll be
6600 and I I'll I'll tell the locals
people if I got it right and it's
because the the traffic doesn't seem to
have any
relationship to how well I'm doing or
anything it just seems like it's
flatlined and it has for years
likewise my um my Instagram traffic or
followers pretty much just constant
hasn't changed in the longest time but
my ex
traffic zooming up my uh number of
subscribers both on X and on the locals
platform doubled since last year double
while those other things are flat do you
think that's
natural do you think my Instagram
traffic is just completely natural it
just stays the same no matter
what uh do you think my YouTube uh
traffic is just natural so yesterday I
lost my monetization on
Spotify looks like it might be a
technical problem or some other kind of
problem but they just eliminated my
monit ization so for podcasting now how
many times have I had my Monet
monetization taken away lots of times
it's always
temporary right it feels a lot like the
Hamas strategy for trying to get Israel
to leave you know you just Peck them to
death with every little thing you can
that's what it feels like I mean it
could be a bunch of coincidences it be
but it be a lot of coincidences wouldn't
it do do you think there are any left
leaning people who uh got demonetized on
Spotify I don't know
maybe all right so ladies and
gentlemen that is all I wanted to talk
about today I think I've changed your
lives let's see if I missed any big
stories um I don't talk about Israel's
attack on Gaza because I don't believe
any of
it you okay with that so there there
will be endless stories about what
Israel did or did not do in Gaza I don't
believe any of them I don't believe the
positive ones I don't believe they
necessarily killed the one of the
planners not
necessarily you know for example if they
accidentally bombed the wrong place are
they more likely to say well we're
pretty sure there was a Hamas leader
under there or are they likely say oh
shoot we killed a bunch of civilians we
didn't mean to kill which would be more
likely well in war information is a tool
so you would
expect that both sides are shading the
news to you know support their narrative
and that there's nobody who knows what's
happening who has an interest in telling
you the truth would you agree on that
there's nobody who would have the
information about what's really
happening who also wants you to know
it or wants you to know the honest
version there's nobody like that so I'm
kind of ignoring the stories about you
know Israel increased their attack or
they they took out a leader but some
civilians died I don't believe any of it
and I would recommend you don't believe
any of it either which is different from
saying it's not true some of it's true
some of it's half true some of is
completely true some of it's out in
context but there's nothing useful that
you're going to learn by watching the
news if if Israel is doing its job right
and all indications are it's doing a
good job for what it's trying to
accomplish they would be completely
managing the information Flow by
now the that they they're probably
turning off the power to make sure there
aren't too many phones that work they
can't get information out on their own
and then they can control the the
information um universe so part of the
war is controlling the minds and the
news and I'd say they're probably doing
a good job of that probably doing a good
job I somebody I saw El jazer mentioned
in the comments
um I think it was Peter Zan who said
that the best news source in general is
El Al
jazer but on this specific conflict it's
the worst
CU they're just you know sort of on one
team so uh LG zero seems to be an asset
when it's something that they don't care
about but the moment they care about it
it becomes a useless
basically like all new
sources um didn't we set that up I don't
think
so Scott has Gman amnesia
about
what
uh I'm seeing is that one of those just
generic insults because you don't have
an opinion and your brain is
broken Glenn figure it out Glenn you're
not so dumb you can't figure out the
left right thing don't don't act I love
it when people act dumb to as a
gotcha that that's like the most annoing
thing sometimes there's a gotcha that's
there like they can actually get you but
other times they'll act like they don't
understand an easy point so they can get
you so they're Glenn here is pretending
he doesn't understand a very simple
concept so they can get me Glenn maybe
it's just you not understanding
something pretty simple maybe a
said uh PJ says that I only believe the
news I want to believe even when it's
from the same Source PJ are you
deaf did you miss everything I just said
the last five minutes all of it the part
about not believing anything from either
side you miss that completely and your
interpretation of don't believe anything
from anybody your interpretation is that
I'm believing one
side I'm not even talking about it I
just believe it so much I won't even
report that somebody said it I
disbelieve it that much but your take
from it is you just believe that one
side that's what Gilman Amnesia
is do you even know what it
is I think you like don't know what the
concept is or
something simplest way to solve the debt
crisis we should not pay
it that would be the end of
civilization I don't know if somebody
told you that the only the only person
who would suffer would be China if we
stopped paying our
debt you might you might need to improve
your new sources if that's what somebody
told you Scott please reach out to RFK
that's old news we've already
communicated he's already had a
procedure I I saw a video of him on
on so on Oliver Stone's documentary
about JFK RFK is one of the you know
main uh people he interviews and if you
listen to RFK Jr's voice from was
probably I don't know a year or two ago
and you compare it to today it's really
different so whatever procedure he had
was different than the one I had but he
had a procedure that improved it at
least 30 40% I mean it's quite
noticeable
do I like board games no do you know why
I don't like board games they have board
built right into them board they spell
it different but differently but I know
what they
mean uh what's the announcement you
mentioned early in the
broadcast
um I think it was about the
mugs
I think I already did
it RFK is for
reparations yeah that's sort of
disqualifying how is my voice now
compared to well I'll give you um my
impression of myself
talking you know I might actually have a
clip of it I'll see if I can find the
audio of it someplace I have it but if I
were to answer the phone call no let's
say if a if a flight attendant asked me
for what beverage I wanted and I wanted
a diet coke uh I couldn't say
D um D was the hard one so it be like I
Coke and they say what I Coke and they'd
bring me a regular Coke it happened all
the time CU IAT doesn't sound enough
like diet so I got a lot of regular
Cokes
um I'm glad I quit drinking soda so that
was old
days so if I have Gilman
Amnesia instead of yelling that over and
over again perhaps you could say in a
simple form what I don't
remember go so in the
comments tell me what I don't
remember
you can't right you just learned a new
term and you're yelling it at me but
there's no examples of it so you just
wouldn't quiet as soon as I asked you to
tell me what I got wrong you just
completely wouldn't
quiet the the most worthless people are
the people who call other people
narcissists you're really
worthless you should do something about
that
um all right well you I guess you gave
up on that Gilman Amnesia thing didn't
you all right good I just want to make
sure that was just a troll I thought
maybe there was something I am worthy of
being criticized for but it wasn't
that all right um
nepsy not
narcissist when you say at all at the
end of a sentence you completely Trail
off
uh
what
boy there's there's some broken people
over here today all right that's enough
YouTube I gave you your chance but uh
thanks for joining when I sign off I'm
going to look at the number of people
who joined I'll bet it's
6600 I'll talk to you
tomorrow
