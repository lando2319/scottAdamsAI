[Applause]
hey everybody come on in
you're just on time and it's time
for coffee with scott adams a lot of
people are saying
it's the best thing that's ever happened
to them
i can't give you their names because
they'd like to remain anonymous
but i'm telling you anonymous people
everywhere are saying that this is the
best thing that's ever happened
and we'll do the simultaneous sip in a
moment
but first i'd like to talk about
word thinking because i want to get you
all mad before we start
you ready for this here's a typical
conversation between a
potential transgender person
and a typical conservative
i told you you're going to get mad goes
like this
transgender says you know i know i was
born with
male body parts but on the inside
in my mind i feel that i'm really female
and i'd like the freedom to be able to
live my internal life you know my my
mental truth
and that will take some changes on my
external
parts conservative says
you're a man the transgender says no i
get that
i get what you're saying that i was born
with male body parts
but the part you can't see the part
that's in my head
thinks i'm female and always has you
know it's been many years
i'm in my 30s now
so i get your point but i'd like to
alter the exterior part
to make it consistent with my interior
thoughts
conservative says you're not a woman
and the transgender says yeah we've been
over this
i get what you're saying on the outside
biologically
the stuff you can see i'm definitely a
man
but on the inside the part you can't see
that's personal to me
i'd like to live consistent with my
interior truth conservative says
you're not a woman
are they having the same conversation
they're not the the entire
the entire topic is just
it's just two people having a different
conversation while imagining it's the
same conversation
um somebody says lol they never concede
uh physical biology yes they do
that's why you do the operation the
operation
its only point is because they concede
the physical reality
there's no disagreement here um
now the question of who plays in what
sports leagues
is a completely separate question and
you know i think there are
uh yeah there's room for disagreement in
that
but there's no disagreement about the
fact that somebody has
male parts or female parts when they're
born
and we act as if they're somehow that's
a disagreement all right
now that we've settled that and you know
that that's a fake debate
how about the simultaneous sip if
there's anybody left because i know you
don't like that topic
and if you'd like to enjoy this to the
maximum extent all you need is a cup or
mug or glass a tanker chelsea steiner
canteen jogger flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee and join
me now for the unparalleled pleasure of
the dopamine of the day the thing that
makes
everything better everything it's called
the simultaneous sip and you're gonna
savor it
go
savor it savor it good
good well apparently there's a
bipartisan group of senators ten
senators five dems
five gop and these awesome
people in the middle of the political
spectrum
agreed on an infrastructure package now
of course they would have to
sell their agreement to the wider body
of congress
but amazingly five dems and five
republicans
came up with an agreement for an
infrastructure package
would you like to hear the details of
what they came up with
why what's the difference
it doesn't make any difference it's not
like anybody's going to implement this
agreement
the whole reason that people disagree
is for political reasons if if 10
10 people got together and said hey if
we were to ignore
the politics of this for a moment
what kind of agreement would we come up
with that was just sort of good work for
the public
nobody cares about that are you kidding
me
do you think aoc cares what these 10
people came up with
i don't think so you think bernie cares
no now biden might care because he is
upset just by nature i think you know
that's my opinion of him
but i don't think this is going anywhere
so that's my prediction is that the
bipartisan
agreement means absolutely nothing in
today's day of age
but i'm glad they tried it now if i'm
wrong
suppose i'm wrong suppose
that congress actually agreed on some
version of this
bipartisan package what would that tell
you
if that happened wildly unlikely
but if it happened this is the only way
we should do government
we should do it like this every time if
it works
do you know why we've never done it this
way before
oh actually maybe we have you maybe you
can think of some historical
situation but in the current times i
don't think this is really a thing you
can do
because the people involved are not
trying to do what's right
they're just not they're trying to do
what gets them elected they're trying to
do what their side agrees with
etc so i predict this will go
nowhere but i'd love to be wrong if
there's anything i would like to be
wrong about
it would be that there's some news out
of iran
that i don't know if this is real
it feels exactly like fake news because
it's just a little bit too on the news
but the way it's coming to us looks real
so i guess i'm a little on the fence on
this one
because there is a video and people are
not saying it's fake
but here's the story there's a candidate
for uh president
in iran and the candidate uh mohsin
rezai says that he'd take a thousand
more american hostages
and use the hostage ransom money
to boost the iranian economy
now i'm thinking he probably won't get
elected
that doesn't really seem like a campaign
promise that would
catapult you into the presidency given
that
that would cause us to attack iran and
destroy it completely
but is this real
do you think that a candidate for
president iran actually said that
because it really doesn't sound like
something that somebody would have
really said
in public so i'm going to put a little
asterisk next to this one
and say maybe but if i got caught on
this as fake news i would feel pretty
bad
because it looks like fake news doesn't
mean it is
it just smells like it and looks like it
i don't know how it could be fake news
but it sure looks like it so here's the
good news that could come out of bad
news
critical race theory being taught in our
schools
is very uh divisive turns out there are
plenty
of black americans who think it's a
really bad idea
to divide people by race and make race
your your primary filter on life
and i wonder if there's a positive thing
that could come out of this
which is if critical race theory is what
finally breaks the teachers unions
by taking their credibility completely
out of the universe
maybe we get more school competition it
wasn't the way anybody would have wanted
to do it
but maybe this is such an overreach and
so outrageous
that it is the reason that school
competition
leaps into being uh that plus the
coronavirus
in where maybe you wouldn't have
so it's possible that this is what
breaks the system and breaks the control
of the tissues unions
which as you know are the primary source
of systemic racism because if the
school if the teachers unions didn't
block competition in schools which they
do effectively
by controlling politics they have a lot
of money so they can control politics
locally
if they weren't doing that maybe we'd
have better school competition
maybe we maybe uh black kids and white
kids and
brown kids of all types or low income
could have good educations i'm going to
make a statement
that i feel is fair which is that in the
united states
if you get educated you'll be fine
now that education could include a trade
skill
doesn't have to be traditional college
but
if you get an education or develop a
useful skill
you'll be fine in this country it is
basically all you need
if you stay in jail and don't get
addicted
and so i would like to make this
following statement
in general you know that i like systems
over
goals right i like a system that you're
something you're doing every day to get
you
into a good situation as opposed to a
goal which is i'm going to do this
specific thing
but i don't know how it's kind of
useless
so the goal is to have everything equal
and no racism
right if we can just snap our fingers
and say all right
all the racism is gone and now
everything's equal
well maybe maybe we'd snap our fingers
and get that done
but you need a system to make that
happen
and i would propose the following
focusing
primarily on your problems gives you
more problems
focusing primarily on solutions
gives you more solutions critical race
theory is primarily about
focusing on your problem and if you do
you'll have more problems now
remember your reality that you live in
is subjective
if you wake up in the morning and think
of only your problems then you live in a
world of problems
if you wake up in the morning and think
of only solutions and positive things
not ignoring your problems you still
have to solve problems
but it's not your main focus your focus
is on solutions
what do you get more of more solutions
right the the thing you're focusing on
is the thing you get more of
so if your system is critical race
theory
you're going to get more racism and sure
enough
you're getting more more of exactly what
you're focusing on
if you can't learn this basic thing that
you always get more of what you focus on
again you can't ignore problems but if
you make it your main filter of life
you just get more of them or it will
feel like you have more of them
which ends up having the same impact
right
at least in terms of your subjective
reality so here
instead of treat focusing on the
problems i would suggest as i have many
times
that you teach strategy in schools
life strategy now i of course have
written books on it not that one
but how to fail with almost everything
and still win big would be one example
of life strategies systems you could
teach to young people
there are other ones so it doesn't have
to be mine
but here's the thing if you go to a
young black kid and say
here's a deal there's all kinds of
racist and racism in america
and the black kid says yeah i've seen it
i know what you mean and then you say
okay we're done talking about that
there's nothing else to say plenty of
racism
it's going to be a problem never never
is going to go away
completely do you get that black kid
says yeah i get that that's like most
obvious thing in the world
all right we're done talking about it
now let's talk about what you do about
it
here's your strategy did you know that
if you do well in school
the fortune 500 companies are begging to
hire you and mentor you to is
the highest level you can achieve did
you know that
black kid says what yeah did you know
that if you get an education and go in
for a job interview at any fortune 500
company
that you will be picked ahead of all the
white candidates did you know that
and the black kid will say i did not
know that
well now you do so what are you going to
do about it
are you going to maybe focus on school
because now you know that focusing on
school
100 works maybe it's not school
maybe you're more suited for a trade but
focusing on a trade
100 works it doesn't work sometimes
it works every freaking time so teach
the kids
how to succeed in a world where not
everybody has equal
options but everybody has equal access
to at least one option that's going to
work every time
get a good job go to a big company
that's dying to get more diversity
that is every big company all of them
you could pick your industry
you could pick your career anything
you have all of that available to you
how about just teaching people that
which one do you think gets you a better
result teaching people to focus on their
problems and complain
or teaching people how to minimize their
problems
somewhat in an obvious way
not even a big risk involved
all right why are there no effective
black leaders
now you might say to yourself scott you
racist or you're out of it there are
plenty of effective black leaders
are you kidding me all over the place
for example
uh i don't know i can't think of any but
there used to be i mean martin luther
king was
effective and a black leader and
everybody
understood that less so in his time
but certainly we understand it in modern
times
um i hear somebody in the comments
saying candace owens
but she doesn't really extend over to
you know the other side of the political
aisle
so there's a little bit of a limit there
um
obama didn't really take that mantle you
know he tried to be everybody's
president to his credit by the way
i give him credit for that uh ben carson
not so much
thomas soul only the right likes him
nelson mandela doesn't work in the
united states
you know i'm just looking at your
comments kanye could be that person
he hasn't quite you know made that his
mission he could be that person
but he isn't here is my hypothesis
the reason there are no effective black
leaders is because the mainstream media
doesn't want any
the mainstream media could make anyone
they wanted a black leader couldn't they
yeah when you're hearing this you just
you just thought to yourself
holy that's true cnn
msnbc the the left-leaning media
could make anyone they wanted a black
leader
you just put him on television a lot
that's it that's the whole thing
there's nowhere there's no like you know
big trick to it
you just give somebody a lot of
attention and then people say oh this
person's getting a lot of attention
they must be a leader and they get more
followers on twitter and suddenly
they're a leader
but why has the mainstream media
not effectively you know nominated
somebody on their own to be the black
leader
and i'm not saying that you know has to
be blackly
black people choosing the leader
because the media can just do that for
you they can just decide who your leader
is
but they haven't done it why not
feels a little uh racist maybe it feels
like the mainstream media
always promotes leaders on other topics
i mean you can think of any topic and
think oh that's the person they always
have on
but where's your effective black leaders
who are teaching
strategy and working on you know
school choice and are popular on both
the left and the right
there's this gigantic gaping hole
and i feel like the mainstream media is
largely to blame
largely to blame
sexist joe biden keeps getting away with
saying things that are so amazingly
sexist
i can barely believe it so he was
meeting with boris johnson
recently and uh he joked in the public
that uh he had something in common with
boris johnson
and that they had both married above
their station
now that's really sexist doesn't it
that am i the only one who thinks that
because this always reminds me of
back in back in my corporate days now
you know decades ago but in my corporate
days
the super sexist uh usually white
male executive would often say the
following
about their secretary back when
secretaries were a popular thing
they would always say well my
secretary's really the one who's in
charge here
because she's the one who tells me what
my schedule is so
yeah it's really the secretary who's in
charge
and you think to yourself you
condescending prick
all right yeah you don't even talk that
way
right it's just so cringy and icky
yeah i'm seeing in the comments you
remember that was like the most common
thing
that your old white executive would say
my secretary is really in charge and
when i hear joe biden say this
oh we both married above our station
because joe biden is president of the
frickin
united states jill biden
is the woman who married him those are
equal
jill biden is accomplished right she's
got a doctorate
successful person but these are these
two things are not equal
joe biden is the president of the united
states
she's a successful human being with all
credit to her
but why does he have to promote her as
being better than him
it's just sexist cringy stuff
how about how about you know
he's doing great in his job she's doing
great in her chosen
field and you just don't need to say
anything about it maybe
well we've got a fentanyl crisis at the
border that's
worse than ever 59 pounds of it has come
through which is a giant
ginormous amount uh in a year fentanyl
seizures have jumped
800 percent in texas one year
fentanyl the most dangerous chemical
coming into the country
has jumped 800 percent that's china
and that's the cartels china sends the
chemicals to the cartels for processing
and china promised they would clamp down
on it and did the opposite
instead of clamping down they've
increased it apparently
so why do we have still relations with
china
why why are embassies still open
we're at war and we're idiots
for having diplomatic relations with
china
while this is happening we should not
have diplomatic relations with china
while this is happening now you can't
punish every country for all the
bad things they're doing right a lot of
a lot of countries are doing bad things
to their own citizens
you still want a diplomatic presence
but when somebody is killing tens of
thousands of your people
right in front of you and not even
hiding it
you don't have diplomatic relations with
those
do you this is completely unacceptable
and by the way trump for not doing
enough about it
 trump promised to do a lot about
this did nothing
i mean he asked them to do something
they did nothing he didn't respond
 trump for not doing enough
about this
and biden for doing nothing
about it even less
 both of them right this isn't
political at all
we're at war and we've had two um
two commanders in chief who don't even
 know we're in a war
total total failure both of them all
right you can't give anybody a partial
credit on this
complete complete failure both
presidents
no ex i'm not giving them anything for
this
there have been more than 88 000
americans who died from overdoses
in the last 12 months ending in october
2020
up 19 000 from the same period
before you
 every one of you politicians who
ignore this
how about how about pushing some
critical race theory
while 88 000 americans died
for the war that you don't know is
happening
there's a quote in this article i was
reading about this problem in which a
father was talking about the moment that
his
he was screaming at his dead son to try
to get him to breathe
while his wife watched on
now as you know i lost my stepson
19 years old to fentanyl
there were other other drugs in the
system but it was probably the fentanyl
that did them
and i got to watch him um
i got to
i got to watch his dead body being
carried out of the house
and um you don't really forget that
it's been two years
i'm not a biological parent
it's been two years and it's not any
 better
it's not any better
you don't um you don't recover
yeah i hope you do but you don't
so um uh there's 88 000 americans who
died from overdoses
doesn't count the families
doesn't count the siblings doesn't count
the mates doesn't count the families
who are permanently disabled
by this permanently you don't get better
ah so
 biden trump
 chyna
um we're not taking this seriously
which is not taking it seriously at all
not even a little texas is apparently
building a border wall
and thank you for that i don't know that
it'll stop fentanyl but
it's a step in the right direction
on other news the cdc says it is unknown
how long
natural immunity lass after having
covert 19.
and in the twitter
twitter summary of the news twitter
summarized it this way
said the u.s senator rand paul of
kentucky
falsely stated that because he recovered
from covet 19 he does not need to get
vaccinated cbs news reports
so here's my problem
i get that what they're saying is that
if you have natural immunity
you um you might you might benefit we
don't know this 100
but you might benefit from a little
extra boost of immunity from the
vaccination
and it might give you a little
protection from variants
now i think that both of those are
questionable assumptions
meaning that although it's probably true
that getting the vaccination even if
you've recovered
and have antibodies probably the
vaccination would give you a
longer immunity we know the natural
immunity is likely to decrease over time
as does the vaccination but probably it
gives you longer
immunity we don't know if that matters
though
right does longer immunity matter
don't know because maybe the amount of
immunity you get is all you need and the
you know and the crisis will pass and
you'll be fine
what about the protection against
variants do you believe that the
vaccination
protects against variants but natural
immunity does not
do you believe that i don't think that's
demonstrated is it
so there might be a scientific consensus
on what's likely to be true
but i don't think that's been
demonstrated has it
and so if you're rand paul and you're
looking at your own
personal situation and you're saying
well my risk reward
is i don't want to put a new chemical
inside me
even though the risks are small because
the risk of
having a problem once i've had the
coronavirus is also very small
and so he might say i don't need it
but here's my problem
don't use the word need on this topic
do you know what rand paul needs he
needs you to shut the up about what
he needs
how about that's none of your business
what he needs
how about we let rand paul decide what
he needs
giving him options is great explaining
what the
potential benefits of those options is
even better
having full information about your
options
excellent telling him what he
needs
is too far he will decide what he
 needs
all right nobody else nobody else don't
use that word
don't use it on me don't use it on him
we'll decide what we need
okay favorite story of the day
jeffrey toobin is back on cnn
god do i want to make lots of jokes
about this but
they're all too easy and so i'll maybe
hold back
on a few of them i can't say that i will
avoid
all jeffrey tube and jokes i'm not that
big of a person
but i'll reduce them a little bit number
one i watched a clip of him uh
his first appearance back on cnn after
being on leave i guess
and i noted that uh in the wide shot
he showed both of his hands on the table
good move jeffrey toobin keep both of
your hands on the table
for the wide shots that's all i'm saying
just keep both hands on the table for a
while
until until we get past this right now
the
the host uh i forget her name who was
interviewing him
had her hands below the table but that's
okay for her
for jeffrey keep your hands on the table
good good form so far um he says he's
been going to therapy over this
uh he's trying to become a better person
he's even working on a food bank
and he's trying to become the kind of
person that people can trust again
what what
was there a was there a problem that
people weren't trusting
jeffrey toobin because he didn't realize
his camera was on and he masturbated
was was there a trust problem
was there something that you were
worried that jeffrey toobin would do to
you
or or was he going to do it again do you
think i don't i don't think this was an
accident
i think he liked it i think he's going
to do it again i don't trust him
was there anybody in the world who
thought that you couldn't trust
jeffrey toobin because he made a dumb
mistake and didn't know his camera was
on
i don't believe this was ever his
problem was it
i will go further is there anybody
on earth who watched this situation and
said well
jeffrey toobin's got a a character
problem he needs to work on
anybody anybody did anybody think he had
a character problem
no he had a problem of a camera being on
that he didn't realize
that's not really a character problem is
it
people are saying yes that he has a
character problem
from what
exactly he's a fool somebody says
well he says he made a mistake we say he
made a mistake
we completely agree but it was a very
very human mistake
right this is not the kind of mistake
where you say to yourself
oh i would never make that mistake i
would totally make that mistake totally
if you say to me scott i would never
make that mistake
well maybe only if you've never
masturbated
but otherwise this is a human mistake
everybody can make this mistake
everybody could do this right so
i found his apologies and explanations
way more cringe-worthy than the actual
mistake itself which i just thought was
funny and human
that's it it was funny
and it was just human and he apologized
to his family and i think that's the
only ones that matter
co-workers maybe co-workers even that
that's a marginal case but it's nice
that he added that too
but you know who he doesn't need to
apologize to
me the public you
does he owe you an apology no
but the problem with being on cnn is
it's the apology network
they demand apologies i mean they they
really like their apologies
so i think he went a little overboard on
the apologies
he said he's sincerely sorry
and he apologized to the people who
quote
thought i was a better person
who thought he was a better person than
masturbating
and and you know getting caught was
there somebody who said
i thought jeffrey toobin was the kind of
person who didn't masturbate
i mean i really thought he was the kind
of guy who whose biology was unique
and among all human males i thought he
was better than the rest of us
who you know sort of need it but not him
i thought he was above us who thought
that
really did anybody think that
so my summary of jeffrey toobin is
this incident made him more interesting
more human
i'm far more likely to watch him now
just uh
it's got a little more interest in it uh
we should not be apologizing for being
human beings that's that's a little too
far
um you all know that uh democrats
complain about filibusters
when they're in power and they use them
when they're out of power so everybody
knows that
there's tons of uh hypocrisy when it
comes to that stuff
but i didn't realize how bad it was
there's a article here by
david harsanyi who is
talking about hypocrisy is nothing new
but it takes pretter natural
shamelessness which i just love that
turn of a phrase preternatural
shamelessness to have participated in
over 300 filibusters as dems did in the
past
few years and turn around and treat the
procedure as
odious racist relic that threatens
democracy
you know there's there's hypocrisy and
then there's
oh my god hypocrisy now how can they get
away with that
how do the democrats get away
with using the filibuster 300 times and
then the moment
that the other team is using it it's an
odious racist relic that threatens
democracy
it's because the media lets them that
how many times did you hear this
estimate that they had used it 300 times
in the past
did you have any idea i would have said
oh god i'll bet they've used it a dozen
times
that would have been my guess i always
said probably
i don't know 10 12 times they've used
this in the last few years
probably made a big difference those 10
or 12 times they used it
no it's 300 300
times but now it's a big old racist
odious thing
so i usually don't do hypocrisy stories
because they're just too easy and
obvious and you're already thinking it
so it has nothing
but i don't know if i've seen a bigger
one than this i guess the only reason i
mention it
is that it's extraordinary in its scope
so that's the only reason it's worth
mentioning otherwise hypocrisy is just
the operating code of government uh
biden gave a speech in which he said
that his military leaders told him
climate change
was the number one military security
threat to the homeland
does that sound like something that
happened
do you believe that do you believe joe
biden when he says that his military
experts said
climate change was our biggest military
security threat to the homeland and the
the thinking was that it would cause
massive uh migration of people to get
away from
bad zones and that massive migration
would
necessarily have a bigger impact on the
countries with wealth
because that's where people would be
going to uh violating borders possibly
of our allies
causing all kinds of trouble now i do
buy
the concept that there might be massive
migration
and it might be related to droughts and
that sort of thing so i think that part
might be true
and certainly something to take
seriously but
doesn't that sound like a gigantic
thing to say if you're a general
it sounds to me like the generals were a
little bit too
woke don't you think because if
the general who said that that climate
change was our biggest challenge
do you think that that general if you
had that general privately
and said look you think that's bigger
than getting
nuked by china really
because china with nuclear weapons and
maybe chemical warfare and terrorism
and drones and the ability for one
person with the right
bio weapon to destroy entire
civilizations you don't think that's a
that's a little bit bigger just a little
bit bigger than the fact that climate
change will
take 80 years to catch up to us
i don't believe that privately they
think that
that sounds like something you say
because your boss wants to hear it
right so general uh what do you think is
their biggest risk
ah not enough critical race theory
training in school
okay that's number one risk what else ah
trump said some offensive things
yes yes now you're on to it now you're
really talking about higher priorities
that was a risk to the country how about
another one what are your top risks ah
could it be um the people who occupied
a room in the capitol because
occupying an empty room at least until
they occupied it
um is a risk to the entire united states
bingo you got it you got the biggest
risk
in the whole country and
climate change yes yes you got them all
those are the biggest military risks
climate change anything that trump
tweeted when he was on twitter
and uh yeah critical race theory not
enough of it not enough of it being
taught in schools so
those are big risks on the country not
not china
i'd probably fire anybody who told me
that if i were the commander-in-chief
but it does tell us that we're not
taking nuclear energy seriously if biden
doesn't
by the way the biden administration does
take nuclear seriously
but he doesn't talk about it much does
he
feel like he could talk about it a
little bit more maybe give a little more
a little more of a boost but he doesn't
here's my question to you climate change
people what would be a bigger
environmental problem
nuclear waste let's say we have
more robust nuclear energy
systems would the subsequent nuclear
waste
storage be a bigger problem than all of
the batteries
that we would need if we did just solar
and wind and
other things you would need massive
batteries
either at your house or battery farms i
suppose
for the times when you don't have enough
uh wind or
sun so somebody said you can recycle
batteries
fairly easily that doesn't sound right
to me does it
do we recycle batteries do you think
that your tesla home battery would be
recyclable and how long would it last
now i would like to think that elon musk
thought about that and has some kind of
a solution for recycling
but even if it's just tesla you know
maybe tesla will come up with a solution
for that but they're not going to be the
only battery company
there's going to be a lot of batteries
out there what do you do with them
once they're done yeah i think it's
actually hard to recycle those
and i don't know if we're thinking in
terms of the scale that we need to
because the number of you know batteries
in the world that are associated with
with solar power and wind probably not
that many
right but if we were to massively change
the entire energy structure of the world
that's a lot of batteries am i wrong
now there are other ways to store energy
you can build a dam but there aren't
that many places you can do that
so um i just feel like maybe we haven't
looked at this
as objectively as we could hey how about
that arizona audit
kind of quiet isn't it don't you think
by now
if the arizona audit had come up with
the smoking gun
of massive fraud we would know about
that by now wouldn't we
because we did hear about almost
immediately when they thought some data
had been
deleted but it turns out they found it
we heard about that right away
right there is apparently a chain of
command
or chain of custody chain of custody
problem with some of the votes but
that's not going to change any election
outcomes
the courts will just say yeah but it's
already certified
can't go back you know catch it next
time
so i feel as though every day that goes
by
you should put a little less hope in
this arizona audit coming up with any
kind of problem
i could be surprised maybe i'll be wrong
um i understand from uh andres backhouse
that there are a few
ivermectin trials in progress the good
kind the
randomized controlled trial
so we might actually have a real uh
credible
believable answer on whether ivermectin
makes a big difference
i don't know when so there's a little
uncertainty about when we'll know
but someday we'll know it looks like we
will actually know
if there was a big ivermectin scandal
and we should have been using it
or not we'll actually know the answer
now i suppose even you know high quality
multiple randomized controlled trials
could still have problems
but it's as good as we get so i feel
like
i feel like we're going to know maybe
after the
pandemics totally a non-problem but i
think we'll know
and hydroxychloroquine i would warn you
that the the
more recent news showing there's a study
that says it works
is not the high quality kind of study
that you should bank on it does
make you think we should study it some
more it does make you think that maybe
there was something there
with both of these drugs but we're far
from
that being a scientifically certified
certainty we'd have to deal with this as
a
risk management issue
and if you were a certain kind of person
in a certain situation
i could imagine you would say to
yourself well i know that science is not
telling me for
certain that it works but i'd like to
take that chance
so that's where we're at rasmussen
did a poll and asked people should the
republican party
i think they only pulled republicans and
conservatives
should the republican party be more like
trump or more like
pence what do you think people said
because we just went through several
years of republicans complaining
that trump should maybe act more like a
regular politician
more like a mike pence so how many
people in the end said yeah
you know now that you asked the question
we do want the republican party and we
do want conservatives
to be more like mike pence because he
doesn't cause problems
how many people said that well it turns
out 64 percent of republicans
and about the same number of
conservatives said they would prefer a
donald trump-like
republican party
so remember i told you that winning
solves everything i've said that a few
times
being successful just solves all kinds
of unrelated problems
and i think that's what trump did he
came in and he was simply successful
and then suddenly people go well can't
argue with success
stuff worked at least stuff they liked
not everything of course so that's where
we're heading
where looks like the republican party
and conservatives
prefer the more pugnacious
uh provocative style of the deal maker
who does
get some stuff done he did
and that is what we call
the simultaneous sip and coffee with
scott ms i don't think it's ever been
better
really probably the best one of all time
sorry i lost it a little bit there i
wasn't expecting that
sometimes you wonder hey do people do
these
you know emotional expressions in front
of people
intentionally nope that wasn't
intentional
i wasn't planning on doing that
but thank you for all of your support
i'll give you a little uh advanced
warning i'm gonna do some
traveling yes i'm gonna do some
traveling
starting tomorrow i'll i'll tell you
where i am as as things
progress uh tomorrow i believe i will be
able to do my regular
uh sip the day after
tomorrow uh not so sure
depends if i'm awake in the right time
zone
well i'll be in the wrong time zone but
it depends if i'm awake at the right
time
and i'm going to try so
for the next uh 10 days
we'll things will be normal tomorrow but
after that i'm going to do the best i
can to hit this
time zone but i don't know for sure
whether i will and i'm going to promise
you something else
there will be a simulation surprise
right there will be a coincidence
that i will reveal i think i can reveal
this i have to ask somebody else first
but i think i can reveal a coincidence
about this vacation
that will impress you like a really big
one
you know the kind that makes you wonder
about the nature of reality
um none of your guesses are correct
about where i'm going but i'll tell you
and it's
going to be someplace fun and i will
talk to you
tomorrow
