[Music]
hey everybody
come on in come on in if you're watching
this on
youtube you might say to yourself hey
the sound is not so good it sounds a
little
like you're in a barrel or something
that's because i was using my
uh airpods as my microphones
but a lot of people don't look out like
how they look
because it looks like you're a walrus
with teeth sticking out of your ears
instead of your
mouth i don't want to look like a walrus
with
with teeth coming out of my ears so i've
ordered a new microphone which will be
here in a few days so next week you'll
have good sound
i think it sounds pretty good on
periscope in case you uh
in case you care now what do we need to
have the best day
ever yeah you know you know
all you need is a copper bug or glass
tanker chelsea just die in a canteen
joker flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite
liquid i like coffee and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine of the day
thing makes everything better including
the debates
it's called the simultaneous step and it
happens now go
ah delightful
well as everybody's piling in to hear my
thoughts on the debate because i know
that's why you're here
did you see there's another video uh
andy
know has it on his twitter feed of uh
black lives matter
rioting in wisconsin in
wauwatosa that's the name of this
the town wawa watosa
that's actually the name of the town
anyway the black lives matter rioters
were
smashing the windows of random
residential homes
is that scary are you scared yet
it's one thing when retail stores get
broken into and destroyed but when
residential homes in which probably
there were children at home
think about it your home your children
are there and a brick comes through your
front window
and there's an angry mob outside how do
you feel
pretty scared right i think that's the
kind of persuasion that wins elections
we shall see
all right let's talk about the uh big
debate last night
i'm sure you all saw it and i have many
thoughts on that
in no particular order number one
uh pence won it wasn't even close
in my opinion uh pence dominated
be dominated in terms of you know
personality
he dominated in terms of better points
uh i've been telling you how many times
have i told you
the most underrated public servant
is mike pence don't think
pundits and experts fully understand
how good that was last night because
what you notice is mistakes
right those are the things that they get
your attention
you look for moments you look for
knockout punches
you look for mistakes but that's not
pence's game
pence is a boxer who's going to win on
points
every time yeah you're not going to get
a knockout
because pence doesn't give him give any
vulnerabilities so there's never a
knockout
but he will he will win on points
if you hang in there with him so i think
that's what happened you won
easily on points
uh you also have a cnn's new technology
it was kind of impressive so cnn now has
a drone
that's so small and shaped like a fly
and they flew it into the debate stage
and landed it right on
mike pence's head to try to distract him
but he's so cool didn't even bother him
that a cnn fly drone was on his head
didn't even slow him down for a bit
that's how good
mike pence is at debating um
when you watch him debate he felt
more like a surgeon didn't it because
where trump was sort of like a
a cannon if you think about it it didn't
matter what
biden did it was sort of irrelevant what
biden was doing in the debate trump was
just a cannon
boom boom boom boom boom just offense
offense offense
but um but watching pence work
it was like watching a surgeon it's like
well here's your claim
let's let's look at your claim well
let's dissect it
let's take this part off he was he was
deadly
and i don't think he made a mistake
think about the fact that of all the
coverage this morning
there is zero zero
uh commentary on anything that pence did
wrong nothing they're talking about the
fly that landed on his head
because that's all they have they're
reduced
they're reduced to talking about the
insects and the building
that's it that is winning a debate
you don't win a debate harder than
making your critics
talk about the insect in the building
that's a win
all right um i wonder
who was who is the staffer who got the
job
of telling kamala harris what she did
wrong last night
because that feels like a tough job and
i would like to give you my
impression of the staffer who drew the
short straw to explain to kamala what
her biggest weakness was in the debate
last night
and it goes like this uh
miss harris uh do you have a moment i'd
just like to
talk about some of the things you did
right and
maybe some things that could have been
better in the debate last night
if you have a minute why sure i'm always
open for feedback
what what do you think i did right and
if
i did anything wrong i'd like to hear
that too
well well um on your your lies your lies
were excellent
you had lots of good lies and i we
thought those were good you really
landed those
but um and in general in terms of your
overall presentation we thought you were
excellent from well i'd say that the
chin
down from the chin down all good
really good um from the chin up
there's a little bit of an issue i you
know i don't want to make a big thing
about it but
there are some facial expressions
that are suboptimal in the context of
a national debate televised debate
and harrah says really facial
expressions i
don't exactly know what you're talking
about can you be more specific
oh i was hoping you wouldn't ask me to
be more specific
ah i sometimes you look
maybe a little condescending a little
bit
maybe your smile is a little too big
and harris says i'm not really following
you what would a
what would a condescending look look
like and what do you mean i smile too
much
what do you mean okay uh the only way
i'm going to be able to
convey this is maybe i'm going to try to
do an
impression of you and don't take this
the wrong way
but um this is the sort of facial
expression we'd like to see more of
let me demonstrate see this would be a
comfortable um confident smile
like this you want to do more of that
and then less of less of less of this
try to do less of that
okay and calmly would say um
anything else yeah yeah
the condescending thing
you can sometimes if the other person is
saying something you don't like
here's a good way to go just look down
and just give your head a little shake
like gosh that's that's not true because
that conveys to the audience
that you're confident and you're
signaling that the other person's
statement is not exactly
accurate just a little bit of a just a
little bit of a side to side
like that so we want to see more of that
and less of this
yeah let's see this face
do less of that one and more of this one
okay got it and then the staffer would
be fired
so that's the way i think that went let
me tell you um
and as long as we're all going to be
accused of being sexist
you you accept that right we're all
going to be accused of being sexist if
you say
anything at all about kamala harris
but it is a fact that
uh overall impression and the way even
the way you look
your height your hair your presentation
it matters
because people are influenced by your
character
as you present it as much as your
policies
and in that in that totally non-sexist
uh framing that i'm giving you it has to
be said that she was having a bad hair
day
now this might be somewhat subjective
but i would like to start by saying
camellaris usually has very good hair
days
in fact i would say that as a female
politician
she has really excellent hair to the
point where i would say it's a plus
most of the time and she has a variety
of different looks for her hair
which is normal and most of them i would
say
9 and a 10 of her hairstyles i would say
that's pretty good
pretty good whatever she did with her
hair last night
i don't know if she was happy with it
but i have this question
to the women watching this this
live stream so instead of making a
statement
i'll put it in the form of a question if
you were
if you're a woman and you're debating on
tv
and you feel in your own mind just your
own opinion
that you're having a terrible hair day
what's that do to your performance
very sexist right now obviously no two
people are alike
you know some women don't care about
their hair blah blah blah we're all
individuals i get it
but that's why i'm asking the question
women how would you feel if in your own
opinion not other people's just your own
opinion
you were going on stage and you were
having a terrible hair day
because i feel like maybe that was
happening last night
did anybody else have that impression
that she she generally has
i would i would say some of the best
hairstyles
of any woman politician um
but last night no there was something
something going on last night with her
hair that wasn't good
and it matters it matters if it affected
uh how she felt about it it matters if
it affected her confidence
and maybe it did we don't know um
now you all know that the big excitement
for me
if you saw my tweet especially is that
when i saw kamala harris
cue up the find the fine people hoax
in other words she was going to claim
yet again
that the president had said that
neo-nazis and white supremacists were
fine people
which is literally the opposite of what
happened
as you know he said the opposite he said
i that he called them out by name and
said they should be condemned
totally but biden has made that the
centerpiece of his campaign
the the very the trigger for his
campaign the
the reason he had to enter the politics
when maybe he was you know passed his
prime
was that this fine people hoax was sort
of the last straw for him
and it never happened it's just a
complete made-up hoax
now as soon as kamala queued it up
and and i believe that pence had a
little bit of a tell
where where i think he shook his head
you know in the way that you should
to signal that there's something wrong
going on and i jumped off the couch and
i tweeted
you know do it pence do it
because he looked like a coiled snake
didn't he
he looked like you could see kamala you
know
talking about the fine people hoax and
i'm looking at pence
and in my mind he actually transformed
from
you know this vice president looking guy
into a coiled cobra
like i you could almost see it like it
was visual he just
he just morphed into home into this
coiled
cobra and that's what got me off the
couch i saw that look
and i said okay that look is a coiled
cobra he's gonna go for this
and then he did magnificent bastard
he did he went right after it he and he
did a really good job he said this is
why
you know the press doesn't trust the
public or i'm sorry the public doesn't
trust the press because it's exactly
this kind of thing
and then he went on to say how they
edited out to the part where he said
explicitly
that he condemned the white nationalists
and neo-nazis
and it was perfect now that's not the
good part
the good part is what happens next
because you know that the debates are
always fact checked and any major claim
is going to be fact checked right
so a major claim like that where where
calmly says this happened and pence says
it
didn't happen that obviously is going to
be on the list of fact-checking things
on cnn right let me check
okay cnn let's see where you fact check
to find people
hoax not there
they ignored it msnbc
let's see i don't even have to check do
i i don't have to check
they ignored it and i haven't checked so
if it turns out i'm wrong i will be
amazed
but i'm making this claim without even
looking
without even looking i make the
following claim they did not
try to fact check it however
in another country that we're very fond
of it's called great britain
they've got this news organization
called the bbc
and they fact checked it and they fact
checked it in favor of pence and they
gave him
a full a full true rating
for calling the fine people hoax a hoax
they fact-checked pence as true
boom now not the only ones there were
some lesser publications
that also did it and of course
breitbart's been doing it forever
you know joel pollock's been doing it
steve cortez has been
debunking it with videos and articles
for
for two years i've been doing it for two
years so
the three of us uh you know joel and
steve
and i who probably worked the hardest on
debunking that damn thing
were feeling pretty good last night
feeling pretty good because it felt like
vindication
it did is what it felt like and i
believe that the trump campaign
also has uh tweeted out
some of the fact checking on that so
are we done here's what's fun
fun parts coming up this has opened up
a line of attack that for whatever
reason president trump had not been
taking before
and here's how it goes once you've got
the fact checking
established so now that the hoax has
been debunked
and nobody has done an undebunk in other
words there's only debunking
there's debunking and there's silence
that's all there was no
nobody was supporting it oh and by the
way as
uh if you saw the video
of uh of com layers
wall pence was debunking it watch your
face
because remember when somebody is saying
something in a debate that the other
side believes is a
false statement what do they do if it's
not your turn to talk
and somebody else is lying you always do
the handshake
you go ah wait wait was my turn
did she do that when pence was debunking
the main claim of the biden campaign the
central claim
of his campaign pence was debunking
and what did kamala harris do she looked
down
that's it she just looked down she
looked like a kid
who got caught in the candy jar because
she was
and it also signaled to me
clearly that she knows it wasn't true
that's the good part the good part is
she's signaled so clearly that she knows
it's not true
because you don't act that way if
somebody debunks the most
important thing of your campaign you
don't just look
down you resist you talk over them
you throw in a little uh debunk or they
debunk when it's your time to talk again
you shake your head you you make a face
you do something if the central claim of
your campaign
has been taken out by the other side you
don't just sit there and look
down unless you knew it was a lie all
along and that's
it's increasingly obvious all right
i think the president could take that
momentum
and next time he has a chance he could
just say look
the central claim of the biden campaign
is the fine people hoax
it was debunked by the bbc it was
debunked
by everybody who looked into it was
debunked by breitbart
anybody who looked into it debunked it
there was no counter to that
last night so i think the president
could drive that home and it would
really matter
um the big story of course is also
the sexism the misogyny
was there sexism and misogyny last night
pence was talking over his time and
sometimes talking over kamala harris
was he mansplaining as some people said
was he being a big old bully was he
just being a terrible man
well i don't think that complaint is
working quite the way
the defenders of kamala harris wanted it
to
because the only thing that could be
worse
than losing a debate is losing a debate
and thinly claiming that the reason was
sexism
because the whole country looked at that
and said
i don't think so i watched that debate
i know what sexism looks like and then i
watch this
that's not what i saw and even
even the women democrats
who would support kamala harris in
general even they
were saying oh slow your role on the
sexism thing
that's not what we saw and the women who
to their credit were were you know
trying to be
let's say non-political in the sense of
you know being accurate
they they said another woman would have
been able to handle that situation
true fact check true
imagine hillary clinton in the same
situation
does hillary clinton get bulldozed
nope nope imagine
margaret thatcher does she get bulldozed
probably not imagine elizabeth warren
does she get bulldozed in that situation
i don't think so i don't think so it
felt like it was a kamala harris
situation
it didn't feel like it was a man-woman
situation even women
didn't feel that um so
i think she lost terribly like
really badly and some people tried to
say that she looked
presidential i'm going to talk about
some of the comments after
but in my in my mind she lost
some presidential credibility
because if she couldn't stand up to a
vice president
who's one of the nicest guys in the
world
on the other side of you know two sheets
of uh
plexiglas if that was too much for her
to handle
how is she gonna handle putin how she
can handle you know
she etc so i think she really hurt
herself
especially because people see her as the
top of the ticket and she looked
unqualified in my opinion and i realized
that
her supporters said the opposite they
said oh yeah she's very presidential
looking
there i didn't see it the the facial
thing
and the sort of complaining and sort of
the
letting him bully her because she didn't
let him
she allowed it to happen none of that
looked good
and none of that looked presidential and
and the facial expressions
they looked unusually unpresidential
in fact i would go so far as to say
i'm not aware of anybody who's ever run
for president
male or female who got who got to a high
level let's say
i can't think of one example of anyone
who's
let's say mannerisms or less
presidential than kamala harris
i can't think of anybody can you male or
female think of any personality
whose demeanor her facial expressions
just the way she acts
or he acts can you think of anybody
who didn't look presidential if you look
at you think of the entire
you know slate of characters from um
uh remind me the name of a
uh who who is the woman who is running
for
democrat uh in 20
no she was running as a republican uh
i can't remember her name but anyway she
would be another example of somebody who
would not have wilted under pressure
um palin yeah i think
i think palin would have done fine and
that's true carly fiorini thank you
i was trying to think of carla fiorini
fiery would not have wilted under
pressure
and you know it right because we've seen
her under pressure she didn't wilt
so i think the claim that it was sexism
just falls apart
and certainly weakens that side of the
story um
let me let me go to the white board here
uh
we'll talk more about uh people's
impressions about the
uh the debate but i want to make this
point
before we go too far there's for those
of you who have not
studied economics or statistics or
business
you may not have heard of something
called an expected value calculation
it's one of the ways that you use logic
and reason and math
to help you sort out what's true and
what matters and
and you know what is bigger than
something else
and it goes like this you take the odds
of something happening
and you multiply it by the cost and then
you can compare it to other choices
so let's say that the odds of trump
getting re-elected
and destroying the united states and of
course
there are lots of things that could go
wrong in any administration but
we'll just keep it simple at the concept
level okay so just imagine that there's
one risk
and it's the risk of the united states
being totally destroyed
but it's very small even if you were
totally
anti-trump he's got a full
uh term behind him so you know what
you're gonna get
you might not like it but you know what
you're gonna get
and the country was not destroyed so
let's say there was a one percent chance
that he would destroy america you would
multiply that one percent times
if you wanted to look at it financially
you would multiply it by
the total value of the united states you
say well there's a
you know one percent chance that you can
have a cost that would
cost the entire united states or a one
percent chance
that it would kill you know all the
people in the united
however many st were worth now we don't
have to do the math
because i'm just sticking to the concept
if you were to compare that
to the alternative the alternative is a
biden
harris administration which we know
would be staffed with you know
progressive people
you know the aoc would have a bigger
role etc
i would say there's probably a solid 30
chance that going as socialist as the
democrats want to go
would destroy america i'd say about a 30
chance now if you watch tucker carlson
it looks like it's closer to 100 chance
but remember that everything in the
political season is is sort of
tripled in magnitude so everything that
seems like it's a three
on a scale of one to ten it's looking
like a nine
at the moment because everything's
ratcheted up but
but in reality let's say biden gets
elected
in reality literally what are the odds
that the whole united states is going to
be destroyed
well it's not a hundred percent it's not
90
i don't think it's 70 but when you get
down to about
30 when you look at the actual things
that are being
presented you know fewer police etc
you start to say to yourself yeah
financially that actually wouldn't work
and if you took away the incentive for
people
that's going to be bad if you took away
law and order that's bad
so i think there's a solid 30 chance
that america would be destroyed by a
biden
administration now you of course
get to put your own odds on this so
there's a
subjective nature of this right nobody
knows what's going to happen
so you're just sort of guessing what the
odds are but
i the main point is this
the total risk of getting four more
years of trump
is really small in terms of will the
country be destroyed
no no it's a very small risk
the odds of socialism in its fuller form
leading to the destruction of the united
states and conquest by some other power
it's pretty good it's pretty good
actually it's not
it's not most likely but would you take
a 30
chance of destroying the country
i think that trump can do a better job
of scaring
uh scaring the country into voting for
him
and it would be completely fair
because i do think that these are
roughly the odds that's my
that's my opinion
all right uh here are some comments that
people made on
cnn about the debate and i wanted to see
them because they were funny
uh so here's something that sarah isgur
said so these are all
cnn related pundits she said that
senator
harris came in with sky-high
expectations
is that true and you and in your
experience
do you think that kamala harris had
sky-high
debate expectations
that never happened did it i think
everybody thought that she would just be
okay
i don't believe anybody thought she had
sky-high expectations
but we did have high expectations for
pence
because he's always performed well in
debates and he
i would say he exceeded sky-high
expectations
in my opinion you know pence will
he will just he's doomed to never get
the full credit
for the good things he's done he will
never get credit
for how good that debate was that was
one of the best
debate performances i've ever seen i
don't it's good that's hard to top
but uh so they started out by trying to
convince you that there were sky-high
expectations
and therefore if she didn't meet the
sky-high expectations
well it's not because she did a bad job
it's because your expectations were too
wrong
it's your fault it's not kamala harris's
fault
you have to take some responsibility for
her failure
because your expectations for her were
too high
way too high why do you do that why do
you hurt camel harris like that
by making your expectations sky high
okay that never happened um
and then there's a julian zelizer
also cnn person uh
and he says given her immense skill as
an orator
and in debating what that's his first
sentence
given her immense skill as an orator and
in debating
i don't think that's an evidence is it
it
does she have immense skill as an orator
or
or as a debater because i think if she
had any of those things
she might have been the candidate for
president
it feels to me that she would have
gotten a little bit a little bit deeper
into the campaign in the primaries
if she'd been a skilled orator
or good at debating
and then then he goes on to say she was
incredibly restrained
so turning it into a good thing yeah
she's very skilled
but she's restrained all right that's a
good thing
um even sticking to her time
so she stayed within her timelines
whereas pence did not
so that's a little bit like a
participation trophy isn't it
it's like sure sure mike pence
won the debate but i don't think that's
the whole story
because you have to look at the fact
that she stayed to her time limits
if that's what you have she stayed to
her time limits
and she didn't have a fly on her
forehead
that's losing the debate all right
um
and then there's frida gitas also cnn
who said that harris won because she had
so much more material to work with
all she had to do was cite the facts
blah blah blah
about the catastrophic handling of the
coronavirus so frida
she's decided that the debate
can be decided not on anything that you
do in the debate
it's just the facts that existed
independent of what you said about them
now these are so weak the defenses of
kabul harris that they're hilarious
how about van jones so van jones
trying to make a lemonade and a turd
said uh vice president pence was
masterful at one thing
normalizing conservatism
he can take right-wing conspiracy
theories and president trump's
grievances
and make them sound mellow and
unthreatening okay
was it was it pence who was making that
stuff
sound unthreatening was that his magic
trick
or is it that that stuff
is unthreatening and the only person who
can make it sound
threatening is trump right
trump's magic trick is he makes
everything seem
bigger more important sets your hair on
fire all right
so the real story is that trump can make
ordinary things
sound dangerous and provocative
pence can simply describe ordinary
things as ordinary things
so is that is that like pence's great
skill
that you can take these extraordinary
things and and describe them as ordinary
no that's not what was happening pence
was describing completely
safe and ordinary things like law
enforcement
etc in ordinary
terms it wasn't magic he just described
stuff
that's it but uh
so then uh then van jones went on to say
this that uh harris
made history tonight as a black woman
okay so made history again
i would like to think that we're at
least on the on the verge
if not already there where it's more
sexist and more uh more racist
to call it down a special than it is to
ignore it
all right is there anybody here who
thinks it's special
that a woman is running for the highest
office
i hope not i hope not is there anybody
here who thinks that's weird or special
or
crazy because you know
hillary clinton won the popular vote so
we shouldn't be talking about her being
a woman anymore
that feels like a nothing you know we
should be over that
how about talking about her because
she's a person of color
aren't we over that we had eight years
of obama
did his color matter no
except maybe as a positive and
just the fact that we still have to call
that out as like a
it's a remarkable time for women who are
who have a background from india and
from
you know jamaica or wherever um
we just got to stop talking about that
all right
and then he says after 90 minutes of the
debate no one is saying she could not
serve as president of the united states
that you know he says they'll quibble
over her answers but
but now everybody can see her as
a president is that true
because i had the opposite of healing
from the debate
before the debate i could see her as
president
after the debate less
because that facial thing it looks like
she can't control that
and it's pretty bad it's not a good look
the the fact is that we do pick
presidents
like we pick um ornaments
we do pick presidents for a look a
demeanor
uh a presentation they become the brand
and the logo of the country so they
don't have to be beautiful
you know it's not about attractiveness
per se
but you need a certain look of gravitas
did kamala harris convey gravitas
like did she convey weight i would say
no
i think she i think she went the other
direction
i believe that she looked non-confident
and she couldn't handle a mild bully
because you know pence was pence was
obviously by uh strategy he was taking
extra time
but all he was doing was taking the
shelf space
that he could get away with that's part
of the game
part of the game is if you can use up
most of the shelf space you know that
use up the time that's an advantage so
when when pence could see that he kept
talking
and he wasn't being stopped they tried
you know they were
the uh the the host tried to stop him
but there was no penalty so he just kept
going
um that didn't look like a mistake to me
that looked like good strategy which was
obviously decided in advance and he
implemented it and it worked
so in my opinion she looked less
presidential last night
than at any point during the campaign
season
that's just my take um
essie cupp said that uh quote
what i saw was a man who talked over not
just his female opponent
oh we're going full sexist here but also
the female moderator oh
double misogyny double misogyny
that mean old mike pence not only did he
talk over
a woman who was running for vice
president but he talked over a woman who
was a moderator
double misogyny but
none of that is what happened and other
women who are being
fair and honest about this are saying
the same thing
other women who have succeeded based on
their
talent and hard work and skill are
looking at kamala harris and saying
you know the right amount of talent and
hard work and skill
would have been better she could have
been better
um paul magella who is
sort of the golem of cnn if if cnn were
sort of a hobbit movie paul bugalo would
be the the golem
and uh he's he's so far away from being
uh
anybody you should take seriously he's
probably the person i think
least seriously
all right um he says ahera showed the
world why joe biden's
first presidential decision wasn't
master stroke
so okay she indicted the trump regime
with a relentless
remorseless command of the facts she was
cutting yet charming
righteously indignant yet likeable it
was that last word
that uh caught my attention would you
have used the word
likable for kamalaris last night
and again watch out your sexism
because if you say that a woman is not
likable
you're sort of automatically suspected
of being a sexist right
well would you have said that about a
man let me be as clear as i can about
this
in my own opinion would i say
that a man was not likable if he made
the same faces
that kamala harris did yeah
yeah i would i would say that anybody
who made those faces
would be unlikable likewise anybody who
spread the fine people oaks
is automatically unlikable in my opinion
megyn kelly made some news by saying in
in a tweet
she said take it like a woman don't make
faces
so she was tweeting at harris during the
debate take it like a woman
don't make faces so what happened to you
know what happened with megyn kelly
when she did this tweet take it like a
woman
well obviously people decided to make
that sexual
do you think that megan kelly intended
that statement
take it like a woman don't make faces do
you think she was thinking of that
as a sexual comment no
no that was not a sexual comment
it was a comment about look tougher
look tougher all right so take it like a
woman was like take it like a man
except you know more uh appropriate
version
it was just saying don't make that face
that's all it was and
she got dumped on on social media
now will any of this matter
it will matter if uh the campaign takes
advantage of it
so there is an advantage to take the
advantage is first of all
you can paint kamala harris as the real
top of the ticket
so that you can attack her like she's
the top of the ticket and that sounds
fair because people
people expect that at the very least
she'd be
the candidate for a second term if biden
got elected
so you can certainly attack her as the
top of the ticket
in waiting and you could attack her on
the find people hoax
now now that it's been fact-checked
by credible news organizations
you could just say you can do a campaign
ad where you say the
the biden campaign was based on the
the biggest lie in american history
now calling the fine people hoax the
biggest lie in american history
is technique if you've if you've heard
me say it or tweet it
it's technique the technique is this
you say to yourself i'm not sure that's
the biggest lie in american history
let's look at some other ones and see
how big they are let's compare them
that's what i want you to do it doesn't
matter if it's literally the biggest lie
in american history
if i can put it in that category and
make you argue about whether there might
have been
there might have been some other lie
that was bigger then i've already sold
my point
that it's among the biggest lies and
that it's a lie
that's the point so when you say it's
the biggest lie in american history or
the most
divisive lie in american history that
might be true
that's the most divisive lie um
you're trying to overclaim because
that's strong technique
so if your but if you said biden keeps
telling this
bulging vein thing and then you show the
video clip all that came out of
the wheels the weeds with the bulging
veins
and then you show the debunk show that
it's not true
and then you end the campaign commercial
with
noting that richard spencer the
organizer of the charlottesville
uh march has endorsed biden
you just you just end it with and the
organizer of the charlottesville event
endorsed joe biden which is true
and people will go to fact-check that
they're like that can't be true
oh that actually happened that's and
that's real by the way
so while the while the vice presidential
uh debate
is not by itself something that will
change the election too much
it did expose a line of attack
that could change the election so it did
make possible
uh a dismantling of their campaign
so the other big news is that trump has
refused to take part in the next debate
if it's going to be a virtual one and
that's what they wanted to do
so they decided they wanted the next one
to be virtual which makes sense because
the president
you know and others have been
uh you know tested positive for
chronovirus you don't know how long that
stuff lasts
you don't know who else traveling with
him might be exposed
so maybe you want to go virtual it's not
a mistake
but do you what do do you agree with
president trump
refusing to do the debate
remember he's behind in the polls
generally speaking when you're behind in
the polls you do the debate
right have you ever seen an exception to
that
has there ever been an exception where
the person who's behind in the polling
didn't want to do a debate because
that's the only way they have
you know to make up ground for the most
part
um i i'm i'm watching your
comments i won't be able to you know
read my notes
and also call out the super chats but i
do
look at them so uh for most of them i'm
seeing
in case you're wondering but i can't
read them out loud and look at my notes
at the same time
so i apologize for that um
so here's here's what is good about
trump refusing to do it i believe that
the second
part of this which has been unstated
but you know it was coming if trump had
agreed
to a virtual debate where they're in
different places and it's just being
broadcast
what is the predictable next thing that
would happen
you know what you know what it is the
next thing would happen is they would
change the debate rules
to turn off the mic so that trump could
not be heard
at all now if he was on the same stage
with biden and they turned off his mic
he could still talk over him
right and the camera might pick up the
two of them and might see the trump
talking
maybe you could even hear it on the
other microphones
so the idea of putting him in a remote
location
i think is probably 80 percent
about turning off his microphone don't
you think
that that was the real play it's about
the microphone
and they'll use the excuse of
coronavirus and that's a good excuse
it's a really good excuse
but it's about the microphone
now the president being behind
says i'm not going to do it now it might
be a negotiating ploy
remember the president is always
negotiating
especially when he leaves the
negotiation
leaving the negotiation is just part of
his negotiating he does he says that
so we know that to be true and so maybe
maybe they'll still have some kind of a
debate but
think about the fact that he could do
this
after uh pence beat kamala harris in the
debate
i think that pence's solid win
made it possible for trump to cancel the
other debates
or at least made it easier because at
least pence goes out with a solid
victory you know that i know some crazy
people will say that you didn't win
but um and cnn's running a
fake polls showing that kamala harris
totally won
like by a lot uh i don't think so that's
not the debate i watched
but um the bottom line is that uh
you can't win a debate as a vice
president you can't win
any harder than having the top of the
ticket say you know we don't even need
any more debates
we we just won this one so badly and
kamala is really the head of the ticket
so we just beat my number two
pence my number two guy just
demolished your number one candidate
because their number one candidate
is sort of cumulative that's not a bad
that's not a bad time to leave if you're
going to pull out of the rest of the
debates you couldn't pick a better time
than that
so i think trump is good at recognizing
a moment
and this was this was exactly the right
moment for that play
it gets the news cycle gets you talking
about the debates so you're talking less
about the coronavirus
all good um
uh lauren kenton said something funny on
cnn that was funny enough
that i just wanted to repeat it she said
covet 19 thanks to the bad hair year
it's not a bad hair day it's a bad hair
a year
i don't know i thought that was funny
did you see the uh
the video of trump talking about
regeneron and he was
he was doing a proof of life thing where
he's not on camera as much so he's doing
these videos so you can see he's
still trump and he's still healthy and
i had a few impressions about that
number one
i can't tell if it was just the lighting
and it might be just the lighting
but it looks like there's no orange left
in his hair
and it looks like there's no orange tone
to his
um tv makeup now there could be a reason
for this
and i'm just going to speculate now i'm
guessing
that because of his age that his hair
color
is colored right doesn't he add
something some highlights to get it
to give it that that non-gray
color i think i would assume he's gray
i would assume if he didn't do anything
to his hair it would be grey
so if you go into the hospital and in
particular
if your problem is one that
people can't be around you is somebody
else the one who colors his hair
i'm just gonna speculate that he has
some assistant
who normally once a week or whatever
adds a little you know tone to his hair
to keep it that color if you go into the
hospital
the nurses and the doctors are not going
to perform that function
and there's nobody else you can ask
because you're infected with the
coronavirus
so it could be that like other people
who go into the hospital
you just can't keep up your you know
your hairstyle while you're in hospital
so he may have let it revert now it
could have been just the lighting i may
be completely
off here so we'll have to see him again
but if he let it revert
he emerged as gandalf the gray
you know gandalf he was actually gandalf
the gray at first and turned into
gandalf the white
when when something happened and he
transformed i i don't want to call him
trump the white because that
turns into a whole different thing so
it's like he emerged as gandalf the gray
like he came out of the coronavirus a
different person or a different leader
and i gotta say i like it he the
if the gray is real and if he's gonna
keep it
and i don't know i don't know either of
those to be true
it works and i think also there might be
an issue
with how he does tv makeup because how
does it
how does a makeup artist put makeup on
somebody who's got coronavirus
so he may not be getting tv makeup
maybe a family member maybe probably
melania
because melania already has the virus so
maybe he says melania can you put on
some tv makeup
and maybe she does it better maybe she
just gives him a more natural look
maybe it's because his hair is not as
orange so they have to
tone down the face makeup as well
whatever it is it works so i'm just
going to say
i like it it's a good look so if he
keeps it i think that'd be a
pretty good decision but let's talk
about what he said
which wasn't so good the the part about
him talking
not as good not as good and he has one
mistake
that he seems to want to make over and
over again
which is saying medical stuff that
non-medical people just shouldn't say
now of course you all know he got in
trouble with hydroxychloroquine
because he's not a doctor not a
scientist and was
a little enthusiastic about that and
that didn't work out for him politically
but
then he has this regeneron and several
other drugs
rem deserver and i don't know what else
vitamin
vitamin d etc and he gives this video
and he says that it was the regeneron
that made all the difference
and when he said that i just said oh
don't say that i know why he's saying
makes perfect sense to say it but
uh he's he's again falling into the trap
of making a medical claim that
presidents should not make you know if a
medical person made this claim
you could at least take it seriously but
i just don't like to see the president
say
i took six drugs but this is the one
that made the difference
because i don't think you could know
that i don't think you could know
which of the drugs made you feel the way
you feel and on top of that
he's he's taking that other drug that's
got a long name that's a
a steroid the steroid
i believe makes you feel better even if
you're not better
somebody needs to fact check me on that
and any doctors want to
fact check me on that would not the
steroid
just by itself wouldn't that make him
feel better
even if underlying problem wasn't that
much better
so when he says i felt immediately
better after
the regeneron i gotta ask myself
what else were you taking about the same
time
so his credibility on medical claims
could not be
lower and so i think it was a mistake
for him to
promote this but i have to say i didn't
see that much pushback
maybe because there's other news that's
more interesting but he might have
gotten away with it
uh i think they'll double back on that
later
but here's the thing he's trying to uh
present a story in which the
therapeutics are that
are the savior and the vaccines will be
great
and that the vaccines will finish it off
but the therapeutic especially regeneron
if it's
real and if it's working is here now and
it's a big difference
so he wants people to feel safer about
you know the
odds of catching it so that's good so
he's dealing with the fear
how's he doing let me ask you this
when you saw president trump go into
walter reed
how much fear did you have about
coronavirus
probably a lot you started with a
healthy dose of fear for somebody
in their 70s maybe you weren't afraid
for yourself
but you were certainly concerned about
anybody in their 70s
and when he went in the hospital you
were really concerned probably
you know if you were a supporter and
when it turns out that this drug if this
is true
and it could be true the regeneron made
him feel instantly better
if that's true that makes you feel a lot
safer doesn't it
and again not safer necessarily for
yourself but safer on behalf of
the exposed vulnerable population
so i think that part's probably good
that to the extent
that he's sold the story that there's a
therapeutic that can really make a
difference
big pharma pushes new meds even at
walter reed
yeah so big pharma was using this as a
marketing opportunity
that's true and successfully
now i hope we will not find that the
president has any uh financial tie to
regeneron
i i believe he used to have some stock
in that company but doesn't anymore
if that reporting is correct i'd need a
fact check on that
so i love the fact that he's selling the
story that the therapeutics are already
here
and that will keep you alive in almost
every case
that's a pretty good story and it is
compatible with reopening
the uh the the country
in related news uh in an unprecedented
move it's been called the editors of the
new england journal of medicine
uh have publicly condemned the trump
administration for their covet
pandemic response and calling for the
the current u.s
leadership to be voted out of office
that's pretty unprecedented
because it's a medical organization and
they don't usually
maybe never have gotten involved in
politics
but in their opinion the the treatment
of the the medical part of his job if
you will the pandemic
that according to them he's botched us
so badly he should be voted out of
office
and they should break their
long-standing tradition to make that
case
here's what i get out of this this is
exactly why you can't let doctors make
decisions
this this is exactly why
you shouldn't listen to doctors on big
political decisions now should you
listen to your doctor
about a medical decision sure of course
of course you listen to your doctor on a
medical decision
is the pandemic handling a medical
decision
nope nope it's a very big decision
it's a national decision it's a national
defense decision
it's an economic decision it's a mental
health it's a physical health
it's a medical decision it's a lot of
things
it's not a medical decision this
demonstrates the stupidity of doctors as
well as just about anything could
they have ignored the the economic
part of the equation that
is stupid because they're at least smart
enough to know they don't know that
right it'd be one thing if you didn't
know what you don't know
but doctors are smart in general right
they're smart people they're people with
high iqs
they know they don't know economics and
they know that that's the other part of
the decision
and they have consciously decided to
just
ignore it they know that freedom is the
thing and the people want it and the
people will willingly take a risk of
dying to get it
did they talk about freedom nope wasn't
part of the
conversation so doctors having a limited
talent stack
meaning they could have all the talent
in the world at doctoring
they know they don't have those other
things they know they don't speak for
our freedom they don't speak for your
soul
they don't speak for your you know your
quality of life they don't speak for the
economy they don't speak for national
defense
but the president does and the president
took all of those things into
consideration and made the decisions
that he did
i believe he followed the medical
decisions in every case
but i looked for a specific example
because obviously
if doctors are going to make such uh you
know an unprecedented move
they're going to have to give the
reasons right so here are the reasons
for example they say in their statement
for example
masks work what
was there a point when the president
said masks
don't work the only point that happened
is when the doctors told them to say
that that's the only time
the only time trump said masks don't
work
is when doctors told him to say it
that's it
as soon as the doctors reversed fouchy
and uh the surgeon general etc as soon
as they reversed
trump reversed too now he of course
doesn't want to overdo the masks but he
always said they worked
he's always promoted them he carries one
in his pocket so the first part
is just not true and then they say
social distancing works
was there ever a point where trump said
that doesn't work
no these are just lies they quarantined
in isolation work
right again there's nobody including the
president who's ever said these things
uh don't work no that's not true they're
they're
citizens who say they don't work but
certainly not trump
um and this is amazing
all right um i would like to frame
trump's handling of the coronavirus
this way when you have a leader
leaders have two roles i held up three
fingers there when i said
two but you know this one doesn't count
two uh two rules one
is to lead the public where they don't
know they want to go
that's that's really where leaders get
the most credit
if a leader can tell the public all
right it's going to be tough
we've got to go to war for example it's
going to be horrible
but we got to do it anyway that's
leadership
getting the public to do something they
didn't think they wanted to do
but it's good for them the other kind of
leadership is giving the public
what they want because it's legitimate
right so the public wants let me give
you an example the public wants
freedom of speech if the president
simply didn't put his own opinion on it
and just said all right everybody wants
freedom of speech
i'm your leader i'm going to go get you
some freedom of speech
that's not really leadership in the in
the other way where you're giving them
something they don't want or don't know
they want
you're giving them what they want what
was the coronavirus
was the coronavirus the first kind of
leadership
where the president was leading people
to do something they don't want
or was it more the follower kind of
leadership where you say all right
everybody's on the same page this is
what you want
i will simply deliver it to you i think
it was more the second part
there was a little bit of the first part
you know you got a social distance and
we're gonna close the economy so there
were
there's parts of that but here's the
part
that i think nobody has talked about
and it goes like this the public
had a vote it was never the president's
decision
the president never had the power never
had the ability probably never had the
desire
to override the citizens on this
question because i think the citizens
had enough information
to make their own decisions and the
citizens said
in effect they didn't say it explicitly
but in effect
yeah we're willing to risk a few hundred
thousand lives
to to run the country a little bit more
closer to a normal
situation keep the economy strong keep
our national defense strong
protect the the poor especially do what
we can with the vulnerable people
especially
but the citizens decide the president
didn't have a choice
if you think the president could have
made the citizens
respond much differently i would say
that's a very unsupported assumption
and doesn't doesn't track imagine if you
will
a president obama all right that's the
fair
that's a completely fair uh mental
experiment
imagine a president obama and he told
the country you've all got to wear your
masks what do the conservatives do
do the conservatives say oh president
obama says we have to wear masks
i'm in because the way he said it was
very credible
and he's he's a man of science very he
respects science so if president obama
says
we conservatives and republicans should
wear masks
i'm in i'm wearing a mask no
in your wildest imagination you can't
see
you can't see president obama
getting more compliance from the public
do you know why
not his decision it's not
watch this this is me not wearing a mask
if i want to i can walk outdoors
and i can walk into a store without my
mask i'll get kicked down
but i could do it i have the power
president obama can't you know he
couldn't have made me wear a mask
if i didn't want to he couldn't make me
not
meet with my friends if i wanted
president trump doesn't have that power
either so as soon as you imagine
that the president was leading in that
first way which is getting
you know getting the public to do
something that maybe they didn't want to
do
you you end up with the wrong answer
because if he had been trying to do that
he failed i would agree with that
if he had been trying to make everybody
wear a mask and trying to make everybody
socially distanced the way he was
telling you were the experts
yeah that didn't happen was it ever
possible
was it no because he didn't have the
only vote
this was a situation where every one of
you had a vote
and you voted you voted with your
actions
and if you look around you see a lot of
people who said you know
i know that a few hundred thousand
people are gonna die if i act this way
and other people act this way
um yeah
i was just reading your comments that's
why i was pausing here for a moment
so whoever the president was they were
going to get the same response from the
public
the public was going to vote americans
have voted
americans have chosen freedom and
and growth and prosperity over absolute
safety
do you know why we chose that because
we're americans
there's nothing more american than that
if you say to an american
here's your deal the only way you can
keep the economy going
is a few hundred thousand people are
going to die we don't know their names
but we know it's going to happen but
it's the only way to keep this engine
working
and this engine is what has made the
world as good as it is
do you want to break the thing that made
everything work
i mean basically the whole rest of the
world benefits from a strong united
states
i feel that's a safe thing to say
so that's my take
the the public voted the president um
basically agreed with the public and we
got
exactly what we bought if you go into a
store and you say i'm gonna buy a loaf
of bread
i've got my whatever bread cost i don't
know four dollars what is bread cost i
have no idea
i don't buy bread um but you give them
four dollars for your loaf of bread
and they give you a loaf of bread what
do you say do you say that was
that was a failure no no
you had money you wanted bread you gave
them money they gave you bread it's what
you wanted it's what they wanted
everybody got what they wanted
nobody failed if the public of the
united states said yeah i know it's
going to cost us
a couple hundred thousand lives and and
more and i'm still gonna go get that
loaf of bread
because you know what i know what a loaf
of bread costs
i know it's not free i'm not asking for
free bread
i'm american all right americans don't
ask for free bread
you know we know it costs something
we're gonna we're gonna pay it
so americans paid it the president
allowed the transaction
let me say that that way all right
that's all i got for now
i will talk to you tomorrow
all right periscope is off youtube is
still on i like to hang around and just
take some uh
extra questions on youtube
somebody said harris had less time than
uh or pence had less time than harris i
saw that
but it's funny how it didn't seem like
that right
the the impression of it was different
than the actual math of it i think
somebody says social media ruined
politics
yes i would say that the artificial
intelligence
ruined social media which ruined
politics because the ai determines
what we see and it's decided we'll only
see things that make our hair
catch on fire
what did i think of the lincoln lie i
don't know which one you're talking
about
do masks work let me give you the answer
i've given before i'll give you the
short version
if you believe that masks definitely
don't work
or you believe that masks definitely
work you are not smart
sorry sorry because there are smart
people
who are arguing they work and there are
smart people also looking at the data
in all cases everybody's looking at the
data and smart people say they do work
so what can you conclude as a citizen
who is not an expert
when there are smart people who say they
work smart people say they don't work
what should you do what's what's the
right decision
the right decision is you wear a mask
because it might work
if the stakes are really high it's it's
this
it's a version of the expected value
thing
the cost of wearing a mask there is some
cost
especially if you've got an underlying
health condition or something there is a
cost
and it's pretty big cost but the
alternative
of potentially millions of deaths is
bigger
so if you don't know that they work and
you don't know that they don't work
the right play in terms of risk
management is to wear a mask
so when you ask me do they work or do
they not i don't need to answer that
i only need to tell you that smart
experts have looked at the data
and they disagree that's it that's the
whole
that's all the data you need to know to
wear a mask
all right
somebody says that kamala had nothing to
promote or or to tout that's true
i saw one expert pundit to say
she only needed to show up and you know
not lose and it would be fine
because the tickets already had i think
there's something to that
she didn't have to take a chance so she
didn't take a chance
and she didn't have to take a chance
maybe that was enough
what's the dumbest the comments are
going by so quickly a lot of them i
can't read
can you speak to the answers to the last
question remind me what was the last
question
i don't remember
who was more positive and upbeat um i
