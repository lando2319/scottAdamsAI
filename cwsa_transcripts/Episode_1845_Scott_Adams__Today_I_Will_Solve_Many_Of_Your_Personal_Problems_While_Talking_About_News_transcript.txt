foreign
Excuse me while I checked for a security
problem
see how bad that is
not bad just my dog
good morning everybody and welcome to
the best thing that will happen to you
today
and probably the best thing that's ever
happened to you in your whole life it's
called coffee with Scott Adams
kind of a peak experience and if you'd
like to take it up to the next level and
I know you do all you need is a copper
mug or a glass of tanker chalice or
Stein at canteen jug or flask uh
any kind some of your favorite liquid I
like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day the
thing makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous Sip and it
happens now no
ah
everything's good now
it's all good if you hang out to the
latter part of my live stream today
after we talk about the news
I'm going to
give you a little hypnosis treat
anybody wants to stay around for that in
which I will teach you how to release on
the past
release on all your problems in the past
so wait for that that's coming
um I saw there was a scientific study
where scientist analyzed people who
coincidentally look alike
have you ever seen anybody who looks
like you you're walking down the street
and you say wait a minute that person
looks just like me
I have a bunch of those doppelgangers
well now it turns out the people who
look like each other even if they've
never met no matter where they are they
end up acting the same as well
so they have sort of similar preferences
now we already know this with twins
so it's actually not that big of a
surprise to me whatever it is that makes
you look physically exactly like
somebody is is probably affecting your
mind as well as your body right there's
some kind of genetic commonality there
so
what does this tell you
does it tell you we might be a
simulation that there is code reuse
and that there just aren't that many
people in the world I have hypothesized
there are only 100 people
I think there are only 100 people
and they're everybody's aversion you
know it might be 200 but it's not a lot
it's not a million they're definitely
not a million people
more like one or two hundred that's it
and everybody's like a version of that
you know based on what your I guess your
environment did to you
uh
so not only might we be a simulation
but what would it tell you if there are
some characters that are the same
characters but they're playing in
different scenes
well that would be consistent with my
hypothesis that if we're a simulated
reality the reason we're being simulated
is to try to solve problems for whoever
built the simulation so in other words
we're running through a b testing of
okay if I do this how does that work out
if I do this how does it work out but
then you would also have to test it
in different environments
so it wouldn't be a good test to test
just me and my specific life trying a
different thing and seeing if it works
because you wouldn't know if there was
something else about the situation that
made the difference
so you would have to test me
in a variety of different situations
trying a variety of different solutions
until there was a commonality between
the thing you tried and it didn't matter
where you were doing it and then you'd
have a solution
so maybe
all right
I had been ignoring the
the senate race in Pennsylvania
apparently I missed a lot of fun
because I don't really pay attention to
the state races
but this Dr Oz versus fetterman thing
has gone through such a ridiculous place
that I can no longer
I can no longer ignore it because
it's not funny except that it is
[Laughter]
so have I explained to you before that
there's nothing wrong with laughing as
something that's horrible
if you also understand it's horrible
right if you're laughing at tragedy and
you don't care like you have no empathy
well maybe you're a bad person
but if you know it's bad and there are
genuinely you know there are people
genuinely suffering
as always you acknowledge that if
there's something about it that's funny
well that's not your fault
that's not your fault at all
and this
John fetterman thing the thing I can't
get past is that you know again I I do
have empathy for him and his family he
had a stroke
it seems like it was pretty bad
and the stroke has debilitated him to
the point where he tried to give a five
minute speech and he really didn't work
he just couldn't come up with the words
in time and some of the words were
seemed to be the wrong choice of word
and it just didn't work
I mean it was pretty brave
you know if we're going to give him
you know any props at all that was
pretty brave
pretty brave
but apparently somebody on the Dr Oz
campaign
said
because I guess Dr Oz got some pushback
because he was complaining about his uh
crudites costing too much or something
which is what some people call a veggie
tray that's what the Democrats said
anyway so he seemed like sort of the
elitist complaining about his crew
nights being too expensive and uh
so somebody on the Dr Oz campaign
actually said this if John Federman had
never eaten a vegetable in his life then
maybe he wouldn't have had a major
stroke it wouldn't be in the position of
having to lie about it constantly Rachel
Tripp as a senior communication advisor
said
so she actually she actually said and
she's like
she was like the head of his
Communications
she's a seizure Communications person
what what did the junior Communications
person say
this is what the senior Communications
expert said I'd like to hear what the
Lesser qualified people had to say hey
I've got an idea why don't you say he's
the vegetable
how about that yeah well why don't you
take it to that next level
you know saying you should have eaten
vegetables that's pretty that's pretty
cutting
but you should take it to the next level
you know that's what the junior uh
communication is advisors would have
recommended
but here's the funniest part
uh the the race is close
just neck and back there's one guy
there's one guy who's basically barely
organic
and again I do have empathy it's a
horrible thing that happened to him I
wouldn't want it to happen to anybody I
loved but
the political part of it you can't avoid
the fact that that's funny
that he literally can't function at all
again we have empathy for him but in the
political sense they're running somebody
who can't even function
against us and his neck and neck
it's like really close
that tells you everything you need to
know about American politics
all right here's another story
I swear I'm not high I know it looks
like I am but I'm not
but it's it's not my fault the new the
news is just funny today
so I saw uh this wasn't news but there's
one of these little uh advertisement
kind of interstitial things you see on
the internet all the time and it
purported to show the IQs of the 40s
smartest presidents
and the first thing that's funny about
it is that we can calculate the IQ of
the uh of like the founders of the
country now I get that they were smart
but you can't really calculate their IQs
that's not a thing
uh but apparently they think they did
and the funniest part is I think they
put uh Trump at like number three
as the one be good because his IQ has
never been measured in any way that
anybody's seen but he claims it's very
high
so they they used his claim of his IQ
and put him on a list at like number
three
I don't know
oh my God and but here's the part I like
best do you know who's number one
according to this very unscientific list
do you know who is the number one IQ of
all the presidents anybody know
allegedly it was uh John Quincy Adams
John Quincy Adams
who apparently was a Harvard graduate
and spoke fluently seven languages
he spoke fluently seven languages
that doesn't even sound true
um I never believed that when somebody
says they're fluent in seven languages
do you ever believe that that's actually
true
I know I know
usually that's three that's sort of
three plus I I don't believe seven
but I love the fact that uh Trump made
it onto number three of the smartest
President's List uh just because he made
a claim
so I thought can I do that
I've actually had my IQ measured so I
actually have a number
but you've never seen it you don't have
access to it
so let me tell you my IQ is 185.
as far as you know
so I'm just going to put it out there
because someday they're going to make a
list of the smartest cartoonists
and I want them to have the same problem
well we couldn't find any information
about his IQ but he says it's 185.
so I'm going with that
so from now on from now on I'm not going
to tell people that it's a joke
I'm just going to put it out there like
it's true
so you're all in on the joke okay you're
all in on the joke
from now on I'm just going to say I have
an IQ of 185
I'm going to see if I can make that turn
into a thing
you're all in on it
so it's a and by the way you can help so
if you see like a tweet where somebody's
calling me stupid or something just go
in there and say stupid
he's reportedly has a IQ of 185.
but say reportedly
just say reportedly I
it will turn into a fact and some people
are going to believe it
all right let's do that
John John Stossel had a
Great Piece about what it means to be
scientific in terms of the government
and his point was and he showed lots of
good evidence for it that what we
believe is science
if it has any connection to the
government is really just a left-wing
preferences that they've laundered
through fake science
that's I'm kind of oversimplifying is
his thesis
um which I can do because I have an IQ
of 185 so I can I can
simplify this so easily with my big IQ
um
so he makes this case pretty well that
if the government is involved in any way
you should not assume it's science
if the government is involved in any way
it's very unlikely that it's actual
science it's just advocacy that they
launder through fake studies and so they
gave some examples
and but my favorite was and I guess you
knew about this but I didn't
did you all know that uh Stephen Crowder
submitted a paper about something about
fat studies and fat acceptance
and was invited to a some kind of fat
acceptance conference
where he attended over zoom in a dressed
as a woman
he was just as a woman talking talking
pretty much like a guy but he was
dressed as a woman
and he completely sold the conference
that he was a real scientist or or had
real scientific studies or whatever and
not only did they love his presentation
but they invited him to look at some
other people's studies
oh my God
um how many of you know that I once wore
a disguise and went to a
a top level uh business meeting in
Corporate America
so the true story I
um years ago when Dilbert was sort of a
bigger phenomenon in the country than it
is right now
I uh
I dressed in a actual fake costume I had
a mustache and a wig and I went in as a
consultant
now it was a prank that was being pulled
by the San Jose Mercury News so a
reporter there was working with me and
she got the CEO of the company
to BMI and so the CEO knew who that I
was a fake but his his top generals did
not so it was a meeting of his top
generals and this and this is what I I
did I told them that I was there to help
them create a mission statement
but I was really there to see if I could
get them to create a mission statement
that was complete nonsense
and I wanted to see if I could get them
to create nonsense and all at all bark
like train seals and it was awesome
and so I I used my hypnosis and
persuasion powers to get them to think
that they were you know contributing to
it
but I would just take all the worst
things they said and write them down and
then I struggled all together until
their mission I don't have it with me
but their mission statement what it was
done was the most ridiculous jargony
nonsense because I made sure that the
the worst ideas got implemented and I
made them think that they were the good
ideas and so when it was all done it was
something like you know we strive to be
the it was just just a jargoning
nonsense thing and then at the end I
said you know science has proven
that if you want somebody to remember
something it helps to make it Rhyme or
to put it to music
and I said is there anybody in the room
and remember these are the top
Executives of a tech company top
Executives and I said is there anybody
in the room who has some musical
background who could maybe help turn
this mission statement into a musical
piece
and I actually got somebody to volunteer
to turn the mission statement into a
song
so once it reached the ultimate level of
Ridiculousness
hey I stood in front of the group and I
I just took off my mustache
and they're all just sort of in shock
and then I
took off the wig
and they're still in shock
and then somebody recognized me
like you know that Dilbert guy you're
the Dylan and it was all over
great story
anyway uh Stephen Crowder's prank I
think is better than mine and one of the
best I've ever seen so so kudos to
Stephen Crowder I guess this is a while
ago he did this I don't remember when
but that's that's that's one of the best
pranks I've ever seen
have you ever seen a better prank than
that
that's that's got to be that's got to be
like number one
of All American pranks it'd be tough to
top that one
all right
um
so karma is coming for uh Andrew tamed
um been kicked off of all platforms and
uh he's made a heartfelt video about how
he was bullied
and that's that's on Rumble if you want
to see it but uh I'd just like to say
something to YouTube
because I know
if if you don't mind the people on
locals just uh point of uh personal
privilege
hey YouTube
I understand you banned uh Andrew taint
there's a video on there you need to get
rid of
in which he claims that I promoted
vaccines and masks
now those are lies
they're not the only lies there the
other lies are incredibly misogynistic
and I can't believe you let that video
up there YouTube
so YouTube what the are you doing
you pieces of you
 you absolute
if you're gonna get rid of Andrew Tate
get rid of all of it
because that's the worst thing he has on
there
and it's still there
you
have have any of the
do I have the attention of any of the
sensors yet you stupid you
absolute pieces of you
you listening yet
because this is just to the sensors
if you're watching this to see if you
should ban some some of this or
demonetize it you're in the wrong
 place go look at your site go
find Andrew Tain lying about me get rid
of that piece of
and squash him for good
he is a lying worthless
dangerous
piece of
and if you don't get rid of him I'm
coming for you
so take care of that
well it turns out that apple is uh
decoupling a little bit or at least we
like to think so from China
um
they're going to be making more phones
in India
so I feel like this um
I I feel like
I feel like the the decoupling is
happening do you think it's real
the decoupling with China I think is
very real
isn't this like the biggest story that's
happening
and here's a question that I have for
America
we can't really decouple from China too
effectively if we can't make stuff here
shouldn't we be working really hard to
figure out how to make things in America
or at the very least make things in
Central America so we can you know
control the immigration
although I'm not sure I want to control
it anymore
you know uh
uh you're gonna hate this that this is
just my thought of the day
but I'm getting more and more worried
about the depopulation problem
you know Elon Musk says it's the biggest
biggest risk for a civilization and I
think I agree
it does look like the biggest risk
because I do think we have other things
somewhat under control
but we don't really have a good solution
for the underpopulation problem
and so I'm wondering if all of us are
wrong about immigration
now I think immigration had to be
controlled when the the natural
population was growing I think that
stopped around 1970 or so replacement
population but you do know that if we
stopped immigration
or even we if we kept immigration even
where it is or we stopped it completely
you know we'd be doomed right
how many of you know that do you know if
we stopped immigration just if we
stopped it completely America would be
doomed
do you know that
is that is that something that is not
commonly understood
yeah they're people saying no
yeah they're people who say no
so some of you disagree with that
you let's let's do this
yeah pick your fate
yeah as as I've often said we've we've
been talking about the wrong question
forever
we keep talking about immigration yes or
no and we never talk about the smart way
to say it
do you have a mechanism for controlling
it can you can you dial it up and dial
it down as you need it and can you
control who gets it and who doesn't
that's the only question we ever should
have asked
and then the question of how many you
let in should be you know experts
basically they should say well we're
below replacement value we have certain
level of skills we need more than others
so we'll we'll dial it up but not for
everybody we'll let in the people who
have certain
characteristics certain skills
but
how many of you are are having a moment
right now where you're saying oh is
that possible
is it possible that if we succeeded in
keeping everybody out we'd be doomed
it's probable
it's actually probable because the only
way we would not be doomed is if our if
our own reproduction started suddenly
going way up and I don't see anything
that's going to happen to do that do you
do you see anything that would make
people have more babies I mean it could
be a pendulum thing maybe it just swings
the other way at some point
but be careful about what you wish for
be careful about what you wish for I
feel like at this point
um as bad as the problems that
immigration creates they might be less
than the alternative
and I'm at least open to that
conversation where I don't think I was
even a week ago a week ago I don't think
I would have said this
it's just the more I think about this
population problem
uh the more concerned I am
and I don't think opening the borders
and just like hey everybody come in as a
solution that doesn't feel like a good
solution but I don't think we're
thinking about it as smartly as we need
to
imagine let's just use your imagination
imagine if Trump said we need more
immigration not less to survive
but we have to do it a little smarter
how does that sound
that sounds completely different doesn't
it because as soon as you say we have to
limit
immigration you sound like a racist
because people just assume you know
you're talking about brown people
but if he came in and said look I agree
with Elon Musk we have you know I had
several kids I like kids we should have
kids we're gonna have to have kids but
if we don't
and that's your choice if you don't have
kids you know you're doomed if we don't
bring in fresh blood
so we don't have a choice but let's do
it in the smartest way we can
that would solve everything
wouldn't it you you tell me that
somebody could argue against that
position we need more people we just
have to be smarter about it
who who disagrees with that
you could so easily so easily make that
case
now I know there's some of you who said
no we don't we don't need more people
but I would ask you to research
population collapse as a risk
so just do some breathing on population
collapse and you might change your mind
you might change your mind yeah we like
skilled people first but remember uh
young people don't have skills
and a lot of the people that we're
bringing in are the young people without
the adults by the way if that's a thing
so it's not uncommon for the the young
kids to come to America
and the parents not be able to come for
one reason or another
so they do send their kids
and they can be trained
so Biden is uh pushing the student loan
forgiveness ten thousand dollars per
person I think it was uh
was on the five and Dana Perino was
saying there was Dana Perino was saying
that the ten thousand dollar forgiveness
um
might make a lot of people angry
so they would vote against the Democrats
for doing it but probably there's not
anybody going to be so happy about it
that they vote for it I don't know about
that
I know if you were a student or if you
had student loans
wouldn't you vote for the person who
gave you ten thousand dollars
all else being equal which most people
don't follow the news anyway they just
say wait I just vote for this person I
might get ten thousand dollars
I know there's no right answer for uh
student loan forgiveness meaning that
it's a problem that needs to be
addressed but on the other hand it's a
problem that people created for
themselves but on the other other hand
there's no free will
so if you knew that somebody had calmed
you and you were a victim would you
blame the victim
because that's what we're doing we are
blaming the victim if they took out too
big of a school loan because they're a
victim of society Society said you have
to go to college
and if you can't do it any other way you
got to get a loan
that's what we told everybody we
brainwashed kids into thinking that's
the only way to succeed
so if you brainwash people and then they
do what you brainwash them to do is it
fair to blame them
is it because to me they're the victims
why are you blaming the victims
seems to be the colleges have something
to explain
uh but again they don't most of the
colleges don't have enough extra cash
that they could do anything about this
either
so the real the real solution is the
long term
which is uh redoing education so re
education has to be redone so it doesn't
cost anything
you know the actual cost of an education
what do you think you should be
it should approach zero
over time
the cost of an education should be
trending towards zero
forever
you know you'll never get to zero
but it will half that distance every few
years
right
into perpetuity until it costs a petty
because in theory once you get something
on video or
in VR or whatever form it is once it's
there
it can teach people math forever from
the same content
right so at the moment there is not a
substitute for in-person learning that's
as good
you'd agree with that right Zoom is not
as good as in-person learning for most
things but for some things it's already
a little bit better just special cases
the special case would be the teacher is
not so good but the video is excellent
and it's a visual thing so being on
video helps so but that that crossover
will continue there's no chance no
chance that a human teacher can be
competitive with technology as a teacher
no chance not in the long run so in the
long run it might be an avatar or an AI
or something but there's no way that a
human will be able to
you know be competitive except maybe as
a coach or in the room or something
right but the main teaching will
definitely be technology and that means
that the cost of it should be dropping
so that's the long term
and I've said this before but if I if
you haven't heard it I'm going to make
this a thing I I tried to start a
startup to do this and actually had an
agreement to get a funded a company was
going to work with me on this
but something happened with that company
and they changed their priorities and
fell apart and the idea was this
that each of the the courses that you
teach in school
should be defined so that you can break
the course into chunks
all right here's the module where you
learn
how to calculate angles and geometry or
whatever it is but like discrete little
chapters and then you say each of these
chapters is available to the entire
world to make a better version
so you can just work on this module if
you could teach somebody how to
calculate an angle better than anybody
else
then maybe yours gets voted up because
people would you know be analyzing them
and then your module gets voted up to be
a recommended part of the class
and then somebody comes in later and
they come up with a better module
and your that module gets voted up and
replaces the other one over time all of
the modules in the class would be the
best one that the market could produce
it'd be way better than a human human
teacher way better won't even be close
you just have to add competition
and then you have to build an Amazon
like Market where people know exactly
what they're building and what money
they could make if it's successful like
a book right when you write a book you
have a really good idea you know what's
my advance and if it succeeds what's my
upside it's a very mature Market
education will become that so in the
long term I would expect Amazon would be
the only place you get of Education
how about that
and it won't cost much
maybe you pay a dollar for a module
it's just video
right so they can deliver it for
basically zero cost
so yeah dollar module times everybody
who's learning is pretty
it's pretty good uh profit
once there is a good lesson who will
ever uh well anybody who thinks that
they can write a better book
tries to write books even though there
are plenty of books already you never
have to worry
so I'm seeing you know Khan Academy and
UW and everything being recommended but
I don't think that any of those models
have what I'm describing I think they
have entire courses
given by you know one set of people per
person I don't think there's any one
course that's broken into chunks
is that true but if you ever see that
let me know because I would promote it
for you
Jordan Peterson is working on a school
like that
are you serious
well let me know about that if oh yes
well I'll be down so you're saying the
udemy does that
I don't believe that I think udemy is
just something you want me to know about
which I know about
um all right
okay
um
how would you like me to make your past
problems disappear
all right
does anybody does anybody uh racked by
let's say doubt or guilt about the past
anything that's been bothering you
well let me see
experienced
for a second can you hear literally
that your life simply began right now
in my own ability to manifest things
insane and belief well it looks like
that got cut off for some reason but as
it turns out
I can complete it even better than
listening to the video
because it's hard to listen to the video
I'll just tap the video you don't need
to hear the rest of the video because I
was going to do this uh myself so I want
to give some
um credit to the person who reminded me
to do it goes like this
okay you just want me to tap it don't
you
all right because I know you're not
going to stop saying that until I do
uh
but uh no I'm not going to do that
forget that I'm not going to show that
to you because I can do a better myself
okay so stop saying tap
there's absolutely no reason you need to
keep identifying with the past if you
disagree God
um
so I'm going to do it myself
it goes like this
think about where you are look at your
surroundings
just look at your surroundings
and
feel that this is all that exists
imagine that you were just born into the
world this moment
you just you never existed before and
you just popped into existence right
where you are
now do this
do this with me
just look around and just say I just
popped into existence
somehow I know how everything works it's
like oh I know what this is
so just go through the visualization and
just imagine you just appeared in the
world
history
even if you have a memory of it doesn't
exist
you couldn't take a handful of History
you couldn't punch history you couldn't
put it in your pocket you couldn't paint
it you couldn't touch it you couldn't
smell it
history doesn't exist what is this is
this
and you can start today
and just say I'll just act like my
history started today
just act like it didn't exist
now you don't have to worry about the
reality of it
because we're not talking about reality
when you reframe things
you don't need to be technically correct
it just has to work
and that's the main theme of my
reframing book that I'm working on now a
reframe doesn't have to be true
it doesn't have to be logical
it doesn't have to be factual
it just has to work
this is one of those instead of
imagining yourself as as a creature
across time
imagine yourself as a creature of a Time
you are of the moment
imagine you are not a creature who is
spread across the past and the future
you're a person who exists right now and
that's all you are
is it true it doesn't matter
it doesn't matter it does matter if you
can imagine it as true which you kept
and when you do that it takes all those
past things and puts them into the
imaginary box and then you can close the
box at least for a little while
you can live free from the box
eventually the pass gets out of the box
but you can do it again
just every time the pass gets out of the
box and you start obsessing about it
just bring yourself to the room
touch things feel things and say I was
just born
I just came into existence here's here's
the stuff I have to work with what do I
have okay I got this body
I apparently have some kind of job I
know of
and I'm in this space
I'm hungry I'm horny I'm tired I'm
something but I'm right now
I'm right now
that
is the technique
now some of you probably felt it just in
my description of it
but it does work this is one I use all
the time by the way I've used this
number of times and it does work for a
while right it's one of those things
you'd have to reinforce but it works for
a while
try it out
all right
um
so this next part many of you will want
to turn off I think we can we can agree
that nobody cares about vaccinations
anymore right do we all agree with that
nobody wants to hear an argument about
it nobody wants to hear if you chose
right or chose wrong
blah blah all right but
here's what I'm not going to release on
how we think about things
that's important
right
and given that I have an IQ of 185.
I'm going to help you
think through some things and I was sort
of curious myself about how people were
thinking about it so I did a
I did a poll
and what which I asked people uh
um what is your level of certainty
that the risk of long covet for people
over 40. well forget about the young
people for a moment but what is your
certainty that the risk of long coveted
for people over 40 is too small to be of
concern
how certain are you that long covert is
something you don't need to worry about
the people who are totally certain that
long covid is nothing to worry about
was uh what do you think that came out
to about roughly
the people who are totally certain that
you don't need to worry about long covet
at all
yeah it's about a quarter about a
quarter of the people
that's probably a coincidence it was 28
specifically
um
and then
there's the other people
did that really not print
oh there it is people who are confident
but not totally certain was about a
third
and then the 38 said it was just unknown
just unknown
now
that's your whole uh that's your whole
vaccination discussion right there right
because if you said to yourself you were
sure about the risk of
long covet you had everything you needed
am I correct if you were sure about your
risk of long covet that it wasn't risk
then I think you'd have everything you
needed to make a an informed decision
would you agree with that
because you have some sense of the
vaccination of yourself
you have some sense of the risk of the
of the the virus itself
the only thing that was unknown
would be the long covet would you agree
with that
that was the big unknown
and if you were positive that you knew
then you would say I do everything I
knew
does that sound correct
because I I would agree that if you knew
long coveted risks somehow you had a way
to do it
that's all you know
but I ask people also
I asked this question I'll ask you here
all right you ready now some of you are
going to say hey that's a trick question
but here's what you can't do you can't
add your own assumptions
you can't change the question
this is only to see how you think it's
not about the actual
pandemic right so it's not about this
pandemic it's just a general how do you
think question and the question is this
if you knew for certain right now you
have to accept it's a hypothetical
question so there's no doubt
because it's just hypothetical right if
you knew for certain
exactly the risk of a vaccine and it
doesn't matter what vaccine again it's
not about the pandemic if you knew
exactly the risk of a vaccine would you
know enough to make a decision about
taking it go
if you knew the exact risk of the
vaccine for you would you know enough
yes
yes some say no why do you say no and
some say yes
I'm saying you know exactly what the
vaccine's risk is for you not even for
other people you know for you
do you now those of you who are watching
the answers go by
are you confused that there are people
saying yes and people saying no
like do you wonder what the other people
are thinking
isn't are you curious like whichever
answer you gave aren't you shaking your
head and saying how in the world could
somebody be on the other side of this
question
and it doesn't matter which side you
talk right aren't you amazed
aren't you amazed that somebody's
answering differently than you are
it's kind of weird isn't it no matter
which side you're on it seems weird
doesn't it
yeah well here's the answer because I
have a IQ of 185 as far as you know
the answer is that if you knew the exact
risks of the vaccines it wouldn't tell
you anything
that's no information
no useful information
it's none
do you understand that
that knowing everything about the
vaccination
would give you no information that's
useful for making a decision about
taking it
how many of you understand that point
they're having complete accurate
information about the vaccine
doesn't give you any information about
whether you should take it
hey you got really quiet there didn't
you
some of you got really quiet suddenly
do I need to explain why that's true
do I need to explain that
because a lot of people I think half of
the people said that if they knew the
risk of the vaccine they'd have
everything they needed to make a
decision
and that's 100 wrong
because you would also have to know the
risk of the thing you're trying to
solve with the vaccine
so if you knew everything about the risk
of long covet
and everything about the risk of dying
and everything about the risk of the
vaccine you'd probably have enough
information
but if you only know about the vaccine
or think you do
and you don't know if you've got if long
covet is real or not then you don't have
enough information to make an informed
decision
now those of you who think long covet is
not real
can in the comments tell me is long
coveted real or not real you tell me in
the comments is it real or not real
I'm seeing a little bit of both right
not real not real okay this is one of
those questions that I I can answer with
complete certainty
most things I can't answer was this
level of certainty is real
I I had long covered for a month there's
no question that's what it was no
question
and I couldn't walk upstairs
for a month and I'm in good shape
right normally I run upstairs you know
even at my current age
I run upstairs just because I'm always
in a hurry but I couldn't walk upstairs
for about a week
like I had I'd stand at the bottom and
go
like it was a process
now I lost a month of quality life
meaning that I could not enjoy myself in
any way whatsoever for a month
if I had it to do over again I would
have taken the booster
now I didn't get the booster shots
because I didn't want the risk of the
vaccination
when I thought that the risk of Omicron
was so small
right so I said ah why would I take the
extra risk of a vaccination when the
Omicron is such a small risk
if you had told me that I would lose a
month of my life
I would have taken the booster
because I I think there was a chance it
would have reduced my symptoms
now
I do have regrets but I have regret that
I didn't take the booster
and that's sort of a recent realization
now I do like the fact that I have maybe
something like natural immunity but just
I'm a crime I don't know
somebody says 185 IQ and vaxxed here let
me let me with your brains a little
bit
there are people here who got vaxed and
they're people who didn't get vexed how
many think you made the right choice no
matter which way you went
just speak for yourself how many of you
say you made the right choice for you
go
oh yeses all right I think I saw one now
one I don't know
but mostly mostly we've decided we've
made the right choices
so I think we could all claim victory we
can claim that we all made the right
choice no matter what choice we've made
so that's pretty good
anyway
um
now if you tell me it would be a bad
decision to add a booster to the
whatever else I've already got in me
because the booster itself has some
risks which of course it does
I would tell you that you didn't
experience my my month of long covet if
you had experienced my month of long
covet you'd be way more flexible about
the risk of the vaccination
it was really bad it was really bad for
a month
all right
um
but let me say as clearly as I can I
don't I don't know what's going to
happen in the future
I don't know if I'll get a blood clot in
the future and I don't know if my long
covered will be the cause or the
vaccination I don't know
you know I I was guessing
and I wanted to take a vacation
um
here's something interesting
what percentage of doctors uh
immediately signed up for the MRNA
vaccination when it was available what
percentage of doctors
because we don't trust experts right
you can't really trust experts anymore
we don't trust the government we don't
trust The Who
right
um I saw a number of this at 96 percent
yeah I saw 96 percent
does that sound right
now I don't know if it's right but let's
say let's say it is if 96 of the doctors
took the vaccination
do you think they did it for coercion
reasons
does that sound like doctors
the doctors do you know
have you ever met a doctor
our doctor is opinionated
doctors have strong opinions about
things
yes they do doctors have really strong
opinions about
you think you could get 96 of them to
sign up to an experimental drug unless
they were feeling comfortable it was the
right choice now that doesn't mean it
was the right choice
I'm just saying did they feel
comfortable all right now let's compare
that to this situation
I recently was diagnosed with a
forget what you call it one of the
hernias
it's like a little hernia like a break
and it doesn't matter what it is but
when I talk to The Experts
my my regular doctor had primed me this
I'm going to have you talk to the expert
the surgeon who does the the surgery
but you should know before you talk to
the doctor
that the doctors who do the surgery are
the least yet it's an inguinal inguinal
thing that the doctors who do the
surgery are the least likely to have it
performed on them
and I said what
that's right the doctors who do the
surgery
are the least likely group to have the
surgery done on them if they have the
same problem do you know why
too risky
too risky
and
and so when I talked to my surgeon
he he started going through this long
description of the risks and Rewards
and then I I just stopped him I said
most of the people who do do what you do
do they get the uh do they get the
operation because I heard they don't
and he just stopped
and he said what do you do for a living
he goes what do you do for a living
and I told them and he goes okay because
I thought you were probably some kind of
science or engineering kind of person
because you you got to the risk
too quickly
basically the only thing that mattered
was that the people who had the most
information about it don't do it
he goes That's the only thing that
mattered right there all the other stuff
all the other stuff it doesn't matter to
the decision what you need to know is
that the people who absolutely
positively know the most about this
don't do it
that's what you needed to know
everything else was a distraction
and so I didn't do it
now I still might do it the the factor
is if it ends up you know being painful
or something but it's not painful it
doesn't bother me so I don't do it
someday I might so you would do it if it
hurt you every day and you didn't have a
choice basically
so yeah you just got a life just got a
life lesson
didn't you right
so I'm not going to say that because
doctors all did it that's a good idea
because I think the peer pressure in
this pandemic situation was not like
anything else
can we agree
generally speaking if all the doctors
are doing it I'm going to be feeling
favorable about it this would be the
exception
because I think the pandemic was such a
big psychological event as well as a
medical event that I don't believe you
could trust even the experts to make
independent decisions I don't think that
was an option
some
will become Rogue and maybe be right
I generally bet against the Rogues
because they're usually wrong
no matter how convincing they are
they're usually wrong
some of them might be right
all right so that's all I'm gonna uh
the the thing that I noticed is that the
people who were the most certain that
they had made the right decision were
also the least likely to know what all
the variables were
I'll say it again the people who are
most certain that they made the right
decision about vaccine or unvaxing are
also the people who are least aware
of the variables
because almost everybody who says I
didn't get a vaccination and I'm happy
about it doesn't include long covet as
even a risk variable if they do include
it then they say well I've said it's
zero risk but that's not based on
information it couldn't be because we
don't know the future
right and if you had if you'd lost a
month of productivity and you thought
you could have that lost month two or
three more times because keep in mind
I don't know if I get Omicron again
I don't know if my natural immunity
would keep me from a month of
of uh you know Badness again
because remember this is an engineered
we think
I believe I can say that now I all
indications are from what I can hear
that it's probably an engineered virus
how many of you believe you can predict
the long-term effect of an engineered
virus
how many think that's a thing
how many of you can predict what will
happen having an engineered virus in
your body
interesting because we all agree we care
predict
how bad the virus will be
but yet you're confident of your
decisions you shouldn't be confident of
a decision if you don't know what the
future looks like
confidence in the decision means you do
know what the future looks like because
it's just cause and effect it's
obviously going to happen
yeah
all right
so that was about what I wanted to do
and
so the reason that the Andrew tank thing
pisses me off is that he got a lot of
attention and part of it was a lie about
me well actually several lies about me
and so his lie is that I was a
pro-vaccination pro mask that's the
opposite of true
I was anti-anti-mandate
anti-mandate what do you do with your
own body that's your decision but
definitely anti-mandate for all those
things so he has lied
in a very dangerous lie about me
and so karma is coming together
and uh
he said my IQ was 112.
185 you tell him 185.
confident in making the right choice
given the current information okay I'll
take that I'll take that correction in
case you never think I changed my mind
yes being confident that you made the
right decision with what you knew at the
time is different from being confident
that it will work out that that is
correct I accept that correction
all right let me ask you this a number
of people told me that the fact that the
medical community was all on the same
page on vaccinations
is your indication that there's
something wrong
yes or no
the fact that the medical community was
so pro-vaccination and it seemed like
they had all you know except for the
Rogues here or there that they they seem
to have this unified front is that an
indication that there's a problem
look at your answers yeses and no's
here's the right answer
the right answer is
there are two situations in which the
medical community would be on the same
side
one is the one that we're talking about
everybody is group thinking and they're
afraid of the consequences of going
against the recommendations that's one
possibility
what's the other possibility for why all
of the medical community will be on the
same side I'll give you an example the
medical community is very let's say
Unified in saying that smoking
cigarettes is bad for your lungs and for
your health
now is that a red flag that the medical
community is pretty much solidly against
cigarette smoking
is that a red flag that maybe cigarette
smoking is good for you
no
[Laughter]
there are two situations in which the
medical community might be unified one
is if they're totally correct
and that's the most common one
the most common way that the medical
community agrees is when they're
completely correct
the least likely way that they all agree
is peer pressure but it is a thing
that's a real thing
I absolutely agree with you that what we
could be seeing could be nothing but
peer pressure that's possible it's not
my it's not my opinion
but if you say it's not possible oh it's
possible it's very possible that every
one of them could be wrong very possible
it's just the least likely possibility
the most likely possibility is at the
right
by far probably ten to one
if I had to put a number on it I'd say
when no matter the situation if you see
the medical community is solidly agreed
probably ten to one the right
but
the pandemic would be the one situation
where you'd have to question it
can we agree on that
that the pandemic was such an unusual
situation with government control and
everything else that is the one time
where all the doctors being on the same
side should mean closer to nothing
closer to nothing
but if you took it as more than nothing
and you moved it all to a all the way to
well it's a sign of fraud well that's
not justified
the fact that they all agree is not a
signal for fraud
is either a signal that it's an obvious
good thing
or something extraordinary happened and
unusual but that extraordinary and
unusual thing
would happen in exactly that situation
so it wouldn't be extraordinary in that
situation you know the pandemic
all right
uh the doctors were unified that masks
don't work at first
were they no they weren't
no they weren't
I don't think doctors have ever been
unified on masks I think masks is the
one thing they're not unified on but
well let me take let me say that
differently I believe that doctors are
unified that masks uh work with quotes
if you're visiting your 90 year old
grandmother in the rest home
correct or not
I believe that nearly 100 percent of
doctors
in the pandemic context would tell you
to wear a mask if you're visiting your
grandmother in the rest home
and not just for looks and not just
because it's the rules
but I think all of them would say you
know
it might make some difference
might make some difference
so if you believe that the virus is too
small
for the mass coals which is true
the virus is much smaller than the gaps
in the masks and plus it gets out to
size plus people wear them wrong
so in the real world
if you're wearing it all day
probably doesn't make much difference
because there's enough getting out if
you're around people all day long
you know it doesn't matter how it gets
there but on a short visit
does your mask get moisture on the
inside of the Mask yes or no
is there moisture from your exhaling on
the inside of the Mask
there is right
and if the virus travels on the moisture
do you think there's do you think you
wouldn't be able to measure any virus on
the mask
if somebody had covid
you don't think you'd be able to pick it
up on the inside of the Mask
so we know the mask would stop some
if it only stopped in bad logic
it's not bad logic remember I've got an
IQ of 185 don't forget that
uh
so if you know that virus is on moisture
you know the moisture is on the mask
some of that virus is on the mask
now is that enough to make a difference
don't know
because one of the hypotheses that we
heard that I have not heard debunked but
I have not heard it confirmed is that
the amount of virus you're initially
exposed to makes a difference
how many of you think that that's
confirmed or maybe just logical
that the amount of initial virus you're
you come with yeah logically it makes
sense but it doesn't mean it's doesn't
mean it's true right our logic brings us
oh less virus probably good because your
body has less to fight right
right so
here are the things that we can say for
sure from an engineering perspective
there's a hundred percent chance that
masks stop some virus if you disagree
with that you're a idiot let me
just say that
does anybody disagree with that does
anybody want to out themselves as a
 idiot
if there's moisture on the mask and the
viruses travels in the moisture is
stopping something
right nobody disagrees with that right
now do we see the difference in the
statistics
I haven't seen it
so whatever is happening is too small to
justify a mandate but probably not too
small to justify wearing it if you're
visiting your 90 year old grandmother in
the rest home how many would agree with
that assessment
there's no evidence that it works in a
macro sense when everybody wears them
and there's definite indications that
they're negatives to it
but if you're visiting Grandma uh who
knows
worth a shot
are we on the same page
I think we're on the same page
now I would also say that in the
beginning
we didn't know I mean maybe you know
we're guessing so I I don't I don't
fault anybody for being wrong in the
beginning
except the fauci told us he lied
but he lied for a reason that was I hate
to say it
he had a reason
and that reason was for the benefit of
the medical community so they wouldn't
run out of masks and that was the right
call
that well the right call was to protect
the medical community first
it doesn't mean that was the only way he
could do it but I don't have a better
idea
like if I bet in his position I feel
like I would have lied
would you
if you thought that the LIE would
protect people's lives would you have
lied in that position
it's easy to say no
but people would die if you told the
truth you know that right
suppose suppose you were sure that
telling the truth would kill people
would you lie anyway
or would you tell the truth if you knew
people would die because you told the
truth would you tell the truth
yeah it gets tougher if you know people
are going to die because I think that
was the case I think I think fauci was
closer to knowing people would die if he
told the truth
yeah
so
I think here's how I would have
preferred to handle it and it would have
gone like this
we need those n95 masks for the medical
community
if I see you wearing an n95 mask and
you're not a doctor
I'm going to talk to you about it
and everybody else should too if you see
somebody wearing an m95 ask them if
they're a doctor well I mean if if
they're outside the street
I don't know why are they wearing it
anyway but
but I think you could have uh
embarrassed the public and of wearing
them
I think you could have done that
you could have just embarrassed the
public and say look if you're wearing an
m95 mask in public and I don't have them
enough for my surgery team
you're an
yeah I get that you're protecting
yourself I get that it's your right but
you're not making the right choice for
the country so I feel like we maybe
could have embarrassed the country into
you know not scooping them up
because I do think I do think that
Americans
will step up
what do you think I mean not everybody
in every situation but my impression of
Americans is that in emergencies we do
Step Up
and I think if you said this is an
emergency I'm going to ask you not to
protect yourself
I'm going to ask you not to protect
yourself with these n95s until the
medical community can protect themselves
because that's your better outcome in
the long run
would we have stepped up
well if ten percent said they wouldn't
because they just are afraid I would say
those 10 probably needed them
you know if there's ten percent who have
such a mental
uh let's say they're so mentally
debilitated by what they perceive as the
risks
maybe they need the n95s right because
at that point it's medically required
but I think you could get 80 of the
public to say you know I will I'll
increase my risk a little bit for you
doctors because you're increasing your
risk for me
how hard is it to increase your personal
risk
to benefit somebody who's increasing
their personal risk and you're seeing it
in real time for you
everybody in the medical community
increased their personal risk
for you
would I increase my personal risk to
compensate them absolutely
in a heartbeat yeah it would be an easy
choice
yeah yeah maybe 75 you're right
ah
uh wow you're really showing your covet
Stripes here
really
uh
Sean so you're you're on a subscription
platform so I'm going to uh charitably
assume
that uh I'm misinterpreting you
all right
so if you'd like this would be a good
time to explain what you meant by I'm
showing my coven stripes
because I think you heard what I said
about the last person that
misinterpreted me
on this topic and I'd be happy to say it
again but I'm going to charitably assume
that you are
oops
and I just lost the feed
hold on a second
I hope that happened I just lost the
entire local speed
there we are
hey I'm back
hello
sorry I hit the wrong button
um
you were scared and making decisions
based on fear
all right you stupid bastard
um Let me let me take a minute to deal
with the people who say that I'm afraid
and making my decisions based on fear
number one I don't really even remember
the last time I was afraid
not really
I mean honestly if you said when was the
last time you were afraid of something I
was like I don't know
I can't even think of the last time
I I do see things as mostly risk but
even within that context of not actually
feeling fear or fear
oh actually I'll talk the last time I
was afraid was
when the supply chain looked like it was
at risk
the when the supply chain looked like it
was going to crash I was a little
worried about that now I told you I
wasn't worried and that was part of
making sure it didn't crash but
that worried me
I don't remember having any specific you
know worries about the virus or the
vaccination
I would say those of you who believe
that the people who got vaccinated was
because of fear
and the people who didn't get the
vaccination were Brave well you're
 idiots you're idiots
let me be you're a idiot if you
think that
because the reason you didn't get the
vaccination is you were afraid of it
now you might not have been trembling in
your boots
maybe you weren't shaking I'm not
shaking
but you looked at two things two risks
and you said this risk is bigger than
this one
just like every other person
they just looked at the two risks and
they said I think this one's bigger than
this one for me
you're not a hero
you're not a hero because you
didn't get the vaccination right you
could be somebody who accurately
calculated your risks you could be that
you could be a person who took the
looked at two risks and made a
reasonable decision you could be that
absolutely you could be that
if you're 25 and you know
you're not around a grandmother and you
decided not to get vaccinated I'd say
I've well okay that was a reasonable
approach
if you're 75 and you did get vaccinated
I'd say well I don't know if you're
right or wrong but it was a good
approach
but if your view
is that the people who looked at two
risks which are hard to calculate and
they chose a different one from you and
you think that they're a coward just
because they looked at two risks they
can't calculate and picked one you're a
 idiot
that is the lowest level of intellectual
honesty and evaluation you could
possibly have right
if you didn't take the vaccinations
because you're afraid of it it will kill
you or turn you into a mutant you're a
 coward
oh how does it feel how's it feel how
does it feel to be told called a coward
for not taking a vaccination and you say
to yourself I'm not a coward I looked at
the pluses and the minuses and I decided
that there were more minuses and pluses
well you coward
well stop being a
what well you can't put a little needle
in your arm you're afraid of a little
mRNA oh oh you you goddamn
coward man up man up and put a needle in
your arm it's not that hard
all right was that useful
I didn't do anything useful there did I
there was no benefit for me calling you
a coward because all you did is what
every person did they looked at
the risks they did their best based on
their personal situation nobody did
anything different from that you're not
a hero
you're an idiot
so don't go through life thinking I'm a
 hero I'm a hero I didn't get the
job those dumb people did no you were
afraid of the jab you were afraid you're
a coward
not really
it's just easy to say right
nobody was a coward
nobody was a hero we all just did our
best
and most of us are happy with our
choices
most of us are happy with our choices
you're not a hero you're not
brave
you're not the Rogue you're not the one
who bucked the things
right you might turn out to be right
I'm not saying you're wrong because
again fog of War we're all gassing but
and I'll tell you who annoys me the most
the people who are sure that they saw
the problems coming and here they are
those people are really lost
uh stop talking about your bad choices
um
well
that's the NPC approach
how many people did I drive off I wanna
I was assuming that I'd lose everybody
here yeah it looks like I lost most of
the YouTube people
all right
um
that's all for now
all right
just looking at your comments for a
moment uh YouTube done for now
I'll talk to you later bye
