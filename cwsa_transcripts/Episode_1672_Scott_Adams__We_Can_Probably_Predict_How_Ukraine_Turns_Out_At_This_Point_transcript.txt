good morning everybody
and congratulations for making it here
whether you're live or
potentially
your time delayed
still it's quite an accomplishment
and i hope the rest of your day goes as
swimmingly as this did because you
nailed it you nailed it
and if you'd like to take it up a level
probably do
you seem like that kind of people you're
the kind of people who are not satisfied
with a normal life no you need the
simultaneous sip and all you need for
that is a copper bungee glass i tanker
tell us this time to canteen joker flask
vessel of any kind
fill it with your
favorite
beverage
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
it's called the dopamine hit of the day
everybody's calling it that
and uh it's a simultaneous step and it's
happening now go
ashlyn oregon says hi well hello ashland
that is so good of you
well
um
today i lost all respect for myself
um
and
i know i know you were already there i'm
just catching up with the rest of you
but i have to say as recently as last
week
i still maintain a shred of respect
for myself
may not have been warranted
but it was there
as of today i can confess that i've lost
all respect for myself
and uh i welcome you to join me if
you're not already there
and here's the reason
i feel like we're all monetizing the
misery of the ukrainian people
as well as the
russian people at this point
and
you know it starts out you're just
talking about it because it's the
important thing to talk about
am i right
like in the beginning it makes complete
sense it's morally and ethically
appropriate
people want to be informed
but then
then it kind of quickly morphs into
just merging with your business model
you know because my
part of what i do here is monetized by
ads on on youtube
and i'm thinking
you know i got here innocently
but i think i drifted into this
situation where
i like
billions of people around the earth
already
are sort of dehumanizing the ukrainians
almost looking at it like it's a movie
or it's an entertainment or something
and i'm i'm not joking
i feel actually disgusted
with myself
and
i'm not joking
if you want to feel the same way about
me
i can't talk you out of it
because here we are
but what do we do about it
do i just stop talking about it
i mean
i'm not sure that's really a solution
so we press on and i guess i'll try to
be helpful
i don't know if i can find some way to
be helpful to somebody
i guess i'll flail around for that
but um i just want you to know i'm
terribly uncomfortable
um
talking about something so horrible
like in the form of entertainment
i don't know what to do about it
honestly
because i don't think you want me to
stop or you wouldn't be here
and i don't feel like stopping
but it's terribly wrong so if if
somebody comes up with a better way to
handle this
please let me know all right
here's a little uh news bubble test
i gave people on twitter i think many of
you passed it but i was wondering what
people outside
of
your bubbles would say
and here's what i said now
because i don't want to get banned from
youtube
i don't have to worry about locals of
course but i don't want to be banned by
youtube
so i'm going to say it this way
this week
we heard reports
i'm not saying it's true
but we heard reports
that there were election irregularities
in wisconsin
and
uh the if if those turned out to be true
then trump was probably right about the
2020 election now we also heard about
the zuckerberg money that went into the
battleground states we heard about
recently
that some of that looks like it was
illegal
which actually would look like a rigged
election in
some people's you know definition of
what that would mean
so in the last week trump has been
we can't say for sure
but
certainly the reporting has turned
to more like he's right then he's wrong
the biggest thing in the country for the
last you know year and a half
and the entire narrative
turned directions
and i don't think most people heard
about it
do you do how many democrats do you
think
know
that wisconsin
has got a lot of questions to answer
and that zuckerberg is
being accused or at least the money
you know whatever happened i don't know
the individuals but
at least the how the money was used
looks like a crime at this point
hasn't been proven in court
but the reporting is just sort of
i don't know it's kind of weird isn't it
now
we also see that there was more
reporting in the past week
that trump was right about climate
change being a hoax
now not in the sense that the science is
necessarily wrong
because i think the science
probably gets at least the part
about humans warming the planet i think
they probably get that right just so you
know where i'm at in this conversation
right i think they get that right i
don't think they get right
how bad it will be because they can't
predict
technological changes and all kinds of
stuff like that so i think they'll be
terribly wrong about the outcome of it
but i think the world is getting warmer
just seeing you know that's just
background for
this conversation
but we learned that um a lot of the
the opinion
about
uh nuclear power
was driven by russian propaganda
so a lot of the fear of
nuclear
power
literally was funded by
russians
so that they could sell more energy and
we wouldn't become energy independent
with nuclear energy
so indeed
you know i'm not going to say trump was
right when he said it was a chinese hoax
because who knows what he was including
in that
but i think the reporting should at
least acknowledge
that the way the way the country is
responding to
climate change is literally based on a
hoax a russian hoax
about the dangers of
of nuclear
and that the russians were pushing
we're pushing everybody to go green
because if you went green you still
needed a lot of oil
and gas
so the greater they could make you the
more dependent you would be on gas and
oil
which is so cynical and so right at the
same time
anyway
and i didn't see much of that in the
general news
and certainly trump was completely right
about energy policy we do see that in
the news and the right but i don't think
the people on the left are hearing it do
you think democrats are hearing
you know
if trump
had gotten what he wanted which was
energy independence
from
you know the
russian oil we'd at least be moving in
that direction a lot faster
but you don't see him getting credit for
that
so the number of things that trump was
completely right about
or so right that you need to at least
update the story
right
he's not completely right about some of
this stuff
yet who knows but
but he's right enough
that you do need to update i think if
you're being honest about it
but
the news bubbles will keep that from
happening
um and of course we all like to play
wwthd which is what would trump have
done
what would trump have done with this
ukraine situation
well we don't know
but
definitely putin and trump had a
different relationship
and trump was definitely a deal maker
and a practical person and an anti-war
person
i feel like we would have been in a
different place
maybe worse
right you can't really predict these
things
but i feel like
trump would have said
something like
if the only issue is you don't want nato
uh in ukraine
if that's the only issue
i'm going to call your bluff
i'll call your bluff
and say yeah we won't put nato in
ukraine
and then see if putin withdraws his
forces
because that was the obvious play
the obvious play was to just call his
bluff and say yeah actually
now that we're surrounded by your entire
military
okay
we will sign a document that says that
ukraine will never be in nato
and it wouldn't mean anything because
you could always just tear it up if you
change your mind later
we could have do you think that trump
would not have thought of the idea
of giving putin nothing but a piece of
paper
just to see if it calls his bluff and
that he withdraws his is military
he might
i mean it was the obvious play
so obvious
and you know i think trump would have
done it but of course we you know when
you're playing
what would trump have done it's just
guessing nobody knows that
now the other possibility is that trump
would have uh
used the same trick that uh putin is
using
which is fear persuasion you know i've
got some nukes
you know maybe maybe you better not be
helping ukraine cause i've got these
russian nukes have i mentioned that i
have nukes so right so putin is doing a
really good you know job of persuading
and
so far our response to that has been
what is being called the adult response
where we're
confirming that we're not escalating any
of our nuclear alerts
so instead of meeting him you know
nuclear tit-for-tat we're like oh no no
you don't have to worry about that we're
not even playing that game
that might be that might be exactly the
right way to play this
it might be
i don't know that trump would have
played it this way
i think because trump always does it
whatever you think he's going to do he
ends up doing something different which
is part of part of why he was effective
at a lot of stuff
i think trump would have offered to
annihilate the entire russian army
and he would have sold the threat
i think you would have sold it and he
would have sold it because you're never
quite sure what trump would do
now i feel safe that he wouldn't do
crazy warlike things because that was so
opposite his personality
he was very anti-war
but
i definitely think he could have
convinced russia that he would have done
it
and i think there was still plenty of
you know
let's say plenty of runway to back off
from the nuclear war you know if the
threat didn't work
you still had you know it wasn't like
putin was going to launch
so
i don't know i think a deal maker could
have made this work
a better persuader could have made
something work
somebody who had a
who had shown more respect to putin in
the past
might have come in handy
this might have been exactly the time
that somebody had more of a
let's say let's say an ego-free
relationship with putin
it might have been exactly the right
person at the right time you never know
you never know i'm not going to claim
that trump would have done a better job
we don't know that
but it would look different i think we
could say that for sure
and since what we're doing now doesn't
seem to be working
i don't know that doing it differently
would have been worse
maybe it just would have been another
thing that didn't work you never know
all right
so
uh there's some fake news about lindsey
graham today
so lindsey graham i guess called for
the russian people to take out their own
leader
presumably through assassination
some in the social media sphere are
framing that as
lindsey graham calling for outside
powers
to maybe assassinate putin
which would be a big problem
but he didn't say that
which would be crazy
he did he did say that the russian
people might have to take care of it and
it's the only way out
which is actually just a statement of
fact it's persuasion
because you can tell that he's trying to
put that idea in their heads
so i think anybody who
i know i didn't have the same bad
reaction to this that a lot of people
did
did you
how many of you think that lindsey
graham if you if you judge this only
from a persuasion
perspective
that he just wants to put that seed of a
thought in the russian public
mistake or not a mistake what do you
think
mistake or not a mistake
i think most people are saying a mistake
right
i'm gonna i'm gonna say uh unclear
i'm gonna give this one a fog of horror
gray area mark
because first of all
um i know you don't like everything that
lindsey graham's ever done
but can we agree he's reasonably smart
he understands persuasion for example
i think he does
but
i don't think that this cost anything
and it might have produced something so
i think that if he says
hey we should you know
put this little idea in the russian
public's mind
it does at least make the
strategy of the united states make a
little bit more sense
you know keeping the pressure on the
russian people until the russian people
take care of it so at least that would
be an integrated coherent strategy
if you take out the part where the
russian people have to change their own
government to get out of their own pain
then what we're doing doesn't make a lot
of sense does it
you almost have to complete the whole
picture to be honest about it so in one
sense i think lindsey graham was just
being honest
the sanctions are not about changing
putin's mind the sanctions are about
changing the public's mind and the
public will change putin's mind one way
or another
i don't think that's likely to happen
frankly
do you
well
some
oh
damn it you derailed me i just saw a
question on youtube
uh what if trump and and uh trump and
putin agreed to meet
best idea i've ever heard
not a chance
as long as biden's president that's not
going to happen
but it would be
i i think it could work
am i crazy
well yeah i am
crazy and uninformed
but
the the thing that trump brings to every
situation is shaking the box
no matter where he goes
you start thinking about the whole
situation differently as soon as as soon
as you added that variable the trump
variable
so if our situation is that we're stuck
everybody's
trapped and and the only logical outcome
of everybody being trapped in their
position is that lots of ukrainian
citizens get killed
that's sort of where we are
what is the best strategy when everybody
is locked in their positions of doom
shake the box
shake the box you don't know what you'll
get
so that's dangerous
but it might be better than doing
nothing if you know that you're locked
into a position of doom
yeah maybe you don't shake it so hard
but i'm going to say that lindsey
graham's
call for the russian people
to take care of their own government is
really just a statement of the obvious
that that's really the point of the
sanctions because nobody thinks that
putin himself
is going to change things do they
do they think putin's going to say oh
look at my suffering country
i think i'll help them out
i mean i do think he probably has
empathy for his own country like i'm not
so
i'm not so brainwashed that i think
putin doesn't love his own country or
the people in it i think he does
all right
um
so i'm going to give lindsey graham a uh
a passing grade on this i know this is
going to be unpopular but i think he
didn't say anything that isn't obvious
he did complete the strategy from why
the sanctions could work i don't think
they will but at least it gives you a
path that they might
it might make things worse i'm not even
saying it's a good strategy to change
change leadership you get somebody worse
maybe the nuclear weapons become
unstable i mean it could be really
really bad
uh but at least it's consistent
so the law of unintentional consequences
is at play again uh elon musk
issued a warning on twitter
that starlink the system that he has
provided to the ukrainians so that they
could have some communication
it's now the only non-russian
communication system that's still
working and you could in some parts of
ukraine
not all of it but in some parts
and he warns that if that's the only
communication system being used
it can be identified digitally and
targeted
and he's literally saying don't stand
near one
did he did he hear that
elon musk who provided these starlink
you know the ground-based uh
components
he says don't let people stand near them
because they're probably going to
attract missiles
that's i didn't see that common did you
so then the other thing that i would
worry about is i don't know how hackable
it is
but even uh even musk seemed to see
think that you know everything's
hackable i guess
so what happens if all of the vital
communication that the ukrainian
military is doing
what if it's over one network
where all of the hackers can concentrate
all of their hacking
and do you think russia already can hear
every communication of the ukrainian
resistance
if the only thing they have to use is
starlink
doesn't russia know exactly what they're
saying by now
or is it not hackable in in that fashion
maybe it's hackable if you want to take
it down
but i don't know if it's hackable in the
encryption sense
i don't know
so that's the law of unintentional
consequences it could be the star link
i'm not saying this will happen
but
the starling could be the thing that
finishes the resistance
it could be the thing that saves them
but even musk is saying watch out you
know this could work the other way
i'd take that pretty seriously
all right rasmussen did a poll asking
american adults
if they think the russian invasion of
ukraine is likely to hurt the american
economy
and three quarters of american adults
think it would
what do you think
let's do short term and long term short
term is easy
short term it hurts the american economy
everybody agrees with that right
basically everybody's economy is going
to hurt there'll be individual companies
that maybe make money but everybody's
economy is going to work
now
you can't be a good economist if you
only look at the short term what about
the long term
what if
what if the outcome of this
is that russia gets bled dry
economically by trying to
hold and control ukrainian which looks
almost impossible at this point
i mean they can conquer it
but to really keep it pacified is going
to be so expensive i don't know how
they'll do it
now at the same time they've got the
sanctions but they've got the
workarounds we don't know if the
workarounds will beat the sanctions or
if new sanctions will beat the
workaround it's sort of a case of good
pitching beats good behind
and vice versa
so probably that's going to be a back
and forth for a while
but in the long run
what if what happens in the long run is
uh it makes russia
less competitive
that could happen
what if it makes russia just a smaller
country
smaller economy
because they just can't break out of the
the sanctions enough
to grow
they might survive but maybe they can't
grow well that would
defund their military eventually
and they would become less of a threat
over time
right
so
could it be
that our uh
our people in let's say the cia
i'm sure they've done every kind of
prediction and estimate about this
do you think our cia is whoever does
their economic predictions because they
must have somebody doing that
do you think the cia's economists
believe that this is a good long-term
investment
to
to basically make sure that russia gets
bled dry in the war instead of just
letting them win easily
because we could have gotten out of the
way
nato could have you know not let weapons
in
could have not supported him
and it would have you know probably been
a quicker job
and
i don't know worse for the ukrainian
people
maybe maybe not worse i don't know
you can't tell
but
um i'm not so sure
if i had to guess
and i would remind any new people here i
do have a degree in economics i've got
an mba from a
top school
but you know your qualifications aren't
going to be really too helpful
in doing this kind of
analysis because there's no data you
could rely on
and none at all
so you're really just guessing based on
general kinds of
you know
truths a general truth if you're at war
you're probably not going to prosper as
much you it's sort of a general truth
i feel in general
that this could russia for
decades
economically
and maybe the u.s gets some advantage
from that maybe our energy company is
something i don't know
but uh i don't i don't think it would
have been a good idea as a purely
economic investment but it's unknown how
that's going to go for us
but let me give you an update on ukraine
here's what's new and i'm going to prime
you for my predictions to come because i
think we we know enough
that we can make a reasonable prediction
about the end game
what do you think
before i give you before i get to my
predictions
do you think we know enough now where we
can kind of reasonably assume
uh what the end game looks like
most of you say no okay good i want to
change your mind
so i i'm gl well somebody was saying yes
actually
that's a mix all right we'll see how we
do but here's some uh i'm gonna prime
you first
so i guess uh putin is securing land
bridges and ocean access which is a you
know sort of a war talk way of saying
that putin's military is sort of
surrounding and enveloping everything
that matters
so while he's not crushing everything in
ukraine right away
he is basically
almost already
surrounded
everything that matters
so
that's not good
there was attack on a nuclear plant it
was the fire was not part of the
it was a related building but it wasn't
critical
uh it sounded worse than it was but the
russians have control of that now
apparently that's a war crime
attacking a nuclear facility is
literally a war crime
and could have been could have been
really really bad depending on what
happened there but it wasn't so far
um
let's see what else is due
we've got um
here's the persuasion war update
would you say that zelinski is still
winning the persuasion war
i'd say so
i mean he's doing a great job
i don't think anything we're seeing out
of ukraine is real
like it's
all of the anecdotes are are just not
real
and everything you think about zelinski
are you starting to look like a hero
angel kind of a creature
you know what that's making me think
i'm starting to suspect the opposite
isn't ukraine supposed to be the most
corrupt government
or one of them it's like one of the most
corrupt governments now brazil zelensky
was probably an anti-corruption guy
right but are there any reports that
zalenski himself is dirty
because i've never seen one have you
i've never seen any any suggestion that
he personally was
corrupt
but there always is i guess every leader
gets that
um
okay i'm seeing some people say yes what
what are the odds
that it's just two corrupt
regimes fighting each other and we
should just get out of the way
i mean that's one way to look at it
that's not my opinion but that's one way
to look at it
all right um
so zielinski
i don't know that he's the angel hero
that he's made out to be but he's
definitely winning the persuasion war
just on the basis of persuasion he's
totally selling the story
um he seems to be rallying the country
to put up a fight so i guess he's
completely succeeding there
uh interestingly
the biggest push against at least the
u.s
provoking any uh escalation of a war
especially with u.s assets or people
are the independents on social media
are you following that they're
you know you you know all the names you
follow a lot of the same people
but there are some big voices on social
media who are
pushing very hard
to not be dragged into war by stupid
narratives and fake news and
every other provocation
and i feel like that is such a valuable
yeah cervich greenwald possabic
tucker carlson
yeah so those are the ones you're seeing
the most um
somebody says jessie kelly jimmy dore
barnes
yeah
colonel mcgregor
yeah so you've seen lots of people
pushing for no war and i think that's
that's pretty healthy
but here's one way to look at it
if putin is right
that historically speaking ukraine and
russia are the same country
did we just provoke
or trek putin into attacking his own
country
because he thinks ukraine is his own
country
he's actually at war with his own
country
and i think
i mean that's obviously not what
the ukrainians believe or the united
nations
so there's a lot of people on the other
side of that conversation like almost
everybody
but
it is an absurd situation that he
actually is at war with his own country
and i believe that the west
provoked him to do that which is
i don't know you have to wonder how much
of that was intentional
so we hear the nato rejected air cover
one way to look at that is hey nato uh
definitely doesn't want any part of this
war with russia that's not how i
interpret it
here's how i interpret nato rejects
providing air cover
i do think that's real and that they
will continue to reject air cover
but i think their public pronouncement
of it
is air cover for the fact
that they're already way too involved
if you know what i mean
for some reason russia and the united
states have evolved this idea
that you can do anything to each other
if you can lie about it successfully
and and fool at least somebody
like it doesn't even have to be a good
lie
it's like
cyber attacks
i don't know what you're talking about
what was cyber attacks
i i'd like to see that proof
right so then the cyber attacks are
going full strength probably both
directions right
how about uh
spies
spies
what
you you think the us has spies in our
embassy in russia what do you think the
russians have spies
what
so we just do this stupid thing
where if you can lie about it
successfully
it doesn't count as war
somehow like how did we drift into that
stupid situation
but
so here's something that nobody could
sell
which is if nato provided air cover for
ukraine
you couldn't sell that as anything else
am i right
it can't be sold
as something else it would 100 be
reported by all
all observers that nato had provided air
cover if it happened
so that's when they can't sell
so they they say that one publicly
that's our position
and it sort of draws attention away from
the fact
that somebody's providing all this
material support and intelligence and
weapons logistics transport sales
i don't think those
i haven't heard anybody else say this
but i don't think ukrainians are
operating all those drones
i'm sorry
i just don't believe it
i believe that however many ukrainian
drone pilots there ever have been
that the number of drones has now
increased beyond the number of trained
ukrainian drone pilots
what do they do
wait until they're trained
i don't think so
i i think that on paper they just say
okay you're resigning from nato and now
you're ukrainian for a week
and then the same guy who was sitting in
the chair working for nato
is just a ukrainian volunteer for a week
and he's just doing the same job
now i have no no evidence of that
no evidence of that whatsoever but it
falls into the category of things which
you could successfully lie about
so it's fair
right uh
we think nato is secretly running those
drones i don't know what you're talking
about
show me the evidence
sure there are drones
but uh it's all ukrainians
ukrainians
it's ukrainians all the way down
no evidence otherwise
so if you can sell the lie
i think you do it
so there's really two wars going on
one is all the stuff we're doing and
mutually lying about and then there's a
stuff on the surface that you can't lie
about
so you don't lie as much although putin
did a pretty good job of i'm not going
to invade
you know what
you know what i wonder about in terms of
how to treat russia after this is done
it's almost as if the real punishment
should be the lying
have you ever had this standard for
anything it's like
okay i don't mind that you broke
something in my house
i really hate that you lied about it
you know what i mean
like
countries go to war and it's of course
the biggest human tragedy
but
if you're going to hold somebody
responsible for something forever
you should hold putin responsible for
saying he wasn't going to attack
and you should use that justification
and that only to ban russia from all
business and commerce
because business and commerce requires
that you do what the you say you're
gonna do
and the first time you don't do it you
get a bad yelp review you know what i
mean
and i think they're in the in addition
to um
the way we talk about it is that we're
sanctioning russia
for their military aggression
which is literally what we're doing a
more productive persuasive way to do it
is to say that russia is no longer um
suitable for business
and you just say look these are separate
issues there's a war we have to deal
with that
we've got to get people safe etc
but separately
you have a you have people in place who
will say the exact opposite of what
they're going to do and you can't do
business with anybody under those
conditions
so russia we're not at war with you
but if you can find a way to become
credible in the future which might
require a regime change
but we'll wait
you know no rush you know you don't have
to go all lindsey graham about it
if you'd like to wait 30 years and just
wait till
putin's go on and try again and get a
trustworthy
you know government we're waiting for
you we'll be happy to work with you we
would like to work with you russia
so remember how trump treated north
korea
we want to do business with you
we would love to help you
you know rebuild
we'll invest and we can get people to
invest in your country just stop
pointing rockets at us
that's a way more
productive way to
to negotiate just say look you've got
you've got a business problem your
business problem is that you can't be
trusted for anything
we'll help you fix it
we can help you fix that
we'll give you a series of steps that
would rebuild your credibility
don't think you're going to do them
but you could at least we'll give you a
path out
so
um i always look for ways to d to take
the emotions out of these things if you
if you think you'll ever need to
negotiate anything and just say look you
got a bad yelp review and
that's separate from the fact that we
got a war going on
so here is my
um
ukraine prediction nato rejecting air
cover
is a very clear signal that nato is not
going to play to win
am i right
if nato ever meant to play to win
they would be considering nato air cover
so now nato has said we do not plan to
win
who thinks that the ukrainian
resistance
can just flat-out win
i don't think anybody right
there are definitely lots of people who
think they could hang on indefinitely
you know in an afghanistan potential way
i don't think so actually
uh uh afghanistan at least had you know
this
you spread out territory and it was hard
to know where anybody was and who was
with who and all that i feel like
in a modern society as soon as russia
has control over all the communications
i think they can control the country
a lot i've heard a lot of people saying
no there's no way they could ever
control them because the
resistance will just be well armed and
fight to the last person
until the only way to communicate is
through russian technology
at which point
i think russia can actually know who's
doing what everywhere
and crush the resistance over time
but it will take time
so i think that uh at this point the
money if you follow the money
uh
and you follow let's say the psychology
of it
we've put putin in a position where he
can't
lose in ukraine
in other words we've guaranteed that
there will be nothing to stop him
militarily
and we've decided we've decided he's a
war criminal
that's a trap
the trap is that he has no other no
other option
but to conquer ukraine and somehow try
to make it work
that's it
because he can't be a war criminal
follow along he can't be a war criminal
and lose in ukraine
he can't do both
that i mean that would guarantee his end
or it would feel like it would guarantee
it
which would be bad enough
he could probably survive being called a
war criminal by everybody except you
know china and his good friends and
everybody in russia
who wants to say it out loud anyway he
can survive that
but i don't know if he can survive
starting a war in ukraine
losing a war in ukraine
also being a war criminal
having his entire economy destroyed in
the process
i mean i don't think he could survive
that so he basically has one path which
is to destroy as much of ukraine as it
takes
whatever it takes
as long as it takes
and it looks like that's exactly what he
plans to do
now
here's your second economic prediction
question
in the short run it's terrible for
russia economically
no debate there
in the long run
could this work out for putin
maybe not putin but let's say maybe the
leader after that
could it be
an actual
rational investment as evil as it is and
tragic
because here's the things there are the
things i'm learning about ukraine that i
didn't
know until
today in some cases
apparently they have vast natural
resources including rare minerals
and their vast natural resources have
not been exploited as much as they could
so if russia took over ukraine with its
superior
energy production facilities
it would secure its pipelines
it would have way more resources
it would have you know demonstrated its
resolve which probably helps it
in other future things because people
like be like okay we don't want to mess
with russia they they pull down all the
stops and always do
yeah they would get rid of the
launch base in ukraine they would feel
safer
so
if you add a ton of people to russia
which also had a population problem
it would be one way for russia to grow
its population which is actually really
healthy you know the more people you
have
as long as they have jobs
the more power your country has because
bigger tax base blah blah blah
so
scott are you pivoting to a russian win
let me get to that's that's the right
question
so
let's say win in the context of
economics
in the context of economics because that
would allow
two possibilities one is there's a
forever resistance but it doesn't stop
ukraine from you know being a country
that
or being a region of russia that
produces good economies
so here's let's so give me your
prediction
is uh is taking ukraine at any human
cost
because that's part of the economics is
what is what the public thinks about it
forever you know because you don't want
to
destroy a part of your own country and
then have to live with that that's going
to be pretty dangerous
but in the long run
would russia come out ahead
economically if they got full control of
ukraine
your answers are
i'm seeing yeses no's yeses
yeses
i'm seeing most yeses
now
do you think that uh
the united states and the west
could make that not the case
in some way could we make it so
expensive that it would never be
economical
meaning that ukraine just would always
have armed resistance
and every time you tried to build
anything in ukraine
somebody in the west
funded somebody to blow it up
my guess is
that all of the bad feelings about
russia
can last no more than
i'm going to put a number on it
with or without putin in power
now if he were to leave power
sooner
then i think russia's reputation could
improve depending on who goes in there
sooner but let's say let's say putin
stays alive
lives a long life
i feel like it's a
15-year
at the most
could be
could be 10 years could be five
before people who need to buy their
stuff just say you know we just need to
buy your stuff because we just need
energy
and
the ukraine thing is over there wasn't
anything we can do then there's nothing
we could do now we're just going to buy
your energy because it's the cheapest
most available we don't have options
yeah
so i think it's very likely
that in 10 years
russia will look like it made a good
investment
what do you think
in 10 years
will it look like it was a good
investment from russia's perspective
seeing yeses and no's but a lot of yeses
more more yeses
um
i've seen mostly well okay a mix on
youtube
yeses and those
now let's take let's take uncertainty as
one of our variables
would you make this investment let's say
you didn't care about human tragedy
because you're a monster
would you make as an economic investment
would you make this investment given the
uncertainty
here's what i think
i feel like in the long run
however long that long run is
having control of ukraine has to be
economically positive for russia
maybe not in 10 years
maybe not in 20
maybe not in 50
but in 100 years
yeah i mean if they can hold it for 100
years yeah
yeah it's a good investment
unfortunately
so
if we assume that putin doesn't seem to
care about the human loss we see
examples that make that case
then he's just making a good investment
and he's also trapped into completing
his investment at this point
so
while i did predict
that russia would have way more trouble
than
they thought and i think that's been the
case because the the quality of the
weapons the ukrainians would have access
to
now i don't know if there were any
secret weapons but i'll bet there were
what do you think
secret in the sense that the russians
didn't see it coming
what do you think i think maybe
you know or maybe elements of existing
weapons and known weapon systems were
you know better than we thought or had
more features than we thought or
something like that
so i think i think russia got some
surprises by the weapons themselves just
guessing i don't know
but i would say at this point ukraine
doesn't really have a chance of staying
independent
and
um
you know i i don't even know what to say
about that i mean it's so awful
it's i guess it's literally beyond words
because i don't
i don't lose the ability to talk about
things very often but as soon as it came
out of my mouth i didn't even know what
to say about it it's just so awful
and
but all of the outcomes look awful at
this point
we're choosing among awful outcomes
so i don't even know if i should wish
for a speedy
or a slow victory by russia because it
kind of looks inevitable at this point
and the inevitability is based entirely
on the fact that putin wants it more
he wants it more than nato wants to stop
it and only nato can stop it
is that fair could could you break it
down to just that
putin wants it more than nato
and that's it
nato is not even going to put up a a
proper fight
so if one side's fighting
like it's the most important thing ever
which putin is at this point we forced
him to do that
you know where where he is at this point
i mean it's by his own actions
plus our actions but the combination of
his actions plus our actions
force him to win
he's forced to win i don't know if he
has a choice
now
i do think that the russian army
is going to have insane losses
i do think that that that column
well let me give you another variable
that's possible
do you think the ukrainians have ever
asked for
some kind of warthogs or whatever the
air the aircraft are
that strafe and destroy entire columns
of enemy stuff a-10 is it the a-10
do you think the ukrainians have
requested those
because you'd only need
five of them
to
take out the entire russian column
am i wrong
i think you'd only need five of them
because let's say you lose three
the other two can just finish the job
they might have to reload a few times
so
so here's my question
if nato said they're rejecting air cover
but at some point i think there was
discussion of
extra aircraft being
provided
but i don't know by whom
so here's my question
could
somebody i guess would be the united
states or if somebody had used ones i
suppose some other country could sell
the ones that they bought from the
united states but could somebody provide
in the next few days
uh
aircraft that would take out entire
russian columns
i feel like
nato saying that they wouldn't provide
air cover
is kind of saying that they're not going
to fight
like that
in other words they're not going to
fight to win so what would be the point
of taking out the russian column
there wouldn't be a military or economic
benefit with her
i don't see one
so i think nato has already tapped out
frankly
and that's
that predicts the end
now
um
and the best bet that the united states
has
in europe i suppose
is to make sure that it's a pyrrhic
victory
how many of you are so well educated
that when i say it will be a pyrrhic
victory
you say to yourself i know exactly what
that means you cartoonist you
right
um typically i like to speak at a sixth
grade level
because that's actually just good
communication style as soon as you get
above six sixth grade
you know a third of your audience at
least
is gonna miss a word and not know what
you said
a pyrrhic victory
means you won the battle
but you were so degraded in the fight
that you you know you're worse off than
if you hadn't won the battle or if you
hadn't had the battle i guess so it's
possible that russia will take ukraine
but the united states and the west will
keep the sanctions on so
so extraordinarily hard that they lose
in the long run
but i don't think they can lose in the
20 to 50 year range
if they're thinking that long
probably not
all right um
and the most uh
here here's what the people on twitter
who i polled so this is unscientific
twitter poll
i asked what are the odds of russia's
move into ukraine
being economical
now here's why i think this poll might
be the only useful one ever on twitter
because a non-scientific poll
probably misleads as much as it informs
that's why you have
you know good polls so you don't do that
but if you're asking the question what
would
the average person think about a
situation a poll could be actually kind
of handy
because you you might surprise yourself
so i asked what are the odds that russia
will find it economical in the long run
to go into ukraine and uh or what are
the odds of it being economical and your
answers were
if you answered it uh only 29 thought it
was a high chance of being economical
23 thought medium but fifty performs
fifty four percent
thought it had the low odds of being
economical
fifty four percent is roughly the number
of people who don't understand economics
at any level whatsoever
because i'm pretty sure it's economical
you just have to wait for it
in in the short run it could be like
horrible i mean the russian economy
could really be taken to crap for 10
years it's possible
but in the long run unfortunately i
think it's just guaranteed to be
profitable
so um
and then the most important thing i
heard is that ben shapiro watched the
new batman batman movie and said it's
bad
that is the least surprising tweet
of the year
because
if you haven't noticed all movies are
bad now
all movies are bad
there's just no such thing as a good
movie anymore documentaries are still
good i still like some of the the ones
based on real life things
like the elton john movie the one about
queen
those are great
but as soon as a movie has to be fiction
then i don't know if it's egos or
con
contractual
you know who has the edit edit rights i
don't know what's wrong
but
today movies are nothing but two or
three hours of discomfort
and boredom
i can barely remember when movies were
good
now there are a number of factors making
this true one is that other things
cater to short attention spans so we've
been trained to have short attention
spans that's one
the other thing is that people have
gravitated away from big screens toward
little ones
which changes the whole nature of you
know movie watching in a negative way
and we also watch movies individually
i used to like watching movie even if i
didn't like the movie
because i'd watch it with other people
and i liked the popcorn and the
experience and then you would talk about
it afterwards about how bad the movie
was and you'd have some drinks and it
was all fun
but if everybody's just watching it on
their own while they're
you know
doing something else
you don't have any kind of a shared
experience and you don't even get the
popcorn you don't even get out of the
house
so
a lot about the movie business is bad
but one of the worst things
is that the cgi is so good
i have to tell you some of you are not
old enough to
know what this felt like but i'll bet
most of you are
do you remember how you felt when you
saw the first star wars movie
in the comments tell me how that felt
like when you saw the first one
it just blew your head off didn't it
now if you were to watch that first one
by today's standards
it would be
you know lame and
you can see strings on the ships and i
mean it just looks pretty lame by
today's standards
but now let's say you watch the most you
know excellently done
cgi
sci-fi or
like one of the marvel movies
are you still blown away by the special
effects
nope the special effects are so good
that they eliminated the oh wow factor
because any any well-funded movie is
going to have the same perfect looking
effects
so
so one of the biggest reasons to be
amazed by the movies
was you would see something on the
screen that you would say that had to be
hard to do
like wow
why can't everybody do that let's like
if you take even the
gone with the wind
gone with the wind
for its time was you know cinematically
beautiful you know big screen and you
know the whatever
movie technology they were using to make
the color it was all great was it black
and white originally and then got
colorized
i forget
but
um so a lot of what made movies good is
gone our attention spans are shorter
and
the movies i think are shittier
i don't think i'm wrong about that i
think that the movies are too long
maybe there's a reason for that maybe
you can sell more advertisements or
maybe it
fits into
streaming better or something i don't
know but
they're way too long compared to older
movies they're poorly written they're
predictable there's always a chase scene
there's always somebody
tied to a chair and tortured
it's just the same movie over and over
again it's a i think it's a dead art
what do you think do you think movies
are dead i i literally think
they just don't have a future
in their current form i mean if they
changed quite a bit then yes
you know what maybe maybe uh
virtual reality is the next
because you should get to the point
where you can be in the movie
i've described this before
but imagine taking a history lesson
where you're actually on the battlefield
like the soldiers are just running past
you and
um or
or you actually you know once you want
to replay january 6th
so in american history what if you could
actually be in the capital of rotunda
when the the guy with the uh
you know the horns
walks through because we have enough
video that you could actually create an
entire
virtual reality
that you would feel you were there
now of course you have too much
subjectivity about
who was being violent where but you
could recreate that entire event and you
could learn about it in school by
walking around the rotunda
and fast forwarding it and seeing the
people go by seeing the battles with the
police
maybe at the same time seeing
news reports or the president's speech
how about this
imagine a vr environment
in which you can simultaneously fast
forward and reverse the actual events
while you're in them
like they're actually walking people are
walking around you you're following the
crowd into the capitol
and at the same time you can call up a
tv screen that'll float in front of you
that shows the pre president trump's
speech
in real time
like matched
matched to the actual goings-on
in front of the capitol so you can see
when the fence went down
you can see when the security seems to
seem to lapse
you can see when people got more violent
if that happened i don't know if it did
and then time it to the homicide events
i mean that's what learning will be
in just a few years
i told you that a few years ago i
already i did a tour inside the
hindenburg
you know the airship that caught on
firing was a disaster
there's a virtual reality program
where you can go inside the crew
quarters and walk around it had a
smoking room
a cigarette smoking room a little
ashtrays there you can walk around you
can walk into the control room to see
how they flew it
look down at the controls
you can you can go into the
infrastructure within the balloon
and see like the framing and everything
that's what that's what education looks
like in a few years
imagine learning to be a
imagine learning to be a
car mechanic
in 10 years
you're going to walk into the virtual
reality
you'll see the car engine in front of
you floating
and then while you're watching it it
will disassemble
into each of its component parts
will be described and then each one will
be you know brought back you can see how
it acts and you'll see each part you
know rotated and why it does what it
does
you would learn everything about an
engine
in about seven minutes
and you could be
you could be like a trained mechanic
seven minutes
and because if you saw a problem
you could just put that problem into
your computer
and be in the virtual reality and say ah
that problem is this component usually
but sometimes this component
and stick your stick your
your monitor into this hole
it'll just be easy
i mean you could learn an entire
skill in a few minutes you know with the
with the ongoing boost
all right so much
for that
my prediction unfortunately is not the
happiest one
but i think
anyway how many how many
agreed with my general prediction
that at this point putin has to take all
of ukraine there's there's no
there's no backing out at this point
i see yeses and nose all right well
that's all i got for today i've got to
go do some other stuff and i will talk
to you
tomorrow
