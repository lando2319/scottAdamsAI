to do
good morning everybody and welcome to
coffee with Scott Adams the highlight of
human civilization
and if you think it was going to be good
I mean even before you signed in here
wow
it's gonna be so good and all you need
is a cup of mug or glass a tanker
jealous of Stein a canteen Joker flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparalleled pleasure of
the dopamine the other day the thing
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens now
ah
delightful
all right let's talk about all the news
that's fun and exciting today is one of
those the news is more funny
and you know interesting than tragic
I don't like the tragic news so we're
going to skip all the tragedies and just
talk about the fun stuff
um do you remember that I told you that
I could feel the zeitgeist
telling me that camping was going to be
really big this year
does anybody remember me saying that I
invested don't do what I did this is not
a recommendation but I bought some stock
in a camping company
because I just had this I just had this
overwhelming feeling
and I don't know why exactly the camping
was going to be good
now here's the persuasion reasoning
the persuasion reasoning is every time
you turn on the news they're showing
homeless encampments
and they're always camping
and it looks and if you have the same
reaction I do it's like oh I feel so
sorry for those homeless people they
have to be in those awesome tents and
then I think what is a nice tent
it is a nice tent
and there's part of me
that envies them
does anybody had that feeling at has
anybody had a little bit of an
irrational feeling that you envy the
street people because they're living
free they're living life on their own
terms they don't report to anybody they
don't pay any taxes they don't listen to
your rules they don't even have laws
really they just have their own little
civilization so all they do is do
amazing drugs that make them feel
incredible and then they go live in
their tent
and they're happier than you are
now I don't really want to change change
places with them but I believe it's an
objective fact that they're not doing so
poorly
if you were to look at
how much of the day a homeless person
enjoys
versus how much your day you enjoy what
do you think that would look like
I'm pretty sure they sleep in every day
so I don't know that they hate it I mean
it looks like something you would hate
if you were doing it but
I don't know there's a there's a lot of
choice involved in that but anyway the
Wall Street Journal had an article that
camping's camping is really big
so I did correctly read the Zeitgeist
camping's big this year
all right I asked this question on
Twitter just because I was curious and I
got half a million
people looked at it so I guess people
thought the same thing turned out it was
a dumb question I said Is it true that
men are not approaching women to ask for
phone numbers in person in 2023
but then I got the Boom retrievement you
know what the Boomer treatment is right
let me give you let me give you my
example of the Boomer treatment me me
asking so do men ask for women for phone
numbers
oh Boomer
oh oh Boomer
oh no they asked for their insta
or their snap
or their Tick Tock but wait no they
don't they no no
you're so old you're so old it's just
funny you're like Joe Biden times too I
mean really who asked for a phone number
anymore
and of course
my critics are right
I was dumb enough to think that people
would imagine that those were just
texting apps and that it's all kind of
the same and that they would know that
that would be included in the question
automatically however upon thinking
about it my critics are correct because
it is a lower risk to ask for somebody's
insta or SnapChat am I right
if you ask her a phone number it says
I'm probably going to call you
you're probably going to get a call from
me you're probably going to get asked
out on a date
so that's what a phone number is but if
you ask for somebody's Instagram
well
maybe they're interested I mean it kind
of seems like they are but it's very
non-committal isn't it it's like how
about why don't we just follow each
other on social media and then you know
maybe I'd have the access to your DMs
and maybe I'd send one and you know
maybe you check it and maybe you'd want
to answer and it's a lot of maybes
involved
right yeah so it's the it's the weaker
indirect
low-risk way to do it so it turns out
the question was boot because young
people in the dating world
don't need to ask for a phone call or a
phone number it's just sort of less
useful
so
I don't know that any of it matters
you know it's one of those interesting
trends that have changed but it does
suggest the following is true
I saw somebody say this on social media
sound is fine
um
I saw somebody suggest that if you were
able to walk up and ask for a woman's
phone number in 2023 you would seem to
have a superpower and you would rule the
Earth like a god
because other people are doing it
so it used to be if you went up to an
attractive woman and asked for a phone
number you know you'd be the 10th person
that day and your odds would not be good
but in 2023 I'm hearing this a lot
if you ask for somebody's phone number
they're like oh my God finally finally
finally somebody had the balls to ask
for my phone number yes of course here
it is
so it looks to me like you would get a
different reaction in 2023 if you were
to ask
for a phone number all right
so as you know Elon Musk and Zuckerberg
are at least allegedly planning to have
some kind of a battle Zuckerberg of
course knows Jiu Jitsu and Lex Friedman
famous podcaster is also a jiu jitsu guy
and has wrestled with now both of them
so he's trained with Elon tried to show
him some moves and there's a picture of
him training with Zuckerberg
do you think it's going to happen
what do you think
you know I was looking at the stats of
Elon versus
Zuckerberg and I think everybody agrees
that Zuckerberg is a higher higher level
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu guy so you know if
you were fighting somebody on his same
size you know you'd expect him to win if
they were not trained but Elon is 6'2 it
weighs I don't know 230 pounds whatever
it is it's over 200 I think and
Zuckerberg has listed at five seven
and he you know his weight looks on
point so five seven weight on point is
probably like 155.
you just wait something like that I
don't know much about Brazilian Jiu
Jitsu
but can a five seven person ever beat a
six two person if you're not if you're
not punching
if you're not punching
so Brazilian Jiu Jitsu would be strong
enough
that you could you know you could get on
top of them and get the advantage
okay all right A lot of people who seem
to know what they're talking about say
that's the thing
um
I mean the the disadvantage is pretty
big but
here's the funny part there's a picture
online of Zuckerberg having Lex Friedman
in a chokehold
it it looks to me like exactly the
Chokehold that has killed two people
recently
one on a subway and one uh George Floyd
it's the exact same joke old
they do it for recreation
Recreation
and then the number of people told me oh
that's a thing when you're practicing a
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu It's Not Unusual to
choke each other out
so that you have experience being choked
out you know what it feels like it
doesn't scare you
Is that real
is that a real thing that the Brazilian
Jiu Jitsu people choke each other out
for recreation
people are saying yes that's the real
thing so
do you feel that you've been totally
gamed by the whole uh holding person
somebody in that Chokehold is going to
kill them don't you feel like you've
been kind of gamed by the the whole
system here
yeah I feel like uh
the choking is not how people are dying
I think it's the drugs but anyway we've
been over that
um
so Lex Friedman I believe he's alive but
according to the news he's dead at least
twice
um here's a uh shocking shocking poll
this one actually does shock me you know
usually when you say oh it's a big poll
I'm shocked it usually doesn't shock you
at all this one shocks me
right this is Rasmussen
66 percent of likely U.S voters are
concerned that the outcome of the 2024
presidential election will be affected
by cheating
two-thirds people
two-thirds
now do you remember back in let me take
you back to 2015
uh when there's there was this new
candidate his name was Trump trump
and uh I said oh oh watch out
I watched him just a little bit and I
could tell he was the most persuasive
person in political life
and so I warned you back in 2015. uh
he's gonna be your president you don't
see this coming his his ability to
persuade is like off the chart
and what did people say to me
you idiot oh my God oh my God would you
just stick to cartoony
oh my God this is embarrassing it's just
embarrassing you're embarrassing
yourself Scott he's not persuasive he's
not going to win more than I don't know
seven to ten percent of the primary vote
and that's the end and he's just doing
it for he's just doing it to get
attention and don't take it seriously
and I said no seriously you don't know
what's coming
the monster is right behind you like no
I thought there's no turn around turn
around it's right behind you just turn
around and look there's nothing behind
me Scott just go back to cartoon he can
calm down a little bit will you
so
Trump loses the election
claims the election claims the election
was fraudulent
time goes by
two-thirds of the public agrees with him
or at least agrees that the risk of the
next one being fraudulent is high which
would suggest that they think the last
one was maybe fraudulent right I mean
there's pretty connected ideas
so
now do you think that Trump is
persuasive
is there anybody who wants to have an
argument with me about whether Trump can
persuade the public of things two-thirds
of them now agree with him
that's way more than just Republicans
way more than just Republicans they
agree with it
going further
49 of Voters agree with the statement
quote there is no way Joe Biden got 81
million votes in the 2020 election
49 of the voters
believe 2024 or 2020 was a fake election
according to Rasmussen
49 percent
now when I said that I'm not often
shocked by a poll but this one shocks me
is anybody having that same experience
or is it just me
this is like mind-blowing I had no idea
I had no idea that the the idea of a
fixed election had gotten that much
traction now probably I'd want to see at
least one other poll
you know to see if other polls are
coming up with the same numbers because
Rasmussen is is pretty uh heavily let's
say engaged
in retweeting the you know the the voter
stuff so they're they're pretty much on
the side on this issue so I'd wait for
at least one more poll but this is
pretty shocking
all right uh so some tweets that Google
it has a habit of hiring a lot of EX
Intel people
how many you say
165 of them
so accordingly according to a tweet I
don't know I suppose this needs some
fact checking but Google's trust and
safety team is managed by three xci
agents
so 3x the CIA it's CIA agents are in
control of uh what you see
so so what is considered misinformation
is determined by three ex CIA people
X
see they're they're no longer in the CIA
but what I'm saying is the CIA does not
pay them any kind of a salary
so they're completely X as in they don't
work for them anymore
nope nope
so don't worry about that because they
don't work for him anymore
yeah the CIA there's 27 xcia people 52x
FBI 30 NSA have 50 DHS and six odni
does it look like maybe they are looking
for these people
it feels like they might be recruiting
them or they're recruiting themselves or
each other or
it's a lot
it's a lot now the other way to explain
it
would be that these are highly qualified
people and Google offers them more money
than intelligence work
it could be that they're just excellent
people have on your staff you know they
have high they're highly qualified they
know a lot about the world yeah that
sort of thing they have maybe experience
in other countries that would all be
stuff that would be insecurity and
security so that would all be stuff that
would that Google would want
so it wouldn't surprise me
that they were hiring a lot of people
from that world
but it does seem like too many doesn't
it
as in there's something going on here
that's
not exactly what it looks like
so we got questions don't we first of
all uh first of all I cannot confirm
that these numbers are correct
so before you get too excited may not
even be true I don't know but
somebody seemed pretty confident online
all right let's talk about RFK Jr
uh YouTube banned one of his videos just
took it right off
a conversation with Jordan Peterson
can you even hold that in your head that
this just happened no I just I just told
you how many X Intel people work for
Google who owns YouTube then YouTube
just took a major candidate you know one
of the biggest challenges to Biden just
took him off just removed his video
completely now they would say there was
some misinformation there or something
dangerous but do you imagine
like in your wildest dreams can you
imagine a conversation between Jordan
Peterson and RFK Jr that would literally
be dangerous
does that feel like a thing
and even if it is dangerous
aren't we allowed to see it
we're not allowed to see anything that
might be dangerous
I don't know that that's a standard when
did that become a standard there's lots
of things I look at that you know you
can make an argument could be dangerous
in one way or another but what about
that free speech and
you know letting everybody decide for
themselves business what about that
well
I think I'm aghast as most of you are
RFK Jr is a serious candidate for
president of the United States they just
took down his message
because they didn't agree with it
because what because they're all
scientists and they know it's true and
what isn't
and what if they just disagree what if
RFK Jr has his experts and maybe YouTube
has some other experts to say his
experts are wrong what makes their
experts right is wrong who gets to
decide that
do you do you get to decide which
presidential candidate we get to see
that feels pretty extreme to me
pretty extreme now let me be clear I do
not endorse all of RFK Jr's
uh let's say assertions about medical
stuff I don't know that I know them all
or that I know them with the right
Nuance the way he explains them
in the current year I don't know that
but so I haven't seen anything that he's
explained lately that I disagree with
but I'm sure there's stuff there so I'm
not saying I agree with him I'm just
saying that why in the world can't you
see it
that's insane
and
this also goes under the umbrella of
outrage fatigue
if this were the only thing that's going
on this that's you know not right with
the world we'd probably get more excited
about it but there's so much in the news
that's like this I don't even want to
like aim
goodbye all caps
and getting rid of the all caps it
doesn't matter what you say you know
what use even if you're just talking if
it's all caps it's it's a
it's distracting to the The Host
so I'll just delete everybody uses them
no matter what the purpose is okay
all right um
Nate silver was uh saying now if you
don't know Nate silver he would be you
know one of our nation's most credible
statistical polling
you know kind of the people
um he gets a lot of hate from the right
but I've been following him for a long
time and I believe his opinions are
about as close to objective as you can
get he's got some bias that sneaks in
but he's really close to objective you
know better than most so I always
recommend him as a good follower he has
good comments too on Twitter
but he said that he said this he said
there's this notion that Kennedy's doing
kind of well in the polls and he just
isn't now his polling shows Kennedy
lower than that 20 percent shows him at
like nine percent and his polling is
done well compared to other polling in
the past so maybe he's maybe he's right
on that
um you may have seen gen uh Jessica
tarloff on the Five on Fox News she
often says she has never met a Democrat
who supports RFK Jr it's just a it's
just a republican thing
she says she's never met one in the wild
like an actual human
who's a Democrat
who supports him now I say that is not
predictive
it seems like it would be right it seems
like it would be the single most
predictive thing you could ever have
but I don't think that's predictive
because as RFK Jr points out whoever
ends up being the the nominee is going
to get the Democrat vote because the
Democrats sure as hell aren't going to
vote for the Republican they're going to
take what they could get with a with a d
next to it anything they can get so he
just has to be the nominee right
but of course he's he's way way behind
by for that
so it really comes down to whether
Biden's really going to be running
you know do you believe he's really
gonna run
now you may have seen that Tucker
Carlson dropped another video
and he says that Newsome is being you
know groomed to be the last minute
replacement for Biden this is something
you've heard me say for a while now
but
what would make most sense from the
timing
those six to nine six to nine months
before the um
Democratic Convention
so in my opinion some to sometime toward
the end of the year
maybe through February will be the time
that Biden will have a sudden turn of
Health
and he's going to say well I really did
plan to run I really did but it just you
know it won't work my health is failing
and that it'll be too late for anybody
else to get serious but but Newsom will
already have been out there talking
about DeSantis Etc so he just seems like
the obvious one
who's not RFK Jr so this may be the way
to keep RFK JR out of the thing is to
stick Newsome in toward the top
now
that seems very very likely to me
but
if it's Newsom
versus RFK Jr
does he get a debate
ah now we're getting interesting aren't
we does he get a debate because Biden
can say no to a debate and the world can
say all right we don't like it
but it is at least that there's some
precedent right there is President even
even Trump is considering not debating
because you know he thinks he hasn't
locked up why do it
but if you're if you're the last minute
replacement candidate
and RFK Jr has been there campaigning
hard for over a year
how do you not debate
I mean not debating would be pretty
devastating
if you're coming in as the you know the
competitor that's not even putting in
the same work as the guy that's been
there so what happens if you put RFK Jr
in a debate with Newsom
here's what I think happens
I think RFK Jr would solve all of his
reputation problems in one night
because Newsome would say you think uh
all vaccinations are bad
and RFK Jr would say something like I've
never said that
I've never said anything like that
you're just making that up and the news
and the news is on your side you're all
just making up an opinion for me here's
my opinion they're under tested anybody
want to have an argument with that under
test it not tested to my satisfaction I
don't think they're tested to your
satisfaction here's why
that would really just change everything
because he could easily sell under
tested or or he could easily easily sell
I would like to introduce standards for
more rigorous testing
because even if you think the testing
was good
who's going to object to more rigorous
standards
oh just big farmer right that's it
but if you're if you're just a
reasonable Democrat you're listening you
hear Newsome make a claim you hear RFK
Jr call him out as a liar nope that's
not my opinion and why do you in the
news keep saying so my opinion is they
they need to be tested better and that
there's a lot of correlation stuff
that's scary enough we need to look into
it but I don't know I mean it looks like
it could be causation but I can't say
that for sure I'm saying it's scary and
you should not ignore it
he wins
he wins
I think if and there's also a contrast
problem that's really bad
what is newsom's biggest
Advantage as a politician
uh let's say he's got name recognition
and he's a tall good looking guy with
good hair
what's RFK Jr have
all of that but better
all of that all that but better he's
he's a slightly better version Newsom is
the poor man's RFK Jr
RFK JR says things that sound to me
genuine
when he talks you know who knows I mean
I'm not a mind reader right so if
there's any politician lying to me by
doing a good job of it I wouldn't know
I'd only know what they say
but when RFK Jr talks he sounds like
he's telling me the truth
as he understands it doesn't mean he's
right about everything just means it
sounds like he's telling me the truth
and means it
when Newsome talks he sounds like he's
lying
all the time
he always sounds like he's lying even
when he's not
even when he's not he just has that
slimy politician he too big of a smile
thing
all right ladies and gentlemen
uh this question from the ladies only if
you were not in a relationship which
which of those two men would you rather
go to bed with
Newsom or RFK Jr you're not in a
relationship imagine you're single and
you have the you have a shot which one
it's like solid RFK Jr right solid now
you don't think that matters
you don't think it matters that the
ladies would choose RFK Jr as a sex
partner over uh Newsome you don't think
that matters
it does
yeah all right now now here's one for
the men
you get invited to have a beer you know
alcohol is poison but let's just go with
this you're you could have a beer and
it's either with RFK Jr or it's with
Governor Newsom
who do you pick
it's not even close
one of them would be fascinating
and the other one would be Newsom
am I right one of them would be
fascinating like you would you would
just like hang on every story and
everything and the other would be just
some foolish yeah greasy guy that's got
good hair and he's tall and he's got a
tan there's just nothing there it's just
an empty suit
so the mat the matchup between RFK Jr
and Newsome is somewhat devastating for
Newsom
and then RFK Gene has the other
advantage of uh not having governed
which is weird that that's an advantage
but he doesn't have a bad track record
as a governor
newsom's going to have to explain why
you can't walk down the streets of San
Francisco and why the borders opened and
all that stuff so I I think that the
matchup is
really favorable to one
so it really comes down to I would
disagree with navy silver on this he's I
think he again I can't read his mind but
in context it looks like he's looking at
the polling as the major indicator of
what's going to happen and it usually is
yeah I would agree that in most cases
the pollings your best best way to
determine what's going to happen
but in this one weird case because
Biden's health is such really the key
variable in all of it the polling
doesn't pick up his health
so there that's sort of a blind spot I
think but we'll see
all right uh Bud Light fired its uh woke
marketing department so they the first
woman who was hired to market for a
major beer brand is now the first one
also fired
so would you consider this a sign of
peak wokeness and the wokeness is
reaching its highest level and now
there's going to be pushback
I think so to me it looks like a signal
of the end
how about the fact that uh Larry Fink
CEO of BlackRock
and the biggest Pusher of ESG has said
that he doesn't like to use ESG now
because it's embarrassing
because DeSantis made it a dirty word
it wasn't just DeSantis right he didn't
do it alone yeah DeSantis would have
never even said it except that his base
you know is solidly on the same point
the same side
so now we've got
the biggest Pusher of ESG saying I don't
even like to use the word it's so
demonized now
you've got bud life firing its wokust
marketer
and
this morning I see a tweet that a
controversial
Republican Stephen Miller
is I don't know what his involvement is
but I guess he's promoting this
non-profit American first legal it's a
hotline for American workers and
families victimized by illegal racist
Equity policies
so there's there's now a line you can
call if you're white or Asian or male I
suppose and it looks like you've been
discriminated at work for being white or
Asian or male and
now you can get some legal
representation
what do you think
I'm all for it yeah I I could have used
that at least twice in my career and
that existed I would have had a number
to call and I would have gotten legal
representation and I'd still be working
at a big Bank
so I'm glad I didn't have that legal
representation because I'd still be
working in a big Bank
yeah so
now do you see a pattern developing yet
so now you've got a number to call if
you've been discriminated against for
equity and how do you like the fact that
you can just do a tweet on this you can
just say it out loud hey there's a lot
of people being racist against white
peoples now we got a phone number that
white people can call and Asian
Americans and I guess males
um
and straight people I guess to say that
you've been discriminated against
do you see the pattern yet
yeah woke is definitely broke
there will be lots more woke so I'm not
I'm not saying you're not seeing you
that you're seeing the end of it or
anything like that it's going to be
whack-a-mole forever
but in terms of the peak it is now
discredited
I'm gonna I'm gonna call I'm gonna call
the top
calling the top
woke is discredited and is now actually
embarrassing to be on that side
it'll take a while for everybody the
message but it's actually embarrassing
all right
um
so that was good news
um I did a uh a poll asking who's the
who's the bigger racist me or Larry Fink
CEO of
BlackRock and Larry sink one you know
hands down he beat me and then I tweeted
that I think he might be the biggest
racist in the country
now how would you measure
who's the biggest racist now some people
said but what about David Duke and what
about the Ku Klux Klan and I say maybe
internally you know maybe in their minds
they're bigger racists in the sense you
know more more racist feelings
but they don't have much effect do they
not much effect
so if you look at people who are racist
and have an effect
I don't think I don't think you could
possibly be Larry Fink because he's the
main Pusher of ESG e being equity
Equity being racist
would you argue I did no somebody said
joyanne Reed but do you think she has as
much impact on the real world
because I think people watch the news as
just entertainment I I don't know that
they watch so he was asking people to be
racist all over the place
so he was leveraging his power to make
the entire industrial base racist I've
never seen a bigger example of racism
than that well in the current Times
Obviously Hitler had a monopoly on
things
but
then somebody said to a Randy Weingarten
would be a bigger racist because she is
the biggest protector of
institutional or systemic racism
but so it's a little hard to to measure
you know the various racisms against
each other but I think it's down to them
I think Larry Fink or Randy Weingarten
would be the biggest Racist You could
argue Biden
Maybe
Maybe
some people said Obama but I'm not going
to count anybody who's not currently
influential and he's not really in a
sense
all right
so
um what do you think of the fact that I
can casually retweet that Larry Fink is
the biggest racist in the country and
people just uh people simply think about
it whether that's true
that's all they did I don't know is he
the biggest all right I see your
argument yeah yeah I don't know if he's
the biggest because you know Randy
Weingarten but yeah you would be in the
top three for sure
what just what do you think about the
fact that I can just say that casually
he's the biggest racist of the country
and you all just go yeah yeah that
sounds about right
is peak wokeness
do you do you think there'll be any
pushback tomorrow
like there'll be a big viral video about
how I called Larry fig a racist
no
no because it's not shocking
it's not even interesting
it's just a fact and everybody can see
it now
all right
Harvard is introducing an AI teacher
so students will have some kind of a
science teacher chat bot for at least
one course
the cs50 course
and you know it's experimental of course
we'll see how it goes but uh isn't there
an obvious question here
may I ask the most obvious question
why would you pay to go to Harvard
if you're going to be talking to a robot
is it like the special Harvard trained
robot
do you get to are you going to network
with a robot later
well you know I didn't mean any people
but I got this great friend who's a
robot who was teaching me science
um isn't Harvard eliminating itself
if I were Harvard the last thing I do is
introduce a robot
because the robot has no you know none
of the qualities that Harvard does can
be easily reproduced down to the
community
you know Community College level it just
takes all of the value at Harvard
but I guess they don't have any choice
if they don't do it somebody's going to
do it to them so they you know maybe
they can build some kind of a hybrid
situation that makes them look like they
have some value but uh interesting that
they would go first
all right so there's of course more
rumors and whistleblowing and
speculation that the by the
investigation into Hunter Biden was
blocked
so now there's a whistleblower
that says that uh they were told to not
pursue leads that would go certainly go
directly to the question of whether Joe
Biden except today bribes or did any bad
stuff
and they were told not to and then
there's a story that Weiss the
prosecutor
tried to get some prosecutions going in
Washington D.C and also in LA but in
both locations they rebuffed him and
they said go away we're not doing that
but
Merrick Garland
the boss of this whole situation has
told Congress that there was no no
obstacles nobody blocked them they had
free reign to do what they wanted
I don't know if those are necessarily
opposites
because Garland is not in charge of you
know the two other states that said no
but collectively
collectively the picture is becoming
very clear
it looks like there's no question
whatsoever
that Hunter Biden was selling access
to his father taking huge amounts of
money and finding ways to not pay taxes
on it
it looks like it's all true
it's like it's exactly what you thought
it was times 10.
it's and I think we all know it now
but we but we we got totally cat on the
roof you know what I mean we got so cat
on the roof so the cat on the roof is
like oh your cat's on the roof trying to
get her down oh the the cab fell off the
roof and you know it's a little bit
injured but we took it to the vet and we
think it'll be fine and oh the cat died
so so the hunter thing you know started
with I don't know the laptop probably
and then there were all these stories
and time goes by and stories and time
and time and stories until you get to
this and you realize that every worst
assumption you had was true
they were all true that the bidens have
been a criminal Organization for decades
they've been a criminal organization
for decades and he's still president
nobody's talking about impeachment
or well I guess we talk about it but
it's not serious and
and we're just we're just going on like
this is a normal day
that's just a Wednesday
that we found out the president is
actually a crime syndicate kind of a guy
all right
which also makes sense why the Democrats
try so hard to paint Trump as what the
bidens are
as we've learned Tucker taught us this
the Democrats always accuse you of
whatever they're doing and if you look
at all the accusations against Trump
they do seem to mirror all the things
that Trump is not doing or did some
small way and Biden is doing a lot
so that's for sure all right how many of
you let's talk about the increase in the
trans community
so
uh I saw Vivek tweet this five percent
of American adults under 30 identify as
trans five years ago it was uh 0.6
percent
so there's a huge percentage increase in
number of people identifying as trans
under 30.
now his uh his conclusion isn't somewhat
obviously a mental illness driven
phenomenon
how many of you would agree with the
assessment that the increase in trans is
a primarily a mental health Contagion
I only would accept that as the most
likely explanation
all right so that was uh that was my
opinion as well
uh and I was Pro I was quite confident
in my opinion I have to I have to say
quite confident in my opinion that there
was no other reasonable explanation
other than it was just getting in
people's minds and they were talking
themselves into it because there was so
much in the Press about it
however
how do you rule out the following two
hypotheses
because I'm gonna I'm gonna you up
a little bit here and that's why you
watch I know right I want to take
something that you're pretty sure about
and leave you with some doubt
all right
so I think it was uh
was it Jordan Peterson
somebody somebody smart said the
following thing
there's so much more trans happening in
California
than there is in Ohio how do you explain
that
is it because uh
how would you explain that
other than it's uh it's a mental
phenomenon because you know that the
mentality in in California is different
than the mentality in Ohio right so
isn't it obvious that if California has
lots of trans
and Ohio doesn't have as many
it's kind of obvious that California is
more let's say mentally promoting of it
so that that would that would support
the idea that it's a mental contagion
would you agree
that the high rate in California
relative to Ohio supports the hypothesis
there's a mental Contagion
agree
all right
there are two hypotheses that I don't
think you can rule out
number one is that it's just safer to
come out in California
or that if you suspected you might later
come out you might move to California
instead of Ohio
what's wrong with that hypothesis would
that explain the difference between
California and Ohio in California you're
completely safe to come out in Ohio
maybe not so much maybe not so much
right so so are you so sure it's a
mental Contagion
when it just coincidentally
coincidentally just this is a total
coincidence right that the one place
it's the safest in the world to come out
in any way you want to come out is
California
and that we have the most people coming
out
just a coincidence
I doubt it I doubt it
how about the the idea that there might
be something in our environment that's
changing our sexuality you know the gay
frogs Theory
do you think there's anything in our
environment that's changing our
sexuality
even to the point of sexual
identification
do you think
well
have you heard that the uh
the the
burn levels and then have gone down for
like 40 years in a row
what happens when when you're no longer
chemically male
I mean what makes you feel male is
testosterone I think
doesn't it
yeah there's one thing about how you
look and how you're born and you know
maybe your natural biological instincts
but on top of that
if your testosterone is high you're
going to look and act and feel kind of
male
because you're going to watch yourself
picking fights and you know doing
dangerous and like all the male
stuff
but if your testosterone was low
for let's say environmental reasons
something in the water for example
uh wouldn't you feel less male
and and might you reasonably be expected
to say I don't know I'm not even sure
I'm totally male
I don't feel it I don't I'm not doing
what the other males are doing you know
they seem to be throwing shot puts and
climbing walls and stuff I'm not doing
that I like to knit
so maybe I'm a woman
so
there are three hypotheses
and I think that they're all
strong in their own way
so when I see a group of four friends
and all four of them are questioning
their sexuality and they're 13 years old
which is a real thing you know somebody
I know has that situation yeah do you
really think that the four of them like
the four friends just coincidentally
they're all non-binary and maybe trans
really because that seems doesn't that
seem completely psychological
to me it does but here's here's a Nuance
I'm going to throw in there
I think the um
you could easily figure out that mental
health would cause somebody to be maybe
a little non-binary or not so sure if
they're gay or not
I can see mentally contagion doing that
fairly easily that that would be
actually normal not surprising at all
because you can definitely change
people's
uh let's say non-solid
sexual preferences with persuasion you
you could turn somebody who maybe had a
little inclination to be bi
into somebody who lived a life of a gay
man
all right that that would be completely
normal you could do that I don't think
anybody who is a hypnotist would
disagree with what I just said you know
somebody's leading in a direction you
could push him a little further very
normal so you could do that with a
mental Contagion
I don't know that you could make
somebody fully trans
with mental condition alone
now when I say anybody well probably
somebody right I just don't think it
would be the I think that and this is
just speculation because I'm not trans
right so so I want to be I would like to
have appropriate
respectful humility I don't know what
it's like to be trans
so let's let's all agree that I can't
know what it's like but my speculation
is just living in the real world and you
know being a person who tries to pay
attention
that probably if you're super trans like
you were born that way and it's like a
real thing your dysmorphia you know the
experts would say okay this is the real
thing this has nothing to do with mental
persuasion this person is trans
do you think they don't know it
seems it seems to me that in those cases
persuasion is probably not the key
variable
all right so I'm leaning toward a theory
that it's three different things I think
the environment is one of the variables
I think whatever is dropping
testosterone
is clearly messing with sexual chemistry
if you know that the environment is
messing with your sexual chemistry at
least
for sperm
you don't think it would affect the
others
that there would be something that only
affects sperm
Maybe
maybe you can't rule it down but it
seems to me that something that's taken
your sperm down is probably you
up pretty good like in in a variety of
ways that just are not obvious and one
of them the most obvious would be your
your sexual identity I would think that
that would be assaulted by any change in
your sexual chemistry
so I'm going to say all three things are
probably in play I think there's a
social contagion that affects some I
think there's is safer to come out in
California so you should expect
more people to come out in California
than
Wyoming I would expect that and you know
some of it is an environmental I think
it's probably in in the war the water or
the air or the food or something
all right
so I would just like to leave you with a
little bit of humility and doubt that
you know why anybody is coming out as
trans or non-binary or anything you
really don't
we just we just don't know
but certainly all of those things are
worth a you know a close look and I
don't think Vivek is wrong he may be
overstating a little bit but not wrong
there's a social contagion element to it
for sure
all right
I was re-watching uh Putin's recent
speech the other day about you know the
alleged Insurrection or whatever it was
and
he looked like a deep fake
did anybody else have that experience
that his his video his speech he looked
he looked like a deep fake no I don't
think he was
but the difference between how he looked
in his real world because he was pale
and concerned and very uh tense
and he wasn't acting like the relaxed
happy Putin that you could sometimes see
and when he when he takes away his happy
layer and he's got his tense serious
layer the difference between his tense
serious you know presentation
and a deep fake
it's just almost nothing
now if you'd been say jocular and joking
around and you know a good laugh and
hahaha and shaking hands and stuff that
would be really hard to deep fake
simply because there's more more action
you'd see more things to go wrong but
when he's just standing there looking at
you
I looked at it again and I said If that
had been a deep fake I wouldn't know
again I don't think it was but if it had
been
I don't think you could tell I think
we're already at the point where that
could have been faked
and you wouldn't know it
and we're only five percent away from
there at most so that means that maybe
the government can already do it
all right
let's talk about progression you know
that uh the reporting is that his plane
took off from Russia and landed in
Belarus and lukashenko the head of
Belarus is saying oh yeah yep he's here
we got him yup yup yup he's totally here
have you seen a picture of him
do you see that picture of him getting
off the plane
confirming he's there
because you know lukashenko wants to
confirm he's there
because he would like you to know that
he's an important deal maker and that
he's the one who negotiated it and it
worked out and here's here's here's my
success
here he is I told you I told you I would
solve this problem I'm the one who
solved what could have been a a mutiny
against Putin I I'm the one that worked
that out here he is here he is here's my
buddy
where's that picture
kind of missing isn't it kind of kind of
the most obvious picture you would
expect
he's there
lukashenko knows where he is
you don't think and they're friends
they're friends they've been friends for
years you don't think he caught up with
him when he landed and said hey how you
doing you know here's the deal and
here's where you can stay and here's
what you can't do
yeah but no pictures of his good friend
who is probably hanging out with him
right now couldn't just take out his
phone snap a little selfie for us so
we'd be sure he's there
all right here's my uh fun speculation
first of all he might be there right so
if if tomorrow you see the picture
you know don't don't act like I'm
surprised I wouldn't be too surprised if
he's there but I think a slightly a
slightly bigger chance is the following
he's already in custody
that's what I think I think Putin
already has him and he's probably he's
probably in Russia
I think you'll never see a picture of
them
because if Putin just killed him in some
way that everybody knew that Putin
killed him he would have to deal with
the Wagner group itself
because the Wagner group itself probably
has some pretty loyal people in there
and they're dangerous people
as it is
um I saw cash Patel saying that Putin
wins because he gets this whole new Army
to to put you know into use any way he
wants but I didn't understand that
comment because he already had that
Putin could make the Wagner Force do
anything he wanted it was under his
control they just pretend they were
independent but not really not even a
little bit
so I don't understand the argument
that Putin suddenly got a bunch of new
soldiers they were already his soldiers
you can make them do anything he wanted
so I don't get that
so but I do think that the Wagner group
might be dangerous to Putin and the very
best thing he could do is say you know
what your dog didn't die no no your dog
didn't die no no he went to live in a
farm where there are beautiful fields
and other happy dogs yeah that's where
he is yeah you live forever on the farm
so my guess is that Putin had the
airplane he had his the private airplane
fly so that everybody would assume he
was on the private airplane there would
never be any pictures you would never
know if he made it to Belarus
maybe someday you'd find out he didn't
but at the moment it's the way to calm
everything down make it look like he's
in control but probably he's in Russia
and having a bad day that's my guess
I don't know about Dad
because they might be interrogating him
to find out who's working with him
now there's also indication
and I believe he heard it from me first
that he would never have tried to march
on Moscow
with his you know tiny force that had no
chance of really taking over the city
unless he assumed
that he had high ranking people who were
going to flip and the reporting today is
he had high level people he expected to
flip
and there were people who knew about it
for a long time including uh
senior Russian general sarovican
so he allegedly had Advanced knowledge
but if he had Advanced knowledge
did he tell everybody did he teleporting
with his Advanced knowledge because
there's some indication he might be in
trouble
right so it's not clear that uh Putin's
happy with that guy
so it might be that he's the one they
expected to flip and then he didn't flip
now remember I told you that if I were
the CIA and I were trying to help
Ukraine I would try to make a progosian
at Putin mad at each other so that they
would do exactly what they did
and so that's what it looks to me it
looks like the intelligence agencies got
them all ginned up to fight each other
but then I further said
that if I were the CIA I would tell a
progression that he had allies that were
going to flip but don't contact them
because you'll get caught if you contact
them the communication will be
intercepted but trust us we've talked to
them they're going to flip and then he
marches and finds out that was all lie
and there's nobody flipping and then
he's got to run back so that's what it
looked like to me it looks like they
expected flipping
did not get any flipping and then the
secondary question would be is it
because somebody told them there would
be flipping but they lied
or did the flippers actually plan to
flip and change their minds
don't know
but also it's likely that the families
of the Wagner group were threatened and
that's the only reason they turned back
I saw a YouTube
documentary on the Wagner group's
history and purpose do you know what the
history of the Wagner group is
it was way more interesting than I
thought so apparently it started with
Russia taking over Crimea and they
wanted some Force there that they could
say was a local Force but really wasn't
so that that's what Wagner was they were
basically military people who are
pretending not to be
run by Russia
eventually it Formed into a group and
they've done they've done a bunch of
criminal syndication things
so basically uh it's you know some
people say Russia is like the mafia
and
the Wagner group was the The Hitman
you know the people who go out and make
the money they were the earners
so the way they would earn is the Wagner
group would go to let's say Syria and
say the Isis and the bad guys are going
to take over here oil wells but we'll
protect your oil wells or even get them
back from Isis if we if we can keep 25
percent of the revenues of the oil well
forever
and by way
is Russia
and then then Syria says well we've got
no choice because we can't get them back
ourselves and nobody else is helping us
so they hire him
now you've got this Russian military
that's starting to get important it's
like got a place in Syria so Syria is a
little bit afraid of Russia because they
got a military that's working with them
but will they always work with them
but the most clever play was in an
African country I can't remember uh
one of the African countries you never
talk about I forget but they have some
natural resources and so the Wagner
people go in they say hey you've got
lots of enemies and you know you've got
a little Revolution Brewing we can
protect you from your enemies
now it wasn't Chad we can protect you
from your enemies so you'll be safe and
all we want is a little cut of your
diamond mines or your your your mining
operations
so they basically sell security
the way the mafia does
but now let's say you're an African
leader and you've you've accepted help
from the Wagner group and the Wagner
group is by far the strongest military
in your country stronger than your own
military because you don't have much of
the military
and then he started working with them
and they're inserted in the government
how long does it take before Wagner
basically owns the country
not long
so Russia has as this business model
where they can go into a struggling
country that has resources they can
pretend to be the saviors of the leaders
but really they're just controlling the
leaders and taking 25 percent of their
money home forever
so it's basically a robbery extortion
you know kind of situation you blackmail
whatever you want to call it but but
it's always it's always presented as
helping the leader but once I get in
there
the powerful force so the leader doesn't
have good choices so they take the least
bad one
all right
in case you didn't know that it's a very
deliberate criminal Enterprise
um I saw this uh interesting tweet from
the prince of fakes or the prince of
deep fakes
and
some of you know him I'm not going to
say more than that uh
and he was tweeting about a story that
said now this is an allegation which I
believe is ridiculous
so I don't believe this allegation
I know you do
so you don't have to tell me that I'm
being gullible and stupid and Scott
Scott
why don't you believe this it's
obviously true
and the rumor is that Bill Gates let out
some mosquitoes
to create malaria that had already
largely been you know handled and is
causing a malaria outbreak because he
coincidentally is investing in some
company that has a treatment for malaria
now I do not believe there's any chance
whatsoever
the Bill Gates intentionally released
mosquitoes to intentionally create
malaria so that he can make money with
his company that did something for
malaria
now I know you do I know you do I I know
some of you do and I'm not going to talk
about that today I'm just going to talk
about
the comment made by Prince deepest fakes
and he said this I'm not sure how people
who believe things like this you know
the Bill Gates malaria thing I'm not
sure how people believe things like this
aren't out there taking vigilante
justice in their low and hands the lack
of assassinations in the world makes me
believe everyone is just LARPing in
other words just pretending to be in
character there are conspiracy theories
regarding the elys If This Were true it
would be an evil beyond anything meaning
that if if Case had actually allowed
mosquitoes out to create malaria it
would be evil beyond anything what does
it say about a believer that the most
they do in response is tweet
exactly
so reality and fantasy have merged
so that when we got it on social media
we're playing it like it's a game but a
fictional game
so you can say anything to anybody you
know I I could maybe trade a tweet with
the the richest man in the world
I mean it doesn't seem real
does it
like it doesn't seem real so when you're
on social media I I believe that people
adopt personas
and then they play the character
and that if the if the character would
say oh Bill Gates is releasing malaria
the mosquitoes
if that's what the character would say
then they say that
but it's not like they actually believe
it like in the way that you believe
things in your you know your actual
physical so-called reality
and and his point is fair if you
actually believed if you really believed
the Bill Gates had just released viruses
to create malaria
you should take your second amendment
rights and go do something about it
you know you should kill Hitler
but number one I'm sure he never did
that I'm sure of it
if I'm wrong if I'm wrong I'll tell you
I'm wrong but you know my confidence is
pretty high that he did not do that and
and the reason he didn't do that is
follow the money
follow the money is very predictable and
if you believe
that Bill Gates would think it was a
good risk reward to release
malaria in some way that could be
determined that he did it
just to make money on a new smaller
company that would add what 1 billion to
his 200 billion
so you think he's really gonna he's
gonna take a chance of being in jail
forever
to make one more billion
do you really believe that because
that's not how money works
if you're if you're going to follow the
money you'd say he wouldn't do it
follow the money says he doesn't do it
because it wouldn't make sense as an
investment
it wouldn't make sense as an investment
so he's not going to do something that's
going to put him in jail where he can't
make money
he's going to at the very least stay out
of jail
so he's not going to do that
right so if you believe he is I believe
that you don't really believe it
I believe that you believe it like a
character you don't believe it like an
actual human being who lives in the
world
what do you think ah I'll just put that
out there and you can wrestle with it as
you as you like did I miss any stories
for today that concludes my prepared
remarks
um
oh wait there's a malaria vaccination
yeah probably
can you explain Sam Beckman Freed's
decision making
well once Sam Beckman freed got away
with some stuff
I believe he came he became blind to
what he could get away with
so I think the Sam brackman freed story
is kind of a slippery slope thing where
they they sort of slid into some sketchy
things and they couldn't back out
and so they just did more sketchy things
maybe talking themselves into it wasn't
so sketchy after all so I think there
was sort of a mental thing that happened
there but you could very easily imagine
that they were following the money
I think that was the nature of your
question he was following the money
because everything he did brought in
more money
but to your point he was not good at
risk reward
right he was a young guy and apparently
a terrible business person Bill Gates is
a very experienced business person
already has his billions already has his
reputation such that it is he doesn't
need that
so for him he would look at the risk
reward as he does for everything and he
would really say okay this is not a good
risk reward it's not a good investment
Sam bagman freed clearly was not good at
risk assessment would you agree
he wasn't good at it so you can try to
be pursuing your best financial interest
but if you're not good at it you still
might make a mistake
uh
okay oh the Epstein yeah there's more
Epstein stuff but I'm I'm just bored by
it
uh he's a plant Institute what
all right
um
as you touch you can block reports
is always about the law do you have a
mosquito problem just looking at your
comments see if anything I missed
um
freed has been freed
all right I think we're good for today
so YouTube thanks for joining
and I love you too my heck
uh and I'll talk to you tomorrow
