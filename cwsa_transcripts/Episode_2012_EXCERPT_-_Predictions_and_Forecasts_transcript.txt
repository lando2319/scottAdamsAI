this might look like a rational process
to you it should because it is a
rational process
so a rational process is if no matter
what the topic is so it could be any
topic you would do your research and try
to figure out what the facts are
what things do you know for sure but
because it's the real world you have to
add some assumptions
for example if you're looking at should
you get vaccinated or or get the shots
or whatever you might make the following
assumptions
I assumed that most of the injury from
the shot would show up in the first six
months
but I don't know that
I don't know that I assumed it and I
assumed it because that's how other
shots have worked most of most of the
problems showed up in the first six
months so I waited six months before I
got mine now other people made a
different assumption
other people said well I assume that
there could be lots of bad things that
happen later now that's true
I would share that assumption
but I assume that most of the risk was
in the first six months I think most
people would agree
uh other people assumed
that uh the long coveted thing was
artificial
and that there wasn't really much of a
long covered risk so they assumed that
wasn't much to talk about I assumed that
since I didn't know if it was a big risk
or not and there were lots of anecdotal
suggestions that it was a risk that it
should be considered as one of the big
risks
but other people assumed differently now
those are just some of the assumptions
there were a whole bunch of assumptions
about for example some people assumed
that the the medical communities in all
places were making decisions based on
fear of being fired or going along with
the crowd or a bunch of other things so
a whole bunch of assumptions about how
people act I'm not saying they were
wrong
I'm just saying they were assumptions
now I made different assumptions
my assumption was that even if you had
lots of people who were afraid there
would always be a few people who weren't
and there would be enough people to you
know make it more of a more of a fight
but there were in fact a number of
Rogues young people who were
Buckingham the Main Street and some of
them ended up being right in the end
so what would you call this whole
process where you research facts of
course you have assumptions you can't
escape this
you cannot Escape assumptions
then you analyze it all you use your
best judgment and your reason and you
come to a correct answer what would you
call this process
go what how would you label that
somebody say risk management deductive
reasoning
right now I did this stuff for a living
so it used to be my job to make the
financial predictions for the companies
I work for so I would say oh here's our
budget here's what we plan to do this is
what it will look like three years from
now and I always made a bunch of
assumptions
to back the things I did know so
assumptions plus things I knew
so do you know what I call this
I call it guessing
when I presented it
to people did I tell you it was a guess
when I presented it to like managers no
no it was a forecast
that was the forecast so when I talked
to the people who are the audience for
it I said it was a prediction and it was
a forecast
if you talk to me in my cubicle and
you're my co-worker
and you said you know how did you come
up to this I go well the assumptions
were so important to the outcome
that it's basically a guess
it's a guess
now you could say it's an educated guess
you could say it's an educated guess but
that's still a guess
that's just a form of guess it's a guess
it's an informed guess but the educated
part and the important part don't have
any predictive value
they don't if you believe an educated
guess is going to be to guess guess
well I would argue that almost all
guesses are educated guesses like in the
real world
it's just that we're educated
differently
so that the education part doesn't help
because we're educated differently
so I guess guess lady oh that's pretty
clever guest lighting instead of gas
lighting I like that
all right so
if you made this one change
where people who do this kind of work
know it's guessing
we know it's guessing when we do it we
know it's guessing
you don't know it's guessing because I
don't present it to you that way I pray
to send it to you as a well-reasoned
forecast
and then you think oh well he says it's
a well-reasoned forecast showed all of
his work I saw the spreadsheets I saw
the columns they seemed to add up yeah
that looks like a pretty solid reasoning
you got there no it is absolutely just a
guess
and the all the rest of it is to launder
your gas
so that people like you
will believe it was something other than
a guess
but it wasn't it was always a guess
always guess and since I can guess
either way
sometimes it's worse than a guess
sometimes you're just forcing the data
to be what your boss wanted it to be so
that's even worse than the guess it's
purely fraudulent
