oh yeah i'm uh wearing my mask
because uh i live in california
and i don't know if you know this about
california but
unlike a lot of the states where they'll
use data
and science and stuff like that we don't
do that here
nope nope we just we just wear masks
that's all we do
you're probably saying but scott you're
all alone and there's nobody near you
well that's true but that's no reason to
let down your guard is it
no it's not no it's not all right i'm
just kidding
but here's the good news and i'll tell
you this
right after the simultaneous sip
yeah you're about to be wandering into
the best part of your day
you didn't really even try very hard all
you did is click a link and here you are
just about the best thing that's going
to happen and all you need is a couple
of marker glasses tanker shelves to sign
a canteen jug or flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid i
like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes
oh just everything better everything
it's called the simultaneous sip and
it's going to happen now if you're ready
go so as you know the cdc has said
that masks are not terribly necessary if
you're fully vaccinated
but states still get to make up their
own decisions
so my state uh the dumbest and most
incompetent of all states
in the universe has decided it's going
to keep its mask mandated in place
now i was walking around a little bit
since the mandate had been lifted by the
federal government
and i do note that california is fully
compliant
people riding their bikes all by
themselves wearing masks
people jogging all by themselves with
nobody
nobody within viewing distance massed up
yeah we are so fully masked in
california you can't get a virus past us
let me tell you but
several retailers walmart costco trader
joe's
have said that you don't need a mask if
you're fully vaccinated but of course
the state
can overrule that as it does in
california
but here's what you need to know
governments they rule
when they're credible if your government
is doing
reasonable enough stuff the public will
probably follow them
when your government be it federal or be
a state
starts doing things which are obviously
not reasonable
i mean just obviously not reasonable
at that point your obligation to obey
them
disappears now there's a risk
right you still take the risk if you
disobey it obey them
but your obligation is gone
you don't have an ethical or moral
obligation
to obey any government rule
that's unreasonable you don't
i mean there's a risk so i'm not
suggesting that you disobey any
rules or regulations but you have no
moral or ethical
responsibility to obey unreasonable
authority that alone will guarantee that
things will
fix themselves pretty quickly when you
combine that with the fact that there
will be
an intense competitive pressure
imagine if you will i can't imagine this
quite because i'm in a
i'm in california but imagine if you
were in a different state
and there was a store here that said you
had to wear a mask if you're fully
vaccinated
and then there's one right next to it
selling similar products
but you know one has a mask requirement
and one doesn't
there's no competition the
the moment the the competitive
difference becomes obvious
which will be in i mean it'll be in the
first week of sales
right the the very first day there are
one grocery store requires a mask and
the other one doesn't
the sales are going to reflect that
immediately right
how long do stockholders put up with
somebody not obeying the federal
government's
guidelines the cdc and it's lowering
their profits
how long do the stockholders put up with
that wait a minute
you're not following the cdc standard
and it's
lowering your profit and all you have to
do is say
stop doing that you don't have to build
something you don't need to invest in
something
you don't need to move anything or
change anything you just need to put out
a thing that says
we'll just stop requiring that and then
your profits will go up
there isn't any chance
that you're going to have a long-term
situation where there's a competitive
business
that requires a mask right as long as
their competitors are not and of course
that's going to happen
so i wouldn't worry about this all
working itself out in the next
i don't know 30 days or so but it's
taking longer than it should
uh alec baldwin is in news complaining
about cancel culture it's like a forest
fire that just needs more fuel
now when alec baldwin
is complaining about canceled culture
which could also be described as
completely agreeing with president trump
cancel cultures in trouble isn't it
because i think cancer culture has now
you know clearly jumped the shark
when uh when alec baldwin is complaining
about cancel culture because it did
happen to him
i mean he has a he has a legitimate
complaint it happened to his wife
uh i feel like cancel culture
is sort of running out of fuel a little
bit
because if you get the leftiest lefty
guy to like it
there's not much left right now of
course it will plague us for a while but
you can see there
there seems to be a turning point i
would say
and i would say the turning point is
alec baldwin speaking out in public
about it it'd be one thing if he had a
private opinion about it
but alec baldwin saying it in public
so i think i think we're turning the
corner on that
i continue to look at the cost of
opposing trump
because you've seen that so many people
who are anti-trump something bad happens
to them have you noticed that
i don't know if it's a selective memory
or just the way the news works
probably that but it seems like trump's
opposition
not only it's bad for them personally
but then
there's a big cost to it for example
um apparently biden is re
who knows if this is true right but
biden reportedly lashed out
at his own health and human services
head
over the handling of the migrant
children
so joe biden it is reported
but again you know i think it's an
anonymous report
about a private conversation in the oval
office
what credibility do you put on a private
anonymous report of something well
not much right but in this case uh it is
a
do you remember that all the leaks from
anonymous sources about trump were
negative for trump
but here's a leak i guess it'd be a leak
about a story about uh joe biden that
makes
joe biden look extra good behind closed
doors
not only is joe biden fighting for the
migrant children
but he's even beating up his own
appointed person
for not fighting hard enough or doing
well enough to save the children
so totally credible anonymous report
that makes joe biden look like a good
fighter
huh now so i
i believe the story is fake news or at
least planted news
you know you you could call that fake
news or not because it could be true
but also you know a a strategic leak
but my point is that if that works in
favor of joe biden then the story that i
get from this
is that fixing this problem turned out
to be really hard
and it wasn't just a case of whether you
were republican or democrat
it's just hard to fix it so even biden
with all the resources in the world and
all of the good intentions
apparently he couldn't even get his own
hand-picked person to to fix it well
enough
so uh i think that gives us a little
perspective about trump's performance
on that same topic now i also asked on a
on twitter how many executive orders
did trump make in which he cut
regulations
do you know the number because i
remember i feel like it was reported at
one time because he was doing that thing
where they'd cut 10 regulations for
every one that they introduced
what did the number get up to can
somebody tell me in the comments
google that for me and tell me how many
regulations he
got rid of is it in the hundreds or is
it in the thousands
it's a lot right so i think it's at
least high hundreds
am i wrong about that somebody's saying
500 but i don't know i don't know if you
actually know the number
all right so let's say some big number
whether it's hundreds or low thousands
is somewhere in that range how many of
them have been reversed
by biden do you know
what percentage we hear about some
specific ones
right you've heard about some of his
executive orders that have been reversed
but reversing an executive order is
different
from reinstituting some regulations
that trump got rid of with an executive
order
right so we do know that executive
orders have been reversed but
what percentage of the let's say
hundreds
of of regulations have been reversed by
biden because he really liked those
regulations
why don't you know that why don't i know
it
why is there no headline on that how big
a story is that
it's pretty big right because that would
tell you
that would tell you if trump did
something that's
amazing you know he'd got rid of a whole
bunch of regulations
and when they were looked at carefully
even biden didn't want them
is that what happened because i don't
know that that's what happened
is it possible that they're privately
being reversed and it's just not being
reported
because i feel like it would be reported
if there was any
big action on it so one of two things is
possible
either trump did an amazing job
of getting rid of unnecessary
regulations
or biden is reversing lots of
regulations back to having a regulation
and we don't know about it which would
also be a big story
am i wrong that this is a gigantic story
that is completely ignored
have you seen the story about it it was
a pretty big deal when i would talk to
my anti-trump friends
one of the top i don't know top five
things that they would say
is that trump has gotten rid of all
these regulations that were protecting
us
so how about a little follow-up how many
people have died so far
because of those lack of protections
how much economic development did we
have that we wouldn't have had
because he got rid of those i don't know
do you know
pretty big question total lack of
reporting um
china landed its rover on mars
at the same time that we have our assets
up there on mars
so what's that tell you
we're talking about the future let's
talk about the future
so it looks like china and the united
states are already
in a land grab for mars
you knew it was going to happen you just
didn't know when
but now it's happening allow me to make
the following suggestion
we should get a military asset up there
really quickly
just one kind of rover that could maybe
you know maybe it's uh maybe it's one of
those flying drones
but just bring one military asset up
there that can
take out somebody else's drone
and i imagine we could do it without you
know getting caught i think just the
the video would go off and they wouldn't
know what happened
um yeah our rover should have been armed
and maybe it is we don't know because at
some
point we are going to have to prevent
china from
having assets on mars i feel like that's
going to have to happen
and whoever gets there first with some
serious equipment
should be able to stop anything that
lands from that point on
because everything would be weak when it
lands right
anything that's going through that what
is it
seven minutes of bad turbulence before
you land on mars
and there's no communication if you
could take it out while it's still weak
and before it's actually you know set up
and transmitting back to earth
who would know who would know
so we should militarize mars right away
is my opinion because if china does it
first
we could be in trouble um
so keep an eye on that so here's a
story about some more ufo sightings
and apparently there is yet another
oval shaped grainy image of a ufo
that was flying over the ocean fairly
low over the ocean
for a long time i mean you know they
followed this thing for a long time so
we don't we do know for sure that it was
a grainy oval
that much is confirmed and then the
grainy oval
dived into the ocean wow
you didn't even know ufos could do that
did you i mean
if you were a if you were a spaceship
from another planet
um it would be hard enough to get all
the way to earth
with a device that can actually fly in
our atmosphere
and not run out of fuel and all that but
apparently they're so good
that they can even fly through the
atmosphere they can fly through space
they can fly through earth's atmosphere
and then they can dive into our oceans
and then later the reports are
that the ufo after it dived into the
ocean it re-emerged
with a smaller ufo in its beak
now if that's not proof that ufos are
real
i don't know what is i mean
you know we we have this good image of
uh ufos splashing into the water
in a place where uh aquatic birds
are plentiful and when you look at these
birds on
uh infrared as these images are they're
infrared
it turns out that the wings don't show
up as well as the body
because the body is warmer or it's a
different temperature from the surface
but the wings are closer to the
same temperature as the outside air so
it turns out that when you do an
infrared
picture of a bird in flight it looks
like sort of a grainy oval thing
that seems to move in a way that physics
can't explain
and not only that but physics can't
explain how it dives into the water now
and then
when it's hungry and it merges with a
small ufo in its peak
so this is all a mystery and i hope we
can i hope somebody smart
can unravel this because um it looks
like we've been visited
by extraterrestrials so
uh today i invested in some ericsson
stock
you know the telecom company from sweden
um they make equipment that competes
with uh huawei
and china and uh beijing is apparently
uh
threatening sweden because sweden banned
huawei's technology and is threatening
to
uh retaliate against eriksen because
that's
you know big company in sweden so
uh just to support erickson i
immediately went online
and bought a bunch of their stock now
let me be careful here
i don't necessarily believe that's a
good investment
you understand that right it's not a
recommendation
i don't make financial recommendations
except to diversify
and i got rid of my turkish telecom
by the way an update i used to have uh
i used to have some stock in the turkish
cell phone company
but i sold that last week for uh
patriotic reasons
because turkey is just not playing nice
and now i'm buying some erickson
also for um to defend them
basically just to defend their stock now
i don't i don't think that it's priced
apparently the analysts are not in love
with it
so i can't tell you that you should buy
a lot of it but if you wanted to buy it
for
uh let's just say anti-china reasons
it's out yeah that's an option um
so israel apparently gave some warning
recently
to a building that had al jazeera and
the
associated press but uh reportedly
also maybe some hamas secret service in
it
i don't know for sure i don't know that
that's a confirmed thing
but they gave them a little warning and
then they it looks like they shot two
missiles into the base of the building
and it was a very impressive
relatively controlled explosion in which
the building sort of went down like this
ish it was impressive i didn't know that
you could
bring down a building almost like a
controlled demolition if you hit it just
right and you know how the building is
built apparently
but they can uh because that's what
happened
and uh i have the following comments
about this
um i think that going forward and
certainly it's already
been true that when there's a military
action
between a strong military power
and uh let's say a smaller military
power could be terrorists
could be you know isis or something that
the first thing the
strong the strong military wants to do
is get rid of the media because the
strongest military can't do what it
needs to do
which is going to get really bloody and
there's going to be a lot of bodies
some of them will be civilians maybe a
lot of them
in order to win the bigger military has
to first get rid of the cameras and and
the reporting
so the first thing you need to do is
take out the press
ideally not you know not killing them
but just taking them off the field
so that they can't report that's what
happened with isis
i mean the fact that there was no
no good reporting on the ground allowed
the military to do what they needed to
do
which i imagine was pretty bad right
because
that's the job of the military if you
see pictures
it makes you think oh we gotta stop
doing this if you don't see pictures
you don't necessarily think you need to
stop doing it because pictures
are what influence us so get rid of the
media get rid of the pictures
now i would imagine that this kind of
pressure on the media
even if nobody got hurt which i hope is
the case
it's going to make them feel like maybe
they need to do what
israel wants them to do in the future
right if you want to keep your building
so there's that now there's also the
story
and uh joel pollock was reporting on
this in bray bart
the israel apparently uh you know
it faked a ground invasion to get all of
the
the fighters into the tunnels big tunnel
network
and then they bombed the tunnel network
so they bombed a tunnel network and
the news is reporting something like a
hundred deaths
like altogether do you think
that after bombing the tunnel network
then number one we can count the number
of deaths
because they're still in the tunnels
right
do you think it's only 100 people have
died after the tunnel network got bombed
was the tunnel network so lame that
there were only a few dozen people in it
i feel like they got a lot more deaths
than this
but who knows right it's going to be
hard to count people who
are pre-buried so the beauty of bombing
uh the terrorists who in the tunnels is
that you don't have to have a funeral
with a body there's no photograph of the
body
there's just bombs and then
that's all you know they're pre-buried
so um then there's additional story that
says
that maybe israel used the foreign press
and lied to them this is this is the
allegation
that israel directly and repeatedly lied
to entities like the new york times so
that they would report there was going
to be a ground invasion
at the same time reportedly i don't know
how reliable this is
but reportedly israel was telling
israeli media sources
no there's totally not going to be a
ground invasion
now i don't know if this is true
is it true that they really told the
local media no ground invasion
at the same time they were telling the
new york times and others oh totally
ground invasion
no no but what is the net effect of that
well the net effect of that
is to make the press that is not already
owned by
presumably the uh israeli
you know secret service or whatever um
it makes any any independent press in
another country
less credible less credible
because uh if you knew that the main
press in the united states had gotten a
story this big
about an israeli invasion and gotten it
wrong
what are you going to think the next
time they have a story about israel
you're going to think well this is the
same one who got that last story wrong
so israel is taking out the media
they're taking out
any media in terms of credibility
and and they're taking out a building of
the media which is
feels like a warning as well even if the
real target was
you know some other asset in the
building um glenn greenwald
is uh has a good
sub stack article on liz cheney and says
that she lied about her role
in spreading the discredited cia russian
bounty story now
the dispute is that cheney was asked
about it and said that
she had only talked about it as an
if as in if it's true
then we should act a certain way and if
it's true
then trump is doing the wrong stuff if
it's true
now her claim is that she always talked
about it
in the conditional if it's true
glenn greenwald objects to that
characterization
with with lots of examples of things she
said
but when i look at exactly the things
she said
it's really carefully chosen for example
some of her words were about
it is reported if somebody says
it has been reported that does that
sound like
if to you does that sound like if it's
true
if somebody says it has been reported
well i think if i interpret uh glenn
greenwald
correctly and i might not be but if i do
he's saying that that's more of that's
more of a direct statement that it's
true
because you're mentioning the report
you're not using the word if
but it's it's really kind of gray
in my opinion because it's really
careful wording
to say it's reported because it's
reported is true
what you don't know is that the thing
actually happened the only thing that's
true is it's reported
but then as greenwald points out
it's a common trick that her father used
which was to leak a story to the press
and then talk about the story in the
press
as if it's public information now and it
must be true because it's in the press
so you got to watch out for that trick
because you'll see it a lot
um i saw a tweet by an attorney matthew
diperno and he's talking about michigan
counties and there
apparently some audit stuff going on
about the election
and it seems that there's evidence now
in writing
that a number of the counties decided to
not
keep the image of the ballots so the
machines will
count the ballots but they also take an
image of them to store
and in order to not store the image
you have to actively turn it off because
the default the way it's built to work
the way it's built to work
thank you optimus so
uh michigan apparently many of the
counties decided to
actively turn off the image control
why would they do that what would be a
legitimate reason
for turning off a function which is
built into the machine
as an audit security safeguard
why would you turn it off give me a
legitimate reason
any legitimate reason now it sounds like
they
turned it off because maybe they didn't
want to go through the bother of an
audit or something
but is that a good reason that doesn't
sound like a reason
does it so that the first thing you need
to know is that any story about the
election
has to be judged with a lot of
skepticism so i don't know if it's true
that michigan counties decided to turn
off this feature but if it's true and
there does seem to be evidence of it
the question that matthew asks is was a
crime committed
and does rico apply because if these
counties
organized in other words they talked to
each other and they said hey
if you turn it off i'll turn it off and
we'll be fine
then they're coordinating a criminal
activity
which is a rico problem now
am i wrong that there is also some
disappearing data in
arizona so that we've got at least two
or three of the trouble uh
the trouble or at least the the places
that people have questions about the
election
how many of them have to be erased
before you say
uh-oh and let me ask you this
let's say the only thing you knew is
that
there was one state that couldn't be
audited
suppose that's all you knew and let's
say that
democrats and republicans agreed on the
following point
um hypothetically so i'll use my if here
if it's true that both arizona
and michigan and maybe another state you
know
there's still some suspicion about some
other states but if there was something
that could have been audited
and should have been maintained and was
deleted before an audit
is the election still valid
is it because it seems to me
and my guess is it's still legally valid
yes
but in your mind would you trust an
election
in which the ability to audit it was
intentionally
erased and intentionally is the
important part
if data had been let's say accidentally
destroyed
then i would say well there's nothing to
see here accidents happen
but if there is an intention and
then it appears to be some kind of an
intention involved here
to delete auditable records
was the election still valid i feel as
if you could make an argument
that the election is not valid if it
can't be audited
and that the reason it can't be honored
that this is important that the reason
they can't be audited
is because people made specific
decisions to get rid of stuff
if that's true it's not a legitimate
election now it might be legal
it might be certified it might be you
know done and done
you know i'm not saying that anything
would be reversed or anything would
happen
or even that the system didn't work more
or less
i'm just saying you couldn't really call
it legitimate
if it became unauditable by human
intention
immediately after the election i mean if
i were the supreme court
i would actually overturn the election
if this were true
now i don't know if there's a legal
basis for that but i might look for one
because if you're the supreme court um
part of the reason it's human beings is
that they do get to look at the big
picture
like what is really good for the world
and also compatible with the
the constitution ideally you want them
only to be compatible with the
constitution
but if there's any gray area that's why
we have humans
that's why we pick wise educated people
to be on the supreme court
because sometimes sometimes you need to
you know move into the gray area to get
a better outcome
and i don't know if i'm the supreme
court and i look at
information being deleted after the
election and before an audit
personally i would throw out the
election that's what i would do
but i don't know that they could
actually get away with that
all right here's my question for you
we're talking about infrastructure all
the time and everybody's arguing about
what is and what is not infrastructure
i'm on the side of defining it broadly
you know i don't really have a complaint
with buddha judge or
the democrats um calling things
infrastructure that are barely
infrastructure
as long as they also need to get funded
you know
elections have consequences right i mean
the democrats
get to throw some stuff in this bag
as a as a process i'm not too concerned
about it
even if i might disagree a lot about
some of the specifics
i'm not too concerned that they're
calling things
you know infrastructure that's just a
you know way to get there
but here's my question to you if you
were to list our most
important infrastructure for national
security
what would be on the list so here's my
list
i would have 5g really close to the top
of infrastructure priorities especially
make sure there's no huawei in there and
also making sure that
we have enough of a 5g industry that we
can
you know help our allies not have huawei
technology i'd also say that nasa
and militarizing space is a top
infrastructure because it doesn't matter
so much today but in 20 years it might
be the only thing that matters
who controls space so space force
and working with nasa or whoever else
they need to work with
i think space infrastructure has got to
be a really high priority
for the future i would say nuclear
energy
right at the top of the list both for
powering our space exploration and
control
and also for climate change and also for
just having enough electricity that's
clean
so i would say nuclear energy would be
right in the top five
i'd say our energy grid and controlling
it
and i would i would include an energy
grid
pipelines and cyber security
you know i worry that our cyber security
is really just uh nothing more than
mutually assured
destruction which isn't good enough if
they're private hackers
because we can't find them so those are
the ones that just jump to the top
of uh top of my list
manage our forests um yeah
i mean in california managing our
forests is way up there because the
fires
uh yeah the government's priority is to
find all the white supremacists that
don't exist
all right so those would be my
priorities um
so joe biden's climazar john kerry
was asked about uh slave labor in china
specifically the uyghurs uh being part
of making solar panels that apparently
we'd have to buy a lot of
or at least components of if we wanted
to go big
on climate you know green energy
and john kerry amazingly
said he couldn't guarantee that we
wouldn't be buying products of slave
labor and genocide
and i feel like he made an argument that
we might have to live with that
that in order to uh deal with a
existential crisis as he would say
but i don't uh of climate change
that you might have to deal with a
genocidal
uh group and allow their slave labor
and their genocide to make the products
that keeps us safe from running out of
energy and polluting the world
how is that moral argument sitting with
you
pretty good huh why is it that we're
building infrastructure
and we're trying to solve climate change
and we're buying ship from china
doesn't it seem like infrastructure
should include
making our own stuff now if you look at
uh now the other issue of course is that
the solar panels
and solar energy takes gigantic amounts
of land
which nuclear does not and others other
things do not as much
and the waste created by it is amazing
and it's made by slaves so
it might be that solar energy and then
it also is not consistently
um powering anything because the sun is
not consistent
so it could be that we're coming to
coming around to the thought that solar
energy
at least the way we can do it now is the
worst thing we can do
and i i feel like there's a good
argument that is literally the worst
thing you can do now we might have to do
some things in the short term
just because it takes a while to do
nuclear energy
but uh yeah solar has turned into
bad on every level bad on land use
bad on pollution in the sense that the
panels have to go somewhere
bet on ethics because slave labor is
making it
bad on economics because we're giving
money to china
bad on national security because we're
giving money to china
so you know i i guess we're
finally wising up to uh the real costs
and benefits of solar
uh and there's also a big question about
apparently biden approved the first
major offshore wind farm
that will power 400 000 homes so it's a
really massively big project about 12
miles off the coast
in massachusetts now you might imagine
that lots of people oppose this
but once again the parts for these
windmills
are mostly made in europe mostly made in
europe
shouldn't our infrastructure include
funding or something to make this stuff
in the united states
there's no way we can make this stuff
competitively
you know apple can't make a windmill
probably don't want to because it kills
a lot of birds
but i don't know how many jobs that's
going to create
if the parts are made in europe so we'll
see
um and made in china too people are
saying on the comments
all right uh how many birds will it take
out yeah exactly you know
it's amazing to me that we can't figure
out how to keep birds away from
windmills
doesn't it seem like that's doable i
mean what would it take to scare a bird
away
i feel like that the bar is not that
high right
i feel like there's something you could
do
with i don't know infrared or something
fluttering or some
uh big scary owls or something
you know if if you made the windmills
at the top look like a predator you know
with like a beak
and you know big predator eyes and stuff
would birds
see the big predator head and still fly
directly into it yeah yeah giant owl
statue
right i feel like there's a way to
handle this problem
maybe it doesn't work at night or
something well you can light it
uh send the
send the ufos after them yeah the other
problem is that these uh
these windmills have apparently
destroyed
uh hundreds of ufos
just hundreds of ufos have been just
chopped up
in these windmills
yeah what about hurricanes it's a good
question i assume that they're built to
withstand hurricanes
although i don't know how how would a
windmill ever
ever survive a hurricane and do you have
any hurricane risk
12 miles outside of massachusetts
maybe a little bit
um even firecrackers
he keeps coming back i don't know who
you're talking about oh you're talking
about a bird
so you've got a bird that just keeps
coming back
um nuclear means nationalization of the
power grid i don't know
that point so somebody's saying that if
we go more nuclear
we have to nationalize the power grid i
don't understand that point at all
what's the connecting tissue
all right let me tell you in advance i'm
planning a
trip in june so i might miss a few days
of this i want to give you some warning
about that but that's a jew and i'll
tell you about it when we get there
and um oh
yes juan reminds me that chip
manufacturing should be in the top five
it turns out the the united states
doesn't do much
making chips anymore and i don't know
when that changed
i i thought there was one point when the
united states
made most of the chips am i wrong about
that
and now we barely are in the business or
something
i don't know how many we make but it's
mostly overseas
so it does seem like we should have
chips and 5g
and uh some other stuff here
uh yeah we make we make junk food over
here
that's our specialty in america making
food that will kill us
um hey zach
thank you you know um i appreciate the
offer
so i maybe i'll just say this here a lot
of people
um say they'd like to you know
grab a cup of coffee or something when
they're in the area and i always
appreciate it
because it means people are enjoying
what i do but i
pretty much never say yes to that so
uh i have barely enough time to do the
things i need to do
and really i don't have enough time to
do them so i don't really ever just sort
of
take a coffee i just don't do it but
but thank you for offering
