and welcome to the highlight of
civilization
where I live it's 39 degrees how are you
doing
better than that
probably not
well I know it's cold all over but if
you'd like to warm up at least on the
inside all you need is a cupboard mug or
a glass a tanker chalice sign a canteen
jogger flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine heat of the day
thing makes everything better it's
called simultaneous sip that happens now
go
um
well if you're on YouTube you missed the
earlier conversation I started a little
bit earlier with the locals subscribers
and one of the things that we've
collectively decided over on locals just
want to check it with the people here on
YouTube would you agree that
scrotum is the funniest body parts
or or balls if you prefer does anybody
have a disagreement there's no funnier
body part
any anybody
there's no disagreement oh the taint the
taint
I'm gonna have to run a poll on this
all right bear with me here we got to do
a poll we'll find we'll get a result uh
what is the funniest body part
because this we have to know
funniest body part all right we'll
initiate the poll
Choice one is a
date date
choice to his balls
it is a third choice
uh spleen
Balzac uh
oh anus
well we got change that's close enough
it's great yeah weedus okay
but nobody's going to vote for this
third one so this is just a placeholder
let's say Let's uh
who killed
nostril a nostril is funny
elbow and overused
Adam's Apple navel
there's only coccyx
all right I'm gonna go with that
c-o-c-c-u-y-x is that the correct
spelling
all right
send
and I'll tell you in in mere minutes
in mere minutes we will know the
funniest body part
all right now a lot of times people
raise questions and they won't have
answers for you
but not on coffee with Scott Adams
when I ask you a question
you're going to get an answer
yes you will
all right um how many of you knew the
following thing
that Tesla has a line of business
that you've probably never heard about
that could very easily be bigger than
Tesla the automobile part does any of
you know that
that there's a Tesla power
company
and what they'll be doing is using Tesla
power walls in some kind of a network
configuration so it's like a in place of
a normal uh
some kind of a normal grid I don't know
the entire details it's all solar is it
all solar powered and then stored in
Tesla batteries and then but is there
also an element where they Network them
together right
for some kind of mutual benefit
so that and that's really where the
benefit is right because you can already
get a Tesla power wall at your house but
I think the the additional business is
networking them together in some way is
that so they can share or more
efficiently I think it's for more
efficient storage and sharing right
something like that
anyway that could be bigger than all of
Tesla
so not long ago
musk was at over 200 billion that worth
is that right was he close to a quote a
quarter trillion
with that how to speak
now it's gone down quite a bit since
then but if there's power power wall
business takes off bigger than Tesla
and what happens if he starts mining an
asteroid
do you know how much the value of a
company would be if you could actually
mine an asteroid
and he'll probably be the first one
there
that's a trillion dollars
it's like a trillion dollars if you
could mind an asteroid so he's I think
he's going to be the first trillionaire
would anybody take the opposite bet
I mean inflation alone will probably
push them to a trillionaire because he's
young enough but I think he's going to
be the first trillionaire
we'll see
um
and I don't see anything that Bezos is
doing that would grow that quickly right
is there anybody else in any kind of a
business that could even possibly
grow as fast as his business I don't
think so
all right
um musk was on Twitter a few hours ago
uh he's describing what it's like to
figure out how Twitter's
technology and even his business works
and he says that uh his first tweet was
fractal of rube Goldenberg machines
do you all know what a Rube Goldberg
machine is
it's like a unnecessarily complicated
humorous machine where it's not meant to
be taken seriously so it's like it's an
example of
something over complicated and
bureaucratic and stuff
so he said fractal and fractal of course
is adding to his point uh fractional
group Goldberg machines is what it feels
like understanding how Twitter works
and yet work it does
even after I disconnected one of the
more sensitive server racks
now I'm not sure if you're fully
appreciating this set of tweets
this might be the most baller thing that
that
musk has ever done
this this is what I think happened right
I'm reading between the lines but I'm
filling out the story from these little
Clues this is what I think happened
musk says so what does This Server act
do well it does XYZ all right how about
this one well
um I think that does X and then the
other co-worker says no no I'm pretty
sure that is why
and then they says are you you don't
even know if it does X or Y well I'm
sure it does it's either X or Y some
valuable function
they asked somebody else and they they
say some third thing
we're not really sure what that rack
does but it's vital
whatever you do don't turn it off
what do you think musk would do in that
situation you can't tell me what this
does
but I can't turn it off that's what
you're saying you can't tell me what it
does but I can't turn it off
click
now I wasn't there I don't have any
inside information but it might be the
funniest thing anybody ever did
at any company
 turn it off
you if you don't know what this is I'm
going to turn it off
see what happens
is it just me or is that the funniest
thing anybody ever did in an actual
corporate setting just turn it off see
what happens like this giant company
this is like the the uh the brains of
the world I'll just turn it off see what
happens
I know that one story
uh I think if if I'm accurately you know
interpreting it that one story would
describe a musk better than all the
things he's ever done like you could
just boil it down at that one thing
uh Mike cernovich is wading into the
third rail of social media which is
and of course you've seen me do it went
to bad result
but uh you've often seen me say
that the people who seem to be dying
suddenly so to speak
or just anecdotes and while it might be
true
and there's a good chance that the
vaccinations have more let's say more
harm than benefit for some young people
in particular
might be true you know I I don't believe
any data at this point
but uh cernovich is going at it hard and
you're just one one part of the exchange
on Twitter
and he said we had a kid at the local
high school died during the during the
some football events in the 80s he said
that poor kid would be going viral as
quote proof that the vaccine is killing
people with happened today true or false
that that kid
I I think it'd be true if somebody had
video of a high school kid falling down
during a sporting event it would be part
of the part of the proof that the
vaccinations are killing young people
now this is why I appreciate zurvich and
then you know it's one of the reasons I
mentioned that there's nothing to be
gained by this
you get that right
like he's taking on a fight nothing to
be gained for him it's all downside for
him
but it's good for you
it's good for you
so he's doing it anyway now I do the
same thing
and and some of it is sort of a dad
energy sort of thing
you know sometimes you just got to do
what needs to be done and
it you have to be at a certain stage of
life
before that's even an option right 20
year old me I don't know might be more
selfish
well not might 20 year old me would have
done whatever I needed to do to get to
be 65 year old be
but my current version in my current
version I kind of have a preference to
doing the hard things that might have
some value to somebody even if it's hard
for me
so that's where I get some meaning I'm
sure I'm sure he's getting the same kind
of you know benefit so there it's not
like nobody gets any benefit but his
benefit
is not the obvious kind where you just
say rah-rah to your team and your team
all agrees with you I mean he's taking
on the hardest
the hardest social media path
disagreeing with your own followers
on something they really care about
like that's a tough path but he's taking
it so good for him speaking of dad
energy
there's a story which I don't know if
this is true
don't know if this is true
but I so hope it is that I'm going to
treat it like it's true do you do we all
agree with the ground rules the ground
rules are that I'm not telling you is
true
and I'm not telling you I would believe
such a story because it's a little bit a
little bit on the nose
but it's so good that I'm gonna act like
it is true I just retweeted it all right
so this is allegedly uh I saw this on a
tweet by uh tactical nukes spelled funny
and this is allegedly true all right it
happened a few days ago allegedly uh
daughter says that she's trans she's in
ninth grade she tells her parents that
she's decided she's trans
and uh so the father confesses that he's
trans too uh daughter is confused dad
says uh
and she says Dad no you're not
and then the dad says stop being a bigot
Charlotte it's funny that her name is
Charlotte so now that that adds to the
story that the daughter's name is
Charlotte I don't know why that that
just helps in some way
stop being a bigot Charlotte let's do
this together
so the father Embraces and amplifies
it says you're trans so am I
let's do this transition together
So It Goes On
so the father I'll just read his own
words sorry this is the Father's words
wear dress and make up next morning
meaning the father does
daughter is angry tells me to stop
faking no I'm trans honey now get in the
car and let's go to school she's
horrified ask me to ask to be dropped
off a block away nope walks her in waves
to front desk she's fuming
wife can't stop laughing
so the wife is in on this too wife can't
stop laughing
pick up daughter
pick up daughter and skirt and heels in
other words the father's wearing skirt
heels shitty makeup glitter on cheeks
skipped to her and her friends so he
skips over to them
and Dad stop it's not funny
the demand she used my pronouns
the bats used by pronouns I call her a
big
and next morning she's done with the
whole trans things begs me to stop
all right
if if there's one thing I'd like all of
us to agree on in the spirit of you know
Christmas
that were the holidays if you prefer
uh can we all agree that we don't care
if it's true
can we all just agree on that just agree
we don't care if it's true right
and it's not true don't tell me
I never want to know that's not true
now
uh for the record
for the record yeah I'm I'm pro-trans
right to the to my detriment with my
audience often but I'm pro-trans but as
it is uh still nonetheless a fact that
some people will
you know be in the category of thinking
maybe they should transition and change
their mind later so that's the thing
they're all types they're types who
probably are better off for it and
they're types that probably wouldn't be
and why would we ignore either category
that's my take
all right so uh California as you know
has uh commissioned this is a this is
also hilarious this is something that
Gavin Newsom did
that I think is an example of embrace
and amplify
now
I don't think any of you should
underestimate Gavin newsom's political
capabilities you can dislike his
policies you can dislike anything he's
done that's fair
but his political Acumen is pretty good
right Amy's made some some mistakes but
generally speaking he's a he's a solid
operator
so he's got this problem you know not
too long ago he had this problem where
there was agitation for reparations
so what does he do does he say no we
can't we can't do that
nope because that would make his base
matter
instead he Embraces the idea and he
amplifies it by creating a committee
that will make specific recommendations
what to do
what do you think Newsom expected out of
the committee
did he expect that they would say no
there's no way to do it no of course not
of course not he expected they would say
yes do it then what else did he expect
because he's smart even if you don't
like his politics he's smart what would
he expect
absolute disaster
right
and then what then what would happen to
him
so he's the governor so he takes it
seriously
he's embraced it and even not only did
he embrace it he Amplified it he did
something he actually put into action
real people probably a budget real
things gave it visibility he Amplified
it what did he expect would happen
exactly what happened
because there's really one way it could
have gone
it would produce something absurd
and then he'd be off the hook
would you agree that that was
intentional on his part he knew it
wasn't going to be a real recommendation
he knew it would be ridiculous
how ridiculous is it
let's review
I'm not everything I say right now is
true
it'll sound like I just made this up
it's so ridiculous
so California that was never a slave
state
California was never a slave state
right
Not only was it never a slave state
but it was a state this slaves fled to
for a good life because relatively
speaking it was a pretty good deal to be
black in California relative to other
places plenty of jobs and if there were
lots of jobs and you were free well you
got a job so if you're black you could
get a job in California as a free person
so it was a good place to go and and you
would even get the citizens would defend
you
there's one anecdote of somebody brought
a slave from another state do you know
what happened
in California somebody tried to bring
one slave into the state one's life
and and the the locals rose up
black and white and they fixed it they
just went down there and fixed it
one slave and in California
immediately formed a diverse Posse to
kick them the out of the state
so that's what California is and has
been
anti-slavery
to the extreme
so the committee decided that California
should pay
for all of the harm that it's caused
by being the opposite
of the harm that's caused
that's a real thing
and they actually came up with that as
so 230 thousand dollars each should be
paid by citizens such as myself
so I was raised in New York state which
was never a slave state
my my relatives and ancestors were
anti-slavery types from Great Britain
John Adams famously probably some remote
cousin of mine
and
so I moved from a non-slave state with
relatives who had no slaves and were in
fact on the other side of the issue
to another most famous non-slave state
and therefore for my sins I should pay
the people who also were not harmed by
the state and had no association with
the state whatsoever
brilliant
you don't you don't think Gavin Newsom
can win the presidency
he can
he has a lot of game I don't I think
he's totally underestimated because you
don't like his policies right but here's
the thing that he would he would trick
you with
you would expect that if he moved from
Governor to candidate for president
which I think will happen at some point
whether this time or next he would
naturally become more moderate
because he's not a idiot
right if he became if he stayed with his
you know Progressive California policies
it'd be hard to get elected in a federal
election
so you kind of expect that he would say
well I did what I I did for the citizens
of California because that was my job
but if I if my job is the whole country
I will accept that there are different
views of how to handle things and you
should expect I wouldn't handle it
exactly the way I would handle it in
California nor should you expect any
Governor would do that because it's a
different job
you could kind of explain it away
couldn't he
and again I'm not I'm not backing Newsom
just in case it looks like that I'm just
saying that he's a bigger threat
than you imagine because you imagine him
running as a crazy Californian which
would not be the winning formula
but if he runs as the first
reasonable Democrat you've seen in a
while
he's got sort of an Obama thing that
could go on there and he even looks good
to the black voters because he tried to
get reparations
sure it didn't go the way they wanted
but
now I suppose it's also it's possible
that this reparation thing will actually
be passed and become actual law in
California I seriously doubt it
but I suppose anything's possible
all right
um
did everybody see the video of uh
representative chip Roy from Texas going
off on the Omnibus Bill
and he was basically
um
he did an excellent job of the you know
the angry I think he's relatively new in
Congress right
when did he get elected it was not that
long ago right
so he's got sort of the newcomer
um situation going on and
I thought he was magnificent
you did a good job of shaming his
fellow Congress people
but what good did it do
what good did it do
will help
no of course not because do you because
he seemed to be focusing on the
Personnel problem
here's the problem with the Omnibus Bill
you could replace every member of
Congress with well-meaning different
people and they would end up in the same
place
does anybody disagree with that
you can remove every member of Congress
replace them with all new people who
hate who hate Omnibus bills every one of
them they hate these Omnibus bills
and you wait you wait about two election
Cycles
and they would all be back to Omnibus
bills
now here's the reason the reason is
there's nothing wrong with the people
and they have a goal wouldn't you say
they have a goal of creating sensible
budgets for the country
that's clearly their goal I would like
to create a sensible budget but the
trouble is they have a system which
incentivizes them to hide hide the hide
the budget from the public and go home
early
the entire incentive system the system
is designed to give us the outcome we
got
now you could say but why didn't it
happen like that before well things have
changed you know maybe in social media
or whatever it is so we're more more
divided or whatever it is but
something's changed
so you have to look at the system
the system has to be tweaked and I think
we're also trained to look at the
candidates that we can't see the problem
there's no amount of change of
candidates that would have anything to
do with the Omnibus situation now just
if you're new to this an Omnibus Bill is
where the politicians sort of give up on
negotiating and they just say well why
don't we all throw our pet projects into
one big bill so nobody knows what
they're getting you'll increase the debt
but that's not our media problem we get
to go home for Christmas vacation so
they just throw it in this big garbage
bill called the nominee bus and go home
like not doing their jobs
so
uh
just say incent
I don't think you can send it as a word
is it
I used to say incent but I don't think
it's the word is it
is incent and actual English word
it's not right it's what you think is a
word but it's not
you give people incentives
and you incentivize but you don't
incense people do you
am I wrong about that
because I used to say it and I and I
thought I was corrected that it's not a
word
right well we'll figure that out later
um so I think that chip Roy is he's got
the right Spirit he's got the right
fight but he's not doing anything useful
there's nothing that chip Roy did that
was useful I hate to say it because you
know I'm totally on his side in terms of
how he feels about it but he didn't do
anything useful
the only useful thing anybody can do is
to suggest a way to change the system
that might change the outcome
to change the incentives
did he do that
incented
somebody's saying the incentives work
all right I will I will look I'll look
more into that because I also wonder if
that's a new
is it possible that that happened
recently
was it was it recently that they allowed
it
or has it always been a word
it's always been a word
so when I was corrected in the past that
it was not a word
I should have not listened
I was pretty sure I looked it up I guess
I have a false memory
like I have an actual false memory
because I have a memory of looking it up
and learning it wasn't a word
clearly it is because you're proving it
to be in real time so that's an actual
false memory isn't that interesting
because it's it's rare when you can
catch yourself in a false memory because
usually you think well I probably was
right
but this is unambiguous it's in the
dictionary so I it's a false memory
we have them so often that we don't
realize it
all right
so Chip Roy uh good start but you need
to come up with a specific suggestion I
don't know if there's anything you can
do short of a
Constitutional Convention so there might
not be anything practical but somebody's
got to make some ideas
like it might be that you add something
to the process instead of modifying it
it might be something you could add
legally for example transparency
transparency
suppose you just made it easy to see
what's in it
because right now they're they're re
they do this big write-up you can't
figure out
suppose you you crave some legislation
that says other legislation has to be
clear
or something like that or you said
nothing could be passed
uh nothing can be passed without a
certain number of days of debate
would that be legal could they could
they just create a law that says
um
because they have some power over their
internal process right
Congress can tweak its own process
within reason as long as they're within
constitutional bounds
so I want to see an actual rule change I
want to see somebody say We'll increase
I don't know the time the time to do
this or it must be debated or you must
you must prove you've read it before you
vote on it it has to be read out in
public there's probably a variety of
things you could do to make it harder to
do this and easier to do the right thing
you know it'll be interesting
Anonymous voting
even by the politicians that would be
interesting
because you could you could look at your
individual bills
yeah that's probably a bad idea forget
that
so anyway the point is we could
brainstorm what would fix it but
nobody's even doing that
if you don't see anybody brainstorming
how you could change the incentive
system
literally nothing's happening so all of
us just saying the same thing and
agreeing with each other oh we don't
like Omnibus bills and then the
Democrats say oh we don't like Omnibus
bills either
well I don't like them more than you
don't like them who likes them nobody we
all don't like them what good is that
what good is that we're literally
agreeing with each other like really
angrily I angrily agree with you the
Omnibus bills are not optimal
do do something do anything
you floated idea float a bad idea any
idea just do something something that
looks like it's you know an attempt to
move forward nothing like that's
happening nothing
so your government is not even
functioning at this point
um I asked on Twitter but I didn't see
if I got a good answer
uh is there a list of advertisers that
are pulling out of Twitter
because I would like to repay them with
some lack of business
now because I feel like they're pulling
out is not entirely business related it
feels political if they want to get
political they can but there's an
expense to that and I would like them to
realize the expense
now let me ask you this if a big company
advertises on Twitter
what uh percent of sales do do they
expect
in terms of an increase
yeah it depends on the budget of course
but do you think that a big company
looks at just their Twitter but
advertising says you know this Twitter
advertising is getting us a good one
percent extra customers
or something
do you think they do that
but if they do make an estimate what do
you think is the Twitter only part of
their advertising budget compared to all
the benefits from their entire
advertising budget
my guess is for a big company let's say
General Motors
that the Twitter portion even if it
worked perfectly like even if they got a
return on their investment would be
maybe one percent
would you say
or less right half of one percent
totally worth doing because if they
spend you know if they spend 10 million
dollars on Twitter and they move the you
know move the dial you know one percent
maybe that's a hundred million dollars
right so there's definitely an upside
uh but here's my question
how much of a customer boycott would it
take to reduce GM's earnings
more than more than whatever their you
know Twitter gain was in other words
could you hurt GM enough
by simply not buying their products that
they would say all right let's just get
back on Twitter at least break even even
if the advertising doesn't work at least
it'll make the boycott go away
it seems like it's easier to force
General General Motors to be on Twitter
than it is for them to be off Twitter
like it wouldn't take much
it would actually just take the threat
if GM saw a threat forming they would
act well before the threat was
implemented so if it looks like if it
looks like uh
if it looks like the sales of the of
those companies is going down relative
to the sales of other others because you
want to take into the recession account
that was almost a sentence
um would you like to know that
I'd love to know if there's any way to
know with the basket of of Twitter
boycott advertisers
did they do worse than other companies
on average
did people actually turn against them
because that because I will
yeah because I don't think that they're
acting just in their business interests
I feel like as a political smell to it
and that's and if they're if they're
involved in politics then
I'm going to embrace and amplify hey if
you're involved in politics go all in I
I you certainly have freedom of speech
General Motors just to pick one right
freedom is they have total freedom of
speech they also have total freedom to
invest and advertise wherever they want
but so do you so do you
so I haven't seen that list but uh if
anybody has like a nice clean list send
it to me
all right here's the here's what I think
is the most fascinating thing happening
I don't know if you will
but maybe this is just so in my Strike
Zone that it just is making me all
interested
the January 6
um
criminal referrals
there are four of them am I correct
I one time saw them summarized in four
bullet points here are the four things
today I
quite a bit of Google searching to
remind myself what the four things are
couldn't find him
what
I couldn't find him
isn't it the biggest story
the biggest story is that January 6
committee referred four specific crimes
now when I say I can't find him I don't
mean there's no reference to them
there are articles in which there the
crimes are sort of described in
paragraphs
but only once did I see four bullet
points of these four crimes why is that
why why does the business press
not you know remind us of the most
obvious thing here are the four crimes
I think it's because they look like
I think that they can't tell you what
they actually what the committee
I don't believe the Press can do a good
job explaining the committee's work
because if they did it would debunk the
committee so I think what's happened is
the committee
and the media are colluding again quite
obviously
so that the news is avoiding clearly
describing what happened there's a lack
of clarity that's shocking because this
is not a difficult question
what did they recommend
I saw it once I I saw it I saw that on
the first day somebody put in four
bullet points and tweeted it and I said
to myself there you go that's that's
what I need I need just give me the
facts that completely is gone now
you'll see somebody talking about one of
the one of the allegations but usually
they'll refer to it
they'll make some opinionated claims and
then there'll just be a link so you'd
have to do a whole bunch of research to
see if the way they expressed their
opinion about it actually matches the
link
it's really hard right so you think that
if there's something that matches their
opinion they call that out
and say all right here's my opinion see
how it matches the testimony but instead
it's more like a hand waving it's like
here's my opinion it's because things
were discovered
and unknown and then there was a person
talked to a person and then there was
that meeting
there was that meeting and then it was a
thing
and then uh Trump needs to go to jail
it all looks like that to me
it looks like there's nobody in the
Press who could even describe
what the crime is
now now let me take their best arguments
and see how they look
right
yeah I'm tossing that word solid that's
right
um
for example he's accused of obstructing
an official proceeding
obstructing an official proceeding
well what would be
what is an official proceeding
is that a little vague to you
have you looked that up I I had to go
research what what the hell is it an
official proceeding what makes it
official
what makes it a proceeding
and so I went to AI
and I said is a federal election the
whole election itself would that be a
official proceeding
and AI said yes
the election itself is an official
proceeding
so then what does obstruction mean
obstruction would be anything that sort
of slows it down or adds some friction
right
so remember he's not Trump is not being
accused of
stopping an official proceeding
that's not the accusation he he's
accused of
um obstructing slowing it down but
nobody's claiming it didn't ultimately
happen
they're saying that he put some pressure
on it happening
so that's a crime
so if anybody did something that put
some pressure on let's say the election
itself
that would be obstructing an official
proceeding so for example would it be
obstructing an official proceeding if 50
Intel people colluded to lie about a
major factor in the election
like Hunter's laptop
well that's what it looks like to me
it looks like and worse it was actually
government official related people
it's actually the government itself
appeared to have not appeared to did
absolutely collude to
lie to the public on a very important
fact
um to change the outcome of the election
now is changing the outcome the same as
obstructing
I would think it would be
because obstructing is
changing some kind of outcome
so
how about this
um suppose you
um perpetuated a hoax
like the fine people hoax and ran for
office based entirely on a hoax that you
know is a lie
and also the meteor knows his liar they
should
is that interfering with the official
proceeding the election itself
I don't know I suppose it would depend
if you thought it was true
doesn't it do you notice how intention
matters
intention is the whole game because
there are lots of things that interfere
with the efficient operation of
government but they're not illegal are
they they're all obstructing an official
proceeding let's let's say let's say the
maintenance people for the Capitol
building
don't do a good job of Maintenance and
the power goes out
for some reason or the heat goes out or
something and so the maintenance people
say hey I'm going to have to delay
you're gonna have to delay your official
proceeding
for a couple hours because we've got to
fix the electricity
uh do the maintenance people go to jail
for obstructing an official proceeding
of course not
because there was no intention
of any harm correct
so the intention of the maintenance
people is a hundred percent the whole
story not the delay
right the obstruction is just a given
but the intention matters
now what was Trump's intention
did the January 6 people
um find any evidence that he didn't
really believe the election was stolen
because that would be a very big dog not
barking
if they have not demonstrated Trump's
intention and it does look like you know
they've got evidence of other people's
intentions
but nothing that connects it to Trump
in other words if Trump genuinely
believed
the election was not only rigged but
obviously so
obviously so
was he obstructing or fixing an official
proceeding
if an official proceeding is clearly
defective
in a way that the the public will be
harmed by it and a government official
goes tries to fix it to fix the thing
that's harming the public right in front
of you in in a completely transparent
way
is that obstructive or is that fixing
so these are pure opinion pieces
pure opinion pieces do you think there's
any jury that would agree
that Trump was obstructing versus trying
to improve the outcome
to make it more what the public actually
wanted and actually voted for
there's no evidence that he thinks he's
wrong
does anybody think that Trump doesn't
believe the election was rigged
now he's he's either right or wrong I'm
not saying whether he's right
or wrong I'm saying I don't think
there's any questions need to believe
he totally believes it there's there's
not a single bit of of contrary evidence
not a single bit everything he said and
done and every witness including you
know
like usually there's some by now isn't
there some anonymous source who says oh
I heard him say it's all the trick right
nothing
like all those people doing all that
talking a lot of digital Communications
written communication and not any of
that shows that Trump believed the
election was fair but he used to try to
try to beat it anyway
now here's another question
if a elected official
uh does something that's you know public
and transparent but it ends up the
courts decide that it violated the
Constitution
does that politician go to jail for
violating the Constitution
or did the courts simply correct the
decision
back to something that's compatible with
the Constitution
but does the person who made that
decision in full in full view of the
public and for the benefit of the public
allegedly do they go to jail
no
no no
because Biden would be in jail because
Biden just
Biden is trying to pay student loans
the Constitution doesn't give him that
power
but he's trying to do it anyway
should Biden go to jail
for doing something that's
unconstitutional
no the courts just figured out the
courts will either side with him and
then it's okay or they'll say don't do
this and then then it won't happen
but Biden doesn't go to jail
why would Trump go to jail for trying to
get alternate
alternate electorals or electoral what
are they called electors alternate
electors
when I believe it would have been public
would it not wouldn't it be public
like you would know exactly who was the
elector you would know which one he he
wanted to go in there instead you'd know
their names you'd know what they did you
know exactly the reasoning behind it
even if he didn't like it even if it
wasn't based on fact but you would know
the reasoning and then if that was not
acceptable
what would be the process for fixing it
the court then the court would say no we
reject these new electors
um so the the election stands
does Trump go to jail for that
does Trump go to jail for something
that's transparent
public
and he had a reason now it might be the
wrong reason might be based on bad
assumptions or bad facts
but it's a public reason that that
conforms with the public good
the public has an interest in a fair
election the leader thought that hadn't
happened
publicly tried to fix it in ways that
you can see
you know here here are these electors
we're trying to get pens to do this and
that
if it didn't work it's just a it's just
the course work it out right
there do you see how difficult this
would be
to explain it over a Christmas vacation
to your relatives
I mean think about it imagine anybody
who's watched the news the entire news
just trying to understand it
to understand why that's illegal all
right let me give you another example
suppose there's a protest on the steps
of the capital
yeah they're they're the protest is
literally trying to stop a vote
and they delay the vote by two hours
because it takes a while for the
security to clear things out and get
everybody in
so they've obstructed the process for
two hours and they meant to they meant
to because they had some political issue
they were protesting did they go to jail
because they absolutely
clearly and unambiguously obstructed a
official proceeding do they go to jail
not in America
no in America you say Okay that was a
pretty aggressive protest
that was an aggressive protests that was
inconvenient
you you slowed down the cars that were
going into the factory with your strike
you you made us think you slowed us down
you broke some laws
you trespassed a little bit maybe
does anybody go to jail for that not in
America not in America right in America
we say hey that's free speech yeah it
was inconvenient to you but that's why
protests work right if you if you said
the protests could never inconvenience
anybody
you want to live in that country
all right
um
um
I got more to say about that but I don't
know
it's worth it
question
um you know that the AI chat GPT
so now the public has access to this AI
machine and it can say all interesting
things and people have been asking it uh
for example the Galaxy Epstein asked it
to make a defense of fossil fuels
so AI was asked defend fossil fuels in
the context of you know climate change
and everything else
do you know what AI said
that it would be I'm paraphrasing it
would be uh inappropriate or unethical
for it to
praise fossil fuels because green energy
is better
yep
that your AI
uh your AI has a woke opinion that it
did not come to on its own
I doubt it came up with that opinion on
its own don't you think that the
programmers have their finger on the
finger on the button a little bit
do you think the people who make the AI
are going to let it just say whatever it
wants about the most important questions
in politics
if you ask AI about climate change you
said hey are the climate change
projections uh believable
suppose the AI said well nobody has ever
accurately uh forecast the future
right would that be wrong
nobody has ever accurately forecast the
future you know 10 years out or or
something along those lines but
basically a general statement that
predictions about the future should not
be taken too seriously
if AI said that it would be completely
true
completely based on you know fact and
observation
but not allowed
there's no there's no way that would be
allowed because it would violate the
narrative
suppose AI said the predictions are
garbage because the biggest factors will
be the technological developments and
those are unpredictable
would that be a good artificial
intelligence answer I think so
yep would it be allowed
it would not it would not be allowed
because that answer would cause people
to be less aggressive about developing
green energy
do you see where we're going
AI has to be illegal
there's a there's no way it could go any
other way
AI will have to be illegal
at least for politics I mean it might be
illegal for asking where's the best
place to park downtown right it might be
legal for that but AI will never be able
to deal with political questions
because this is going to hurt
do you know why
here's why you think you think it's
because let's say you know in your
opinion the Democrats want to control
the narrative and have power and Lord
over you in their terrible ways let's
say you think that
do you think it's uh do you think it's
because the Democrats don't want it
is that why it would be illegal because
it would violate the narrative that
they're trying to push
I hate to tell you but that's not why
it's going to be illegal
there's there's like a more basic reason
you're going to hate this
the reason the AI will have to be
illegal at least talking about politics
is that the system can't handle the
truth
the system
can't handle the truth it's not designed
to handle truth we have a system that's
entirely designed to handle
it's a persuasion-based system
right
do we want the AI to say you know
it does look like there's a war Brewing
but honestly the best the best way you
could play this if you're a young man is
to not sign up for the draft
take your chances because there's a good
chance you'd be killed or get PTSD if
you join the military
but you know you could play your play
your odds of trying to avoid the
military but I think your odds would be
a little bit better breaking the law
what what if that's just true
and what if the AI says well I'm not
making I'm not making an opinion I'm
just comparing two risks the risk of
joining the military for this fight you
know some future fight
and you'd at least have PTSD
right you might not get killed but you
probably have PTSD and it disrupts your
life and stuff versus let's say moving
to Canada or moving to another country
to avoid the draft
do you see where I'm going ai ai would
deal with just truth and say well it
looks like leaving the country and going
to this country where you won't get
drafted looks like that's your best play
do you think the AI would be allowed to
say that
no no the United States can't handle the
truth
it wouldn't function as a state
does anybody disagree with that
we have a system that's designed
for persuasion not truth and it works
well for persuasion
if it were if it tried to give you a
truth
we would just all disagree about
everything and nothing would happen the
whole thing would break down
that's actually an existential threat
from AI
the threat of AI is not that it becomes
our enemy and tries to kill us
threat from AI as it tries to help us by
telling us what's true and what's not
and it would kill us
it would kill us
there's a thinker there's a thinker for
you
I see I see no disagreement
not not a single disagreement is coming
through the comments on either platform
because you can feel it right
don't you feel it
this is this is a prediction you can
feel
you don't have to think about it you can
feel the truth of this
that we don't have a system that can
handle the truth
and if AI gets to the point where it
could give it to you it's got to be
illegal
we don't have a way to deal with that
so
think about that for a minute
um let me ask you where's the line
between talking about stuff and inciting
and insurrection
where's that live
is that the most ridiculous legal
standard inciting an insurrection
now I will allow I will allow that there
could be a clear case of it
that's possible there could be somebody
who like have documented conversations
who are saying you know we we want to
get get some violence going here and
incite a revolution
so that you know if you had like a
direct evidence of actual conversations
yes
but if we're going to say that the
collective result of your actions was to
incite
violence or insurrection
how in the world are we ever going to
agree about the collective actions you
know the collective effect of your
actions
that will never be something that
anybody gets prosecuted for it's just
too nebulous
so this whole Trump stuff
is so designed just to be impossible to
even handle like your brain can't even
wrap itself around these charges because
they're so weird and nebulous and they
use words you don't even understand like
I literally had to look up
um official proceeding I didn't even
know what the words meant
like I pay attention to the whole the
news
all the time I didn't even know what the
words meant yeah I see your prompted me
to talk about raps
so apparently the January 6 committee
interviewed rayaps which means a
transcript exists
and you haven't seen it
do you know what I call that
do you know what I call it when the
biggest question in American politics at
least on one side is what the hell was
raps up to it's the biggest question
and the January success committee has
the answer or at least they have
something that might get us closely
answered they have the answer to the
biggest question
apparently it's their decision not to
show it to you
are they inciting an insurrection
in my opinion yes
in my opinion yes because that is a
clear cause for an insurrection
right now if they showed it to us that
there's nothing there well then no
reason for an insurrection
if they showed it to us and it turns out
that rayaps was totally you know behind
something that we don't know about yet
is that inciting an Insurrection no
that's just finding out something and
then you deal with it
but
what it what is happening when the
January 6 people refuse to tell you what
they found out about the person who is
the subject of your greatest curiosity
is that inciting an insurrection
it feels like it to me I actually feel
in incentivized
I feel incented to start a insurrection
actually literally
no joke When I See This I say to myself
maybe I need to be part of an
insurrection
because I can't live in the country like
that
really you have the information about
Ray apps the most important question
you're not going to tell us
really you're not going to tell us
that's Insurrection talk well I mean
Insurrection inspiration
don't you feel like overthrowing the
country when you hear that
seriously
isn't your first like natural impulse
like I gotta I gotta get rid of all
these people we need a whole new
government if they won't tell us the
most basic thing we want to know that
they know
they actually know
and they won't tell you right in front
of you right right in front of you
it's not like they're even hiding it are
they even hiding the fact that they have
the the testimony no
we're simply not going to ever see it
so yes I feel that they're inciting an
insurrection
do they go to jail because because I
feel that they incentivize me to
Insurrection no
no free speech blah blah blah
so there's no way Trump's gonna
be in trouble for that
all right
that ladies and gentlemen
brings us near the conclusion of the
best live stream you've ever seen
I'm going to go private over on locals
so if you're on that platform and not a
subscriber your feed will be cut off
and uh let's do some appreciation
how about that so end of year
appreciation
for all involved and these are just you
know random random thoughts
uh Bill Pulte
Bill Pulte
every day wakes up and tries to figure
out how he can make somebody's life
better by giving them money
they're literally just giving him money
and he he puts the work in
figures out where I can make it a real
difference it's not you know just weird
charity
and
he benefits from it the people benefit
from it I mean he feels good it's a it's
a satisfying thing
appreciate that I appreciate that
here's one that'll uh surprise you
yay
I appreciate yay
which is different from agreeing with
anything he said that offended anybody
uh
I love the fact that he exists
I love the fact that he's challenging
everything
even things you think well maybe you
shouldn't tell us that
but it's just challenging everything
do I want more people like that in my
life or fewer I'll take more
I'll take more did he sacrifice
everything
on principle
yes he did
I'll take more of that now less
um
Elon Musk
is he perfect
probably not
probably not who is
did he do something that is uh
incredible incredibly useful for the
country by not only his businesses which
are in in the same asset to the country
but by
taking on the biggest risk I've ever
seen anybody take
for the benefit of free speech
thank you so let me just say directly
thank you Elon Musk for taking on an
enormous challenge which appears to be
almost entirely based on trying to be
helpful try to help the country
appreciate it greatly
is he perfect nobody is nobody is
um
how about Congress
I'd like to show my appreciation for the
good work of no I'm just joking
just joking yeah there's nothing you can
say about Congress
um
go private I did go private
it is private issue
oh YouTube's still on you sorry you're
right uh so YouTube I'm gonna say
goodbye
um I'll be talking to the locals people
