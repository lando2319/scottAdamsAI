good morning everybody
and welcome
to the highlight of human civilization
and possibly some alien worlds that are
yet to be discovered
if you'd like to take it up a notch and
i know you do what's it take well not
much all you need is a copper mug or a
glass a tanker jealous or stein a
canteen jogger flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
it's the dopamine hit of the day if you
haven't heard a little bit of oxytocin
on top it's called the simultaneous sip
go
ah
yeah
that was good
better than usual
well i saw a video of a bunch of pilots
on strike
here's the video i don't know if you see
it on my tiny little phone
but a bunch of pilots in atlanta for
delta and american
is there anything about these pilots
that you detect as a pattern
is there anything about them
that i don't know it feels like they
have something in common
what is it
what is it
oh yeah
it's all a bunch of white guys of a
certain age
so there's a as you know an airline
pilot shortage does anybody know why
there is a pilot shortage
do you know what it costs
to become a commercial pilot
do you know what if somebody wanted to
go into that business
so you need a lot of flight time
that you'd have to do on your own give
me
take a guess
what do you think is a guess
how much would it cost to start from
zero
and get enough air time
to become a commercial pilot like those
people in the video what do you think
i think it's between half a million and
a million
that's why there aren't pilots
now um did you notice there are also
zero women there
at least in the marchers
and there were zero people of color
now i have a little insight into this
because my recent ex-wife just became a
commercial pilot
and so i can tell you a little bit i'm
no expert but i can tell you a little
bit about what it would take let's say
let's say you're a woman
and you want to become a commercial
pilot
what would it take
step one
and it's you don't want to skip this
step
step one is
marry a millionaire
and announce that your main ambition in
life is to become a pilot
if you skip that step i don't know that
there's another way to do it
honestly
now it's also necessary
there's a second step that happens after
that
after you marry a millionaire and spend
enough money to become a commercial
pilot
if you don't remember the video let me
show it again
uh marriages don't last
very long
if you're a woman who becomes a
commercial pilot let me let me just
throw that in there
so don't expect to stay married but
it's an excellent career and i recommend
it
um
here's a little psychology thing i read
today
i think it was in cnn
do you know how grocery stores and other
stores too always put flowers out front
have you noticed that
um
the and apparently there's a reason for
that
according to paco underhill the founder
and ceo of behavioral research
he's got a consulting firm he says that
when the shoppers uh smell the flowers
as they're walking into a store
the
it fires up their senses
and it makes them irrational
it makes them irrational so they're more
willing to buy stuff just because the
smell just sort of wakes up their brain
and
you know puts them in primitive mode
takes them out of logic mode
and i don't know
how much of that's true
oh about a little bit about this you've
heard the trick if you're trying to sell
your house
to have a an apple pie baking when
somebody comes in to look at the house
because the smell of the apple pie
or pumpkin i guess is good
sells the house pretty pretty fast
i would say that the most overlooked
sense
in our civilization is smell
and you know i don't have a sense of
smell at the moment it comes and goes
but the moment i don't have it
but let me ask you this
men
men only answer this question how many
of you men wear a scent
some kind of cologne aftershave
how many of you wear a cent
i'm seeing a lot of no's but a lot of
yeses
nope nope nope all right so the men are
saying yes and now now i'm going to ask
a question just for the women but don't
answer yes or no because it'll be
confused with the prior question
just say you like it or don't like it if
you're a woman
just for the women
do you like or not like
a man who has a
scent you know an intentional scent
like
or don't like
look at the women's answers now
one don't like so two door locks
but mostly like
and then there's some people would just
be allergic so that's a problem
it needs to be light like like like
depends on the scent of course it
depends on the scent
like
so interesting
um so here we have about
now after obviously i can't be uh
too exact when it comes to something
like
uh you know this statistics but what it
looks like is maybe half the men do not
wear a cent
but 90 of the women wish that the man
did
is that about right
did did you see that as it was just
basically answers going by but it looked
like about half of you don't wear an
intentional scent
but most of the women wish you would
now
how important is the scent
to closing the deal
if i ask the men
they're going to say not that important
but what if i ask the women
yeah
it's right at the top
it's right at the top
and here's the way it works
if the guy smells right
the brain will will become a less
careful shopper
just like the flowers in front of the
store
is the same effect
if you're a man
and you don't put some flowers in front
of your store you're ignoring the
science
right now the exception would be if
somebody's allergic and you know it or
something like that and there may be
some environments where there's just a
mixed crowd and you can't wear any scent
and you have to take that seriously
because that's a medical problem for
other people
but
if you're just going to take a
if you're just going to take the
scientific statistical path
for
for the amount of time it takes you to
do this
reach over
put it back
you would perhaps double your odds of
sex
ladies ladies back me up because there's
no man who believes that no man believes
what i just said i'm saying that for the
five seconds it takes you to pick it up
go
put it down you will double your odds of
sex
and look and look at the answers from
the women the women are saying yes
it's the same the same impact
you get to smell right
and they will imagine the other things
are right as well
it's not true
but they will imagine the other things
are more right if you get the smell
right
so three things
job gym membership and
take care of your scent
you get those three things right
you will rule
you rule
the dating world
or your
marriage i guess
well let's say that you want to go to a
july 4th to get together this weekend or
this whole long holiday weekend and
you uh want to get people all worked up
and having fights
get them in political arguments i like
to do this every holiday
tell you how to start the biggest fight
during your get-together with the family
here it is
it's just a little factoid
and it's reported by cbs
so you so the source is a left-leaning
source
cbs
and it was a major story but it's not a
recent story
so i linked it you can see it in my
twitter feed in case you want it
but the story says um
that uh
romney when romney ran in 2012 he was so
unpopular
says the story
right now this is how cbs is
characterizing the story
that romney was so unpopular that's
that's the reason given his unpopularity
that in 2012 a number of precincts in
philadelphia
romney got zero votes
not one or two even by mistake
but zero
now here's how the article started in a
number of precincts in a number of them
what do you think is the number
like if you see a headline that says in
a number of precincts
romney goes here just take a guess
before i tell you
in a number of
precincts
three to five two to seven
zero two what you would guess
oh damn it you know the answer
one of you knew the answer
all right are you ready uh hold i'm
going to give you the answer but i want
you to do this for me
put your hand under your chin before you
hear the answer all right
because if you hear the answer your chin
is going to go
and you might actually dislocate
so for
for your own safety
before i tell you the number of
precincts
in which
in which romney got exactly zero votes
in 2012 not one or two but exactly zero
the correct number hold your chin hold
it hold it
57
how's your
chin
50 seven
now just drop that big floating turd at
your barbecue
and watch the lefties try to tell you
that the election was completely good
in 2020.
yeah you know i believe and here's the
way to go
agree the agree with them that it was
good in 2020 and the election was
absolutely fine
but also
you know interesting
it's a weird little thing
probably not connected to the current
situation in any
discernible way
but it's sort of an interesting
historical note
that there were 57 precincts
that gave romney's zero votes 57
 zeros 57 zeros reported
in cbs right in front of your
face and they tell you that it's because
romney wasn't popular in urban areas
that's not true
that's not true
that's not true
there is no statistical way to
get zero votes in 57 districts
and shove this in our faces and
act like we're not gonna notice
except it worked
you didn't notice
but
if you want to wonder if our elections
are up
you don't have to wonder anymore
it by the way if this is true and i
guess you'd have to say maybe cbs has
the wrong numbers maybe
but if it's true
the 57 precincts had exactly zero romney
votes
we're done
we're done our election system didn't
work in 2012.
you can say that for sure
now i don't know if it got the wrong
answer it's possible that you know obama
would have been
handily you know elected under every
circumstance is possible
but you don't have to wonder if the
election is corrupt
that's been answered
now what was it that changed the
situation and
uh how did the system get upgraded so
such a thing wouldn't happen again
well that's not in the story
because the story doesn't need to tell
you how the system was fixed
because there was nothing to fix
the headline tells you that
romney was unpopular
so the way you fix that is run a better
candidate right
nothing wrong with the election system
according to cbs it's just that you have
this one candidate who's so darn
unpopular
that he gets zero votes
amazing google says 59.
um
oh yeah you're right it's 59. doesn't
change the story but
59. i wish i'd sworn with the correct
number it would have been
much better
anyway that's the country you live in
the elections uh oh let me say it
directly
you want to see me get cancelled
based on the cbs report a reasonable
citizen should conclude that our
elections were fixed in 2012 and that
nothing has happened since then that
would change that situation
so if cbs is correctly reporting the
only reasonable conclusion is that the
elections were completely rigged or at
least in philadelphia you can't go
beyond that that the election was rigged
in philadelphia
and that nothing has changed since then
a reasonable citizen
should be able to look you straight in
the eye and say there's no
chance that our elections are not rigged
does it mean
that trump won the election i don't make
that claim
i accept the election i don't come the
way it you know the way it was called
from the day it was called because
i still think we're better off trusting
the system
and fixing it than to throw out a system
right so we're still better off acting
as though that was a credible result
but we certainly should not expect that
it was
so if i'm still here tomorrow
that'll be a surprise
but if i get kicked off that cbs report
about 59 precincts having zero romney
votes is going to get a lot more
attention won't it
and that's the kill shot
that's the end of the
conversation
if it's true
i mean i could take a fact check on that
maybe the cbs report is wrong
but if it's true it's the end of the
 conversation does everybody
agree with that
there's nothing to say after that
you don't need any audits
you don't need any
you don't need any smoking guns
nope
you don't need to find a hanging chad
you don't need a thin ballot you don't
need any
trucks in the wrong area you don't need
any mules you don't need a thing
except 59 59
precincts with zero romney votes
it's not possible
all right
i've told you before about my favorite
uh
chinese operative
at least allegedly
he denies it
but chen waihu on twitter
i call him my nemesis because we've had
a number of interactions but he's the
best nemesis ever number one he's really
good at his job
and i can't lose sight of that because
it makes me laugh every time i see him
operating
so what he does is he waits for some
political story
and then he weighs in in the comments
to tell you that if you looked at the
context you know america is really a bad
place
and he adds the context
that changes the story a little bit to
sort of a chinese propaganda
view of things
now twitter labels his account
as affiliated with state media of china
so twitter is doing a good job telling
you you know watch out for this one this
is probably the chinese government
talking to you right now and i
appreciate that so that's something good
that twitter is doing
but but the funny thing is that chen
still operates
right with the label and he's even
complained quite accurately about the
label not being applied to other other
places and he's right about that too so
what i like about chen
is that when he
he criticizes the united states usually
not every time but usually it's actually
a good a pretty good point
and it might even be one that we would
criticize ourselves from so it's
it's wonderful to watch him work because
he's so good at it but here's here's a
tweet he did about biden and
when biden i guess asked the gas
companies to lower the prices
basically just telling them they're
making too much money and lower your
prices
and
jen
tweets to that he says
so biden said bring down the price you
were charging at the pump to reflect the
cost you're paying for the product and
do it now
uh and chen tweets at that and he says
now u.s president finally realized that
capitalism is all about exploitation
he didn't believe this before
he didn't believe this before
isn't that funny
because it's such a short tweet which is
what makes it funnier like he's not he's
not wasting any extra words jainism now
u.s president finally realized that
capitalism is all about exploitation
he didn't he didn't believe this before
it's such a good troll
it was even picked up by fox news you
know they did an article about it just
because it was such a funny troll
all right um
you know the story where uh trump
allegedly tried to grab the steering
wheel of the beast and maybe he tried to
strangle the
the secret service officer who was
driving to try to get him to drive
toward the january 6 protests
and i guess the secret service guy is
named tony ornato
and a xeon political commentator gave us
a little context
so the
alissa
farah griffin who lists herself as a cnn
political commentator
she said in a tweet that tony ornato
lied about me too
so the indication here is that the
person defending trump's behavior might
have a history of lying okay let's see
what that's about she said during the
protests at lafayette square in 2020 i
told mark meadows and ornato they needed
to warn press
uh warren press stage there before
clearing the square
meadows replied quote we aren't doing
that
tony later lied and said the exchange
never happened he knows it did all right
so here's a he said she said situation
in which a cnn political commentator
says that uh this specific
um secret service person
was a liar
now
i don't know about you
but
if i were to weigh the credibility of
two people by their backgrounds and
their professions
and one of them was a cnn political
commentator
and one of them was a secret service
agent that had been vetted
extensively
which one of those is more likely to
tell you
a true story
on a factual event
a cnn political commentator remember not
just the news the political news and
just not a news reader but a commentator
abundant if you will a cnn commentator
or a professional secret service agent
who would guard a republican or a
democrat equally
because that's their job
i don't know
so i thought i would be helpful because
uh alyssa farah griffin added some
context which actually is useful
that is useful context if it's true
if it's true
but it would be kind of two people's
memory of an event wouldn't it you
wouldn't really know which one was true
he said maybe she'll say maybe he'll say
something different than she said
but uh i i helpfully retweeted my list
of 11 cnn hoaxes
so that you could have further context
so now you know
there are 11 things that alyssa farah
griffin probably thought were true and
said so on tv i don't know specifically
which one she would have agreed with you
know the fine people hoax or the
drinking bleach one but probably all of
them
and
so she's got 11 strikes against her
probably you'd have to fact check that
to see how many of the hoax hoaxes she
bought into
and then allegedly tony ornato has one
uh communication example in which
there's some uncertainty about whether
who said what and when
so there's your setup
someone who bought into some number of
11 major hoaxes
versus somebody who had a brief
communication during the fog of war and
one person who's remembering it may be
different than the other so there's your
credibility check
well we're talking about whether trump
will announce
he might announce in july just to get
his platform back because if he
announces he'll be interviewed on bigger
platforms etc
yeah but if he waits he can wait till
the midterms are over and not interfere
with that so nobody knows what he's
going to do but i guess he's chomping at
the bits people say that's what they say
let me suggest a campaign strategy for
trump if he decides to run
if trump decides to win allow me to give
you
the winning strategy
and the funny thing about this is it
would actually work
there's no way you'd ever do it because
it sounds funny
but it would work
all he'd have to do is announce his
presidency and then go hide in the
basement for the rest of the election
cycle
that's it
and he would become president
the only thing that could stop him from
being president is talking
am i right
only talking can prevent him from being
president and what he wants to do is
have a bigger opportunity to talk
so the one thing that could prevent
trump from being president is the only
thing he wants
the one thing that will prevent him from
being present
i don't know
yeah well that and the elections being
fair i suppose that matters
so
let me ask you about adam kinzinger
and i'm going to take a fourth of july
frame on this
and you know adam kinzinger is you know
republican who's acting like a democrat
when it comes to the january 6 hearings
and i guess he's retiring from congress
he's not going to run again
here's my take on him
forget about the politics for a minute
he's also a veteran
i'm no medical doctor
but i think adam kinzinger needs some
actual medical help
like psychological something like that
and i'm serious and this has nothing to
do with politics this has only to do
with the fact that he's a veteran
so if i can just say politics don't
matter for a moment and i just watch
adam kinzinger operate in public
i say to i say to myself
i feel like he needs some help
like actually legitimately like i
actually have empathy i'm not making a
political point has nothing to do with
his politics nothing to do with trump
nothing to do with anything
i mean you can read it on his face
there's something distressing going on
and so in the interest of
you know july 4th maybe the one day we
can pretend to be together
i'm going to value his service to the
country higher
than his politics
and i think that his service to the
country um
sort of obligates us to take care of him
and i don't think he's being taken care
of
i worry about that
does anybody else see the same thing am
i the only one who sees it because
remember he's not running for office
anymore
so if i say you know it looks like he
needs some help it's not because i want
to prevent him from
getting his message out or i'm not
trying to degrade him politically he's
already out of the game i'm saying he
looks like he needs help
you could read it all over his face
and i don't know if that has anything to
do with what he's doing in public but
i'm willing to separate that for this
discussion he looks like a veteran
who looks like he's in distress
i just hope he's getting the help he
needs that's all
and just try to separate that from
politics for for a moment
um
well what else is going on
the here's the thing i'd love to see
some republicans say in public you know
i said it on a tweet but it feels like
this needs to be in public
everything about the
january 6th event
depends on one assumption
and first of all give me a check on this
do you agree
that everything we understand about
trump's actions during that time depends
on one key assumption
which is did trump really believe the
election was stolen
genuinely
or was he pretending to believe
because it would give him some advantage
to try to take over the country as a
dictator
now
we could say with all with all clarity
that we don't know what he was thinking
right
we don't know
but why would you take the least likely
assumption
there are several assumptions you could
make one is that he actually was trying
to
take over the country
and he thought he could do it with some
kind of legal machinations and he hadn't
quite worked out the details but at the
very least he wanted to get some you
know fake electoral
votes in there
maybe
that's that's entirely possible based on
what we've seen
that hypothesis
seems to generally sort of kind of
affect the facts a little bit
i mean it's not ruled out by the facts
is it we haven't seen anything that
rules it out
but you can't prove a negative either
so
but here but here's the other take the
other take is that he genuinely believed
the election was rigged and that it was
obvious
now i'm not saying that that's not my
opinion
not my opinion
i'm just saying that
he could have easily had that opinion so
if you were going to take those two
hypotheses as you're starting assumption
and and the one you take determines all
the rest
everything else is determined by that
assumption
because if he believed it was really a
rigged election
and he was trying hard to delay things
and stay president long enough to figure
it out
then he is george washington
he's a hero he didn't succeed
but he would be a hero who tried to stop
a horrible
uh injustice of the country
right if you made that assumption we
don't know
but if he made that assumption he's a
hero he just didn't succeed
if you make the assumption that he knew
the election was legitimate enough and
that he really lost
well then he's a traitor
and
you know belongs in jail
or if it's crime i don't know who knows
what's the crime these days
so don't you think that everything
relies on that now
correct me if i'm wrong
everything springs from that
because you could imagine that he would
now let me put this in context for you
one of the big complaints is that he
didn't stop the protesters
well if you believe the election was
actually illegitimate would you stop the
protesters
no you wouldn't that wouldn't be the
right play
because you'd want people on your side
you'd want to make a big deal about it
you want the press to cover it you want
everybody to know you'd want the most
people there
would you
if you believe the election was
legitimately stolen
and it was obvious i'm not saying it was
i'll say that every five seconds that's
not my opinion
but if you believe that
would you put up with some extra risk
to the vice president
under that weird weird condition
that you really believe the election had
just been stolen
somebody says no interesting i thought i
was leading you too and toward a yes the
correct answer is yes
the correct answer is yes you would put
up with greater risk
in all areas
not just the risk to the vice
president's
safety you would increase your risk for
everything
appropriately that would be the right
play you would increase all of your
risks
to take care of what you saw was even a
bigger risk
if you believed it
that the election was rigged which is
not my opinion
all right so
every single part of that now the
hanging obviously
that
yeah i wouldn't believe any reporting
about
um trump thinking
that pence should be hung
that doesn't mean it's unbelievable to
me
but let me put it this way and i'm going
to use the really test you remember the
really test is where you state a fact
that somebody's trying to tell you is
true
and then if you can make it look
ridiculous with one word it probably
isn't true and then one word is
really
are you really trying to make me believe
this
really all right let's do that test
with this so the question is did trump
believe
that the election was rigged so put
yourself in trump's head it's impossible
but do the best you can
you're president trump
everything is about winning
he says so right it's win win win it's
all about win he's a winner he's got to
be a winner he can't lose he's got to be
a winner he's sure he's going to win
he's sure he's going to win it's it's
midnight it looks like he's won demi
he's won then he wakes up to find out
there was something that he can't yet
explain turns out it was the late
ballots but he couldn't yet explain
that looked really sketchy
it looked like it was rigged if it
wasn't we don't know
but it looked like it on day one
so put yourself in his head
and here's the question
do you really think he lost
really
do you think in his personal mind he saw
those irregularities that came at the
end of the night which i think have been
explained by the way as lay ballots that
typically favor democrats four reasons
that we can discuss
but i think they're explained
but they had not yet been adequately
explained at that time so remember you
have to go back to the time and know
that there had not been all the
allegations that had been debunked by
then there were still plenty of
allegations but not a lot of debunking
going on yet
you put yourself in his head
his mindset that he thought he won he's
he's got to win winning is everything
and then surprisingly
with great sketchiness in some of the
observed facts
he amazingly loses
you tell me you look me in the face
if you're a democrat look me in the face
and you tell me seriously you
think that he didn't believe he won
really
really
i mean seriously
this is not you and it's not me this is
trump you really think he didn't
think he won
or at least suspect
it was very likely that there was
something going on
of course he thought it was something
sketchy
he just got through the the entire
russia collusion hoax
if you had done the subject of the
russia collusion hoax would you believe
that the next election was going to be
fair
the russia collusion hoax proved to us
that the democrats would break any law
tell any lie to keep him out of office
and now you've got a situation where it
looks exactly like that's what happened
that's not my opinion but it looked
exactly like that's what happened it's
been explained in my opinion but
it looked like it
now you tell me that you honestly think
honestly i mean seriously it's just the
two of us here this is conversation
between
me and some anti-trumper hypothetically
it's just the two of us in the room i
want you to look me in the eye and tell
me seriously that you believe
trump actually thought he lost
seriously
really
have that conversation with see somebody
with somebody and you know how it'll go
they'll change the subject
do something else bad
do something else bad that trump did
another time
there's nobody who could deal with that
direct
assumption challenge
so the direct assumption you need to
challenge is you tell me that trump
thinks he's a loser go ahead
good
tell me that you think that trump
everything you know about his
personality that when he lost the
election said yeah well turns out
it turns out i'm a loser and i lost to a
brain dead guy
do you think he accepted that
well that's what we asked to believe
that he actually thought he lost and he
acted uh as if he didn't
ridiculous
now i don't know what he was thinking so
i'm not going to take the trap of saying
i know what he was thinking
i'm saying that if you don't know what
he was thinking assuming the least
likely one is not a smart play
well newsome is getting active looking
like he wants to be a candidate for
president i think everybody assumes that
and so he's uh he's saying some stuff in
public against desantis to try to blunt
desantis
in case desantis becomes candidate and
in case newsome does
but
here's what caught my eye on cnn there
was a
i'm not sure if it's an opinion piece or
not
this one's hard to tell it's a newsy
opinion piece i guess
but um it was written by edward isaac
devere and steve contorno for cnn
and
um
here's what they said this is the first
sentence of their article
and listen to the language they use this
so we're looking for cnn to be shifting
toward the middle so i'm looking forward
in their language
all right here's the story it says gavin
newsom and ron desances aren't just
avatars for the different futures of
their parties
but also for the separate realities blue
and red america are living
in two people of opposing viewpoints
looking at exact same set of facts and
coming to vastly different conclusions
does that me
was that me
what do you think
because cnn just
i mean this is not an exact quote of
mine or anything but
i'm the person who told you
that we were living in two realities we
were not living in a reality in which
some people were smart and some were
dumb or that some had different
preferences that's the old way the new
reality is we're looking at the same
facts and we don't even perceive it as
the same reality
that was me
has my influence reached cnn
what do you think
because i i don't know the answer that
you know it could be coincidence it
could be
it's just in the zeitgeist and other
people are coming around to it something
but it looks to me
um so and this would get to your
question sometimes you ask
you know what can one person do
how much influence can one person have
on the world
you see it all the time you see one
person changing the world all the time
in fact
smart people have noted before i said it
that
one person is the only thing that's ever
changed anything
it's not a case of one person can't
change the world it's literally the
opposite
it's always one person
who gets other people involved but it's
always one person
one person changes the world every time
you but you have an option to make it
you i guess that's one of your options
all right
it used to be just you're wrapping this
up
correct me if i'm wrong but it always
used to be that we said one group is
anti-science
or one group is not paying attention one
group is dumb one group is selfish we
had all these different explanations
but cnn right up front looking at the
exact same set of facts and coming to
vastly different conclusions
i have trouble imagining that didn't
come directly from me
directly as in through other people
until cnn didn't know it came from me
right
i mean i doubt that they would identify
this coming from me but it came for me
i'm pretty sure of it
80 sure
i'll leave some doubt i'll say 80 sure
that came from me
um have you seen the video of the
patriot front
marching in boston these are the people
who look exactly like feds pretending to
be protesters so they wear their khakis
and nice shirts and stuff and they've
got the masks on and the matching
outfits
and they don't seem to be asking for
anything in particular they just march
around looking provocative and uh and
right wing
so
uh i've decided that the patriot front
is what i call the the office depot of
protesters
and i have to tell you a story to make
that make sense
so years ago
office depot uh agreed to use dilbert my
character
as part of their advertising campaign
for television and for me it was a
really big deal because imagine you know
snoopy for metlife it's like a gigantic
licensing opportunity and if it worked
dilbert would have been maybe possibly
you know forever the brand of office
depot
and uh that would be a profitable thing
for me
so i worked with the ad campaign to make
the commercials and they wrote the
commercials and i had
basically no input except making sure
that dilbert looked like dilbert
basically
and the commercial ran
and it became a big thing a lot of
people saw my
my character on television and people
would stop me all the time in the street
and they'd say hey hey i saw your
your dilbert commercial for office max
i said no it wasn't office max that's
the competition
the commercial dilbert was in for was
for office depot
the biggest competition to office max
and then somebody else would come up to
me and say hey that's great you're
finally doing you know some tv
commercials i saw you advertising for
office max i said no no somebody else
said that too that's funny
but it wasn't officemax it was office
depot the competition
25 people later
all 25
said i saw your commercial for office
max
all 25
not a single person
knew that i was advertising for office
depot none not one
and do you know why
because office max was a little more
famous
and the commercial started out talking
about office supplies and it wasn't
until the very last part of the
commercial it showed the name office
depot
nowhere in the beginning of the
commercial did a show who you were
advertising for
and so people's natural psychology is
you look at the first part of the
commercial
and you're not really paying attention
because it's commercial and then you
stop thinking about it for a while and
then it ends
so i called the advertising people i
said we you got a huge problem here you
are literally running
commercials for the other
side do you know what they said to me
and i told them why and i said everybody
who sees this thinks it's officemax
because they see dilbert they see office
supplies they think of the major brand
in that space and then they're done
and do you know what the advertising
people said
they laughed
they're like now when basically they
said we do this for a living
you know sort of you know go go draw
your cartoons cartoon cartoon boy
this is sort of our domain
totally blew off my um
thing and the
the sales for office depot when they ran
their major tv campaign absolutely flat
no difference
they could see that their advertising
campaign completely
failed didn't make any difference in
sales
office max did pretty well
office max did well during that period
so they dropped dilbert as their
advertising you know avatar because it
didn't work
and i said to them i'm not sure it was
the dilbert part that didn't work
i think that didn't work part is a human
advertisement for your for your uh
for your competitor
so
here's what's wrong with the patriot
front
they may in fact be uh some kind of
shadowy right-wing organization
maybe
they might be what they want you to
believe they are
but
i don't know a single conservative who
isn't laughing at them for obviously
being feds in other words it's the
office depot problem
they're running a commercial
to make you think there's this scary
shadowy
group of conservatives that are forming
and you better worry about them and the
conservatives are saying oh there's the
feds doing a commercial again
we actually think it's a commercial for
the fbi
am i wrong
it looks like a commercial for the fbi
it's a complete failure for whatever it
was supposed to do but i will allow that
the people who are tweeting about it on
the left
seem to think it's real
so
it does sort of work
yeah and it's my opinion that the
charlottesville
uh thing was at least backed by
some entity that was you know not
organic
so i don't know the full story there but
i don't think that was an organic
event it was organized
but by whom and paid by whom
no no
that would be a good question
all right
and then i saw that some on the left are
calling this patriot front cowards
because they're not wearing matches or
i'm sorry because they're wearing masks
um and i like to and then i tweeted this
i said the least useful
the least useful people in every
conversation
which tends to be about 25 percent of
the public coincidentally
are the bad mind readers calling other
cowards
anytime you see a big news story
and somebody weighs in to say that the
people in the story are cowards
you can ignore everything that those
people say for the rest of your life
because that is the lowest level of
analysis and almost always wrong
do you remember when the 9 11 attack
happened
and
a lot of the
politicians were calling the terrorists
who gave their lives
for their cause
we called them we called them cowards
and i remember thinking that like we are
so far off
on what's going on here i don't know
what's going on i mean it was still fog
of war but there's one thing i do know
people who do suicide attacks are not
operating from cowardice
that i know
and if you if you even start with that
as your explanation about why anybody's
doing anything nobody does anything at a
cowardice except run away
right if you do see if you see something
doing something aggressive
people are not aggressively cowardice
cowards it's the opposite
if they run away or they don't get
involved you can say well you're cowards
and you might be right but if you see
somebody you know dressing up and
organizing and marching in the streets
whatever they are
and i don't know it's a sketchy looking
organization but whatever they are
they're not cowards that's the only
thing you can know for sure
because they're literally taking a risk
right in front of you
so what do you call it when people take
a risk for whatever the cause is right
in front of you
not cowards
as soon as you say cowards
[Laughter]
i see your comment that i'm not going to
say that aloud
somebody's
somebody clever suggested another c word
to call them but we're not going to use
that one here because their name is not
shelley
um
not shelley my ex but shelley's somebody
else and
all right so you've heard about this
liberal uh world order that the bind
administration has referred to they
haven't defined it what it is the
liberal world order but apparently we're
supposed to sacrifice as citizens
by paying higher gas prices
and if you pay higher gas prices long
enough
then we'll solve climate change and get
to a
liberal world order that's that's the
proposition but i wonder if there's
anything else we need to know
all right is is high gas prices the only
thing we have to sacrifice because i
didn't see it coming did you
do a year ago when you have said to
yourself you know
the only way we're going to get to a
liberal world order is if i pay higher
gas prices well i didn't i didn't
anticipate that maybe you didn't either
but it makes me wonder are there other
things we have to sacrifice
to get to the liberal world order that
we don't even understand and probably
don't want
so um
i don't know should we pay more for
other stuff too
to get to this world order
is there any should i shave my head or
chant is there anything else i need to
do to get to this liberal world order
which apparently is an awesome thing and
we should be running toward it
doesn't sound scary at all
not at all
one more comment about the patriot front
and i'm not going to say this too loud
but
here's a little hint for analyzing the
patriot front
it has the word
front
right in the name
the name of the organization
is that they're a front for patriots
literally they're calling themselves an
artificial fake organization
that is covering up the fact that
they're hiding something behind them
they're a front
a front for patriots
it's actually in the name
why can't
dude do you remember maya angelou's uh
quote
when somebody tells you who they are
believe them the first time
or when somebody shows you who they are
believe them the first time is that how
it goes if they show you who they are
believe them the front time they just
told you they're a front
it's writing the name
it's writing the
name all right
um
there's a funny viral video
of i think it's portland some white
woman let's call her karen
gets into a verbal altercation over some
traffic incident
with a
gentleman who is a person of color i
don't know what he's he might be
hispanic he might be native american not
sure what he is
but he gets in this
heated conversation in which
uh he calls her a white colonizer with a
white colonizer mindset
and then she gets all bad because he's
making it all racial and really it was
just a traffic thing and then she goes
extra karen
and so she goes extra care and then he
goes extra awoke and it's like karen
versus woke and they're shouting it out
and i've never enjoyed a fight more than
that
like if you i've never paid for like an
mma fight
but
if you want to see a karen versus a
uh awoke guy complaining about white
colonizer mindset
you would pay for that fight
you put those two in the cage and i'm
gonna i'm gonna start shouting out some
money for that stuff
but it's worth saying you have to see it
but uh when she was saying she makes it
all about race
um i saw a quote from
somebody else who i wish i had written
down to give them credit
but
somebody tweeted it's all about race to
the bottom and i thought about that
as a
maybe a slogan let's say you're a
republican and everything gets turned
into race
suppose you said if you make it all
about race just understand it's a race
to the bottom
it's pretty good isn't it
somebody says oh this is about race
you're doing this because of race you're
racist
and instead of dealing with like the
specific complaint
you just you just do a global one it
just takes care of all of it you just
say you know if we make it all about
race
we can
we do have that option we can make
everything about race but just
understand
it's a race to the bottom
there's only one direction that goes
if that's where you want to put your
attention
it's a free world you can do that but
just understand where it takes you it
takes you to the bottom
if you're thinking in terms of
you know we're all americans
that's a way to help us all rise
but as soon as you make it about race
it's a race to the bottom
and it's a clever use of the word race
in two contexts
and the reason it works
so well in my opinion is because the
brain is not clever enough
to quickly make the change that it's the
race is being used in two ways i mean
you do see it
but just takes a moment and in that
moment that's when the the thought slips
by
so right you it's basically a
distraction at the front door and then
somebody slips by
that's your persuasion tip
for the day
all right um
i would like to issue a public apology
if i may
to travis barker
a drummer for blink 182
and when he was hospitalized for
allegedly some pancreatic damage that
happened during an endoscopy
i said to the story hmm
did he really get an extremely extremely
extremely rare problem complication
or
is it exactly what it looks like because
pancreas you know maybe there's some
drinking in his history or something
like that
now i made
a what would you call it a uh
what what did i do
i i stereotyped them yeah i made an
assumption i stereotyped it
and i said that based on the reporting
very unlikely that this is some kind of
medical complication and more likely
it's a cover story
i publicly apologize
to travis barker for even suggesting
that there was another possibility
because we have some more information
now i'm not saying that this is right
but i do i completely withdraw my
prior insensitive speculation because
apparently he was having a polyp removed
now having an endoscopy
to me is just looking around right
am i wrong about that the endoscopy is
just looking around
but removing a polyp that's not an
endoscopy is it
or does that correlate with it somehow i
mean you look for and then you remove it
separately so he had something removed a
polyp and that he said it was a very
small polyp
removed right in a very sensitive area
usually handled by specialists
which unfortunately damaged a critical
pancreatic
drainage tube
now having now heard a more full
explanation
they say it's removed endoscopically
okay so i'm thinking that the correct
answer is you use the endoscopy to both
look
and also to remove a polyp you would use
that word endoscopy in both of those
all right so people are saying yes
so let's assume that what it is so when
when the story was just it sounded like
they were just looking around i said no
i don't i don't think you're damaging
his pancreas just looking around
and then when i say the removing a polyp
in a sensitive area i go oh okay
if you would if you had told me that
oh polyps are removed during the end
endoscopy okay so somebody's giving me
some more information
so had i understood
that it was an operation
as opposed to a looking around i would
not have jumped to that um conclusion
and i'm not sure if the polyp removal
was part of the first story i don't know
if it was
so
uh in the
spirit of which i like to be generous to
other people who make big boneheaded
mistakes like this one
i would like to ask for the
488 hour clarification i don't know if i
was in under the i may have missed the
deadline in 48 hours but i would like to
the same um
same understanding
that i offer publicly to anybody who
clarifies or corrects within 48 hours
because we all make mistakes
i would call this just a mistake on my
part with no
you know i'm explaining it away by
saying you know the news was confusing
but that's on me too
so it's all on me
all right
uh sunovitch bagged on jordan it's a bad
look thoughts well i heard mike
cernovich reached a million twitter
users
uh today
and here's the question that i have
could trump get elected without mike
cernovich being on board
because i don't know what would happen
if it came down to you know two-person
race
like if it's a two-person race would
cernovich
sit it out
or would he back would he back the
democrat or an independent i mean
i don't know
i don't know
so it's actually a very
interesting opinion
i don't know that i don't know that
trump could get elected without
without somebody as powerful as
cernovich being on board
and i suppose it would depend how he
decided to treat it if he sat down maybe
that's okay
but if he decided to make trump not
president
i feel like he could do it
what do you think it's just a
hypothetical
but if cernovich actually wanted to
prevent
trump from winning the election
his i i think his reach is big enough at
this point
i think he could do it
i don't know i'm not saying you would or
want to or anything like that that's you
know
he's unpredictable which is exactly why
you should follow him
if you want to follow somebody that you
don't know what he's going to say
follow ceravich
i never know what he's going to say
but it's always something high value
even even if it's all over the place he
does a lot of topics
from lifestyle to politics
and health and all that stuff but it's
always surprising every time i read one
of his tweets i'm like well okay i
wasn't thinking of anything that way
all right
um
and that let's talk about who's going to
be president
the main topic
um somebody asked me about jordan
peterson and
uh cernovich now i don't know what that
was about so i can't speak to that right
now but i did see that jordan got
suspended by
jordan peterson got suspended by twitter
i don't know if he's back he he would
need to remove a tweet
about
elliot page
who is
transitioned to elliot
famous
had been a famous actress and i don't
want to dead name anybody so if i'm
using the wrong words
just understand that i'm not doing it
intentionally
so
so what jordan peterson's tweet was
about
was he used her
there i did it again
jordan peterson used him
elliott page
uh
as an example to rail against his
opinions about transitions etc
now
i think that he was uh
he was suspended for targeting somebody
for harassment
that's my guess because he wrote an
article in which he said it's not clear
why he was suspended because they don't
give you specifics but in my opinion
they probably thought he was targeting
somebody for harassment now have you
ever seen anybody target anybody for
harassment on
twitter it's all anybody does
that's like the full-time job of twitter
targeting people for harassment am i
right
but i guess it depends how you target
them
how you target them
if you target them for their sexual
choices you know their gender and stuff
or their race
then i guess that would be over the line
if you're targeting them for their bad
opinions or being dumb or you just don't
like their work or whatever i suppose
that's still legal
but do you have a problem
with the fact that jordan peterson made
his point
by
singling out a specific individual
because i do have a problem with that i
do have a problem with that and actually
if i were him i would have removed the
tweet
i would not have removed my opinion
because his opinions are spinning
but i would remove the tweet because
when twitter said you're you're sort of
targeting this person for harassment i
kind of agree with that
i mean i agree with the
if that's what twitter did it for i
agree with the statement that it does
target one person because the question
is not about that one person
the question is about the larger
question
and i think we would all agree that for
any one person
their choices are you know they might be
right now i believe the context was
pride right
so i'm trying to remember the context i
think jordan peterson said that pride
used to be considered a sin
but that we have an entire pride month
now where we're treating pride of your
your gender your sexuality we're
treating that as if it's something to be
proud of and i think his point was
pride in general
isn't a good idea or at least we always
thought it wasn't a good idea in the
past and
why would this be the exception
that's a reasonable good question
because i make the same point about
white supremacists as i will now make
about the lgbtq community
when white supremacists say they're
proud to be white or they they show some
like
some connection to great things that
white people invented in the past
i always say the same thing it's like
that wasn't you like why are you proud
about other people
how did you get that how do you get to
be proud of other people there's
strangers you never even met edison
don't be don't be taking any pride
because he was white and you're white
how in the world you have proud boys
that's a special case
but i say the same thing about gender
i'm the most open-minded person
i've ever met i mean some people could
tie me but nobody could beat me
in terms of open-minded about how people
get to live their life and their
lifestyle and their choices you can't
you can't get left to me
on that
you know you could try but you'll never
get left to me on letting people live
their life the way they want to live it
you know if they don't bother other
people
and so i could not be more pro lgbtq
plus
i'm as on board as you could possibly be
but
why does it make sense to be proud about
it
right so the very reason
that i'm completely accepting
is because everybody's the same
as soon as you add pride in there
it's like
huh i'm not really
proud of being heterosexual i'm just
heterosexual
right
could i be proud of it
and would that even make sense
because the moment i become proud of
being
heterosexual
am i not a bigot
like at the same time the moment i say
i'm proud of being hetero
i'm a big at that very moment right
am i wrong
i said i'm proud of being white then i'm
a racist am i not if i say i'm proud of
hetero then i'm a bigot against lgbtqp
but why does it work the other way
why why do you get to be proud to be gay
i totally get that you don't need to
explain it to me
i totally get it's none of my business i
totally get everybody's equal in that
way
i totally get all that i'm on board as
on board as you can be but proud
really
the moment you say you're proud
i've got questions
i could not be more of your ally if you
just want to live your life
and keep me out of it i could not be
more supportive of that
but proud
that's asking me to take a step
that feels a little distasteful to me
because
i'm not going to be proud
of the things i had nothing to do with
what what did i work hard to become
hetero well i was born gay
but i put in the hard work to turn
hetero and man am i proud
no
no
don't be proud of your sexuality
why would you be proud of that
it's just what you are
norm mcdonald was hilarious on being
proud of your gay son
i don't even know what that comedy
routine is but it's already hilarious
scott how do you develop a critical
thinking you watch this live stream
or you buy my book loserthink which
teaches you how not to make mistakes
all right um
here's a question for you so bezos jeff
bezos basically is uh
saying stuff about biden now so biden
made some inflation claims told the the
gas companies to told the oil companies
to just lower their prices
and
bezos tweeted ouch inflation is far too
important a problem for the white house
to keep making statements like this
basically
bezos has been
criticizing
the biden administration biden in
particular
for acting like he doesn't understand
anything about inflation or economics
and jeff bezos is saying this directly
they're acting like they don't even know
what
like any of this is or how anything
works
and
here's my question
could biden ever win reelection without
jeff bezos on his side
do you think he could i don't think so
because bezos owns the washington post
the washington post
pretty much has to back the democrat
a candidate
and if they don't
you're going to get another candidate
i feel like bezos not only could take by
to now and just did
in my opinion he just took biden out
imagine you're all the democrat
important people and you just saw that
bezos
just threw biden under the bus
are you gonna say let's run them anyway
oh we lost bezos
but i think we could get elected anyway
i don't know
i'm not in i'm not entirely sure anybody
would make that decision but here's
something to
toss in the ring
i said by tweet that all bezos would
have to do to become president himself
is to apply for the job
and tell us that his policy will be to
do stuff that works for a change
that would be it
just apply for the job you know fill out
the forms don't do any campaigning
and have your slogan be your slogan is
your entire campaign
um
let's do stuff that works for a change
right
now you you imagine
as i imagined the bezos is left-leaning
right would you all agree bezos is
left-leaning
but do you know what else he is
i mean he probably is i'm guessing
but do you know what else he is
he's a guy who understands systems
better than
maybe anybody
ever
ever
and proved it
because amazon is a system
and you have to be a systems thinker and
think about all the parts and keep them
in your mind and how they fit
to build an amazon
amazon is a system of systems it's just
systems on systems and if you have
somebody who thinks in terms of systems
but
leans left which i equate with empathy
really in this case more like an empathy
to individuals as opposed to a set of
policies
that would be your perfect present
that's your perfect present
leans left philosophically
leans right
systems wise
leaves left philosophically
leans right in terms of making stuff
work
test it
see if it works if it doesn't work don't
do it you know don't don't have a some
kind of philosophical hold on a
particular way of doing things just
release on the philosophy and say well
if we can test it
see if it works what does amazon do
better than anybody except apple
computer and google it tests stuff
they're always testing continually
testing right so if you've got a
president who is who was born and raised
in systems and testing
that's your best president
that's your best president
lean's left
for empathy leans right for systems you
could not beat that and i would i would
support him on day one i doubt i'd ever
change my mind so if he ever decided to
be president let me say it publicly jeff
bezos if you ever decide to run for
president i would totally back you
without even hearing your policies
because
i know that he would not present a
policy that didn't make sense
and if he did if he had a policy that i
didn't agree with
i would stop believing i was right
immediately
immediately and i would listen to what
he said
he's that smart
now that's not true of everybody
if
desantis said something i didn't agree
with
i wouldn't automatically suspend my
opinion to listen what he had to say i'd
listen to it it might change my opinion
but if jeff bezos said
something that was just directly
opposite of what i believed would be a
good thing to do
i would immediately
delete my opinion
i wouldn't immediately take his opinion
but i would delete mine immediately and
say okay i'd wipe wipe the board clean
let's hear what he has to say
he's that smart
now
have we ever had a president who was
that much smarter than us
well bill clinton probably yeah actually
we have
jefferson
i guess we have but uh he'd be a
it would be a refreshing change
a refreshing change
we know that he thinks ahead we know
that he thinks of consequences we know
he knows economics we know he knows
systems
we know he has an empathy bias
you don't get better than that really
he's the right age
he's the right age too
now he if he ran for president and i
there's no indication he has any
interest it'd be crazy it'd be a suicide
mission really
actually if he ran for president i'd
call him a coward
just because that's what stupid people
do it's funny
uh
all right
you think you'd be another cia president
you think bezos is influenced by the cia
but it's opposite
about bezos could influence the cia more
than they could influence him but that's
just speculation
all right
um
i believe ladies and gentlemen that that
is exactly what i wanted to accomplish
for today i don't think there's any
doubt that this was the finest piece of
entertainment you will experience if not
today
possibly in your lifetime
china
what's china doing
it's the best show ever
yeah best show ever i think that's true
uh we did learn that there's
uh
i'm not gonna say it
now of course anybody who runs for
president is first of all insane
you know you have the the groucho marx
problem with presidential candidates
you know groucho marx famously said he
would never join uh
he would never join a club that would
have somebody like him as a member
and there's a little bit of that problem
with running for president is there
if you're dumb enough to run for
president
should i vote for you
because it is a suicide mission i mean
you know actually obama came out of it
pretty good
but uh you do get pretty beaten up by
that process and if you have like a
perfect life
you know bezos looks like he's enjoying
himself at the moment
um
somebody says cuban will run mark cuban
i'm not seeing it
i'm not seeing it i feel like i would
know if mark cuban
were preparing a run like you see some
signs of it he'd be saying and doing
some things
that would be suggestive of it by now i
don't think so
um although
he would be a strong candidate
i could back i could back mark cuban for
president
do you want to do do you want to throw
up on that a little bit i'll give you a
little time to barf on me because he
would be a democrat he would run as a
democrat
do you know why
let me tell you why i could back mark
cuban as a president even though he's a
democrat the same argument as bezos
exact same argument
mark cuban would not be able
to do right in front of you
put together a policy or system that
obviously didn't make sense
even if it was like what all the lefties
want he wouldn't be able to do it i mean
i don't think he's
i don't think his constitution would
allow him
to put together a proposal that you just
look at and you go this looks like
just crap
but regular politicians do that all the
time right
regular politicians don't explain their
reasoning they take one side and they
say here shove this down your throat
i've got enough votes to make it happen
mark cuban being a rationalist and
engineer engineer by training right am i
right about that but
um
he would have the empathy part
again just like bezos but he's also a
system thinker and knows how to make
things work so the problem with the
problem that you don't like with the
left is that their systems don't work
and they don't know it am i right
be honest
your problem with the left is primarily
that their systems they put together
don't have the right incentives and
stuff so they all fall apart that's
primarily the problem and nobody's
really offered you the alternative have
they because unfortunately the
alternative doesn't look like a democrat
plan
because it would have too much you know
market competition in it
but i don't see
a mark cuban
promoting any plans that don't have
market competition built into them do
you
can you imagine the you know the the
shark tank entrepreneur guy
the the guy who owns a competitive
sports team
do you think he's going to be against
competition
i don't think so but you expected of
democrats don't you
so i think that i'm naming two people
bezos and cuban
who i would easily
easily support as a democratic candidate
over
i don't know if i like him over desantis
the sense is pretty strong
but um
but totally credible candidates
so you know how it's always darkest
before the dawn
like it looks like everything's going to
be a nightmare and then suddenly the
lights come on you go oh okay that
problem's over
it's sort of like in california we'll
have a year of massive drought and it's
going to be this way for years and then
winter comes and it rains and everybody
goes uh okay i guess we're okay for a
while
here's what could happen in 2024
maybe
would you agree that we have a candidate
problem on both sides
the democrats basically don't have
anybody
and the republicans have a desantis who
probably won't run if trump does so he's
sort of taken out of the game
and then trump controls really the fate
of all the other candidates so if he
runs they won't so basically
if trump wants to run it's probably
going to be him right
so then you have basically the only
republican candidate who has a chance of
losing
he's the only one because he could talk
himself out of the job basically
but the other possibility is this
it's not impossible
that you could get the best presidential
candidates we've ever had
just imagine that somebody like a
cuban or a besos
announces on the left
so they would suck all the energy away
and they would become the candidate
so you could end up with a democrat
candidate who's the best one you've ever
had
because they realize that their bench is
empty
so they have to go recruit somebody
outside the team if they recruit and
they get a you know bezos cuban kind of
a character
they went
not me no i would be a terrible
president
and then on let's say
trump decides not to work to run
that could happen
um then you might have desantis running
against a bezos or a mark cuban
just hold that in your head
i almost wouldn't care who won
in that situation i almost wouldn't care
that that would be such a strong
um
slate
that i'd actually say you know i could
go either one either way on this one
i thought i would see more pushback on
that
that's interesting
but don't rule out that this will be
election between the two strongest
candidates we've ever seen that could
happen it's just unlikely the most
likely thing is you know trump runs
against some weak
democrat venture and
destroys them that's the most likely
thing
but you never know
could go exactly the other way
um
you put a lot of faith in those people
well do i
do i am i putting a lot of faith in
mark cuban or
jeff bezos because i think that they've
both proven what they can do in so many
ways and so publicly
that most of the questions have been
removed
i feel i mean anybody who runs for
office especially if you're a
billionaire there's going to be all
these stories that come out some will be
true some won't and they'll be shocking
so the only way to run for office as a
billionaire is to do what trump did but
do more of it
when trump ran he said
i'm no angel
but you know i can give you these things
for the country
now that didn't get widely quoted and i
wish he had said it a whole bunch more
times but i'd love to see you know let's
let's say some billionaire i won't name
names some billionaire runs for
president
i would love to see that some
billionaires say look
i'm going to be honest
when you start looking into my
background
you're probably going to be shocked
and i'm not running to sell my personal
life
i want you to hear this clearly
don't vote for me if you think i'm going
to be a role model to have to live your
life i don't have anything to tell you
about that
i've got nothing for that
but
if you like some good policies and some
systems that will work some good
persuasion you know if you'd like this
country to be stronger
think of me like your plumber
i can fix your pipes
but don't don't try to emulate my
personal life that would just be a
terrible strategy for you and then
anytime i got accused of something
i would just say well if you're more
amused to think that's true i welcome it
because whatever abuses you
i mean life is short and brutal if you
think it's funny to think that i put a
gerbil of my butt
go for it
like it if that gives you a laugh over a
beer
i'm all for it
it's just that i also have some good
policies can we talk about those once in
a while
but i'm not even going to defend
anything
yeah you you you
kill the hooker and
bury you in your basement whatever
if you like thinking that
if you like it
i'm all for it
you know you should enjoy yourself
when wouldn't you see
one of the greatest hidden
resources in the world is honesty
and some of you just had like a moment
where i said that it's the most valuable
hidden resource
have you ever met anybody who was honest
sometimes you do
every now and then you'll meet somebody
who's honest and do you know what effect
they have on you
it rocks your world doesn't it it
totally rocks your world now i'm not
talking about
there's some people who say they're
honest but it's just an excuse to be
insulting
well hey
you look terrible in that dress i'm just
being honest
i'm just being honest no you're not now
you're being an that's different
but how about somebody who's just honest
it's shocking when you meet them and
they have a superpower don't they
if you actually believe somebody's
honest
they've all their
you know their flaws are right there so
you can see them
and once you can see somebody's flaws
what happens
you trust them
you trust them
so the more flawed somebody looks the
more you trust them
do you ever do you ever wonder how pete
davidson can pull so much
i won't use the word
ever wonder how pete davidson can get so
much female attention
i think
you know he's got a look that they like
he's a certain height he's famous he's
funny got a lot going for him in that
way
but i think the big thing is his honesty
i think when you look at him you go i'm
pretty sure i see every one of his
problems
i think i see them all i feel like i see
every one of your problems they're just
right out there
and then when you see them you go oh
okay i can deal with that
like that set of problems i'm willing to
deal with
so it's really a superpower and i think
he shows it to you now if if your
counter theory is that he's rich and
funny and that's good enough
i know i'm rich and funny and it's
usually not good enough so
maybe if i were taller and younger it'd
be different
um
all right guys in skinny jeans i just
can't
women are suckers for the fixer-uppers
i think that's true
i think that's true
if you were kim kardashian
what would make you feel more
comfortable than to have a boyfriend or
a mate
who's really famous and known for his
flaws
it's sort of comforting is it
because you know kim kardashian's entire
business model is covering up flaws
so
you know she's continually you know
managing your brand etc and doing it
really well kim kardashian is one of the
greatest entrepreneurs this country has
ever had
she doesn't get nearly enough credit not
nearly enough
yeah i would put kim kardashian in the
same highest category of
entrepreneurs and system thinkers and
smart people this country's ever
produced
all right
that ladies and gentlemen
somebody says it's her mom yeah her mom
gets a lot of credit she's
she's clearly very clever
yeah i guess she's in law school now
or some kind of there's some kind of
special law school that's not like real
law school there's some path that you
could take that's not the typical path
hard disagree somebody says
yeah you know people say the kardashians
just
look pretty and hang around and they're
not working but they're working harder
than most of you
all right
if you fix your partner you lose your
biggest project
all right that's all i got now and i'll
talk to you later bye youtube enjoy your
enjoy your day
