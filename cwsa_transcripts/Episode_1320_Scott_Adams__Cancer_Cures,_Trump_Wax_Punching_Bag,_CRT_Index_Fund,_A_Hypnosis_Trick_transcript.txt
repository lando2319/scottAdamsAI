you probably wondered
where i was well i turned on the
camera and i saw the preview and it
turns out my shirt
was inside out and you don't want to go
live to the world
with your shirt inside out and so
i had to make you wait didn't want to
see you do a
didn't want you to have to watch the
wardrobe adjustment
wardrobe failure well looks like the
weather forecast for my kitchen
is no rain yeah for the first time in
two days the weather forecast
inside my house and my kitchen no rain
spent the entire day yesterday trying to
fix a sprinkler system
leak and i had a lot of rain in the
kitchen let's just say
but it's all fixed now so how would you
like to enjoy
the simultaneous sip i know i know
that's why you're here
of course you'd like to enjoy it and all
you'd need is a
copper margaret glass attacker chalice
style canteen jugger flask a vessel of
any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid and i
don't like that
kitchen rainwater i like coffee and join
me now for the dopamine
of the day the thing makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous sip
and it's going to excite people all over
the world
right now go
you want a little hypnosis trick
i know you do here's a little trick
to make people listen to your
points and this works in hypnosis but it
can work in just communication
the amount you pause
and the emphasis you put on things can
be
really really uh sticky
meaning that if you vary your voice just
right
people can't look away because they're
going to wait for your next word
so i'll give you an example of that if i
were going to say for example that the
best thing in the world
was
spaghetti made you wait didn't i
see how i made you wait one of the
things about public speaking
is that time
flows differently for the person who's
speaking than for the audience
and you have to you have to understand
that difference and compensate for it
but that's another story
let's talk about the golden age which is
upon us
you know i was talking about the golden
age almost here and then the pandemic
hit and people said scott
scott's scott i don't think you've ever
been more wrong
about the golden age because we got
ourselves a pandemic
instead to which i said what kind of a
bad optimist are you
if you were a good optimist like me
and like most of you you would say to
yourself
sometimes you've got to reboot the
system
sometimes before you can build an
impressive new building you have to
demolish
the one that's there and the pandemic
like some big
reboot just made us rethink everything
try
different things change our priorities
and here's one of the side effects
that may have come out of the
coronavirus
pandemic apparently this mrna
vaccine is a platform
which has a very good chance of working
for not only
you know obviously this this virus
but future viruses so our position
against future pandemics might be way
better than it was because of what
happened
this year but here's the fun part
one of the scientists behind the pfizer
bio and
tech vaccine says that
the same technology has a good chance of
working for cancer
and not only might it work for cancer
but they might be able to make a vaccine
that works on just
your cancer a customized vaccine
now we're not right knocking on the door
of that but apparently there's nothing
about the technology
that tells you it can't be done which is
to say it's looking at this point where
it's more of an
engineering problem where you've
figured out the sciency part but now
you've got to experiment your way to
making it useful and once you pass out
of that pure science part
and you get into i'll call it the
engineering part you know that
trial and error trying to get a light
bulb that will last longer
type of thing you just keep trying it we
might
we might we might
be entering the engineering phase for
curing cancer now
you didn't see that coming out of the
pandemic did you
have you noticed that uh even though
trump is out of the news he's just
always in your head and he's like this
filter
and any news story you see uh at least
if you've been
talking about politics for the last
several years like i have
everything looks like a trump story even
when it isn't
so here's a story about lebron james he
gets uh
some kind of an ankle injury and he's
going to be out indefinitely
and this is a pure sports
story and when i read this story all i
think is
wow it seems like trump critics have a
lot of bad luck
that's the first thing i thought and i
thought wait a minute
it's not just trump critics that have
bad luck i feel as though even trump's
supporters have bad luck
that if you care about trump something
bad is going to happen to you
now of course you know it doesn't matter
which way you care you hate him or you
love him something bad will happen to
you
now of course this is just a
psychological
confirmation bias thing there's nothing
to it statistically
but because the news always calls out
people who are famous for
more than one thing and one of them is
criticizing trump
it has this weird impression where
you're either going to have a really
good time like uh
like brady you know winning the super
bowl or a really bad time like lebron
getting injured but somehow it's all
about trump
but it isn't also about lebron
apparently lebron was asked if he's
going to get the vaccination now keep in
mind
that lebron has voluntarily taken what
i'd call a leadership
position in society and
for the the top athletes they almost
can't avoid it right
almost anything they do it just puts
them in a position of you know what are
you doing and that's a leadership thing
even if they didn't
want that to be the case so lebron has
taken some leadership positions on the
various awokeness
items so he's he's all in on the
wokeness stuff
but and like the you know hoaxes in
particular so he he pushed the
pretty sure he pushed the
charlottesville hoax
so when it comes to hoaxes and wokeness
he's all in on leadership
but when they asked him if he wanted if
he was going to get the vaccination
he said he'd planning on keeping that
decision private
he's planning on keeping his vaccination
decision private
now how much influence would lebron
james have
on the black community who is hesitant
to get the vaccinations
somebody says that means no but i'll bet
not
if if he wanted to bet against me i
would bet it means yes that he got it
because remember there are a lot of
people who think that's a dumb idea
so if you got the vaccination you
wouldn't want to have to explain it all
the time
so it might be that it might be that not
making a comment is the only way he can
you know live his life
because he doesn't want to have to be
explaining this every day so i can see
that
but i do question why he would not take
leadership in the thing that
saves lives but he would take leadership
and the thing that he gets everything
wrong
they can't tell the hoaxes from the real
stuff any and the wokeness
so here's the problem with making your
sports stars
your leaders they're not really trained
for that
you know if you ask me how smart is
lebron james
i would say if you just based it on you
know his ability to
succeed so well at his sport it's not
all about
physicality he must have some kind of
genius
that applies to you know his his chosen
sport
and if you watch him play it does look
like genius it's just a
specialized kind uh but he doesn't
really have the
exactly the right material for this kind
of leadership
and i think that it shows in this case
here's a story that you're not hearing
why is it that the people who
are most resistant to getting the
vaccinations
are black americans and trump supporters
where are all the stories saying you
know trump supporters and black
americans sure have a lot in common
wouldn't you expect that that there's
always that
story you know about the um the strange
bedfellows and the
the fish out of water and any any time
two things they shouldn't be on the same
team
you know if ted cruz tweets something
about aoc
that's you know on the same side which
he's done
it's a national story right it's like
wait a minute ted cruz can't be
agreeing with aoc that can't be
happening
but here one of the biggest stories in
the world
is that um trump supporters and black
americans
have very similar skepticism about the
science and the experts
and i feel like i've been saying this
for four years now
that it seems to me that black americans
are natural republicans i know it seems
weird
but i think i think the trend if you had
to project forward there will be a lot
more black
conservatives because it works
it works if you tell you if you say i
think i'll be
a democrat let's say you're you're black
you're american you're trying to decide
you know who you are in life etc
if you decide that you're you know one
of the democrats you get thrown in with
every other uh ethnic um
gender situation and you're not very
special
you're just another person who's a
victim in some ways right
but have you noticed that every
it seems like every black person who
becomes a republican
does really well you know they they get
more attention
because it's a little more special get a
more
you know it's more uh non-non-standard
you know a little bit a little bit
non-standard not a lot
um so it just seems to be that the black
population will probably eventually
figure out
that the republicans are the ones who
have better systems
and and they're just better off
and they'll get more of what they need
that way
um i told you that i was going to start
a thing which i haven't yet started
well except a little bit of defending
the hard to defend
and i'm going to do this on tuesday i'll
announce later who i'm defending
but i'm going to i haven't signed on yet
to clubhouse
but i'm planning to do that and by
tuesday
and i'll do a clubhouse in which i'm
going to defend
a really hard to defend person
all right and we'll let you know who it
is later now keep in mind that the whole
point of the exercise
the point of the exercise is to pick
somebody who's hard to defend right so
i'm going to act like a defense attorney
for somebody who maybe doesn't have the
same access to defend themselves
now that doesn't mean i agree with them
you hear that clearly doesn't mean i'm
on their side
although i might be you don't know it's
just not the point
the point of it is to give somebody a
voice
so we'll do that on tuesday i'll give
you more information about that
matthew mcconaughey says he's
considering
running for texas governor says it's an
honorable thing
now i don't know if you've seen any
video of
matthew mcconaughey lately but he seems
to be transitioning
to become a middle-aged woman and
it's an interesting choice because he
was like
the country's sexiest man i think a few
years
but he's decided at least
visually to take on um to take on the
appearance
of a middle-aged woman i don't know why
but if you've seen the videos you know
what i'm talking about
and he's a he's quite sincere
in a weird way um and the democrats eat
their own
jack passovic was uh tweeting this
morning
so you heard the story about alexi uh no
i'm sorry
yeah so uh
alexi mccammond was gonna work at teen
vogue but she got cancelled because she
said some
anti-asian things i think so she gets
canceled but one of the people who
canceled her
another staffer at teen vogue turns out
she used the n-word
more than once in tweets
and now she's cancelled so now the
democrats have cancelled one of their
own
and then one of the cancelers of one of
the cancellers of one of their own
got cancelled by their own do they see
the problem yet
i don't think they do i don't think they
do now i should point out
that this latest uh accused teen vogue
staffer
who used the n-word in her tweets if you
read the tweets
it's pretty clear she's not using it in
an insulting way
or a racist way but does it matter
no indeed it looked like she was trying
to use it in a
in a way that was too familiar for
twitter if you know what i mean
she said something that maybe she could
have said to her friend and gotten away
with it
but you don't say that on twitter in
2021 and
expect not to get canceled
fox news has created a story out of
pretending they don't understand how
analogies work
how many times have you seen a story
that depended on the person
writing the story not knowing what an
analogy was or how they work
so here's fox news their headline says
about governor cuomo it says cuomo
threatened to compare a critic
to a child rapist in the leaked audio
that sounds pretty bad doesn't it listen
to that
headline a governor governor cuomo
threatened to compare one of his critics
to a child
rapist that's pretty bad
until you read the story and it goes
like this
so there were some um some democrats
so that's his party but they were
endorsing him but they were going to
give him sort of a tepid endorsement and
say well he's not our first choice
but he's better than a republican and
cuomo was
arguing with this person on the phone
and saying you know that's not good
enough
we're both democrats essentially i'm
paraphrasing
and he was he uses this analogy
to argue his point so cuomo allegedly
said if you ever say
well he's better than a republican again
then i'm gonna say you're better than a
child rapist how about that
quote was heard telling lipton on the
call
now that's just an analogy
that's not a threat
do you read this and think to yourself
that cuomo will
actually go out and then just out of
nothing
he will start comparing this guy to a
child rapist in public
for no reason that the public can
understand
did this look like a real threat no
this wasn't a threat it was an analogy
the analogy is that that simply saying
somebody's better than a child rapist
is saying they're not that good simply
somebody
saying somebody's better than a
republican if you happen to be a
democrat
is also not so good it was just
an analogy and and fox news reports it
like he threatened him
what a slow news day um also
fox news and i'm going to teach you a
little hypnosis trick here again
there's something i learned in hypnosis
training years ago and my hypnosis
instructor
told me this was true and i said i said
there's no way that's true there's no
way
and i'm going to do the same thing to
you i'm going to tell you something
that i think is true and you're going to
say to yourself
no that's not true you might think it's
true
but that's confirmation bias that's not
true
but then you're gonna have the
experience i had which is once your
filter is set
you're gonna start to see it everywhere
and your
confidence that this is not true is
going to be eroded over time the same
way mine was and it goes like this
you can often it's not a 100 thing but
often you can tell people's inner
thoughts
by their accidental choice of words
so if people use uh and i'll give you
the
example that the uh hypnotists use so
let's say you're going to date with
somebody it's a first date and you're
wondering if they're interested in you
and you're looking at your date and use
the example of it's a guy trying to
figure out if the woman
is interested and it's before dinner
and the woman means to say i'm famished
oh man i'm famished but there's a little
uh
slip of the tongue and she says oh man
i'm ravished
i'm ravished
what that does is reveal that her inner
thoughts were more sexual
and that she's good to go because
ravished
has more to do with sex than it does to
do with eating so that it would not be
an
accidental slip of the tongue it would
be like a freudian slip
if you will and it would mean something
well i was reminded of that when i was
looking at this fox news
uh article about jeffrey tubin
and they used the phrase
pulled off at least three times cnn's
chief legal analyst jeffrey toobin
pulled off a stunning upset on saturday
in his first round
they're talking about some you know
troll tournament
about hacks and stuff story doesn't
matter but they used the word pulled off
i think two or three times in the story
yeah
tuban pulled it off and now
somebody says that it was intentional
and i think it might have been
so it's possible that this was
intentional
and it was just somebody who thought i
wonder if they're going to notice this
is funny
just just stick it in there if it's
intentional
that it's actually just funny and it's
fine but
and i'm not saying that this is an
example of the mind reading thing but it
reminded me
that i've been using this technique
forever
and man does it work it really works
if you look for this accidental choice
of words
it's just like opening somebody's brain
up and reading it
it works so well that you're going to be
mad at me
when you find out how well it works and
you didn't know that until now
i've asked the question why isn't there
no list
public list of public companies
who are doing critical race theory
training
wouldn't you like to to to know
what group so you could create maybe an
index fund
to either vet to either invest in them
or to invest in the other group
now if the if you think the reason i
brought this up
is to suggest that a company that was
doing critical race theory training
would have
lower profits um don't assume that
they could have higher profits because
you've got what i call the
in search of excellence problem you know
years ago
the book in search of excellence um
had as a thesis i hope i'm not rep i
hope i'm not misrepresenting this that
the better you treated your employees
the more you could attract to good
employees and good employees are what
make you successful
so that the the the really good
treatment of your staff
would be a way to predict who's going to
do well now at the time
when i was writing the dilbert comic
because i still am i said to myself
that feels a little backwards to me that
feels like backwards thinking
because in my experience the companies
that could treat their
their employees well were the ones that
were already wildly profitable
so instead of treating companies instead
of treating employees well
and that makes you profitable it seemed
obvious to me
that companies who were rich had enough
money to treat their employees well
and that's all it was
so in the in likewise and now it's
a different situation but you can see
how i got there with the crt index fund
it could be that only companies who are
doing so well
that they can they can start worrying
about non-core
functions it might be an indication of
companies that think they're doing so
well
that they can now you know worry about
the the broader societal things
it might actually be an index fund that
outperforms
the the other possibility is that it
would end up being a bunch of companies
that don't know what's important
and then they would underperform it
might tell you there's something wrong
with management
or it might tell you there's something
right with management
it might be it might be exactly the
thing that makes them successful
but wouldn't you like to know given that
this is training that's happening at
public companies and giving that the
public invest in these companies
and it's important i would like to see
some stats
are these companies going to do better
in the next year or worse than the
average
wouldn't you like to know
rasmussen reminds us that half of
american voters
do not believe that joe biden is in
charge of the presidency
have we ever been in a situation where
half of the country didn't know who the
president was
because they couldn't tell if the guy
who got elected actually is making the
decisions
uh that's really different
and shocking and on twitter somebody was
noting that our system is so good
that you can elect somebody with
dementia
and mostly it keeps working
i would say there have been some
mistakes but mostly it keeps working
did you see the story about the wax
museum san antonio wax museum
they had to remove their trump wax
figure
and put it in storage because people
kept punching it
i guess people kept punching the wax
statue of trump
and i've told you before that
one of the best business
things to understand is that you don't
tell your customers what business you're
in
you do on day one but eventually your
customers tell you what business you're
in
because they treat you like you that
you're in that business even if you
didn't want to be in that business
and so it seems to me that the customers
at this wax museum were teaching the wax
museum that maybe they needed to be a
different kind of business
maybe they should be more in the
punching bag
kind of business have you ever seen this
punching bag that looks like a
uh an adult white male
and you punch it but he's got a face
that
i don't know is it me that not look a
little like
a muscular trump with you know maybe a
little bit different haircut
just a little bit so it seems to me that
the wax museum
should have gone into the punching bag
business
make themselves a proper punching bag
that will take a punch
and just become a boxing business
yeah now if i were trump
i would be very tempted to create one of
these
punching bags as a fundraiser
because would you buy well i don't know
if
trump supporters would buy a punching
bag but maybe his
his haters would could he fund himself
entirely
by getting his haters to buy expensive
punching bags
[Laughter]
the trump punching bags trump punch
anyway um so even the new york times is
saying that trump's leadership on
vaccinations
was not just a success but
a really big one and
compared to europe trump
was the winner now here's here's how
history is going to look at this
i think history is not going to
be too clear on whether masks
and keeping schools closed made as much
difference as people hoped
but nobody's going to question the
vaccines made a big difference
so it seems to me that um history is
going to judge that on the thing that we
can't measure made much of a difference
and by the way there are plenty of
people the experts still say masks
make a difference so the the bulk of
experts are still solidly on the
pro-mass side
but nonetheless it is true that when we
try to look at the data
of how the masks worked in this pandemic
it's not really clear is it like
i'm still pro mask because i think it
had to
at least decrease the viral load given
that we know how much you
are exposed to makes a difference in
your outcomes
i still think the odds that a mask makes
some difference
in some cases is you know was worth the
risk management
but given the history won't be sure
about the masks
but we will be very sure about
vaccinations it's going to look like
the thing that trump did right may have
saved millions
because you know our leadership on
vaccines
certainly affected the rest of the world
trump might have saved millions
how many did he kill to take the
critic's
perspective how many did trump kill
by not being let's say serious enough
about masks
early on we don't know
don't go maybe some
maybe a few maybe none
it can't be measured we just don't know
so
history is just going to frickin love
trump
because he did one of the greatest
things that's ever been done now
to be fair it could have gone wrong
right it didn't have to work but it did
and if you're a leader and you guess
right you do get credit
and it looks like he guessed right and
he did he's getting credit
it's an amazing thing but here's the
question i ask
what's happening with china and
vaccinations
because why don't i know that is china
as a as aggressive vaccinated
because they get a lot of people how in
the world
can they get all their people vaccinated
and here's a question i ask what happens
when the united states and europe
gets all vaccinated but china
isn't close to being vaccinated
doesn't that virus get back into china
and doesn't china just get wiped out
because they don't have vaccinations
i feel as if there's something i don't
understand here can china continue to
live in a world
where other countries are traveling
because they've been vaccinated
but china doesn't let those people in
their country
is that what's going to happen because
either china has to stay in
some kind of at least international
lockdown
which i think they're somewhat
internationally locked down right
they're either going to have to stay
isolated
or they're gonna have another wave of uh
pandemic that doesn't hit the united
states
so i just have a question about that
because if they don't have another wave
why not how could it not happen
and let me let me just throw this in the
mix
do you think that any intelligence
agencies or countries are gaming this
coronavirus for example do you think
that anybody
took a bunch of live virus and you know
just spread it in the city of the other
or put it on the doorknobs of the you
know the parliament of
some other country so all the all the
people would get it i feel as if there's
a
a non-zero chance that somebody's
intelligence agency is using the
coronavirus for bad
reasons and here's the question is there
any country in the world that would get
vaccinated and be really mad at china
that would have the ability to reinfect
china
just for revenge now i don't think
i don't think a proper government would
do anything like that
but there there were the uh
what was it the opium wars it wasn't
that long ago
so anything's possible um
here's a question i saw on twitter that
has been bugging me a lot
which is when we're watching the uh the
crisis
on the border and the all the kids who
are coming in unaccompanied
we have to assume that the kids did not
make the deals with the cartels by
themselves
that is to say that the cartels no doubt
dealt with the parents
and the parents said yes i will pay you
to take my children across the border
and then the cartel delivers them to the
border
but doesn't that mean that every kid
who comes into the united states is
known by a cartel member
who also knows their parents and has
access to the parents
doesn't that make tens of thousands of
these migrant kids
sort of have to do the bidding of the
cartel once they get into this country
because the alternative is you know i
know where your parents live
and there's nothing you can do about it
i feel like
we've we're letting in tens of thousands
of kids who
can easily be blackmailed by the cartel
that's not a story
that's not a story you know
and of course obviously most of the tens
of thousands could be just innocent
children and
they go on with their life but you
wouldn't need that many kids
who were in the pockets of the cartels
to cause some trouble
or at least participate in you know drug
trafficking or whatever
um so you know what what is the worst
thing about
the worst thing about succeeding is it
breeds failure
the the one thing will guarantee your
failure is succeeding
and you see that everywhere like if a
company succeeds too much and it becomes
known as this one thing
it's too hard to change to another thing
and then they fail because of that one
thing like polaroid cameras i use the
example
but ron desantis has this problem now so
he's considered a success story as a
governor in
florida but because he's so successful
where are the spring break crowds gonna
go
where are people gonna travel if they if
they're gonna travel
i feel like ron desantis is so
successful
that it's going to cause people to come
in and wreck their state
with outside coronavirus so success
breeds failure and
that's that's gonna be ron de santa's
problem it's gonna it's gonna look like
his latest decision was not so good
it still looks like his past decisions
were pretty good
but this latest one to allow spring
break
it's not gonna look so good i think so
um not many spring breaks actually i
don't know what that means
um
curfews are starting yeah in florida
they're starting to
arrest people and curfews and stuff but
one thing you can tell for sure is that
young people
do not care if old people die
i think that's really clear that uh
young people do not care about saving
the lives of old people it's just not
just not even interesting to them
and i can't say that i would have been
any different at that age
um somebody says why young people are
under virtually zero risk
from the virus is there still somebody
watching this
a year into the pandemic who doesn't
understand that young people can
spread the coronavirus because in the
question somebody was
acting like young people don't have
anything to do with anybody else
you know if they don't get sick that's
just their business
but if you don't understand that they
can infect other people how could you
have gone a year
and not know that somebody's saying
we're at heard
i saw i saw an article today that some
scientists are saying we might be closer
to her
than we think i wouldn't rule that out
but i don't think that's credible yet
um but if the elderly are vaccinated
what's the risk low and that's that's
why things are opening up
yeah between the fact that young people
don't get it so much and old people are
vaccinated we're
we're uh we're getting ready to fix this
i was i was taking a walk yesterday and
i'm walking all by myself down the
sidewalk and i see from
a great distance two other people
one has a mask but it's it's down and
he's walking he's
he's way ahead of me so he's nowhere
near me and then there's a bicyclist
coming around the corner and is going to
pass this other person
now keep in mind there are no other
humans
in visual sight because my neighborhood
is
you know not that many people only three
of us
in the entire visual plane and i'm i'm
completely out of their
action the vice bicyclist is wearing a
mask
i can't explain it how do we get to the
point where a bicyclist is wearing a
mask
biking where there are no people now the
bicyclist is in sort of the middle of
the road because
there's not even traffic there's not
even people in cars
so the bicyclist is pretty far from the
guy in the sidewalk who has this mask
off
and the guy on the sidewalk puts his
mask on
just for the moment that the guy in the
bicycle who is 20 feet away when he
passes them
in the road just so they have a mask on
when that guy goes by
and i said to myself what's going on
here
because there's something happening that
is way beyond
the virus there's like a psychological
phenomenon here that i think will be
studied for
study for decades um
and i think that yeah somebody's saying
in the comments is virtue signaling
that's exactly what it is
but i and i find myself doing very
similar things
which is i find myself giving people
like way more space than they need
if i'm passing them on sidewalks and
stuff and i feel that i'm also virtue
signaling
but there's a little bit more to that
a little bit more somebody says being
polite yeah that's closer to it
because what you don't know is what the
other person is thinking
and there are people who are scared to
death of the virus
so if i'm you know if i see somebody
coming the other way who i think
since i don't know could be scared to
death of getting the virus maybe they
have comorbidities
you know maybe they're just a scared
person
i would like to make them feel more
comfortable
so i might wear a mask where it doesn't
make any sense i might give them extra
space where it doesn't make any sense
so a lot of it is just about making
other people feel comfortable
but there's another part of this that i
don't know if anybody's felt this yet
but
every time i see a stranger like
you know from the distance they they
start giving me space
before i'm even near them i feel like
that stranger did something for me
because i don't think that they were
giving space for themselves
because nobody's really afraid outdoors
really they're just trying to be
considerate to whoever they're walking
past
and i have seen because of the covet
distancing stuff more people have acted
considerate to me
in the past year than all of my life put
together
i've never seen so many physical
acts of consideration you know i
i will consider getting out of your way
i will put on this mask for you
i have to admit it's not all bad
you know i want the masks to go away as
soon as possible just like all of you
they're horrible i mean i had to wear a
mask all day in my house yesterday
because uh one of the people working had
a mask on and
you know if if you let somebody in your
house with a mask on you're going to
wear a mask
right just consideration i didn't have
to
but was being polite
um somebody says it is terrible you were
wrong
no it's net terrible i'm not disagreeing
with you
that the masking is on average terrible
i don't we don't know yet exactly how
much difference it made
but i'm just saying that people have
demonstrated a willingness to be
considerate to other people
at a scale which we've never seen before
that's all
and that's worth calling out
yeah it's it's my house so i could have
done whatever i wanted but i wanted to
be considerate
that's all um
who's was mentally unable to memorize
and restate the nuclear football codes
i don't know what you're talking about
there's some story about
dengs i guess i'll have to catch up on
that
all right i don't have much else to say
and so i will talk to you tomorrow
bye for now what a
um mind your own business on vaccines
joe biden
oh they're calling biden okay i got it
um no more mass talk yeah
people get mad when i talk about masks
um i'm just looking at your comments
have you ever hypnotized someone to do
what you want
well that's what hypnosis i
i've hypnotized lots of people i would
say
it's to do what they want that's how it
works
oh so so you're making a joke on joe
biden's name
and calling him uh sho baiden
deng so it sounds chinese i get it okay
i get it now
what book or course on hypnosis do i
recommend i don't i've never seen a good
book on it or
and i'm not aware of any good course on
it
um
let's see are you listening to my
persuasion book now good
thanks youtube is shadow banning me big
time yeah
my my youtube numbers are are way way

um and i'm gonna
by the way i'm also on uh
what's the name of it uh rumble
so if you want to if you want to watch
on rumble you'd see it in replay
can i hypnotize you to be happy to wear
a mask
i wish i wish i could oh my
sprinkler broke in my ceiling i've got a
fire suppression
sprinkler and it just got a little hole
in it
here's the weirdest thing about the uh
the fix of my sprinkler system
so we open up open up the ceiling and
you can see the actual leak
spraying out and it's spraying
continuously
so there's no doubt about where the leak
is
so the guy comes in he removes that
piece of pipe you know has to drain the
pipes and
turn off the water and stuff and we take
the pipe out where the leak was
and he hands it to me and he goes
where's the leak in this
because i replaced the part you said had
the leak but
here's the tube i mean show me where
there's a hole in this
because it wasn't where a joint was it
was like right in the middle of a length
of tube
and this thing is like this real thick
pvc
or some kind of pvc and there was no
hole in it
there was nothing wrong with no crack no
hole and
we couldn't make it leak artificially we
put water in it we couldn't make it leak
it was some kind of pvc and
um but it stopped the problem when you
replaced it
a micro hole yeah
it was the uh the strangest thing well
even with pressure though
you would still be able to see the hole
wouldn't you because it's not that much
water pressure is it
yeah i think it was a hairline fracture
but we couldn't find it when we looked
at it was which was weird
all right that's all for now and i will
talk to you
later
