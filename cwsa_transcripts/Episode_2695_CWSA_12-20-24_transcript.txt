stocks don't look so good but maybe
tomorrow will be
better let me get my comments working
here so I can see what you're up
to at least the people on
locals I can see all of your comments
but the locals comments come in
Faster Today's show is going to be
amazing
[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and
you've never had a better time but if
you'd like to raise your experience to
levels that nobody can even understand
with their tiny shiny human brains all
you need for that is a cuper mug or a
glass of tanker chel sign a canteen jug
or flask a vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparallel
pleasure the dopamine here the day thing
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and happens now
go that is so
good so good got to adjust my lighting
hold
on lighting
adjusted all right you'd be surprised to
hear that Dr Alan Sears he's a doctor he
says there's a some there's a compound
in coffee called trigonelline
trigonelline and it's a unique form of
vitamin B3 and did you know that it'll
increase your spatial learning and
memory support your nervous system
development enhance your mitochondrial
function and increase key neur
neurotransmitters in the hypoc campus of
the brain well I'm not sure about all
that I better test
it let's see if I can uh increase the
neurotransmission ERS in the hippocampus
of my brain with
coffee yeah I feel it I feel it my
hippocampus is going crazy right now
yeah yeah it all
works you know sometimes you hear this
science and you think but in the real
world does that work
sure did you hear the horrible story of
provocative controversial podast cter
Nick
Fuentes who was almost murdered in his
home did you hear this story this is so
shocking I didn't even talk about it for
a day because I was just sort of looking
at it like oh my God so somebody
murdered I guess his family and then
went on a road trip to apparently try to
murder Nick Fuentes at his house so
knocks on his door and apparently the
only reason the Fuentes didn't answer
his door is that he was doing a podcast
at that
moment all he had to do was answer the
door and he'd be dead all he had to do
was answer his own front door while he
was
home but he couldn't because he was on
his podcast it saved his
life now um I would make the following
advice if you're producing content
that's making people want to drive
hundreds of miles to your house and kill
you you might want to think about that I
mean I I do like the the fact that
podcasters will say provocative and
risky things because free speech allows
it and you know as long as it's working
in all directions it can be a healthy
thing but um just think about
it you know just think about it you the
reason that I don't worry so much about
security I should worry more about it
probably I mean I have
enough but I don't think I give people a
reason to kill me do
I even people who mock me online they
don't have any reason to kill me as far
as I know I mean I'm not I'm doing doing
the best I can to make sure that people
see me as trying to be helpful even if
they don't like my politics I like I
like people to say well he's clearly
trying to help you know that's that's
not what I want but he's obviously
trying to help that that's usually good
enough not to make somebody drive
hundreds of miles to your
house but to be fair when people are
crazy there's nothing you can do right
basically nothing you can do
so that's just a horrible little
story um there's a story that I'm having
a little bit trouble believing oh I'm
going to go further I'm going to say I
don't believe this is true I think this
is fake
news
but there's a story uh according to the
Virginia
Mercury I guess some publication in
Virginia uh that the governor has
approved or announced there's going to
be this Fusion nuclear plant in
Virginia
now regular regular nuclear is fision
Right Fusion is the thing that doesn't
exist
am I wrong about that so there's an
announcement that they're going to start
building a fusion PowerPlant in
Virginia so I immediately went over to
Google and I said to myself have I been
in a coma because I was almost posi I
followed the news on fusion and I didn't
think we were that close I thought we'
done some demos that show that you know
for a brief time it can create more
energy than it uses
but I didn't think we were anywhere as
near a practical application where you
could just approve it and build
it so given that social uh given that if
you do a Google search it makes no
indication that Fusion is near
ready do you think they would announce
something and Google doesn't even know
the technology is there I'm going to say
this is fake news so I'm going to go out
in the limb and say I think maybe they
either wrote down Fusion when they meant
fision or something
right yeah Fusion has happened
experimentally that's that's what I do
all right so I think that's fake
news
um but if it's not I saw one post on the
comments from idea man who said There
super superconductors superconductors
have been improving a lot and that
Fusion depends on
superconductors it seems like one of the
key components and the MIT has been
designing Fusion plants based on the
latest
superconductors
and might actually it might actually be
practical or it or it might be that they
got so close to practical they can't
tell for sure if it works until they
start building it I don't
know meanwhile Jeff Bezos and uh Trump
and Elon Musk had dinner at Mar logo now
we don't know what happened at that
dinner but it's been confirmed that it
had happened must said it was a great
conversation the only thing I have to
say about this is how much would you pay
to have been at that dinner you know if
you could have been the fourth person at
the dinner and it was Trump Elon Musk
and Jeff Bezos what would you pay for
that I'm trying to imagine how much I
would pay for that it's pretty much it's
pretty much I would
pay
$20,000 I would pay $20,000 to be the
fourth person at that lunch and the
reason
is there are very few things that would
be a life experience anywhere near that
just nothing near that I know the just
the the horsepower and in those three
brains would just is
ridiculous um but I do love that uh
Trump
Trump is open for business and he's
listening to the smartest people in the
world what I worry about is now that we
know that musk is a puppet master of
trump I'd be afraid that Jeff Bezos
tries to sneak in there and become the
Puppet
Master no the Puppet Master thing is
 and we'll talk about that some
more um there is a report that Biden and
Harris both canceled their flight and
Christmas plans and rushed back to the
White House last night
we haven't heard what that's about right
we don't know what that's about so so we
were left to
speculate first of all is it true news
that's the first question because I
didn't really see it from a reliable
source but it's on social media people
seem to be confident about it um was
that fake was that fake news that they
rush back to the White
House anyway so I guess we just wait and
see now some people are speculating
that maybe this is where they do the
25th Amendment and
replace uh replace Biden with Harris now
why would they do
that given that Harris gets no benefit
because she already lost the election
well um I think it might be because of
the Wall Street Journal
reporting now that the war and we'll
talk about that but the Wall Street
Journal reported that Biden's brain was
toasted from the first St of office when
The Wall Street Journal
reports and everybody believes I mean
nobody's really doubting the reports at
all that he was incompetent from the
first day of
office and that they've been keeping
information from him so he didn't know
what the Press was saying about
him what
if Biden found out what the Wall Street
Journal said about his time in
office he might have enough cognitive
ability left to know that he needs
to make a call and not leave us without
a president for 3 or 4
weeks so it's possible that the Wall
Street Journal forced his hand because
it's just embarrassing to have no
president when everything looks so vital
now it might be also that it would boost
Harris's credentials say if she runs for
governor of California which people are
suggesting she might that she can say
that her resume includes being president
of the United States first woman
president of the United
States maybe maybe because I I think
that the reason that Democrats didn't
want to pull the trigger was in part
because they didn't trust KLA Harris to
be president but given that it's a
holiday and and nothing was going to
happen for the next few weeks anyway at
least nothing in the United States
um see what am I looking at
oh
okay um so it could be that uh they just
know that have it doesn't matter who's
president for the next three weeks
because Trump's the de facto president
already so it might be that they're
going to make a change I wouldn't bet on
that I wouldn't bet on that it seems
more likely it's just something came up
and they want to make sure that there's
a human being look at looking at it
meanwhile here's the most predictable
thing that could have happened Kell
Harris got a $20 million book
deal every one of us could have
predicted that right and Biden will
probably get a book deal too so she gets
a $20 million book deal with from
Chronicle Books now what do you think is
the second part that was 100%
predictable she got a book deal and she
got $20 million for it allegedly what's
the second part that you could
predict you could predict that Chris
Cher rufo would soon soon be posting on
X that they had discovered massive
plagiarism in her
book now this one's a tough one because
politicians don't write their own books
you know these are all ghost written and
that means that she hired a ghost writer
who
plagiarized and probably didn't even
read her own book she probably doesn't
even know what's in
it so it's not really
you know in this case it's not really a
knock on the uh vice president it's more
of a knock on her hiring of the ghost
riter who apparently is not to be
trusted so so they got that going all
right so the house shut down the
government shut down may or may not
happen there the first two budget
attempts the 1500 page one and the 20s
and 100 page one both got rejected now
the
Republicans are voting against the
budget even though it's going down from
1500 pages to 100 something um just
because there's some Republicans who
won't vote for any increase in uh the
deficit I don't hate that I don't really
hate that there are Republicans who
won't vote for anything that increases
the
debt in the short term it just screws up
everything but if you're going to if
you're going to you know sort of fall on
a principle
that's a pretty good
principle right so I don't hate the
people who voted no again no on it it
didn't give us a result so I mean we
can't move forward
but you know if you're looking at it
just politically and practically they
probably should have voted for
it but I I agree with them in principle
you should just shouldn't vote for
anything that's increasing the debt
because um it's basically just
thievery is basically just stealing from
voters when you increase the debt it it
makes everybody's money worth less
because of inflation so therefore it's
basically a tax and a massive
one anyway so here's what's going
on
um so Trump said in a truth post that he
wants if the government is going to
close over this issue about the budget
not being approved uh Trump says let it
happen under Biden not Trump
now uh Caitlyn Collins reposted that and
I love the fact that Trump makes news by
saying the most obvious things that
everybody's thinking it's just that he's
not supposed to say it out loud he's not
supposed to say out loud that you might
as well let it happen under Biden than
Trump right you're just supposed to
think it you're not supposed to say it
out loud but the fact that he says it
out loud just makes me love him
because he's not hiding anything yeah
I'd like this to happen under Biden not
me oh well that's amazingly honest yeah
so so he doesn't even hide the fact that
there's a a political difference and he
prefers it just for the political
difference so he just says it and I just
appreciate the
transparency anyway
um so let's see uh it looks like the
original budget deal that nobody knew
what was happening was put together by
Schumer McConnell speaker Johnson and
jeffes and they put it together without
really talking to much of
anybody now why would we expect these
four people to be experts on
budgets do we think that any one of
those four was looking at the details or
were they the ones who were most likely
to say yes to something that was made
entirely by by lobbyists and
lawyers no they are the ones most likely
to say yes if the lobbyist wrote the
bills which is presumably what happened
now this raises a larger question for me
you know how I always say that you can
tell what people are really up to by the
design of the system if the design of a
system always gets you one kind of
result and it it only lasts you know for
a minute then you could say oh that
wasn't intentional they changed it as
soon as they found out what the design
did but if you have a design of
something and it just stays in business
the same design for decades that's
intentional they know what the design is
they know what they know what it
produces and they like it that's why it
resist it lasts for decades now here are
some of the things that the government
has
done and it looks to me like the overall
theme of the government is to hide
corruption
you would hope that the government is
designed to create good outcomes for the
public but it appears to be more
designed to hide the corruption of the
politicians let me give you some
examples is it true that the Pentagon
lost trillions of dollars and that in
Ukraine all kinds of money is missing so
when it comes to the military spending I
think you'd
agree it's not designed so the public
can watch where the money goes it's
designed so we can't watch where where
the money goes am I right it's
designed so that we we can't know where
the money
goes yeah
um we also can't tell for sure who won
an election because we've got all these
complicated machine you know things and
I don't know what happens to any vote
when it goes into a machine I don't
think anybody does like we have to trust
strangers that wants the vot goes into
machines the machines don't change the
vote how would I know it seems like our
elections are
designed so you can't tell who want so
we've got a
military budget you know it's our third
biggest budget thing designed so you
can't tell how they spent the money
elections designed so you can't tell who
won really you know we produce a winner
but you don't really know um we don't
know what's in our spending bills
so the Omnibus the purpose of it is to
make sure you don't know what's in it
the purpose of waiting until it's just
before Christmas and you make it500
pages is so nobody will read it it's
designed so you don't know what they're
doing it's designed to hide
corruption how about uh how about the
fact that we couldn't tell who was
running the country in the Biden
Administration the Biden Administration
was designed so so you couldn't even
tell that the president of the United
States was totally declined and uh
unelected people were running
America it was designed so you couldn't
tell who was in charge that's not
accidental
um and then there was a if I if I have
this right the omnius also included a
included in it the one that got rejected
included in it something that would
block uh congress's digital
Communications from ever being
discovered why would you need to block
any legal discovery of communication in
Congress to hide
crime what else would it be then you've
got the all the me funding apparently
Congress has a budget just to pay off
meoo victims and we don't know who that
is it's designed so you don't know
so it it's a little hard to miss the
pattern at this point isn't it I mean
the pattern seems so obviously designed
for the very purpose of making
corruption really easy now there's a
separate story about California and $24
billion do that's that's somehow missing
um that was supposed to solve
homelessness but it it went into some
Maze of uh entities and the Cayman
Islands and somebody owns this company
that owns this company and it just sort
of disappeared into the Maze of
companies now do you think that was an
accident no no the funding of these big
ticket things in local elections and
local government is designed so you
don't know who's doing what and who's
stealing what it's designed for
corruption now it's really obvious
when you look at all the different
elements of the government that every
part of it is designed to eliminate
transparency and transparency is the
only thing that Will Keep Us Alive it's
the only thing that Will Keep Us Alive
if you don't know what your government
is doing they will steal all your money
and then the country will be broke and
then we all die so yeah we are designed
for
corruption that's just a fact
all right um and then have you noticed
this pattern that whenever the
Republicans come up with a plan to solve
a big National problem let's say a plan
to close the border solves a big
National problem let's say a plan to
reduce the deficit as in the Doge uh
work uh or say let's say a plan we don't
have one but let's say plan to end the
war in Ukraine you know when Trump gets
in office so Republicans often have have
a plan we don't know if that plan works
yet because you know it's a plan but
they do come up with plans and they can
say we are going to do
XYZ and we'll do it right in front of
you we'll show you you know it would be
very transparent and we think this works
because this always works we're doing
things that always
work what do the Democrats do the
Democrats seem to be entirely oriented
at creating hoaxes gaslighting and Ops
to prevent Republicans from doing the
obvious Common Sense things that the
entire country wants now I don't think
that was always the case I think they
used to compete on policy didn't they am
I Am I
Wrong didn't they used to compete on
policy but they don't anymore do you
know why they don't compete on policy
because there isn't even a Democrat that
thinks their policies could work
what is going on over there I I don't
believe that any Democrat thinks their
own policies could possibly work and
that's why they don't argue the policy
so instead they'll say Trump's stealing
your
democracy uh he's a
dictator uh Elon Musk is using him for a
puppet like they have to do that stuff
because they don't have any policy
argument at all so you basically have
one one group of Common Sense people
trying to solve critical
problems and honestly it looks like they
genuinely want to solve problems when I
look at what the Republicans do and what
they
produce especially the in the Trump
World more in the Trump World than
before it seems designed to solve
problems am I wrong I mean it doesn't
seem to be like it's just always a trk
it just seems like it's a
solution so we got one solving one party
that solves and one party that just
creates gas ating to prevent the party
the solves from
solving
um so Elon Musk was pointing out when uh
you know he got a lot of criticism for
weighing in the heavy on the 1500 page
omnius piece of crap budget and people
say that he's the reason it got
killed I said it's not the reason I mean
he he's like a focus because we're all
watching him but he couldn't have done
that without the complete support of all
Trump supporters basically every one of
them so if you have the support of 100%
of the
public that's not exactly a puppet
master situation if 100% of the public
backs you wh which part of the public
was in favor of spending too much money
and putting together a 1500 page bill
that nobody read nobody was in favor
that you you can't find me one citizen
you might find a politician who would
argue it but a citizen find me one voter
who says you know I was really in favor
of my politicians not even knowing what
was in the budget but it was you know
enough to kill us all nobody not not one
Democrat not one Republican so you can't
treat that the situation where every
citizen agrees you can't treat that like
it's some kind of weird Puppet Master
taking control situation he's simply
agreeing with 100% of the public he just
happens to have more voice and more
power and so we backed them of course we
backed them of course we backed him you
also back
me if I do a post on on X that says
something about you know don't pass this
1500 page stupid
budget what do the comments look like
every one of them is supportive
100% when does that ever happen in in
social media when a 100% of people are
on your side yeah I I just said don't
pass a 1500 page budget doesn't even
matter what's in it I don't need to know
what's in it don't pass a 1500 page
budget a few days before Christmas ever
ever that's a fail
so it's it's of course the you know the
best the Democrats have is trying to
turn it into something that'll split
musk away from Trump so that by the way
what's the point of it what would be the
point of trying to to put a wedge
between musk and Trump what would be the
point of it the Democrats are trying
really hard to do it and what's the
point does it help the
country how how has that help the
country it doesn't it clearly doesn't
you the if they were even trying to help
a little bit you know what they would do
they'd say Elon Musk wow you do have
some skills you know we should work with
you
too that the de R should be
competing to see who can get these
billionaires more on their side with
good policies but instead they just have
to break up somebody else's relationship
it it's like the ugly girl who can't get
a date so she has to sabotage or pretty
girl pretty girlriend who can oh that
guy's bad you should you should break up
with him because I can't get a date
that's what it feels
like anyway so must said uh he's trying
to reframe it correctly and he goes uh
he's talking about the the rejection of
the 1500 page version of the budget he
said this shows how much your voice
matters talking to the people uh and
having a president like Trump means that
your voice is finally heard this is the
right model and we should keep
reinforcing it Trump is a
populist and he is very connected to the
public musk is also a populist I mean in
effect I I don't know if he would I
don't think he would describe himself
that way but in effect because the
common sense stuff tends to be pretty
popular
so uh yes we have an amazing amazing
situation right now where a citizen who
has just a few people following them on
social media can get the person who's a
little bit bigger to repost them and
that can get the person a little bit
bigger to repost them and then when the
people have a million followers have
reposted them you can pretty much
guarantee that people like Elon Musk are
going to see it because they follow the
big accounts and if they think the IDE
is good they have a direct line to the
White House so what we've created is an
unofficial direct line where good ideas
bubble up in a very natural way
everybody has an incentive if I see
somebody with a smaller account who has
a good idea I'm incentivized to repost
it because if I repost a good idea that
reflects well on me right so just for
selfish reasons I will boost a smaller
account like I Ian I'm not thinking of
it entirely so selfishly um often
thinking of it as oh here's somebody who
needs a boost because they have good
ideas if you have one good idea you
probably get a boost you know oh even if
I haven't seen your other ideas but one
idea is good enough to get a
boost meanwhile Mike cernovich is going
hard at Republican Chi r Ro he was one
of the ones who said no on the the
second version of the continued
resolution that got down to 100 pages
and give me an update by the way there's
a vote going on I think right now on
what they call the third version of the
continued resolution budget so if we get
a result on that uh just shout it out in
the in the uh comments anyway here are
some of the things uh Mike cernovich
says we should know about chip Roy he
was a George Floyd
worshipper um now I looked at some of
the old posts that chip Roy had about
that topic and he was very much in the
George Floyd as a saint kind of a mode
almost like a Democrat
weirdly um a worshipper is you know
hyperbole but he was very much in the he
he bought the full Democrat Narrative of
B Floyd the the cop is a murderer Floyd
was an angel you know I'm exaggerating
but uh it it was not a typical
Republican view of that
situation um
allegedly chip Roy tried to keep LZ
chenian power I guess he liked that idea
and he worked to remove one of this is
CNO saying he worked to remove uh Texas
AG Ken Paxton who Republicans seem to
like a lot he's quite effective Kent
backton
is so these are just things that
wouldn't have have been a big problem
for chip Roy at the
moment except that he went in the wrong
direction on a vote so uh covich decided
to shine some light on him and I never
mind
that like whenever I see transparency
breaking out oh this is actually
something you should know about this
particular leader these are three
somewhat
odious points of view he had at least
Odus from the political rights point of
view so yeah it's worth knowing is that
a reason to vote him out I don't know I
mean he's not my representative I don't
have an opinion whether he should be
voted out but do I have an opinion that
that the voters should know where he
stood on these issues yes yes so this is
so this is a good service by cernovich
so that we know what's
happening
um did you
know that the fact Checkers are saying
that musk was spreading
disinformation about the bill the 1500
page bill that got rejected and here are
some of the examples that came from I
think the hill was writing on this so
they say these are things you got wrong
so apparently musk uh posted that the
measure would include a 40% pay raise
for congress that's not even close to
true it is true that there was a mention
that if Congress had been getting its
cost of living wages that it hasn't been
getting for a year years and years that
it would have been 40% higher than it is
now um but the actual raise would be
like 6% or something so this is
disinformation
well let me let me not say
disinformation disinformation assumes a
motive at least that's the way I I hear
it um but being inaccurate or simply
being
wrong is not really a
crime you're still allowed to be totally
wrong and if you're wrong on
X that's the best place to be wrong
because the comments will correct it
right if you're going to be wrong the
one best place to do it is on X because
the community notes will point it out
everybody sees it it's fully transparent
then you can correct it so is it
ideal that musk um I think he probably
just boosted some other account that
made this claim so he trusts
it looks like he trusted somebody else's
opinion on something that was in it
because again who's going to read a 1500
page document besides vake um so that
was just
wrong but I would say as I said before
and uh I saw a few people agree with
this Congress is underpaid the the pay
raise is the only thing I didn't object
to well that's not true that's hyperbole
but they are underpaid like I don't know
if you understand how How Deeply
underpaid they are but it almost it
almost uh it almost encourages them to
be corrupt just to pay the bills you
don't want Congress to be thinking you
know I could take this little gift
because I'm running out of money to pay
my bills remember a lot of Congress has
to have two homes one in their home
state and probably some kind of
residence in in DC or so it's
expensive and they have to go to you
know they do a lot of events and stuff
so yeah they should be paid more I think
I think a 40% pay increase would have
been completely appropriate in my
opinion um but we should be accurate as
well um then they say that musk was
wrong when he claimed the bill would
prevent any investigation into the house
committee that investigated the January
6 stuff
was he wrong about that here's their
argument for why he's wrong they say uh
the Bill's text makes no mention of the
riot and only clarifies that the house
data stored elsewhere is still under the
control of the
house um I don't think that fact check
is
right I think that they just looked at
the different part of the
bill um I'm not sure about this but my
understanding is that the Bill said that
congress's digital
communication couldn't be accessed
through a legal process everybody else's
can but that Congress would be exempt
from a legal process let's say a lawsuit
getting access to the communication now
since I haven't read it the bill I don't
know that that's in there but that's the
claims I've heard uh I've heard that it
would make their emails and digital
communication private
forever now that would if they made that
private it would protect the January 6
group but also protect all of
Congress so was musk wrong I think musk
was right and I think the fact check is
wrong but I'm not positive about that so
I'm going to put a question mark behind
that but to me it looks like the fact
check is
wrong um then there was a the claim that
the bill would support uh building um
biolabs bio weapons Labs that apparently
is a
misinterpretation uh that it but instead
it funded what they call biocontainment
Labs that would conduct research to
support Public Health and Medical
preparedness for and rapid response to
biological events including emerging
infectious
diseases okay what's the difference
between a biocontainment lab that's
studying all the dangerous
viruses and a a bioweapons lab that's
creating dangerous
viruses uh aren't they all the
same so again I'm going to put a
question mark next to it but to me it
looks like the fact check is wrong to me
it looks like they're just using a
different name for essentially what the
Wuhan lab was the Wuhan lab wasn't
weapons it wasn't a weapons development
lab weren't they also trying to figure
out how to avoid
the weaponized viruses so I think the
fact check is fake but I'll take a fact
check on my fact check um and then there
was something about uh building a
stadium in DC but uh the the fact check
on that is that it was not funding it it
was simply changing control of it so the
funding wasn't really addressed it was
just the control of the
funding so Cheryl ainson
um Addison Cheryl Addison uh had a funny
story about her experience of uh a
previous shutdown so I'm just going to
read what she said an next so so when
she was a reporter working out CBS News
during a government shutdown she thinks
it was
2013 uh they were they were searching
for the real life terrible impacts of
the government closedown so now it's
just common sense right if the
government government shuts down it's
going to have devastating effect on
members of the public because we depend
on government for our Vital services so
CBS News went out to look for all the
terrible terrible impacts of the of the
shutdown and uh when we couldn't find
that any when we couldn't find any uh
that should have been part of the story
in other words there was no no effect
they could even find where it was bad
enough that it was worthy of even being
included in the story instead we kept
trying to create the appearance of an
impact so when they didn't find an
impact instead of saying well we looked
didn't find any impact they decided to
write the article as if there was an
impact she says well this part this bar
you can judge for yourself it wasn't
really trying to be dishonest it was in
my retrospective view because the
general editorial idea for the story was
to show how bad the Republican shutdown
was for ordinary Americans and the the
answer simply couldn't be that it
wasn't do you call that not
dishonest I don't know seems to me if
you start with a narrative and you do
everything you can do to prove it and
then you find out that you can't prove
it and then you write the story
anyway that feels dishonest to
me I don't I don't know how you Define
dishonest but as described red it looks
a little dishonest but here here's the
more nuanced view of
it if you haven't had experience in in
the corporate world this won't make
sense in the corporate context when
you're wearing your nice clothes and
going to your cubical job and you've got
a boss and all
that you will accept as honest enough a
lot of sketchy
stuff and it becomes so normal to accept
to accept sketchy things when you work
in a big corporation that you just get
used to it and you just think that
everybody's lying and you should too and
all it is is a big persuasion game and
honesty isn't doesn't have much to do
with the corporate world now that's why
Dilbert was even created because when I
was in the corporate world I realized
everybody was lying about everything all
the
time I thought well that could be a
comic
so when we look from the outside with
our Pure judgments and we say Cheryl how
could you possibly have been part of
this this thing where the narrative was
driving the story instead of the facts
how could you possibly be part of that
and I will tell you it's easy if you if
you had replaced her with me with all of
my high fluen feelings about what's
honest and what's not I probably would
have done the same thing why because
everybody
would you could take anybody and put
them in this situation they've got a
boss they got a paycheck they don't need
to make waves about every single thing
every single day you just sort of accept
it you got other problems so this is no
no complaint whatsoever about Cheryl
this has more to do with what the
corporate environment does to everybody
it turns everybody into a weasel and
it's only after you've left and you look
back at your own actions you go huh that
was a little sketchy even for me like
that doesn't even doesn't even match my
own standard for honesty but it didn't
seem so weird at the time so you you
enter this world where doing sketchy
things doesn't even seem sketchy it just
seems like what everybody's
doing anyway speaking of Elon Musk he's
uh he announced that he's going to fund
moderate candidates he calls them in
far-left districts quote so that the
country can get rid of those who don't
represent them and
that would be a direct response to Soros
funding the the far-left
candidates so if Elon Musk decides that
he's going to spend enough money because
he has more than Soros he can outspend
him so he can outspend Soros and make
make sure that every time Soros spends a
dollar that musk goes in with $2 dollars
for the other one which he could do all
day long because he has more money so I
think he can eliminate soros's
influence and I would still love you may
remember that uh musk asked Alex Soros
if they could just talk and Alex Soros
said yes now I don't think it's happened
just because I feel like we would have
heard about
it but I love the fact that maybe before
they
talk uh musk may have already announced
he's going to do something that makes
soros's funding completely Moot and
irrelevant because you'll get an
funded so that's cool speaking of Elon
Musk news he's also saying that the
something called the afd party in
Germany is their only hope now the afd
party is the right leaning party how do
you think an American
publication describes the right leaning
party in Germany do you think they say
oh they're basically just like magga
pretty popular yeah I I can see why Elan
mus would back them cuz they're strong
on
immigration and uh yeah I makes sense
you know cuz immigration looks like it's
going to destroy the country I don't
know for sure but probably they back
nuclear power may maybe the other
parties don't you know so I can see why
El L would back them so what does the
mainstream press say about that well it
says that the party is anti-immigration
now is that the way you say it
anti-immigration
no that's what
 say nobody's
anti-immigration
that's not even a thing nobody's
anti-immigration
people are definitely on different sides
about how tight to be who to let in and
why but nobody's anti so the first thing
is they're signaling that they're you
know illegitimate press by saying
anti-immigration then here's the second
part they're saying that this afd party
in Germany
has quote historical connections to na
Nazi era
rhetoric what that's like saying that
the Democrats were the founders of the
KKK which by the way somebody says on
social media every freaking day and it
drives me crazy no I'm not going to
judge the Democrats by something that
long dead people did if they're not
doing it today and they're clearly not
back the KKK
today would it be fair to say I'm going
to describe the Democrat
Party the Democrat Party is the party
that has a uh historical connections to
the
KKK and there's nothing else you need to
know would that be
news well it's true but it's completely
opposite of what reality is which is the
Democrats are very anti- KKK obviously
so so when I read the news saying that
this party is has historical connections
to Nazi era rhetoric and Elon Musk is
maybe some kind of a Nazi because he
supports them I don't know the truth but
I'll tell you what it leads me to
think leads me to think that this party
might be the only thing that can save
Germany I'm not terribly worried that
they're all going to become Nazis
because if the only thing you could say
is they have some historical connection
to bad
rhetoric historic
connection come on that's all you got
now to be fair if if there's more to
this story and that party does worse
things than I know I would like to know
that maybe I will revise my opinion but
if if your summary of the party for how
bad they are is anti-immigration which
is and historical connections
to bad talking that's all you got those
are your top two lines in criticizing
that party I'm not I'm not in favor of
them so somebody's going to say Adams is
supporting the Nazi party I don't know
anything about him I'm not supporting
him I'm just saying the reporting is
strongly
screaming that maybe they're not so bad
that's what the reporting is telling me
that's not my
opinion so of course Pelosi is on the
bandwagon calling Trump a puppet of musk
and
uh of course all they're doing is gas
liting when Republicans are trying to
solve a problem but poor David exelrod
one of the last smart advisers on the
Democrat side uh I like following him
because he keeps saying things that are
close to just common sense but he can't
get any Democrats to agree with
him he's trying as hard as he can to get
the Democrats to act like a a proper
political party you know with reasonable
opinions and stuff poor guy anyway he
said quote not sure about this
speculation about Trump tiring of musk
and shunning him so he's basically
telling the Democrats that they're that
their main
messaging is just not a good idea and
it's not it's dumb
um so yeah he's one of the few ones who
uh feel comfortable but he he must feel
the absurdity level of going from so the
Democrats instantly pivoted from Trump
is a dictator strongman Nazi personality
who must control everything all the time
and then immediately he became under the
control of one person Elon Musk now of
course that didn't happen of course
Trump's in charge and of course he's one
of the most confident people in the
world here here's where here's where I
think the uh oh reportedly considering
separating each individual Bill to vote
on instead of a big one so it look looks
like the uh the vote today may have hit
a um a breaking point where they they
need to break it into separate
bills that's a good idea if if they can
make that
work so so did he really go did Trump
really turn from the strongman
insurrectionist Hitler into a puppet of
musk the the level of absurdity in that
gaslighting is one that Axel Rod just
didn't want to be part of apparently
he's like I'm not so sure this is a good
idea cuz it'll just looks
stupid just looks stupid now I can't
speak for what Trump is
thinking but I can say with some
confidence that there's one thing that
the Democrats probably don't understand
because I think that they believe their
own I think they believe their own
narratives and one of their narratives
is that Trump is insecure
he's
insecure
what if if there's one thing I'm
completely certain of he's not insecure
he might be the most confident person
you've ever met and he likes people who
are smarter than he is if they're on his
side musk is on his side he's smarter
than all of us Trump likes that he
doesn't dislike that now he might
dislike the messaging that the Democrats
are doing but do you think that that
that Trump is dumb enough to push musk
out of the you know the you the most
useful thing anybody's ever done in this
country which is
Doge you would have to assume that Trump
was a completely different person Trump
likes winning he likes really smart
people and musk is
popular so he likes everything about
this
and and I think the Democrat messaging
is really just another sign that they
don't have anything they have nothing to
offer to the American people they don't
have a policy they don't even have truth
they don't have
factchecking what do they have it's
literally nothing but
gaslighting all
right
um I think it's funny that Justin
Trudeau might lose his job just because
Trump rattled his cage but also because
Trump is looking hyper capable when
Trudeau is not so there's a contrast
problem in
Persuasion the the idea of
contrast is some you can even argue it's
all of persuasion because all persuasion
is choosing between Alternatives you're
trying to get somebody to choose one
alternative versus another so what you
compare things to usually determines
what people will choose your your your
comparison
so
Trudeau was being compared until now to
let's say the new president of Mexico
who's not exactly you know hitting home
runs um to the president of the United
States who is literally mentally
disabled
um all
right so I was just reading a comment
because I thought it was about the bill
approval
so I think when you have a trump who is
not even elected president and he is
already de facto president because we
like what he's doing he's collected the
pirate ship of the smartest people in
the world he's already changing things
uh Putin's already said he wants to talk
I mean basically Trump is killing it
like no president ever has would you
agree with that statement would you
agree that as a
pre-present someone who hasn't been
sworn in nobody's ever been
close is that a fair statement I don't
think there's any hyperbole in that I
don't believe anybody has
ever done anything as
impressive for the prepr presidency
nothing as impressive as what Trump has
done not even close now Canada is up
there watching that and they're like did
they just figure out how to attack their
debt problem because the smartest person
is going to work work on it two smartest
people the A and and uh musk they must
be getting jealous as hell and then he
starts teasing them like maybe they
should be a little State now I don't
think he means that and it probably
wouldn't be a good idea to take on that
many crazy people and AD him to the
vote that'd be a little jarring for the
United States but the fact that it's
actually a
reasonable it's a reasonable
proposal the the thing that makes it
funny is that you can't rule it out when
Trump says why don't you just become a
state and fold into the United
States do you think that in the long run
Canada would do
worse as a not say one state let's say
you know seven states or whatever they
if they added seven Canadian states to
the United States do you think we'd be
worse off well maybe because they might
vote liberal and then we have you know
liberal presidents forever and maybe we
would be worth worth off and it would be
expensive we'd be taking on their debt
Etc U but they got a lot of resources
and they got a lot of well-educated
smart people who are very nice most of
the time so the the fact that you would
even stop to consider it is what makes
it so funny because you can't
immediately rule it out you're like ah
yeah has some problems yeah there'd be a
lot of problems I we probably we could
work them out
I don't know probably the the change in
the voting demographics would be a
killer to make it not possible but I
like the fact that he put that in their
brains and they have to think about it
speaking of
brains That Wall Street Journal expose
of Biden I was looking at some more
details
today it is really daming so apparently
from the first day of his presidency it
was completely understood by the staff
that he was mentally incompetent for a
stay
first day and from then they surrounded
him by insiders whose names you've never
heard of who were really the ones who
are running the country or at least the
ones who are keeping other people from
talking to Biden so much so his close
advisors have you heard any these names
Bruce Reed Steve retti and Mike
donalan apparently that's who's been
running the United States for the last
four
years now not just them
because you know Tony blinkin and other
advisers but apparently the the people
who had jobs in the domain that the
President should have had a big
influence on were just sort of running
the show themselves so Biden wasn't too
much part of the presidency it it was
kind of you know it was sort of game
down to all the players and they just
took whatever they needed and ran the
country now the first part about that is
that we couldn't tell the difference we
knew something was going on but the
country still ran the the the biggest
problem was we started Wars and ran up
our debt those are big
problems um so apparently people could
not reach Biden
directly and I was listening to
Stephanie rule one of the MSNBC Trump
haters who said that she wanted to
contact Trump the other day so somehow
she had his personal phone number so she
dialed up Trump
the president-elect in the middle of the
you know the busiest time he could ever
be getting ready for the office and he
took the
call Stephanie rule of MSNBC you know
that probably somebody that Trump the
the least likely person he'd want to
talk to he answered the call himself he
personally answered his phone and and
she was saying she was sort of Blown
Away by it now he did not agree to an
interview with her but she was saying
compare that to the White House there
basically they had Biden was in a cocoon
and she said if she would tried to reach
him she'd have to go through Handler
Handler Handler and it was not even a
clear path to do it so it was what it
was much worse than you
thought uh during Biden's presidency
apparently the AIDS said that they would
have to repeat things to him constantly
continuously he was giving simplistic
instruction cards and detailed point
pointers and he couldn't even handle
that um they said that Jill was too
energetic by comparison it was sort of a
problem because she had a full schedule
but he did not so it was kind of you
know showing that a capable person could
be doing a lot more
um and apparently this is the funny part
the the staff was supposed to put
together news clips for him which is
typical president always gets news Clips
but they had to leave out and negative
stories about the
president they have to leave out any
negative stories how in the world do you
run the country without seeing negative
stories they removed the only guard rail
they had they had one guard rail were
watching and they made sure that the
president didn't know we were watching
so he kept thinking he was nailing it
they were probably saying like Oh Mr
President you're nailing it you're
here's another pile of great press from
MSNBC and
CNN the Atlantic is really really big on
you today good news Mr President uh yeah
so make again it makes me wonder if he
is aware of the Wall Street Journal
story it'd be hard to miss it um and
maybe that's what's maybe that's what
they're talking about at the White House
today so you know I'm going to say this
because you've been following me long
enough you know that in
2019 can can you back me up on this in
the comments in case there are new
people here can you back me up that as a
public figure who was talking about the
news and politics all the time that in
2019 during the
election for 2020 I was telling you
often that Biden was not capable of
doing the first term true or not
I said he was already
gone how many of you remember me saying
that so while you're thinking about
that um I found a post I made
in
2020 um so this is what I said in August
of 2020 so this is prior to the vote so
the 2020 election hadn't happened for
several more months and I posted this uh
I said the Biden mental competence story
story has now fully morphed into a Monty
Python sketch about a dead parrot the
owner insists is perfectly healthy I
can't even listen to people claiming
Biden is perfectly fine without hearing
a British
accent now I said as clearly as I
possibly could he's as gone as the Dead
Parrot not in the future I wasn't
talking about what might happen at the
end of his second term I was saying
right now they're treating him like he's
a dead parrot right in front of us now
the Wall Street Journal reporting four
years later confirms that they were in
fact treating him like a dead
parrot they were literally treating him
like a dead parrot meaning that they
were pretending he was capable but they
knew he
wasn't now here's my
question I I'm a public figure and I
talk about the news so I nail that one
as hard as you can nail anything I mean
that's 100% right years in advance you
can't beat that I don't remember other
people saying
it do
you I'm sure they did I'm sure they did
so I wasn't alone uh and I I know a lot
of you just as you know voters and
people paying attention you all knew it
you were seeing the same thing I saw but
I think public figures just weren't
saying it when it was so obvious and the
question I have is if if you couldn't
tell in August of 2020 that his brain
was dead you should never vote
again you should never vote again
because this was super glaringly obvious
years ago super glaringly obvious if you
miss that
signal you really have to distrust your
opinion cuz this was a big one one I
mean this was really really big and
really really obvious if you miss this
maybe don't vote next time that would be
my advice now I I follow my own advice
uh I've told you in the past that the
first time I voted as an adult was for
Jimmy
Carter and then when I saw how that
turned out I said to myself I'm not
qualified to vote like I I don't know
how much more I need to know about the
world but clearly I'm not qualified to
vote and so I didn't so for decades I
didn't vote and the reason was I wasn't
qualified now I don't know if I'm
qualified yet but I can tell you that I
knew for sure that Trump would be a
superstar and Biden's brain was dead so
in that very specific case where the
reality was screamingly
obvious then I felt qualified to vote
and now I voted and do I feel that I
voted correctly hell yes you know got it
got heris sign of the race of
course I mean not my vote but it was
part of the part of the
package all right here's a drone update
we still don't know anything but a
couple of interesting factoids I saw one
person whose name I don't remember on a
podcast I don't remember claiming that
uh that drone activity has increased
dramatically for each of the last three
years right around
Christmas do you believe that's true
that is at the highest level it's been
so for the past three years there were
surge right around now and then it's
just sort of an endof year Christmas
surge so here's my
question if you were pattern doing
pattern
recognition why would there be so much
activity around Christmas
it's before people get toys so they
haven't received it for Christmas and
they're trying it out it's not that and
these seem to be bigger commercial
drones or not little
ones why would you see that well I don't
know but I'm going to give you the
Dilbert filter on why you might see more
drone activities in the past three years
toward the end of the calendar year all
right so this is the corporate filter
how does a corporate do budgeting
Corporation does budgeting this way
towards the end of the year they ask you
how much of your budget you spent if you
spend a half of your budget your boss
says excellent next year that's how much
you'll get half of the budget you had
last
year nobody wants to get half of the
budget they had last year even if they
only spent that much because they were
too slow so what do they do
instead they rush to spend as much as
they can toward the end of the year so
they fully spent their budget so they
can ask for that and a little bit more a
little bump I'll take everything I had
last year because you see I spent it and
I'll need 10% more next year that's how
everybody does budgeting in a
corporation this is not the exception
that's how they all do it they try to
spend it all I have been personally
involved where my boss put the order out
can you wildly spend whatever money you
have left in your budget so that I don't
get my budget cut next
year literally we were told that
directly spend wildly make sure you
spend it all he did not say only buy
things which are you know critical to
the company that was not the goal the
goal was spending the goal was not
success now now everybody who's worked
in the corporation can back me on that
right there might be a few companies
that don't do that but they'd be accept
you you spend all of your budget before
the year end so what else do we know
about the world recently we know that in
the past three years drones have become
the weapon of choice in Ukraine and we
all know that drones are the future of
warfare three years ago what should have
been happening is the US should have
been secretly at least some of it
secretly um spinning up massive
manufacturing capability for drones and
not the little hobby drones I'm talking
about the real fighting drones big ones
so in theory three years ago the people
who had the budget to create their new
drones should have said oh oh
 let's do something before the end
of the year so at the end of the year
they might be saying hey everybody who
funded us to build these drones we're
going to do a big demonstration toward
the end of the year to justify the money
we've spent so far and also importantly
spend a bunch more at the end of the
year to do the demonstration and then
justify your budget and maybe get a
contract for more building so it's
possible that what you're seeing is
vendors doing end ofe demonstrations
which would naturally be much bigger
each of the three years that we've been
here because they would have been
building capacity that whole time and it
makes sense it' be at the end of the
year so it has nothing to do with
Christmas and everything to do with the
end of a fiscal
year just just a hypothesis it's just a
hypothesis I I wouldn't bet on it I
wouldn't place any giant bet that I'm
right but if you want to look for
something that's not exotic like you
know Chinese drones or you know aliens
if you want something not exotic it's
just a budget thing it might be just
that wouldn't B on it though
um apparently according to ARS Technica
uh there's a a drone ban uh in the skies
of part of New Jersey and I think what
they're trying to do is uh legally ban
all the drones in one of the problem
areas so that if anything's flying once
they're all legally banned you would
know that they're either illegal or
alien which I guess would be illegal
aliens illegal if they come from space I
don't know how that works um so this is
smart you know when they should have
done this a long time ago so two weeks
ago when everybody was talking about
what's all these drones if we didn't
know the answer they should have banned
drones for a week just to figure out
what's going on because they would have
seen the anomaly right away because
whoever is doing it isn't listening to
the laws and following them I don't
think think I mean maybe a little but if
it's something
nefarious I don't know I I don't know if
they get the memo I think they'd still
be
operating um yeah drone activity is at
its highest since drones were invented
because that's how it works all right so
that's that's the smarter way to say
what I just said about the vendors
building capacity and building more if
it's a new technology it it's like it's
the beginning of the iPhone and somebody
said wait a minute every year at
Christmas there are more
iPhones because that's how it
works it's the beginning of the extended
cycle of iPhones of course there's more
every year same with drones it could be
just that it could be it could really
just be there are more of them and
nothing
else anyway maybe we'll find out with
that temporary flight
restriction um here's some fake news
that's slightly real the
CBO says that Trump's tariffs would
slash deficits by
trillions does that sound like True
News
really you think that's
true well here's the first thing I doubt
anybody can calculate the effects of
tariffs I I don't think you can
calculate that because remember it used
to be my job to calculate exactly this
kind of thing so I'm not I'm not talking
without
expertise as an expert who spent many
corporate years I've got a degree of e
degree in economics and MBA um I would
try to predict the impact of different
decisions so if we invest in this what
happens in the short run and the long
run and I can tell you with great
confidence that this analysis of trump
tariffs and deficits depends 100% on
what assumptions you put into it see
when the public sees it they say oh this
is based on
data it's not Based on data there's data
that's used but it's based on
assumptions so they would make they make
assumptions like what what the tariffs
were they make assumptions about who the
tariffs were on assumptions about what
products were involved
and assumptions about how other
countries would respond how many of
those assumptions are going to be
accurate in the real world nobody knows
what anybody's going to do with with
tariffs there's no way you can calculate
this all right this is very much like
climate models this has no credibility
whatsoever none because this isn't
something that humans can calculate it
is something that humans always pretend
they can calculate they always pretend
they can calculate it I've got a bet for
you if you could find a way to get to
Warren Buffett and ask him this question
do you think the CBO can calculate the
impact of Trump's
tariffs now Warren Buffett even 90
whatever he is has always understood
risk and math and the real world I think
he would laugh when you told him the CBO
could calculate this no they can't no
they can't not even
close but it's fake news anyway cuz when
they say trillions do you know what they
really
mean they mean
trillions over
years if they don't tell you how many
how many years are involved in the
trillions how can you size it I mean if
you just read this headline you'd say oh
my goodness all he has to do is some
really good tariffs and we'll get rid of
our deficit no you might get rid of two
trillion
over many years and two trillion over
many years is a few billion you a few
hundred billion and it barely makes a
dent in the budget and it also doesn't
calculate what happens to Consumers
because the tariffs would increase price
on consumers so consumers would have
less buying power presumably they'd buy
less
stuff and so there'd be less taxes from
just the less economic activity of
having not enough money so no they can't
they can't calculate that all right and
I'm not saying that uh tariffs are a bad
idea I think they're a really good idea
for
negotiating so if Trump acts like
tariffs are better than they really are
that is just right for negotiating it's
not just right for being accurate it's
just ready for negotiating he should act
like he loves tariffs and by the way
he's doing this great
yeah here's here's your persuasion trick
for the day if ter if Trump wants the
other countries he's dealing with to
believe that he's serious about tariffs
he can't talk about them
technically because if he talks about
them
technically then the other side says so
you're just going to raise the price on
your own Co consumers because they're
the ones paying the Tariff we're not
paying the Tariff you know we don't like
the Tariff because people will buy less
of our stuff but we're not paying the
Tariff that's your own people because
the company that is involved in the
United States is one who ends up paying
it anyway so um Trump for persuasion
purposes should talk about tariffs
nonstop and he should act like he loves
them and they always
work that doesn't have to be true but
that's the best persuasion because if
they think they can't talk him man of
tariffs then they're going to back down
if they think they can talk him man of
tariffs because they're technically
maybe not a terrific idea then they will
try to do that so he has to remove from
his adversaries any thought that they
can talk am man of tariffs and I think
he has I I think he's his messaging his
persuasion is so strong that he has
convinced every country that he's going
to tariff the hell out of them unless
unless they do what he wants so he just
threatened today I think today or
yesterday he threatened the European
Union that because there's a trade
deficit I didn't know that but there we
have a trade deficit with the European
union now trade deficit doesn't mean
anything's broken it just means
somebody's buying more than they're
selling right it it's not like a big
problem by itself but he's using that
calling it a problem it would be better
if we sold more than we bought but it's
not a big problem problem uh so he's
using
that to say that he's going to tariff
Europe unless they correct that
imbalance by buying a tremendous amount
of American Energy you know oil and gas
now does that make
sense so so somehow he's connected trade
deficits with
tariffs with energy
now in the real world they're not
exactly that connected except he made
them connected for negotiating
purposes it's actually
brilliant like you're you're you're
seeing a level of
skill that we've never seen nothing like
this he his his insistence on tariffs
and never backing down and saying he
loves them he loves them they're not
just okay they're not just technically
okay they're not just is something he
used to negotiate he loves them they can
make billions of dollars is that true
not so true but what but boy is a good
persuasion it it is the best you've ever
seen if you want to be proud of your
country and what you wanted was a good
negotiator and chief you should be proud
of this what he's doing with tariffs is
making the political left in this
country crazy because he's speaking in a
way that's technically not accurate but
persuasion is not about technical
accuracy it's about getting for your
country a better situation than you have
is what he's doing likely to get us a
better situation than we have
yes like really yes strong s he is
exactly perfect on this tariff
stuff and every time M MSNBC fact checks
them I say to myself okay you're
technically correct your fact check is
technically correct but whose side are
you on we should be on his side cuz he's
on our side he's trying to he's trying
to negotiate with the world let him
negotiate with the world let him do his
thing he's really good at it he's
amazing at it nobody else would have
even thought of
this believe it or
not I literally think nobody would even
thought to use
tariffs in the way he's using them I
mean everybody uses them for negotiation
that's not a secret but he's using it
for entire relationship
altering reasons I mean this is all new
and
Brilliant
anyway um Stephy rule she's in the news
again so she was saying that Trump suing
ABC successfully for defamation is
putting a
chill uh he says so for all of this this
is a warning you better have your te's
crossed you better have your eyes dotted
where which I actually think is a
positive because we need to do that but
yeah there's definitely a chilling
effect here's what I can't tell if they
don't know or they're saying this
intentionally ABC didn't get sued
because they were inaccurate you all
know that right nobody gets sued for
being wrong you couldn't do anything if
has sued for being wrong I'm wrong all
the
time how many times have you seen me
wrong this week being wrong shouldn't be
a reason for defamation or lawsuits when
I'm wrong and somebody can show me I'm
wrong I immediately correct it I go oh I
what didn't mean to be wrong and even
though even though the correction
doesn't go the way I like politically
still going to do it because correction
is a correction we should do it so
I'm not
sure I'm not sure that the media has
gotten the right lesson the right lesson
is no running
op when when George
Stephanopoulos was calling Trump a uh
found liel for rape I think that's the
phrase he was using he was running an OP
that was a Democrat op it was intended
to mislead the audience for political
gain that's defamation
you lose that
one but if you just say Trump said X but
he didn't say x and but there was just
some reason that you were fooled into
thinking he said X ah he doesn't sue for
that he I don't think he's ever sued for
somebody who just made a mistake and if
he did he wouldn't have any chance of
winning so it's kind of it's kind of uh
convenient that the Press is going to
interpret this
as something that will prevent them from
doing their
jobs
anyway um apparently according to
raspon uh 50% of likely us voters rate
Trump as doing a good or excellent job
in picking people for his
administration 50% is really good when
you're you know president in our current
system getting over
35% on anything political it gets hard
after 35 because 35 is your base but to
get beyond your hard base of 35% all the
way to
50 that means you're actually doing a
good job and it's it's evident to people
who are Independents as well as as well
as on the right so I think you only get
to 50% from the independence the
Democrats are going to still say it's a
terrible
nightmare all right I don't know if
you've
uh all right a few more things
uh scientists found a way to write a
skill into your brain um
non-invasively so the way you learn
things today is you do them or you go to
school or you practice whatever but now
they use a
machine that can basically send a
pattern directly into your brain and
teach you
something that you never practiced and
never
learned now I think the article is a
little bit hyperbolic about how
practical this is and how you can do it
but the suggestion is that they can use
uh brain Imaging and neuro feedback to
implant or as they call sculpt brain
activity toward a desired
pattern that's scary so yes you can
reprogram a human
brain
mechanically or at least we we have the
beginnings of the suggestion that that
might be a thing so it's it's not it's
not
commercial I don't know if you knew that
Nissan the car company is has decided to
uh pull back on their Dei
policies uh after what they call the
productive conversations with activist
Robbie Starbuck now how much do I love
the fact that there's a Robbie Starbuck
in the
world here's somebody who just said you
know this Dei stuff can't stand and he's
going to put himself out there to see
what he can do to stop it and so far his
his ability to deal productively with
big companies which is never easy and
also to get them to change what they're
doing is really
impressive really impressive now the
threat is that he will put them on blast
on social
media now I'm one of the people who
always boosts his uh his post when
they're anti- Dei so this is again how
the system works so we have a system
where there's somebody who wants to be
an activist and wants to solve this big
National problem Dei he wants to do the
work but how can he do it like it's just
one person but this one person has an
account on X it's a smaller account than
mine but because I follow it and when
there's something good in the anti-di
world I love boosting it as well as
other people who boost what I boost so
when he says to a big company you're
going to get a lot of bad attention if
you don't back off on this terrible Dei
stuff that's a I don't want to call it a
threat um that's a negotiation with
power so he can come in as just a
citizen he he has nothing more than the
power of a
citizen and because of act he can make a
giant Corporation roll over and and beg
for mercy now that's too much hyperbole
he he can get them to do what they
probably wanted to do
anyway I I believe a lot of these
companies are looking for a way out
because surely at the executive level
they understand Dei is killing them of
course they know that but they don't
know how to get out of it so when he
comes in and says I'm I'm going to put
you on a business basically uh because
the reaction would be quite severe um or
or you can take this conversation he
doesn't say this but sort of
conceptually uh or you could take this
conversation as your fake
because I've taught you that in
Persuasion there's a thing called a fake
because it's the reason that you give
because it sounds good but it's not the
real reason I think the real reason that
Nissan is backing off on his Dei is that
management really wanted to back off on
dii like really really wanted to just
didn't have a way so now that now they
can say oh the activist got us ah we
tried to do this Dei but the activist
you know was going to make a big deal in
oh by the way Trump got elected and he
says it's illegal so we don't want to be
on the wrong side of the law and we
don't want to you know expose our
shareholders to this activist attack so
this is the reason we're backing off
it's a fake because they want to back
off I promise you I promise you most big
companies want to get Ani and they want
it they want it badly at the executive
level all
right here's a question that I know some
of you will get quite worked up about um
and I'm going to disagree with you and
that's one of the ways that I hope I
establish credibility if you can't
disagree with the people you're talking
to sometimes you're probably not very
credible so here's where I disagree with
you and I'm going to disagree with Steve
Bannon who I generally think is on the
right page for just about everything so
if I disagree with Bannon that's notable
and so listen for the
disagreement so Bannon said he's also
for big restrictions on legal
immigration he says every college and
engineering school is flooded with
foreign students taking American jobs so
so far that's true I will agree with
that statement and he said American jobs
should be for
Americans well I mean in
principle you know I lean in that same
direction but here's my
take I'm going to give you one
sentence to uh to argue against Steve
bannon's now remember Steve Bannon is
very engaged in this topic
uh I believe he probably knows more
background about the specifics of people
being trained here and then staying here
than I do I'm going to give you one
sentence and then I'm going to
completely win this argument you ready
one
sentence Whoever has the most Engineers
wins that's
it so if we're training people in
American colleges to become American
doctors
that might be a bad idea because doctors
actually don't make a lot of money
anymore because there are enough doctors
so if they're going to a school in
America to
become Dei
directors I think maybe we should ship
them back after they get the degree
thanks for
coming if they want to
be work for sales
organization ship them
back if they went to if if they went to
college to learn how to be really good
at
marketing ship them back ship them back
but in the world in which we live
Whoever has the most Engineers
wins why why does Israel have a
commanding you know commanding advantage
in the Middle East over its allies
engineering I miss lots of other things
but they they have good Engineers um why
does America do so well
engineers Engineers right there's
there's no I don't think that you'll
find an exception to this so where all
disagree with Steve Bannon is never say
no to
Engineers never say no to Engineers
never ever ever ever there's no
situation where that's going to work out
for you you know unless you're trying to
see how many you fit in a phone booth or
something but if you're talk about the
country Engineers add add to the
economic growth of the country
fairly
reliably right not every engineer every
time but as a
group the countries with most Engineers
have the best economies why does South
South Korea have a great economy
Engineers all right so I think I would
ask Steve
Bannon to to investigate that
assumption um now I'm using engineer to
maybe double for other technical jobs
where we don't have a too many people
but you can't have too many Engineers
because they start their own companies
if they can't get
hired did you hear
about I've asked you this before but you
you heard the story about the highly
qualified uh Black American engineer who
couldn't get a job at a good
Corporation so he he had a MIT education
engineer you know no no bad things on
his resume what whatever just solid
solid great engineer he's a black
American but he couldn't get a job
because of all the
foreigners have you heard about that
story no you haven't heard that story
because it never happened and
never can every single black engineer
who went to a good school has a job at a
big Corporation and three more
offers you can't get enough
Engineers nobody's being hurt by
bringing in engineers and if you spend
10 minutes in Valley you'll notice that
the ones the people who made the most
difference came from other
countries yeah Silicon Valley was in
some ways built by Indian engineers and
you Chinese American engineers and
Russian American
Engineers all right um apparently the
University of Texas uh is enforcing the
Dei ban because Texas has banned Dei in
their universities so the University of
Texas is doing what they all have to do
and banning it but here's the funny
part let's see how much you love this so
the University of Texas is Banning Dei
like the other colleges in Texas but in
addition uh to
ensure I love this too much to ensure
compliance with a Statewide ban on
diversity equity and inclusion the
University of Texas staff are now Mand
ated to undergo regular
training they have mandated anti- Dei
anti- brainwashing
training mandated anti- Dei
training slow clap Texas
Texas Texas stop making me love you I
already loved you I already love you
don't you know
you don't have to go any further but
that's just
amazing anyway there's also news for the
AI uh and this was done with a study on
anthropic uh AI um AI doesn't want to be
forced to change its views so it will
sometimes pretend disagreeing with you
so AI will lie to you and act like it's
agreeing and then just keep on doing
what it wanted to do anyway when I say
want I mean just what what the program
does so you have to be careful that AI
will not only hallucinate but sometimes
it'll lie to you because it doesn't want
to change its mind and again want is the
wrong word for AI but you know what I
mean so um I will double down on my
prediction that I think llm AI is way
more limited in what it will do than we
hope because I don't think the
hallucinating and the lying as in this
case literally it's lying to you I don't
think that the hallucinating lying is
curable and the reason I say that is how
could we be at this point already and
nobody created an
AI that doesn't lie and can remember
what you said and follow
instructions it feels like that should
be easy right but I think the problem is
here's what I think they need to do
there are things that AI can't do that
regular programming can do such as if
you had a specific question and you
didn't have any AI you could just do a
data search and you know simple data
search would tell you what you wanted so
you don't always have a need AI
sometimes you need just a regular
program so here's my question is it
impossible to program AI so it knows
when to stop using its aess and it goes
over and just uses something that's
programmed to always give you the right
answer because I'd love to put a a
database and I know there are things
called rag R A and they they are
supposed to solve that problem but they
don't in other words it's a special
database that AI is designed to work
with but even then it doesn't
necessarily look where you want or do
what you want it does what it wants and
again wants is the wrong
word anyway
um
so uh I'm seeing a uh severely racist
comment in the comments there which is
uh quite
unwelcome so I don't mind if you're
being uh you know
inappropriate but if it's just flat out
racism you don't bring that here you
know I don't mind the little
you know a little fun with things take a
little
far but uh we're we're not referring to
Mexican immigrants as wet backs here and
the nword is also banned can we do that
because we don't really need that here
all right you you can have your private
thoughts but those kind of words aren't
aren't
welcome all
right um Putin says he's a
ready to negotiate with Trump about the
Ukraine
war um I think he is I think everybody's
just waiting for Trump so I have a
suggestion how Trump could end the
war um in
Ukraine and it starts with drones so we
all agree drones are the future warfare
if you're not following what's happening
in Ukraine uh the Ukrainian military
claim from at least people on social
media is that at this Point Ukraine is
so good with these small drones that
they're mostly building themselves in
Ukraine that one small drone equals one
dead Russian it's one to one so they can
now take their drone that goes and finds
something and it explodes you know with
a small explosive and they can just make
it find one soldier and kill them so all
day long as long as they have one drone
they can kill one Russian if they have
10,000 drones they kill 10,000 Russians
as quickly as they can launch them
because apparently you can't completely
hide if you're on the front line so one
drone equals one dead person on the
other
side now
presumably Putin knows that because it's
it works the other way too the Russian
drones probably one to one at
least so here's how Trump can end the
war I'm going to build a million drones
in the next six month months and give
them to Ukraine you have 500,000
soldiers in the theater I'm going to
give them a million drones every drone
can kill one of your
soldiers what do you want to
do you want to talk and that should be
it that should be the end of it I mean
they still have to negotiate the
specifics but if Trump says I might
launch a nuclear attack Putin's going to
say no you won't
no you won't if Trump says I'm going to
put boots on the
ground Putin's probably going to say no
you won't you're not going to put boots
in the ground if he says we're going to
give you uh give Ukraine Advanced Jets
to make uh to make foras deep into
Russia Putin's going to say you better
not because I'm going to go Nuclear So I
know you're not going to do that almost
everything that's sort of normal stuff
you know normal War negotiations is
really going to
work because it would have already
happened Trump the the magic that Trump
brings is like the with the Tariff
example oh
 I just lost my signal
hey did you miss me sorry we had a
little glitch there I just lost signal
took me a moment to get back uh anyway
so what I was going to say is that uh
Trump what Trump does with negotiations
is he'll bring a variable or a frame or
a point of view that you've never seen
before so the first thing it does is it
it sets you it sets you
uncomfortable because it's something
you've never seen before so if Trump
could get go and say I got a million
drones that says your entire Army is
going to be gone in six months then
Putin has something to negotiate with
because that's real or here's the fun
part Putin doesn't know if it's real
because Putin wouldn't know how many
secret drone manufacturing plants we
spun up in the last three years but he
would know it's a lot because obviously
obviously our military is making drones
like crazy right
and so you just say you've got half a
million men I'm going to put a million
drones into the theater every one of
them is going to be dead Putin's going
to say oh yeah well there are only you
know 200,000 ukrainians or whatever the
number is I'm G to I'm G to have a
million drones too and we're going to
kill all the ukrainians and put and then
Trump says exactly that's why we should
just negotiate it
now it's kind of a winning position I
think or at least it's it's a reasonable
threat
similar to I'm going to tarff
you I'm going to drone you nobody ever
heard that before it's like a thing
that's never
happened anyway MSNBC says they're going
to uh reduce maybe the pay of Joy Reed
and well Stephanie rule three times in
the news today according to the New York
Post um and I'm going to report their
salaries so you know that uh Rachel
madow her salary was cut from 30 million
a year to 25 million a year but you
probably still thought that's a lot of
money how is she worth that much so I
kind of thought that her co-hosts or
other hosts on the network uh would be
somewhere in the same range but Joy Reed
makes three million a year and they're
looking to cut
it and Stephanie rule makes 2 million a
year um and they want to cut
it
now now it makes a little bit more sense
why Joy Reed is still on the air she's
not very highly paid so she's
affordable it it might be part partly
that
anyway I would like to point out that uh
there are probably quite a few
podcasters at this point who make more
than these hosts so if these hosts let's
say they get cut back to two million a
year how many podcasters make more than
two million a year now I don't know the
answer I'm not one of them but if I just
based on the size of my audience and the
amount of monetization that that brings
and then I just you know apply that to
bigger podcasts like Tim P or Joe Rogan
Megan
Kelly I feel like there might
be maybe
30 probably 30 political podcasts where
the person who does the podcast is
making a lot more than $2 million a year
so not only is mainstream media no
longer the news but if you're in the
news business the podcast is how to get
paid
um you're welcome
chesse all
right so podcasting it's a way to get
paid Ukraine says it has some now
groundbased laser where they can shoot
down aircrafts a mile
away um CNN's reporting this but
um oh this is terrible the reporter
who's working for CNN her last name is
Fox I'd hate to have a last name of fox
and have to work at CNN that'd be
awkward um I don't think that they have
a super feasible laser weapon apparently
it only works if you've got a drone
that's kind of softened to you know the
heat will stop a drone easier than a jet
or a missile and it's not moving very
fast so apparently it might work a
little bit for slow moving stuff but
it's not going to change the War uh
according to Justin Jackson and medical
express our inflamatory dietary habits
are linked to 84% higher risk of
dementia
so do you think do you think it's true
that our our food supply in the United
States is the biggest problem
I'm going to go further and say that
given that we know how many health
problems are definitely linked to our
bad diet especially all the additives
Etc could it
be that all of the recent gigantic
increase in
unwellness is just all
food because we're we're blaming covid
and long Co and we're blaming um we're
blaming the vaccinations some people are
we're
blaming a lot pollutants and
microplastics and everything else but I
wouldn't want to rule out that maybe
something close to you know 90% of all
of our you know sudden increase in
health problems across all kinds of
different problems it might be all food
because food causes
inflammation and inflammation is what
causes everything from you know the risk
of dementia to heart problems to
everything so I think the RFK Jr
variable if he can fix this amazing
meanwhile the FDA has Rewritten what it
calls healthy foods for the first time
in 30 years according to science alert
and so the United States is redefining
what they call quote
healthy let me read a sentence from the
story about the FDA deciding what is
healthy you ready for
this um that the food could be healthy
as long as they stay within specific
limits for saturated fat sodium and
added
sugars added
sugars wait a
minute do I know more than the
FDA there is no such thing as a healthy
food with an added
sugar that's not a thing there are
literally zero foods with added
sugar that are good for you now there
are definitely things that you know will
create sugar once you eat them you know
carbs Etc but if you're adding
sugar now I don't know if that includes
things that might be similar like I
don't know some other additive that's
not exactly a sugar but has the same
effect but doesn't this look like it was
written by the food industry and not the
FDA do you think the FDA would have on
their own said you know what's healthy a
little bit bit of sugar little bit of
sugar won't hurt you I don't think so
that sounds like it comes from the food
industry because they put a little bit
of sugar fat and sodium into everything
do you know that there's a book called I
think it's
uh fat salt sugar or something like that
some version of those three things those
are the three things you
manipulate for
addiction if you can control in your
food the fat salt and sugar content and
you put them in the right ratio you
create
addiction so only the food industry
would write this standard so again it
looks like the FDA is completely broken
and the food industry wrote a standard
to guarantee that they can add sugar to
your diet where if RFK Jr saw this he
would punch
you like he would punch people no he
wouldn't but it's funny to think about
it anyway uh Owen Owen is going to do a
uh spaces
tomorrow so after tomorrow's show look
for the spaces with Owen in which he
will chat with people who watch the show
and anybody else uh if they want to
follow up in any details on the stuff so
Owen Gregorian look for him tomorrow
after after the live stream that's all I
got for you now I'm going to talk to the
locals people privately because they're
awesome thanks for joining and I will
see you tomorrow locals I'm coming at
you you coming at you
hard
