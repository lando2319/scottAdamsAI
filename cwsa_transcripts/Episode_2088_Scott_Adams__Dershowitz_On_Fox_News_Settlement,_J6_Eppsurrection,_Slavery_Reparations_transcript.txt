foreign
good morning everybody and welcome to
the best thing that's going to happen to
you today maybe in your whole life it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and
there's never been
a better moment in the history of
humankind and whatever came before that
before space-time existed
now if you'd like to take this up to a
level that nobody's ever seen before
well all you need is a cover of mugger
glass a tanker jealousist iron I can't
theme yoga flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine here
the day the thing makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous sip
and it's happening now
go
ah
so much better now
well we got some fun stories for you
today fun and fun stories
uh first of all how many of you have
seen that UFO video that looks like
something about the size of a softball
zipping through the sky unexplainedly
have you seen that one
look at it again
and then imagine that instead of it
being a UFO that's zipping sideways
across the sky imagine it's just
dropping from above
it's sort of like that is the dress you
know what color is the dress as soon as
you imagine as soon as you imagine it's
not going sideways just in your head
look at it and say oh there's something
dropping from above that's just falling
down
it looked pretty fake to me yeah mylar
balloon blowing around maybe
yeah
well we have the Sip you missed it
Raymond
so
UFOs I would say I'm not convinced I'm
just not convinced
um in Chicago
a bunch of pastors organized a March
of black men who were organized
to it was in response to the
the violence that happened over the
weekend so there's a big mass shooting
so a bunch of black men organized by
pastors did a March in Chicago
to which I asked this question
what do they ask you for
and what are they protesting against
and what's the plan I didn't see any of
that in the story now did the news
forget to forget to mention the point
oh a bunch of black men are Marching
and
and they're asking for
their demanding what
I don't know
well what does the March do
was there somebody who saw the March who
was a criminal
maybe a murderer he sees the March he's
like wait a minute wait a minute wait a
minute I'm seeing a March a black man
organized by Pastors in reaction to the
violence of the weekend
I'm starting to think that all my
murdering is ill-advised
now that I see that March
I I I've decided to murder less
how does it work
now I'm all in favor of you know action
and maybe that's where it starts yeah
maybe it's just getting attention but is
there somebody who didn't know the
murder rate was high in Chicago
is there anybody who didn't know the
problem existed and it's like really bad
I feel like every time
somebody on the left tries to fix
something
you can't identify how the action would
in any way work
like you can't even connect it in your
mind it's like okay
were they protesting themselves
because usually if it's a March they're
protesting somebody right you're
protesting let's say the police
but in this case this was black on black
crime they were protesting
were they protesting themselves I mean
not personally but it was a group
protesting its own group wasn't it
how does that work
how do you protest your own group
well what do you do I just feel like
there's something terribly missing
even though all of the intentions and
you know the energy in the right
direction but to what end I don't know
something's missing there the only way
that a March would help
as far as I can tell as if they just
took their families with them and just
kept marching to a safer place
I think people who were not criminals
should get away from criminals
what do you think
if you're not a criminal and you live
where there are lots of criminals
job one is to get away and I'll tell you
what I would have protested for if that
had been me
I would protest for a government help
for relocation
right because that's actually a solution
well my family are not criminals we
don't want to live too close to a big
criminal situation so can we get some
government funding
just for relocation and get another job
in a safer place with a better school I
feel like that would fix most things
because it would turn it would turn the
cities into just you know complete hell
holes because all the good people would
leave
but what's the alternative
it's going to turn into a hell hole
anyway and while it's happening people
are being victimized so get the people
who want to just have good schools and
good lives just move them
in fact it would be interesting to see
if conservatives
put together some kind of like fund
where you could contribute to it
and it was very visible you know that's
the problem with Charities who are not
visible but let's say it's very visible
if you contributed to some Republican
fund
that anybody who wanted to get away from
a Democrat crime-ridden hellhole could
apply
and if they didn't look like criminals
themselves and they had a little good
application it'd be like applying to
college
we applied to college
why can't you apply to move your family
to a safe place
just like anything else you know tell us
what you need tell us who you are we'll
evaluate it give you some money if it
makes sense because it seems to me that
if you moved a a well-meaning
law-abiding family
from where the kids will grow up with
all this criminal influence to a place
where they could grow up with you know
without it or less of it wouldn't you
come out way ahead
wouldn't that money be really well spent
you'd create an entire successful family
plus all of their kids and kids forever
that just seems like a gigantic lever
just to get them out of the bad place
get them where there's better school
anyway that's just an idea so I think
scholarships
for removing the people who want to
succeed
legally
would be maybe a way to go because
nothing else is working right nothing
else is working
and I think that when people demand your
money you have a very different feeling
about it than if you can simply donate
your money to something that made sense
let me let me see if this
feels right to you if the government
says to you hey give us some money so we
can give it to this other group what's
your first reaction
how about no how about I earned my money
how about I keep it how about that how
about I just keep my money and you go
away
but I suppose somebody says to you this
proposition
Hey look
we've got this program where we can take
a really a family that has potential and
they're not criminals and they want to
just do well and stay in school and stay
off drugs but they're in a terrible
place
could you give twenty dollars to a fund
just 20 bucks to a fund that would be
saving families and we'll let you know
how it goes it'll be very transparent
would you give twenty dollars to that
well some of you would some of you
wouldn't obviously but some of you would
and you might even feel good about it
because the problem is when the
government asks for money I think it's
wasted
now you oh the government wants more
money from you okay so I lose money and
I gave nothing
that's how it feels because it doesn't
feel like they need the extra money they
need money
but extra do they really need extra I
don't know
but if it's my option
I love to help the the greatest
underutilized resource in the country
is that white men like to help
I've said that before and I and I'm sure
that people who are not adult white men
don't understand it at all now I'm not
saying there are other groups who are
not like that that's not the point I
don't know about other groups I'm just
talking about a group I know adult white
men
always want to help they just don't want
to do stupid stuff and waste their money
so all you have to do is create a
situation to where they can help and
they're all in all in I'll give you all
my time all my money you can have
whatever you want it just has to be
voluntary and useful
all right
apparently I woke up this morning to
find out that somebody has compiled a
gigantic list of alleged transphobes
did you see that this morning on social
media
it's like 42 000 people on a list
of transphobes
and and I was alerted to the fact that
I'm on the list
I'm on the list of transphobes of
literally the most famous pro-trans
person who has a conservative audience
name one person who's more TR more
pro-trans than I am who has a
conservative audience
nobody I'm the number one most
trans-friendly pro-trans person who has
a conservative audience I'm exactly who
they should be promoting if you were if
you were a trans activist you should
make me the most famous person who's
your ally
because I'm talking to the people who
are the least likely to be on your side
with the most positive spin
on their situation I'm the most useful
person period to the trans Community
maybe in the whole world because the
people who are preaching to their own
side are just talking to people who are
already convinced so you can eliminate
everybody on the left
as being the best supporter of trans
rights because they're just talking to
people who agree
but how many people have a conservative
audience who tell you practically I
don't know three times a week that let
the adults alone you know the kids are a
different story of course but just let
the kids live let the adults live let
them have their life now the question is
about sports are completely uh separate
right
uh
protrans for adults only I don't know
what that means
anyway so that's a fake list obviously
they didn't put any time into putting
that together if you see it don't pay
attention to it
well rayaps appeared on 60 Minutes and
uh if you were going to predict how that
would go what would you have predicted
let's see
I'm going to guess that the people who
think that rayaps was you know innocent
of all let's say government Connections
in January 6 they still think it because
60 Minutes told them and then the people
who think it's the opposite of the truth
that rayaps might have had something to
do with the government and maybe
organizing things allegedly
uh do you think that they were talked
out of it
let me tell you what I saw
uh as Mike sonovich pointed out
accurately
so the FBI did a statement that said
um
the FBI issued this statement Ray Epps
has never been an FBI Source or an FBI
employee
now do you remember when the FBI was
asked under oath
uh did Ray UPS you know work for you or
the government or something and they
said something like no comment
they wouldn't answer that question
but then when they're not under oath as
sort of edge points out when they're not
under oath and they're just doing a
press release
they say the opposite
so under oath they say one thing and now
under oath they say the opposite how do
you interpret that
I only see one way to interpret that and
I'm gonna have to go the assertive path
on this one yeah I don't think they
could tell you he's guilty
or has some some kind of connection any
more clearly than that
all right now number number two are you
aware that it wouldn't necessarily be
even the typical situation
for Ray apps if he had any involvement
with the FBI if he did
you wouldn't be a source
would they call them a source
because he's blamed for being an
operator not a source
but somebody goes and makes something
happen now somebody just talks about
things right so we agree is not a source
he was never accused of being the source
was he was he ever accused of being a
source
well he might have been a source for
somebody
we don't know that but maybe not the FBI
and they say it wasn't an FBI employee
what's that mean he wasn't an FBI
employee
that's pretty specific isn't it that's a
little too specific of FBI yet your
working assumption has to be that the
FBI knows who he works for and is
government related
doesn't mean it's the FBI
but the FBI clearly knows I would say
based on the 60 minutes and the way they
answered in the FBI's response that the
most reasonable interpretation is that
he was involved with some government
entity but not on a payroll
not on the payroll didn't get a paycheck
wasn't an employee
but may have had some benefit
they didn't say he had no benefit for
what he did don't know about that didn't
say he didn't work for the CIA didn't
say he didn't work for Homeland
is there some kind of Homeland Security
defense there are a whole bunch of
agencies and police departments and
government entities that could have been
working with them we don't know
so and what did 60 Minutes ever explain
why he kind of quickly got off the most
wanted list
60 Minutes didn't explain that right
that's like the biggest mystery because
that just sort of doesn't happen
you don't just take somebody off the
most wanted list that would be kind of a
a long process
right
all right so I would say
that Tim Poole's take was pretty good he
tweeted that from now on I'm calling j6
the ray Epps insurrection
and
then I saw another tweet from somebody
called calling themselves chat chat GPT
but it's not chat just a person who said
we think the hashtags should be a
hashtag Ray epsurrection
drives a Home point point even better
then I thought I could improve on that a
little bit so I tweeted j6 epsurrection
I think I'm going to call it the
absurrection from now on
and not because I think he was guilty of
working with the government
but because he was air organizing
he was an organizer on January 6th so it
was an abstraction
what do you think j6 absurrection I like
taking the ray part out of it because
that doesn't add anything
yeah
it was an abstraction
so
uh here again we get to the concept of
working
sort of your working understanding or
your working assumption
the government has now very clearly sent
us the signal
that j6 was a government operation
and they're trying to hide it you
realize that 60 Minutes is the same
people who who had Trump on and told him
that the honcho laptop was Russian
disinformation
that was the same 60 minutes
now can you refresh my memory
what does 60 Minutes say about Russia
collusion
did 60 Minutes say Russia collusion
looked pretty solid
looks like there's some Russian
collusion here I don't remember
but
I think I would have known
if 60 Minutes said it wasn't true you
know while it was still going on
yeah so
if you see a 60 Minutes cover piece so
now the New York Times in 60 minutes
have both given cover to rayaps which
would be the most damning thing I could
think of
the New York Times is
I mean not even barely at a news
organization anymore it's mostly just a
government Democrat entity
so I think that the 60 Minutes in my
mind
has now solidified an opinion that I
thought was just wow maybe yes maybe no
I see what you're talking about but the
60 Minutes things just totally
solidifies that there's something there
that made the January 6 situation not
what it looked like
and that it was probably a government
operation a democrat-led operation
that's what it looks like now that's
just a working assumption right now I
don't know if rayapse is guilty of
anything and I won't allege that he is
I'm just saying that the way 60 Minutes
has presented it is as guilty as hell
so the presentation makes him look
guilty
of some kind of government connection
not necessarily illegal I don't know if
any of it's illegal that'd be different
but
so I want to be as clear as I can just
so rayaps doesn't sue me I'm not aware
of any crime he committed
none I'm not aware that he lied
I'm not aware of it
but 60 Minutes did present to us a case
which is really convincing that he's
guilty of some connection not of a crime
not of a crime but guilty of a
connection to the government that has
not been disclosed
would you accept that interpretation we
don't know
but we've been told as clearly as
possible is true
it's just how you choose to accept or
interpret that
all right
have I've been talking to your ex
um
so that was fun
so Trump is still hammering on uh
DeSantis I guess he's sticking with Ron
de sanctimonious what do you think of
Ronda sanctimonious
I don't feel like enough people even
know what the word means
it's too long got a lot of syllables it
doesn't feel like up to his normal
standard does it it's it's like
nickname week
but on on the other hand he might also
not want to take him down completely
because if you're Trump you want to
weaken DeSantis in the primary but you
don't want to take him out do you
because you still need them
if if Trump gets the nomination he wants
to have a a DeSantis that he can
reconstruct
you know make DeSantis a supporter or at
least not a detractor so Trump can't use
a Kill Shot like he used on
uh
on uh what's his name Bush you can't say
it's low energy because that might take
to Santa sound completely he can't say
he's crooked right he's not going to
call another Republican crooked if it's
a you know a national name
so he doesn't really have the kill shots
that he would have if he were going
against you know a clean enemy who's
always going to be an enemy he has to
reconstitute
so he has to go just hard enough
that he's got his you know boot on his
neck but he doesn't kill him
just hold him down a little bit
so here's what Trump said I don't know
where he said it maybe he tweeted it
but DeSantis is doing some kind of world
tours in Japan now
uh but he's also
uh
I I think this part is just a joke
because I don't think DeSantis was ever
going to Walter Reed Medical Center but
Trump said that the governor is being
sent to Walter Reed Army Medical Center
for an emergency personality transplant
a personality transplant
ouch
the personality transplant now that's
the Trump we know and love right now
that's that's the Trump we're waiting
for okay all right you're back right Ron
de sanctimonious
um that's a warm-up swing
but uh the DeSantis has to go in for an
emergency personality transplant
now doesn't that remind you of Bill
Maher's comment
that people don't want to vote for the
tribute band
right it's the same Vibe DeSantis is the
tribute band Trump is the the real thing
but this is this is the same Vibe just a
different take Trump is the biggest
personality we've ever seen
the Trump has so much personality people
ask him to turn it down
uh that's way too much personality could
you could you just dial down the
personality a little bit even though
that's why we like them
um
I think this was a good attack
because because again it's not fatal it
just shows that Trump is more
interesting and people do follow energy
I would also say that this is a message
to the Press
do you get the message to the Press
what's the message to the Press
if you have DeSantis
you don't have a business model
because he's not interesting there won't
be anything interesting to talk about
so I I think in one way I don't know if
he thought of it consciously but it
looks like Trump is uh warning the Press
that they only have one way to make
money and it's not the boring
personality guy
and he's right he's right the oppress
would make way more money with Trump in
the race would you agree
you agree right I mean I think it's sort
of obvious the DeSantis would be a
profit killer for the Press
now if you follow the money
is there any way that DeSantis can get
elected
now if you follow the money to donations
I think Trump will have the most am I
right is that does that look like that
will be true that Trump will raise more
money than DeSantis right because his
poll numbers are bigger
um
so if you follow the money it's going to
be Trump over DeSantis for the donations
I think that could change but that's
what it looks like if you follow the
money for the Press
the Press absolutely makes more money on
Trump
so follow the money says Trump's your
next candidate it doesn't say he's
president
because that becomes a different follow
the money
um
you know situation
but if the Americans feel that they can
make more money with Trump
he's going to be your next president
so those are three follow the money
situations one is who gets the most
donations probably Trump
who makes the press the richest
definitely Trump
who makes the public make more money
individually well some of the people on
the left might think they'd make less
money because they could get less you
know in support or something but if
people think the economy will do better
under Trump that's the end of the game
he's your next president
don't you think
if Trump looks like the economic it's
all about the economy stupid remember
Bill Clinton it's the economy stupid if
if Trump just doesn't talk about
anything but inflation and economy and
get out of Ukraine because it's
expensive
I feel like he's got it
so
all right uh the funniest most
interesting story of the day
is there's a video of Lieutenant
Governor Mark Robinson now you now for
the purpose of the story you need to
know that he's a black politician
because that's important to the story
um it actually is I say that joke only
sometimes but it's actually important to
the story
um so he's running uh people say he's
likely to be the GOP front runner
and he gave a speech saying that uh
uh Black Americans owe reparations to
this country for their freedom
[Laughter]
now let me go back to he's a black
GOP politician
and he's saying that he's saying that
black people should pay should pay
reparations to this country
now he didn't say to white people but
you know
you're kind of Intuit that uh
now in the same article
uh well I should have a different
article but do you think he's the GOP
front runner
do you think the GOP front-runner could
get in front of a crowd of people and
say you know what I think black
Americans owe you
[Laughter]
oh my God
yes I believe he could win the
Republican nomination with that message
could he win the general I don't know it
just depends how many Republicans are
compared to Democrats and you know
there's probably a black white element
to that as well so I don't know if he
could win
but it's a hell of a message
all right here's my first question to
you do you take it as literal or
hyperbole
do you think he was literal or was it
obviously hyperbole I'm kind of leading
the witness here of course it was
hyperbole no he doesn't think they
should cut checks
no no he does not think anybody should
come to check
it's pure hyperbole
and it takes one to no one
so he's gonna be they're going to treat
it like it was real right the the left
is going to treat that like it was real
that was never real
that was the least real thing anybody
ever said but it's got your attention
didn't it so here I am talking about a
lieutenant governor
did that work oh yeah it worked it
worked great you get all this attention
it's still hyperbole you know nobody's
going to take it that seriously but boy
does that reframe stuff doesn't it
and then I said to myself Scott
you were a financial analyst for a
number of years in your early career
so it used to be my job when I worked
first for a bank and then the phone
company
to do a financial analysis of different
alternative plans and I'd say do this or
do that and then not figure out which
was more expensive and I'd do the math
and I'd write it up in a report and I'd
make my recommendations
so I'm a person who has great experience
comparing things and that's what the
reparations are it's a comparison
problem you know how are things compared
to how they should have been or could
have been so here are some of the I did
a little research to find out what that
would look like if I had gotten the
assignment right so say there was no
politics involved of course that's
impossible but imagine it was and
somebody just came to me Scott you do
this kind of analysis
can you do an analysis of how much
reparation should be for slavery
and I'd say all right but first I've got
to gather some information
so first thing I do is I figure out
where did the slaves come from
in what region of uh of Africa so a lot
of them came from Nigeria not all of
them but the the land that is now called
Nigeria
was sort of that geography was a source
for slaves
so I say to myself all right if they had
not been picked up by the evil Slade
trave slayed slave trade
um what would be the gross national
income of a Nigerian today
it's about two thousand dollars a year
in American dollars right so the so the
people who were not slaves and they
descended from the people who were not
slaves in Nigeria they're making two
thousand dollars a year on average now
they do have the middle class but on
average it's two thousand dollars per
year uh let's compare that to our
descendants of slavery are doing in the
United States they make it in uh
nineteen thousand dollars per person now
I believe I need to I need to fact check
in this when they do the income per
person
does that include retired people and
children
right so if if the only person if
there's only one income in the family
that one income is divided by the number
of family members
is that correct
because it I don't think it's the family
this doesn't sound like the family
income
that sounds low for a family income so I
think it's a per person right but in
either case they're compared I think the
same
so let's say that a black American is
making uh 10 times as much as somebody
who has not descended from slavery
but that's those are not the only
calculations because
there were 400 years of slavery
400 years so that has to mean something
compared to like a 150 some years since
slavery ended
so you'd have to also calculate the
amount of time right because a little
bit of Badness over 400 years you got to
multiply it by 400. that's a lot of
Badness it's never been a little bit
okay let me let me amend that it's
always been a lot of Badness but a lot
of Badness to over 400 years
that's like 400 worse than one year
and and they've only been it's only been
post
slavery for 158 years or so something
like that
so you've got to calculate that in so
you'd have to make sure you had some
kind of yearly yearly thing in there
next thing you'd have to do is figure
out number of people
how many black slaves were there in
America in 1850
what's your guess how many black
American slaves were there
or just black slaves they weren't
technically citizens right so how many
black slaves were there in 1850
the answer is around nine hundred
thousand
around nine hundred thousand by the way
I would consider that a foundational
educational fact
which I didn't know so that's bad on me
wouldn't you say that people should know
how many people died in the Holocaust
right how many people died in World War
II in general about 60 million some say
you should know how many people died in
Vietnam you should know how many people
were killed by uh Hiroshima and Nagasaki
would you agree
those I think those are basic numbers
and I'm I'm finding much to agree with
black America about the fact that almost
nobody knew the right number
that's telling me that education about
our Slave past was incomplete
how do we not all know that number
isn't that that's like foundational
right
we know how many people went to January
6. we know how many people died in 9 11.
but none of it looked like almost none
of you could name the number of slaves
on you know at the time that slavery was
winding down
I didn't know either so I'm not mocking
you because I didn't know so my my
education had that Gap as well
you agree with me that we should all
know that number right that's like so
basic we should know that so around a
million just just rounded off to a
million so let's say there were a
million slaves when slavery ended all
right now second number you should know
what percentage of America
is black
I bet most of you know this number
percentage of black Americans
around 13 14 right yeah 13 14. so a lot
of people know that number but you
didn't know how many slaves I mean
that's that really
that that's kind of a shocker to me but
it's a shocker about myself as well
you should all know that number
um all right so that translates to about
41 million black Americans now
so there were a million
uh slaves and there are 41 million black
Americans but they didn't all come from
they're not all descendants of slavery
so if you take off the top the number of
people were probably immigrants were
non-descended from slavery so maybe 30
million this is my estimate 30 million
ish
black Americans who are descended from
slavery
so that would be 30 million people who
are making nineteen thousand dollars uh
compared to 2000 per year
anyway
then uh next if if I were doing this
calculation
I would also look at the cost and
benefit
in a crime situation
what do you think is the cost of crime
because we do know that black Americans
are disproportionately in prison you
know as a per capita there are more
black people in prison and that costs
money
but so the cost of keeping one prisoner
for a year is a hundred and six thousand
dollars
so if I were calculating this I'd say
well
here's a here's a basic assumption I
probably have to do two calculations one
calculation says that the excess crime
of black Americans is caused by white
people
and caused by slavery
so that should be part of the expense
that that white people are responsible
for because they created a situation
that caused crime to be high and
therefore that's a white person causing
trillions of dollars of criminal
activity
or I would do two calculations the
second would be personal uh personal
responsibility
where it doesn't matter what happened to
you in your youth it doesn't matter what
your environment was if you committed
the crime well that's on you
now that would be a second completely
different calculation
but apparently the cost of crime at
least by one estimate in the US is 2.6
trillion dollars per year
2.6 trillion that's all crime and then
uh
one estimate is that although black
Americans are 13 of the population of
America they account for roughly a third
of the crimes
so would you
would you include in your reparations
the cost of excess crime
and say all right
the reparations might be this big but
you have to subtract the cost of crime
or would you do the opposite would you
do the opposite because that would be
just as justifiable you say no this
crime exists because of what white
people did to slaves and therefore white
people should be paying that extra in
fact that should be money that should be
paid to the criminals
because the criminals didn't cause it
they were put into a situation which
guaranteed there would be high crime
because it was high poverty High poverty
pretty much guarantees high crime
all right
so yes so you've got offsetting
calculations it would be difficult to do
that calculation
so here's my point
do you think you could ever calculate
calculate reparations
I believe that you could do it at least
three different ways
you know depending on who you think is
responsible for the 2.6 trillion dollars
per year of crimes mostly white people
for creating the situation or
to some extent also black Americans were
having a higher crime rate than other
groups
and that's that's kind of philosophical
that's not a math question
right it's not a math question but yet
we're asked to do math
if there's one thing I can teach you is
that math is always oh I'm going to come
up with a saying that will be quotable
forever I'm going to try to come up with
some uh Andrew Breitbart like saying you
know where he said that uh
politics is Downstream from culture
something like that I was going to come
up with one of those that when you're
doing calculations
the your your math is Downstream from
your assumptions oh that's pretty good
math is Downstream from assumptions if
you're looking at the math you're
wasting your time
because the math was sub sort
the math was uh
subordinate to
yeah let's say that math was subordinate
to the assumptions the assumptions are
the math
right so if you decided oh I think I'm
gonna you know blame one group or the
other group for a crime well that's a
2.6 trillion dollar variable per year
the the entire calculation would depend
on your assumptions not on your math the
you could you could do all the math
wrong
and the assumptions were still
tell you which direction things were
going
so the uh I do think that the discussion
of reparations is infantilizing the
black community
uh in my opinion treating reparations
like it's a serious topic
is treating black people like children
and it's basically oh yeah we'll we'll
look into that to kids
uh but when are we going to get there
Dad when are we going to get there uh
real soon
right it just sounds like parents lying
to children I find it offensive that the
reparations uh I feel I feel it's
offensive to Black Americans to have the
conversation
do you feel that way
I feel it's literally an insult to Black
Americans to even have the conversation
it feels that way to me I would kind of
hate it if the situation were reversed I
would hate it
like if I succeeded as a as a black
American I would just hate this
conversation because it would make me
feel like my accomplishment would be if
you'd less uh
less positively than it should be
um
anyway I think this whole conversation
on race is starting to loosen up a
little bit you're welcome
so here's a
here's a little mystery that I think is
solved I've been wondering why Fox News
settled
because I kept looking at the evidence
and the evidence was the the charge was
that the Fox News people knew they were
telling lies about the election
and I kept looking at all the emails and
the messages and I never saw that and so
I said well how could they lose a case
that literally doesn't have any evidence
against them like how is that possible
so I was I was predicting they would win
their case
and then they settled for a god-awful
amount of money allegedly hundreds of
millions of dollars
and I was still confused I was like okay
like I get that people settle when they
think they're innocent that's not
unusual but this is so much money
and there's no evidence of the crime why
would you possibly settle that and then
I wondered what Alan dershowitz would
say
because for years I've been sort of
following what dershowitz says and I try
to guess what he will say before he says
it and here's what dershowitz says
this is somebody quoting him so I didn't
see it from him if if I have this wrong
will somebody fact check me on this
right away I don't want to get this
wrong but this somebody's reporting that
or she had said
uh that he's he doesn't know why the Fox
News settled because in his opinion they
had a better than 50 percent chance of
winning the case
now that's how you do the math so
inertia was apparently knows how to do
risk calculations good for him the way
you do this is if you have a 50 chance
of winning
uh in the the case is a billion dollars
against you
you should count that as like half a
billion dollars
right so so sort of like a toss-up in
that case so he is correctly saying that
if the odds of winning were greater than
50 percent the best financial move would
have been to fight the case in court but
they settled
and here's the speculation
that Patrick Byrne tweets today
and he said he got a leak a few weeks
ago the fox was going to settle in the
hundreds of millions so this is before
they settled so this this is to his
credibility that
you know he'd heard weeks before that
they were going to settle for hundreds
of millions and uh they were that
they're going to do that because Rupert
Murdoch thought it would help Trump
if they won the suit
because imaginative Fox News won the
suit
which said they were lying about the
election being rigged
because they weren't lying
they were just showing what people were
saying I don't think they lied at all
except in the opinion World which is not
really a lie just an opinion
um
do you believe that
do you believe that Rupert Murdoch
would spend hundreds of millions to make
sure that Trump didn't look better
because the biggest thing keeping Trump
out of office would be January 6th
wouldn't you say
I mean maybe not but it feels like it's
going to be the thing so but I I do
follow the logic of it I I would say I'm
not going to believe this story because
it feels like there might be more to it
but it does track
the tracks here's how it tracks suppose
you're Rupert Burdock here uh and he's
would you agree that Rupert Murdoch is
probably a genius at risk assessment
would you agree I mean he's Rupert
burdock
he's probably a genius
at risk assessment so here was his risk
assessment if I fight it I might lose
1.6 billion
bad
so so in the worst case I lose 1.6
billion in the best case I save 1.6
billion and I guarantee that Trump
is president
but if I settle
I I half the RIS is half the risk of
losing the whole thing and maybe he can
afford half the risk it could be that he
just did the math and he said I can
afford half of this
and still stay in business at least Fox
News can stay in business
but if I pay all of it I don't even know
how to keep the lights off for the
business I mean I suppose there's a way
but
um
and then on top of that he would be
getting Trump elected and he he doesn't
want to be in the business of making
that happen apparently so
I don't know
I feel like it might not be the whole
story
but it's plausible
I would rate that as plausible
yeah how many of you think that's
plausible we can't say it's true
sound plausible that that the Trump
election was the main reason for
settling
I don't know it doesn't feel
I don't know feels 40 true or something
like that
all right it could have been part of the
part of the decision though
uh
have I ever described what a husband
apology is I've told you that right
so this is sort of a sexist you know
sexist 50s kind of a look on
relationships so you don't have to tell
me a sexist I'm just making a point here
so a husband really a husband apology is
when the wife insists on an apology
the man knows that it wasn't his fault
but he just needs to get through the day
yes dear totally my fault is all me
sorry I did that won't happen again and
then you can get on with your life
well apparently uh Robert F Kennedy Jr
did a husband apology in public and he's
just coming clean about it
he did a fake apology here's the story
uh I'll just read his tweet so it's from
Robert F Kennedy Jr he says for the
record I never compared the government's
covid mandates to the Holocaust as the
New York Times falsely reported this
week
huh
let's see it's RFK Jr against the New
York Times which one do you believe
I'll tell you it's a it's a good time to
be RFK Junior
because he can go up against the New
York Times and you know what I mean you
don't even blink you go oh the New York
Times lied
right
is there anybody here who thinks the New
York Times story was probably true
and the RFK junior is lying
no
no no no
everybody thinks he's he's telling the
truth what a good place to be
I I can't think of anybody else who
could walk into this conversation with
the New York Times and you just go oh
New York Times lied
right got it
now if I told you that the that the
Press gets a hundred percent stories
about public figures wrong
you don't think that's true do you you
don't believe that they get a hundred
percent of the stories wrong about
public figures they do it's all of them
this is just another example
so he goes on
so where did the New York Times get this
information huh turns out that according
to RFK Jr CNN originated this
mischaracterization
oh
so now we see how this works so CNN
mischaracterizes it then the New York
Times reports it as something like a
fact
all right but did he say anything about
the uh Holocaust apparently did
something and Frank reference but it was
in a different context
um
and then here's the part at the end RFK
JR says the onslaught of Relentless
media indignation finally compelled me
to apologize for a statement I never
made in order to protect my family
it was a husband apology
he knew he wasn't wrong but he just had
to get past it so now he does he does
what I I also did you might be comparing
this to my own story if you wait long
enough you can admit it was a husband
apology
which is what he did perfect
I love the way he handled this I love
the way that he treated them like
children and apologized because he knew
that he couldn't deal with them as
adults
rather than say well here's my speech
it's a public record why don't you just
look at it and you can see that I'm
right could have done that
do you think that would have worked
no because they would have looked at a
speech and imagined they heard it
they would have they would say I
listened to it it's right there even if
it's not and I don't think it is
so he played this the only way you can
play it right which is the you did a
fake husband apology he waited a little
while and then he called them out for
being stupid lying press
and it worked
nicely done
so
that ladies and gentlemen
is the fun part I just want to show you
uh
something that's a sign of the times
there's a tweet going around from
Caitlin Collins from CNN that purports
to show DeSantis meeting with the
Japanese prime minister
and he answers the question
something about running for president by
um
making a funny funny face
I'm going to show you the funny face he
makes and here's my question
is this modified
or is that actually his face
because we're in the age of AI I look at
his face and I say
that doesn't look like a real person
I'm going to show it to you it'll be
hard to see on my little phone but I
think you'll get the idea
we'll see if and when that changes did
you see it he goes
tonight I'm not I'm not a candidate so
we'll see if and when that changes
does that look modified
now I'm not saying it's modified but as
CNN is tweeting it and he looks he looks
just like a little more crazy-eyed
than I've ever seen him
now it could be it could be that he's
trying to joke and he's not good at
joking
because this this plays into uh Trump's
uh statement
so you know how Trump said he needs a
he's going into the hospital for a
personality transplant
and then you see this where it looks
like he's trying to make a joke or he's
trying to be playful
but he comes off as somebody who's never
made a joke before
like he looks like an alien yeah
shape-shifting lizard he looks like an
alien from another planet who's asked
the question and his programming doesn't
cover that situation
programming says act Whimsical to laugh
off notion you're running for president
when obviously you're running for
president make funny face well well if I
were running for president whoa whoa
I don't know
but uh so there's part of the story is
DeSantis
but part of the story is how easy would
it be for AI to
turn somebody normal into the uh
uncanny valley where you just tweak it a
little bit and they don't look human
just don't look human
like there was something about that that
looked inebriated
he wasn't yeah I'm sure he wasn't but he
looked inebriated
right it's going to be really easy to
make people look just a little bit off
just just five percent
somebody's going to make an AI that
tweaks real video just five percent
and it's going to be devastating
because people are going to look at it
and they're going to compare it to the
real one they won't even know the
difference won't even know the
difference and the fact Checkers will
say oh yeah that's a real one that looks
real
but just like a little bit of difference
that's all it would take to make him
look crazy
so but to be to be clear I don't think
he's crazy I don't think he was
inebriated
I think he was probably just an awkward
face-looking thing
uh but he does have a little bit of her
personality Gap compared to
a lot of people
all right uh
in India they love to move their head
side to side somebody says okay watered
off was the side to side thing it was
more of the eyes
talk about how Trump mocked kasich's
table manners recently
I don't know anything about that
yes yeah count the number of fingers
you know maybe there should be a law
that all AI generated people have to
have the wrong number of fingers
about that
all AI generated humans have to have six
fingers because that's the only way
you'd know
so you'd be watching movies and it'd be
like oh there's a famous actor or
actress but they have six figures oh I
get it say I
all right ladies and gentlemen
you know people with six fingers
I used to uh play with the the farm cats
at my uncle's farm so I used to work
when I was a kid working at my uncle's
Farm
and he had all these uh cats that sort
of lived in the hay and they weren't
they weren't domesticated he would feed
them but you know you couldn't pet them
or anything and because they were all
cross-breeding you know a lot of
a lot of inter-family breeding they all
had a weird number of toes
so there'd be like you know 50 cats
would come out if he put a little you
know milk down and you start counting
the toes it'd be like you know six of
this paw seven on this paw it was a dab
to say it was all it was like mutant
cats but there were like lots of them
yeah they were mousers uh cows cows
don't like mice
so I don't know how common this was but
dairy farms will often tolerate if not
feed Stray Cats because the cats get rid
of the mice and the and the cows will
give better milk I guess they freeze up
and they don't give milk as well if
there's the frightened the mice
I don't know if that's true that's just
what I heard when I was a kid
all right
having white cats have six toes
all right
uh cows are afraid of mice I think they
are actually
I think that's true
does anybody have a dairy farm any Dairy
Farmers here can you confirm that
can you confirm that cows don't like
mice
somebody says not true well I know they
don't like them but
are they afraid of them
they say that about elephants but I
never knew if that was true
you grew up on a dairy farm well what's
the answer
uh let's see the batting markets have
bidened over Trump by 10 points
well that makes sense at this point in
the
in the cycle I think when people think
that Biden's going to win it's because
they assume that the election is rigged
what do you sue
but we don't know
give me your assumptions do you think
the next presidential election will be
rigged or attempted to be rigged
I think so I think so
yep I would say based on what we've seen
the smart money says that there will be
an attempt to rig it
now the extent of that and the success
of that would be wildly variable
but I'd say yes my working assumption is
that our elections are corrupt
that's my working assumption but it's
not based on
any specific charge against any specific
entity it's just everything I've seen
would suggest the world I live in
if it's possible
and it is
if it's possible
somebody's going to try to do it
uh rigged as loser think no it isn't
it it would be loser think if I said I
know it's true
but it's just a working assumption
all right I mean if the government
wanted to change my assumption how hard
would it be
not hard
they would just have to say all of our
technology and all of our elections are
completely transparent
and that's not the case if you have a if
you have an election that's
non-transparent in any important part
you have to assume is rigged
I just assume it is
all right
um
there are more votes than registered
voters I don't know if that's true
that's one of the things I've heard
all right here's a mind blower for you
so I've got a friend who shall remain
nameless on Twitter who makes the
following claim
right the claim is that saying that
fauci funded gain of research in Wuhan
is fake news
even understanding that it could have
gone through you know a third party
entity before it got to that that didn't
happen
and that that's the rights version of
the fine people hoax
that there's actually no no evidence
that fauci was involved with funding
anything
that caused money for a gator function
to get to Wuhan
now what do you think about this act
there's somebody who watches the news on
both the left and the right because this
is somebody who watches both sides
it says that it did not happen and it's
fake news and that the entire
political right has bought into a
narrative for which there's no evidence
I I thought it was documented
so I I did a little check
in the news I didn't see it debunked
what I saw was a number of stories that
he that he was involved with the
approval of funding was it Ecolab or
somebody
who then funded the labs
and do we not know that they were doing
gain of function
yeah to me I thought that was proven
but it's sort of a mind bender and so I
so I sent my friend you know an article
that from the New York Post that
connects all the dots I haven't heard
back well actually let me check let me
see if an article that clearly says he
did it
will change his mind
I don't have a don't have a response yet
but the title of it is from the New York
Post NIH admits U.S funded gain of
function in Wuhan
despite fauci's denial well that's the
headlines
do you think the article doesn't
establish it
yeah
it's kind of weird
all right yeah I thought it was
completely established I didn't even
know there was a question about it
anymore
but the the question of whether it was
uh you know illegal or even unethical
I'm still open to your debate on that
because I don't think it was crazy that
we did gain research uh
gain function research do you how many
think you how many think it was crazy to
do that
it turned out bad
but I'm guessing we're still doing it
somewhere
yeah I think it was a calculated risk
that we took and it didn't work out
all right
um see John Campbell on this
all right that's all for now YouTube I'm
gonna say bye see you in the morning
thanks for joining
