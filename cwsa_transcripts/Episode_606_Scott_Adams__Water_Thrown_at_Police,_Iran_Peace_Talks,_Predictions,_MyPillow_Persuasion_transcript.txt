hey where is everybody
come on in here it's time for coffee
with scott adams
and you know what you need yes you do
if you're here early you're probably
prepared
you are the ones who have systems
some of you are exercising more and more
of you actually i'm hearing from people
who are taking this system to art
whereas you pick a
favorite daily television or podcast
show such as this one and you make sure
you're exercising while you're listening
to it
and then you'll have a little payoff for
your exercise if you like your show
but i know what you want
i do you want the simultaneous sip and
it's coming
but first you need something
you need something you need a copper mug
or glass you need a steiner telus
attacker do you need a service of flask
a canteen possibly a
vessel of some other kind fill it with
your favorite
liquid i like coffee and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure of this
simultaneous sip here it comes
oh gets better every time
so boris johnson looks like he's set to
be the next
prime minister true story
about a month ago a wealthy investor
contacted me and said hey who do you
think is going to be the prime minister
i think he was going to bet so i'm not
entirely sure why i asked
and i said i don't know who's even
running i have no idea i'm not even
paying attention
and wealthy investors said i'll send you
three links
of the three top people look at them and
tell me which ones
are persuasive or not persuasive
so i looked at all three links two of
the candidates
i will uh summarize with the following
i don't even remember their names they
were so forgettable they were
non-persuasive but then i looked at
boris johnson's clip and i said oh well
he'll
obviously be the next prime minister
because he has
i'm not sure that he has trump-like
skills but at least he has a persuasion
game you could hear it
you could hear it in just a brief clip
it was just obvious
and so i said well i don't know anything
about politics in great britain but
looks to me like boris johnson is going
to win that because he's the better
candidate and sure enough he won
you want to hear another prediction that
i got right
i'll bet you didn't get this one right
so this is an actual
bet i placed on predicted
so many months ago i made a bet
that president trump would meet kim
jong-un
again in 2019 and he did
now one of the reasons that that was a a
high payoff bet
you know the odds were deeply against it
is because it takes so many months to
plan
such a thing that you'd see it coming
from
long way off and i said to myself
you know what you know what i think
they're going to have that meeting
anyway now i didn't see it the way it
was
it unfolded but i did imagine that they
would not need as much preparation as
everybody imagined
and i did imagine they wouldn't
necessarily have to have an agenda
so i won that bet i also have bets out
that there will be a female
candidate for the democrats and as
separate about doubt that that candidate
will be
camel harris and those bets are both i
think they're at about
double uh the value of when i first
placed them
many months ago so we're seeing a lot of
news about
trump's deportations i guess ice is
uh starting the process of rounding up
people who have been court ordered to
leave
mostly but that's the way it's usually
reported
they say it's mostly people who have
committed some additional crimes
beyond immigration while they're here
and the court has ordered them to leave
and i think to myself mostly
what do you mean mostly what what's the
other category
have you have you seen any reporting for
what the other categories are
i i certainly understand if somebody's
committed some
serious crime while they were already
here illegally
i could see how the court would order
them to go home and i could see how we'd
want to
ship criminals home instead of instead
of
incarcerating them here at our expense
but what's the other category does
anybody know
has it ever been reported what is one
other reason
that they're being deported and
apparently it's not just because we're
in the country illegally because that
would be
millions of people not just the ones
targeted so why don't we know that
and we're hearing wildly strange
reporting about what's only a few people
have even been deported out of thousands
what what's going on there seems to be a
complete
news failure on this am i am i right
oh somebody's saying it's people who
lost asylum claims
in court wouldn't that be a lot of
people
all right we'll have to find out more
about that but anyway the
it seems to me that the reporting has
been
very insufficient here's my favorite
story of the day
trump has decided to come out and
explicitly call the squad
a racist that's right trump
is just calling them racist whenever he
can
now you say to yourself if you're a
democrat
hahaha that can't possibly work
because as we know he's the true racist
look at all our many weak pieces of
infra
weak pieces of evidence that
collectively and individually don't mean
anything
but if we put them all together we
convince ourselves that they do mean
something
how about that huh we don't have that
going the other way
but president trump has decided that
they've said enough things
that are sort of in that gray area that
that's good enough how much do i love
this
a lot it's probably the best thing he
could do i don't know what are all the
bad things he could do
but the best thing he could do is to
explicitly and directly and continuously
call them
racists here's why that works
number one they're racists
that's why it works if they were not
racist
it wouldn't work
now keep in mind that the uh that the
standard is sort of higher for the left
people on the right are racist just for
existing i mean according to the left
you simply have to exist and be
associated with anybody on the right
and they say this explicitly by the way
if you're a supporter of the president
or even if you haven't condemned him
for whatever is on their laundry list
today
that you are a racist just for sort of
waking up in the morning and existing
and liking the president who's in office
so that's a low standard but on the left
they've got to actually do some stuff
they've got to do some racist stuff in
order to be called racists
but they have so
and i would argue that even if you argue
that's not what they're doing you can't
argue
that they don't frame things in racial
terms
and the president consistently frames
things
in country terms which other people say
hey you framed this in country terms our
country versus the other countries
but what you really mean in your secret
thoughts is you mean you don't like
brown people
now at some point that just becomes so
ridiculous
given that the president's job is to
take care of this country
above other countries if you can't do
your
job of taking care of this country above
other countries without being called a
racist what can you do
i mean what's left yeah somebody's in
the comments
somebody's saying that apparently
there's a story that ivanka
got a an all-white dog for
one of the kids and people are saying
it's racist because it's a white dog
when you start seeing racism everywhere
except on your own team things have just
gone to the ridiculous level
now as you know um i had encouraged
uh a a poll
i wanted i want or actually a what do
you call it
a uh online petition to demand
that the trump administration release
children from those obama cages
how many people were willing to sign a
petition
to release children from obama cages
well turns out not many
not that many at all as soon as you as
soon as you call them obama cages
nobody's
nobody's in favor of releasing people
and i thought to myself
well if it's just the name of the cage
maybe we do not have an actual rational
problem here
and by the way i am in favor of
getting kids out of cages i don't know
how to do it in a way that also
preserves borders and
gets us everything we want and keeps the
kids safe from being trafficked
i don't know how to do that i have no
idea how to do that
nobody else does either apparently i
mean not in the short run in the long
run everybody thinks they know how to do
it
but yes i'm definitely in favor of
getting kids out of obamacages
however that happens um let's talk
about iran so i understand from the news
that one of the last loopholes that iran
has for at least for their oil industry
which is a big part of
their economy one of the last loopholes
they have for
distributing it is being closed
something about a
chinese tanker blah blah blah but
i suppose that's true suppose that
the last little bit of you know hope
their economy has is now being squashed
iran has a timing problem
they sort of need to do something sort
of pretty quickly
because the economy is in a
dire situation now when i
when i was talking about north korea
however many
months slash years ago i was saying
explicitly you know you could you really
can imagine president trump and kim
jong-un
meeting and having a laugh that's i
i could easily imagine it and then sure
enough that happened
but can you easily imagine the ayatollah
meeting with president trump in person
you cannot you actually can't imagine it
i somebody says yes but i actually can't
imagine it
because i don't imagine that the
ayatollah would put himself in a
position
where he would even be photographed with
someone who is so completely
opposite of everything he is
and especially if the subject or
at least the topic of which they came
together
would inevitably be trump getting more
of what he wants
and iran released the ayatollah getting
less
of what he wants so how in the world
could you ever
have any kind of an iranian deal if
trump
can never in a practical way
trump can't really beat the ayatollah
because
i'd love to say well the ayatollah might
get flexible
and maybe maybe he'll decide no
can't see it there's no world in which
the ayatollah and president trump
have a photo op and shake hands i just
don't see it
now the problem is that the odds of
having
peace if the two leaders can't even meet
and shake hands
is pretty low so how do you solve that
how do you solve the problem that the
one thing you need
is basically impossible
and i don't have the immediate answer to
that
but i would say that we do have a
creative president
and uh he is very this president is very
good
at seizing opportunities so there might
be something that happens
that's a bit of a i don't know
maybe it's uh an opportunity that arises
that that he jumps on um
now i guess the question would be is
there anybody who
is um subsidiary or
let's say somebody who works for the
aitolo that the ayatollah
would trust to go have the meeting with
the president
or anybody else and come back with a
deal and i think to myself
probably not because if you're not the
ayatollah
you probably are not authorized to give
up anything
and if you did maybe you get killed so
i don't know that there's a mechanism
for iran
to even have a conversation about this i
don't know that they have the type of
government
the type of personalities who can get
from a to b
and i wonder if it might be useful to
call that out
would it be useful to say that out loud
to say we don't know if iran has the
kind of government
that's capable of even having a
conversation
about peace think about that
you could challenge iran to simply
figure out
how they could develop a system for
peace
because if you make it peace yes or no
people are going to say well probably no
because we've never had it before so you
don't want to talk about
the goal piece yes or no or even
have a summit yes or no you don't want
to put this in yes or no because it's
not we're not there yet
we're at a system problem they have a
system
in which they don't have a mechanism
type even the conversation
they don't have a way to have a
conversation in which
at least with this president now i think
they did have a way to have a
conversation with the obama
administration
do it with lower level people obama is a
non-controversial kind of character
so they have to i think somehow we have
to get
past the fact that their system and our
system
can't have a conversation so i'd love to
see that solved
all right um
have you are you seen the videos very
disturbing videos
of police officers who are making a stop
in harlem i believe
and the locals are taking buckets of
water and
throwing them on the police and the
police are not responding
literally they're surrounded by
mostly young men who are taking buckets
of water
and dumping them on top of the police
heads while the police are just trying
to do their arrest
and walking away and stuff and you're
watching the police are not responding
they're actually being assaulted and
they're just walking away
they're assaulted i mean if somebody
throws a bucket at your head as they did
plastic bucket but still somebody threw
a bucket at their heads
if somebody pours water over you
repeatedly in a public place you are
assaulted that's a crime
and the police walked away
now i assume that's because the police
have very strict rules about
engagement and there must have been
something that happened recently maybe
it's de blasio's
um administration that told them to walk
away
or they get fired but
i got to tell you that what i watched
if they had opened fire if they had just
pulled pulled the handgun and started
blasting away
at the people with the buckets of water
i don't know maybe that would be illegal
because it would be too much force
being used for you know the situation
but i don't i wouldn't feel bad about it
and it
would have nothing to do with the
individual cop and the individual person
who would
individually be um
ended it wouldn't be about the
individuals
it would be about the system
you can't really have a uh you can't
really have a good
uh system if
if people can just abuse the police and
they can't do their job
so for the benefit of the system i would
have been okay if a few people
um got some tough justice that day
just saying um
i promised you a while ago that if i had
a slow news day i would give you some of
the
persuasion techniques used in the famous
my pillow commercials have you all seen
the my pillow commercials
mostly on fox news channel most of you
have
and i'm just going to run through some
of the technique so you can see
that the best persuaders the best sales
people use
similar techniques um so one of the
things that
mike lindell does he's the
founder of the my pillow is he does
pacing
now pacing is when you're matching your
audience
in some way you could breathe the way
they breathe
talk the way they talk agree with them
on a topic
that sort of thing so you're matching
them in some important way
that's an important part of persuasion
because if you match them
and they feel matched you can later lead
them
and they will go with you because
they'll say oh you're just like me i'll
go with you a little bit see where you
go
so you see that uh mike lindell
starts talking about um how you uh
he there's a part of his commercial work
says you know why they're called down
pillows
you put your head on it and it goes down
and he says it in a really interesting
way you put your head on it
and it goes down now the first thing you
need to know
is that because it's a pun a play on
words of the word down
because down is you know feathers of a
goose which are in the pillows
the traditional pillows he's he's paced
you
because you've all had the experience of
you put your head on the pillow
and it goes down and you wish it had
been more firm which is the type of
pillow he sells
which by the way are good pillows i i
bought a few of them and i was quite
happy with them they're
a good product so you have to have a
good product or nothing
nothing else matters um
so the when he talks to you about
putting your head on the pillow and your
pillow goes down
he is putting you in the movie he's
taking you out of your seat and putting
you into the imaginary scene
where you can imagine the feel the
the touch the experience every day of
putting your head on the pillow
and it goes down that
is amazing pacing he's
he's he's got into your world he said
something that you've
all that you've all experienced
and you know you've experienced it and
he's put it in a word picture
so you've got a movie in your head
that's like oh yeah here's my head and
it's the pillow and it goes down
and because it's a play on words it's a
little stickier that's also
technique when uh when oj's
lawyer said if the glove does not fit
you must acquit
that is technique because it rhymed is
stuck in your head and
and took on more importance than it
really needed to
now while he is giving you the
giving you the pacing so you're
imagining putting your head on the
pillow he's also showing it to you
so it's visual he's he's squeezing it
he's got some
models there who we first lay on the
pillow
and he's showing you visually so it's
very very visual
now of course it's a tv commercial so
they're all going to be visual
so that part tv commercials never get
wrong
that's the most basic thing but a lot of
people in their normal persuasion
may not know to be visual commercials
always get that right tv commercials
always get that right and he gets that
right as well
another thing he does is in order to
sell
you must first sell yourself so you have
to sell who you
are before somebody will consider your
your product
he does that really well because he has
this likable big personality
and when you see him you say to yourself
hey he's the most
ordinary guy he's just like me
he doesn't try too hard to look like
he's a rich guy he's not wearing a
he's not wearing a tuxedo he's not
standing in front of his mansion i
assume he's got a nice house
he's not doing anything that takes him
out of that mold of being exactly like
you
so uh somebody says he wears a cross
necklace
if he does that's a that's a pretty
strong
message because he runs on fox news and
that's probably a perfect place
for that sort of thing now the other
things he does is he makes it
clear to you that a lot of people are
buying this product so you get the
the sense that you're part of something
larger you know everybody's doing it and
you're
influenced by peer pressure oh
everybody's buying these pillows they
must be good pillows a lot of people are
buying them
and of course he does lots of statistics
of this or that or you
sleep better or whatever so those those
are the uh main techniques he makes you
like him personally
he paces you to be just like you he he
brings you into the picture so he
he uh activates more than just your
hearing
he makes you imagine how it feels what
it looks like
so he's bringing in all of your your
senses
and then if i recall he's probably got
something toward the end where he talks
about price
where it sounds like it's a deal now one
of the things that he
can't do it's not as easy to do because
the nature of what he's selling
he can't use the the shortage uh
technique
where he's so he can't really say act
now or will run out of pillows now if
that were something he could say
he'd probably throw that in there but
obviously he's not going to run out of
pillows they have
factories to make as many pillows as you
want so he can't use that one but i'm
sure he would
if he did so those are the main main
techniques um
and
kind of quiet today yeah
yeah any jokes with the people
oh yeah he when he talks about his uh
what is it is sheets
that are made of giza cotton and he
tells you that they can only be
uh the the is it the cotton that can
comes out of one place on earth there's
only one place you can get it in giza
and you say to yourself whoa there's
only one place this comes from
that must be pretty good now what's
missing
is any sense sense that he has compared
giza
to all of the other places that you can
get
you can get your materials but i suppose
giza's got good stuff and it does make
you seem special
and so that that part's good too good
persuasion
all right um
we'd better start getting some real news
because this summer is starting to get
mighty mighty quiet
um yeah if somebody would would invent
a solution to snoring the world would be
a lot better
uh somebody says they're about to
propose do you have any advice on being
persuasive
yes so here's some persuasion advice
for someone who's about to propose
number one never propose unless you
already know the answer to the question
now i suppose you can roll the dice and
take your chances
but personally you know it's 2019.
don't propose if you don't know the
answer to the question
um so that's my advice on that did you
see that prageru
did a video tutorial in which they
debunked the
the charlottesville fine people hoax so
prageru got in on that so we have yet
another
another source that we can link to when
people
think that that's true that hoax
all right um yes wear nice shoes
that's always good does anybody else
have any other
questions i'll look at your comments
it's
it's another strange strange day
because there just isn't anything going
on which i suppose is really good
oh area 51. so
uh so i understand that started as some
kind of a prank
to storm area 51 and now it's becoming
an actual
event
so i don't have much to say about that
except that i think people are just
having fun with it and
they can certainly have fun with it
um
oh can you talk about seinfeld legend
larry charles
yeah i should ask larry to come on so
you
probably saw the news that larry charles
um who is famous for being one of the
original
seinfeld writers he is also famous for
being the director of borat
he is also less famous for being my
co-executive
producer during the gilbert animated tv
show
many years ago so i know him from
working with him extensively on the tv
show
and i was uh alarmed to see that
he had made some kind of quote and maybe
it's out of context so i'm not going to
make any assumptions about what he meant
or if he was kidding or anything else
but he made some kind of a comment about
democrats need to arm themselves because
there might be some kind of a real
civil war coming now
don't you think i have to talk to him
about that
so i'll ask him if he wants to uh to
come on
um in fact i was uh i met with larry
um in the past year because he was
working on a special which is now
on netflix
dangerous comedy i believe it's called
and
i was interviewed for that i think i i
don't think my interview made it
i think i ended up on the cutting room
floor i'm not sure yet
but uh so i was meeting with him
recently
and i have to tell you in person
in person he's one of the smartest
people uh and funniest people you'll
ever meet
and i love him a lot uh and so
i think if you i think if i talk to him
in person about his
recent comments there's probably more to
the story than the way it's
being presented so maybe i'll do that
um i'm considering adding an interview
feature to what i'm doing that would be
separate from this
in addition by the way um
netflix is officially demonetizing
about eighty percent of my potential
monetization
now i say 80 because what they do is
they somewhat routinely and
automatically demonetize all of my
content
at first and then there's a process by
which you can ask for a human review
upon human review almost every one of
them
is then approved but it takes
you more than a day to get it approved
and by then eighty percent of my traffic
has already happened
because i have content that people watch
the same day
it doesn't have as much meaning because
it's tied to the headlines if you wait
to the next day
uh oh i'm sorry i said netflix i meant
um
youtube so forget everything i just said
about
netflix except when i was talking about
larry charles
um youtube
youtube is the one who's demonetizing me
sorry
um and
but here's the thing apparently they're
also demonetizing david pakman the same
way
he'd be associated with the left so
whatever it is
has something to do with political
content and i guess they just
don't want it i don't know or maybe it
is that david pakman's
not the kind of political content they
want even on the left
i don't know i have no idea why he's
being demonetized because
i'm pretty sure his content does not
warrant it
as nor does mine
so i don't know i can't say that youtube
is targeting me for talking about trump
but i'm definitely being targeted for
political conversation
um somebody's asking about
uh kathy zhu miss
michigan you know that how you feel
about the
miss michigan story i guess she was uh
dethroned for things she said
on social media she claims those things
were not that
controversial other people claim that
they actually are pretty bad
um you can make your own judgment i
don't really have an opinion about that
story
i saw some of the tweets and i would say
yeah
i could see how you'd say that you would
think that would be pretty bad
so that's your personal judgment i would
say
yeah personally i'm hard to offend
so i wouldn't say that any of it was
offensive to me
but it also wasn't targeting me so i
imagine if she had targeted me i'd feel
a little different
differently all right um
yes for my interview series i would use
a different technology
than periscope because periscope doesn't
have a
an easy split screen um
way you can do it but i'd probably just
use a different technology probably
zoom and do it offline and then and then
publish it
uh what's my prediction for 2024. i
don't don't have a 2024 prediction
um you might see mark cuban
getting interested
that would be that would make it a fun
race
but there are a lot of people waiting in
the wings
uh let's see can i be interviewed
probably not
who do you think will win the next
democrat debate
one of the women so one of the women
will be
uh a winner it'd either be warren or
kamala or both
uh these slaughter indexes is over 100
so the the odds of trump winning
reelection
are pretty much locked down i would say
at this point
um michelle obama no
there's zero chance that michelle obama
will run for office
zero chance forget about it
um nikki haley has so far
not impressed she seems to disappear at
least during the
debate she sort of disappeared i just
don't think there's enough
i don't know maybe media support for her
or whatever it takes
i don't think buddha judge has
true national appeal he might get
attention but he's not going to be the
nominee
it's really down to warren and harris in
my opinion
um what has happened to beto
you know the best theory i heard on beto
is that the whole reason that he got a
lot of attention
was you know partly some people liked
his look so he had
you know charismatic vibe about him but
the best
theory i heard is that the real reason
that beto was popular
is just that he was running against ted
cruz
originally and people wanted to get cruz
out of office if they were
anti-republican and so he got a lot of
money and support
that maybe he wouldn't have normally
uh gotten except that he was running
against cruz
so as soon as you take cruz away and
he's just thrown in the mix with other
democrats and he's running against
democrats
well he doesn't look interesting anymore
because of the contrast
all right um
yeah some say he looked like a kennedy i
don't know
i i just don't think beto had anything
now remember i i was never predicting
better would
go far so i think i'm on point on that
prediction um
so someone in the comments is saying a
woman president would be disastrous
how would that be disastrous on what
basis
would a woman president be a disaster
unless you're just saying it's because
they're democrats or something but i
don't i don't think there's any basis
for that kind of a statement
all right i'm just oh mueller's coming
you know the mueller's
the mueller thing is just summer reruns
we couldn't come at a better time
i think everybody's sort of on board
with the idea that the mueller thing
isn't going to produce anything useful
now i appreciate the democrats play here
because the play is just to get people
to talk about it more
maybe to understand some details in the
report and
and maybe that's all but there is some
some suggestion there is some suggestion
that it's going to be good for
republicans because of the types of
questions they're going to ask
about how the thing the whole thing got
started and
and why it didn't get wrapped up sooner
and stuff like that
so it could be just terrible for
democrats
but they'll get their they'll get that
story back on the
headlines and maybe that part is good
all right what time is the mueller thing
tomorrow
i haven't decided if i'm gonna watch the
whole thing or just
pop in and out but my assumption is that
mueller is going to be
so boring that it will be unwatchable
and he might want to keep it that way
because i i
think he just wants to say blah blah
blah until he goes home
all right um
did you talk about boris yes i did
oh so there was some story about trump
offering to uh broker
a peace talk between india and pakistan
over a cashmere
and then there's other reporting that
says that conversation never happened
you know that that's not on the table um
i just love the fact
that that's even out there you know even
if it's fake news
uh you know even if it's just totally
untrue i love the fact
that it's just sitting out there that
trump has offered
even if it's not true i just love the
fact that it's out there that he's
offered
to mediate that could he do that
maybe so maybe so you know
as sure as i was that
trump would be the wrong you know the
right person to talk to kim jong-un and
as sure as i am
that i don't think he's going to shake
hands with the ayatollah i just don't
see him standing physically together
i could totally see trump working
something out over cashmere
i can see that that's that is totally
within the realm
in fact if i had put odds on it success
probably 60 percent you know if he
actually got involved
you know the odds of him actually
getting involved are probably low
but if he got involved and if india and
pakistan said you know
nothing else has worked let's try that
you know let's let's you know give it
let's take a run at it nothing else is
working so
mr president why why don't you see what
you can do
i think he'd have something like a 60
chance
of making some progress there just
because the the nature of who he is and
etc now by the way there's another thing
that may happen soon
it hasn't happened but could happen if
the president gets a number of
negotiating wins under his belt
it doesn't matter which ones they are
let's say you know
let's say something good gets negotiated
with north korea
let's say he gets a chinese trade deal
those are just two examples let's say he
gets both of those done
and let's say the new mexico
canada trade deal also gets signed let's
say all three of those things get
signed what are people going to say
about the president's negotiating
abilities
it's going to start to look like he can
negotiate things that other people can't
negotiate
it's going to look like that and then
suddenly
people who imagined that no solution was
possible
will start to imagine that things are
possible because they're going to say
well
nobody before could figure out how to
solve
cashmere but also nobody before
could figure out how to do a trade deal
with china nobody before can figure out
how to do a deal with north korea if
those things get done
right i'm not saying that you know we're
close to those but
if they got done he would have a track
record
that would become a power in itself
so the world is sort of lining up these
dominoes
in which the president has once again
found
found the way to be the center of
history the dominoes are lining up that
if the first three
fall and it doesn't matter what those
three are if they're all in the category
of things that the president has
negotiated
that other people thought couldn't be
negotiated
if if he can do that three times in a
row people are gonna say
even his critics are gonna say you know
three in a row that's not a coincidence
one in a row people can say he got lucky
two in a row they could say well
anything can happen three in a row
even the critics are going to say okay
it looks like he can do things other
people can't do
he's got a negotiating ability there
so think about how close we are because
he's got a number of things that are
sort of in progress that certainly could
be negotiated successfully
i i do predict something good with north
korea
i do predict something good eventually
with china although if they don't cut
down if they don't clamp down on their
fentanyl
exports i don't want any kind of
agreement which i know on anything
so we're very close to major
progress in the world somebody had
uh yeah and
my understanding is that did i get this
story right
that uh pharmaceutical costs dropped for
the first time
and that president trump's policies
are getting credit for that is that true
can somebody fact check me on that
i'm seeing some yeses here what are the
odds
that trump could get pharmaceutical
costs
to drop i mean think about that would
you have predicted that
would you have predicted that they could
do anything to make pharmaceutical costs
go down
i i'm not even sure i would have
predicted that one
that looks pretty unlikely now i don't
know exactly what it was
and maybe we'll be surprised you know
anything could happen next year
but i think part of it was that the
administration sped up the approval of
generics
my understanding is that when the third
generic hits the market
if that's the way it works when the
third
option hits the market that the price
for
price goes down and that
simply by speeding up the time it takes
to get to that third option
of generic that's enough
apparently that makes a big difference
all right oh and then price transparency
we're not there yet are we
but we're getting there so that should
make a big difference too
um
can you talk about the evil medication
ads on tv
and are they using hypnosis well as i've
often said
when any kind of pharmaceutical or
health care ad comes on tv
i turn it off immediately i run i run to
my device to my remote control i grab my
phone
and i don't want to hear a word of it
because if you don't have those
health problems listening to them isn't
good for you
every time you hear bad news that's
unnecessary
and listening to other people's health
care problems
is pretty optional you don't have to
hear about the horrible
healthcare or health experiences that
other people are having
and so i turn it off as quickly as
possible
i would think that over time the
our news sources would put themselves
out of business
honestly when i watch fox news i don't
know how they stay in business
and even though their product is
excellent i've said this a lot
fox news is really well produced well
staffed
talent is amazing but i don't know how
they stay in business
because they're it looks like their
primary income is pharmaceutical ads
and they're so obnoxious i don't know
how anybody can
handle it in the long run because it's
like it's like somebody says hey do you
like ice cream yeah i do
i love ice cream here's some ice cream
it's free
and you're like whoa free ice cream i
like this i'm eating it
and then and then they punch you in the
head and you go whoa what the heck
what's that why are you punching me in
the head and you say well it's free ice
cream
and you say but i didn't sign up for a
punch in the head
now you might say i like ice cream so
much and it was just one punch in the
head i'll keep eating my ice cream
and then you get punched in the head
again if you get punched in the head
enough
you're not going to take the ice cream
anymore and watching the news
doesn't matter which network i'm talking
about all the networks are the same
it feels like being punished like
actually being punished
for watching content because the
advertisements are actual i find them
actually painful
and i mean that like actually i have
extreme discomfort
listening to all these horrible things
that are in these commercials
somebody asked me something in the
comments that i really wanted to talk
about
i was trying to talk while remembering
what i was going to talk about and it
didn't work out at all
bitcoin controversy i don't know what
that controversy is
i don't know what you're talking about
um
i mean there are lots of bitcoin
controversies i don't know which one
you're talking about
um loser think will be out in november
will be a giant bestseller
much guarantee it
somebody says the trivago ads make me
nauseous
i turned off the tr the trivago ads
every time
there's some ads that i'll let run in
the background because it's not worth
turning them off
but the oh i know what i was going to
say um
if you didn't see this you should see
the
the video replay it must be somewhere
but uh on fox news shepard smith
interviewed the governor of puerto rico
if you don't know there's i don't know a
million people in puerto rico
marching in the streets for days and
days demanding his ouster
because some emails that the governor
wrote were discovered
i don't know hackers got him or whatever
and they just had horrible things in
them
terrible jokes about dead people and
lgbtq
negative things etc it was just the
worst things
on top of that there are allegations of
tremendous corruption in the government
which is probably a little
more noticeable now because they had all
this aid
after the hurricane and people are
saying hey where's where's the aid going
so those are you know it's probably
accentuated now
but if you did not watch shepherd smith
rip that guy apart on on national tv
you really have to see it now typically
i like my news to just be news
and my you know opinion could be
whatever whatever
because it's opinion but i like the news
to just be sticking to the news and
that's one of the things i like about
fox news is they're
they're better than other networks at
labeling what's news and what's opinion
now shepard smith is the news part
and i like it when he sticks to news
but now and then there's a situation
which is so egregious that you don't
even hold your news people to that
standard anymore
and when you watch shepherd smith talk
to this governor
who clearly was a a tumor
on puerto rico i mean he's bad
bad for business he's bad for the people
he's just
bad it was impossible to imagine
that you could have a conversation with
him and remain
just objective and so i would say that
shepard smith
did not remain objective but he also
remained
completely professional and what i was
going to point out about it is if there
are
um i don't know how this works in the
news business if they're emmys or
whatever and this is the second time
i've said this about shepherd smith when
he did the helicopter
crash in new york it was one of the best
pieces of live tv you'll ever see
see in the news context he is so good
but watching him um sort of go
toe-to-toe with this governor who was
being a little weasely
was riveting television and
they just stopped running commercials
for a while because it was so good i
i assumed that they thought the
interview would be
short you know like most tv interviews a
few minutes
but it was immediately obvious from the
first couple of minutes
that this was going to be special and it
was
and you watch this thing and just you
know i know some of you
have your bad feelings about shepherd
smith because he's not as pro-trump as
you want him to be etc
but if you just talk about talent
it was outstanding just the amount of
talent that shepherd smith brought to
that interview
the the way he couched it the way they
put the kept the pressure on the way he
asked the questions
it was really just stunning stunning
talent so a plus to the producers
who never get credit but they obviously
put in put on an amazing show
but a triple plus to shepherd smith
who if you don't get an award for that
like somebody needs to nominate that
that segment because that was
news wise that was the best piece of
news
and just just pure skill wise that was
the best piece of news i've seen in
years it was amazing all right
um i don't have much else to say so if
you don't have questions and i don't see
any
i'm going to go do something else and
somebody says eric fitment is briefing
congress on bitcoin tomorrow morning is
that true
i don't know about that i'll find out
about that if that's true
i'm definitely gonna see if i can watch
that
all right enough for now i'll talk to
you later bye
