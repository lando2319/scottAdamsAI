hello
everybody we got a show coming up for
you oh my goodness my
goodness I'm just going to look at the
comments from the locals people because
they're
special the special locals
people all right looking good
everything's working today
[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and if
you're here for that enjoyment well let
me tell you sometimes humans with their
tiny shiny human brains cannot
understand how much of a pleasure this
is but if you'd like to find out all you
need is a cuper mug or a glass of tanker
chel or a Canen jug a flask a vessel of
any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee and join me now for
the unparallel pleasure the dopamine of
the day thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous Sip
and it happens now
go oh that was divine so
good I hope it was good for
you well I found out that uh some of the
News hosts on ABC News might be looking
at a a cut and pay so they're saying
that maybe George Stephanopoulos and
Robin Roberts and Michael
stran uh who each have deals valued at
$25 million
annually oops we've got a problem with
locals locals is not
[Music]
working why would locals not be
working well locals is
[Music]
streaming let's do
this let's do this I'm going to try
something which I've never tried
before let's see if I can stream on two
devices all right hold on got to fix
this let's see if this is fixable
start
stream huh apparently
not that just
disappeared one more
try live stream is not
started
interesting uh
um let just say it won't
stream
try X or
rumble or
YouTube that's
awkward all right well so we're not
streaming perfectly on all the platforms
but three out of
four anyway uh turns out that the ABC
news people make $25 million a year
for doing a little less than I
do so I basically have the same job
except I work seven days a week and they
work five days a week and I'm thinking I
feel like I'm
underpaid $25 million a year they're
getting for just being on TV for an hour
wow anyway and more important news
according to the Daily Star uh
scientists are trying to resurrect giant
5 foot tall
beavers uh to bringing back to Britain
so apparently there used to be giant
beavers but now they're not giant
beavers but they said to themselves you
know what we really need giant
beavers so if you were thinking you know
life is pretty good I've got this one
problem just one thing I'd like to
fix the Beavers are not big enough we
need some giant beavers well science has
you covered there's a really good chance
that will be giant
beavers
um I think I might turn off the locals
comments because you're only complaining
about the locals not
working uh should I turn off the locals
comments yeah anyway there's there's no
video but apparently there might be some
sound or not I don't know
did you know that there was a movie
called Joker
2 I am so
interested oh my God all right I'm gonna
have to kill this
feed let's
see how do I get rid
of let's try
something all right I can't even make it
go away
huh all right well at least turn this
off that'll be easier so I have no idea
who's watching or if you can see it or
anything else but if you're on locals
you probably want to go to um rumble or
YouTube or X they're all working I think
all
right
um so there's a movie called The Joker
too it looks like it's going to be one
of the worst films of the year it lost
$70 million so far Rotten Tomato score
is not so
good and uh here's my
question who's going to watch a movie in
2024 what it just doesn't even make
sense anymore it doesn't make sense that
the industry even
exists to me I mean it's just a complete
I mean I have no idea all right here's
what I'm going to do I'm going to start
an entirely new
feed on
locals and see if a new one works it
might kick the old one off
um live stream
to trying
again we're at that weird point in
history where you never know what the
technology is going to do so I'm trying
to start a second
feed oh interesting
interestingly it looks like it
works interestingly all right so problem
solved the sound won't be as good on the
local feed but we've got uh we're up and
running I'm just using a second
device that's what phones are for anyway
uh and other news scientists have hacked
a bacteria so it can break down PL
plastic waste according to the bite so
wouldn't that be great to have a
bacteria that can eat up all the plastic
waste do you have any questions about
that so there's a bacteria that can sort
of eat
plastic so we won't have so much
plastic there's sort of a question about
that isn't
there do bacteria
poop what happens when they eat it don't
they just poop out a bunch of bacteria
poop
and wouldn't they be pooping roughly the
same amount as they ate so when you're
done your plastic would just turn into
bacteria poop right I mean I don't know
how they poop but I'm sure they
do so I'm not exactly sure what's going
on with the bacteria eating plastic but
I would ask some questions where are you
going to put what's left
over all right well apparently both
candidates Trump and Harris their plans
for their policy plans have been um
scored by
economists to figure out which one would
destroy the country faster uh Trump's
plan would destroy the country faster
through massive debt compared to Harris
who would also be racking up massive
additional debt so the current thinking
is that both of them have a plan for
destroying the country if not the world
and the next
story why why do we treat it that
way do you understand what's going on
with the national
debt that it's an unsolvable existential
problem that will kill us
all but I think maybe the problem is so
big we can't spend time talking about it
so we just have to pretend it's not real
is that what's going on or is it really
solvable and it'll be just you know one
more of a million things we thought were
going to kill us but in the end we
figured it
out I don't know why we're not talking
about this and only this because we
really only have one problem that's a
big one everything else is way way less
important I mean way less important
still important but way less you know
the war in Ukraine way less important
than the national debt
least way less important but all very
important you know individually very
very important but not even close not
even close to the risk with the national
debt but we just sort of act like well
it's just one more story moving on to
the next story about bacteria eating
plastic and I do the same thing like it
should be just to show about okay we're
all doomed anybody have an idea
no so I still do have hope that the uh
Adams law of slow-moving disasters will
kick
in and given that everybody knows it's a
problem then somehow we'll figure out
how to fix it but my bigger problem on
this is do you believe that economists
can look at the two plans and calculate
which ones will affect the uh economy
and how they'll affect the debt do you
think that's possible or did you just
critically or uncritically did you just
accept what the news told you the
economists can figure out which one
would be worse for the
debt they can't do that
people that's not a thing it if you're
asking are they accurate or
inaccurate it's it's not even the right
question that's not something anybody
can do nobody can figure out the
difference between their two economic
plans and what it will do to the debt
that is not a
thing we act like it is because because
most people don't understand what it
would take to do that calculation but
I've lived in that world here's what
they without even looking into it I'll
tell you what's wrong with it right so
I'm so confident that with not without
even looking at how they calculated I'll
tell you what's wrong they cannot
calculate
growth right so and I don't know if this
is the case but if all they did is look
at the direct the direct impact they
would say oh Trump wants to cut your
taxes more than Harris does so on day
one Trump will be running up more
deficit and then if you just multiply
day one times 10 years it's 10 times as
worse now I'm
oversimplifying but here's the part I
can guarantee you nobody knows what the
difference in growth would be between
the two
plans I think trumps would be higher
growth lower taxes higher growth usually
happens
but we don't know how much so to imagine
that you could calculate the difference
between who would add more to the debt
over 10 years it's not really a thing
it's not a thing you can calculate you
can look at whether somebody's doing
something dumb or not dumb and that's
about it so for example you can tell
directionally if lowering taxes would be
you know stimulative for business but
also bad in the short term for the
deficit but beyond that you can't really
look at 10 years down the road
especially when we're introducing Ai and
robots do you think anybody can make a
10-year
forecast just think about that think
about Ai and robots both going to come
online auto auto robots and uh taxis and
stuff do you know how gigantic that is
potentially do you think that the people
who calculated a 10year economic
forecast 10 years in this
environment that's nonsense it's
complete nonsense we have no idea what's
going to happen in 10 years under any
plan we have no idea so I will agree
with the analysts who say it looks like
the deficit will go up in the short
run and that neither of them have a plan
to really get rid of it but I'm not so
sure they can tell which one's better
than the other that's probably too fine
a level for them to actually put on
it uh there's also a calculation that
says 45% of Americans will run out of
money in retirement according to Yahoo
finance do you believe they can
calculate that do you think anybody can
calculate who's going to run out of
money in
retirement now keep in mind that a
retirement calculation is going to be a
you know a multi-year period so it's not
like one year from now no it's like what
will happen over the next 20 years do
you think the economist can calculate
what will happen over 20 years no no
nobody's ever been able to do that
that's not even close to something
people can do so is this a number that
you should trust that 45% will run out
of money and retirement no no you should
not trust that number but is it Direct
directionally useful I won't even say
accurate is it directionally useful
probably because it does it does raise a
little flag that says I'm not so sure
this whole retirement thing is well
constructed now that part's
true um I think the 45% could easily be
80 I think 80% of the people could run
out of money in retirement under the
current circumstance sense because
inflation is out of control well you
could argue if it's out of control but
it's it's high
enough that it's hard to imagine 80% of
the world having enough money for
retirement so what do you do well I
would suggest that Trump's new
cities might be part of the solution if
you tried to build a place that was from
the from the ground up was going to be
both a great place to live but Al crazy
inexpensive you could do it you can do
it so imagine federal land okay your
land is free now imagine the cheapest
building materials and some robots doing
the building labor is cheap there's a
robot involved but the labor is cheap
the materials are cheap slap it together
now imagine standardizing all the
construction so that there's no there's
no uh figuring out how to do anything
everything's the same Bo up
but maybe you put a little Variety in
the I don't know just the front windows
or something so it's a little bit
something
different you could easily imagine
bringing the cost of uh your phone
service way down your insurance way down
imagine what insurance would be if you
got rid of all the risks you build it
where there's no hurricanes you build it
where there's no
floods right so you just get rid of
those risks those are Insurance costs
and then you build it where in a way
that there's almost no crime because if
you took it away from all the populated
places and built it so there's lots of
you know cameras on the streets and
stuff like that you could almost do away
with
crime and what about food if you grew
your food locally made sure there were
indoor farms and stuff you get rid of
the transportation costs get rid of a
lot of the middleman costs depending on
how you do it so it seems to me you
could lowerer people's cost of living by
80% while improving the quality of life
because the worst situation is if you
have money and you retire and you're all
alone in a big
house that's not really much of a
life so I I think we're going to have to
radically change how people live which
will be very stimulating because it'll
be you'll have to build the new places
that are easier to live in so I've got a
feeling this is all solvable but not if
we just want to live exactly the way we
want to live that's not solvable the the
math can't work we we cannot just do
what we're doing and keep doing it
there's no way that can work not even
not even the slightest possibility that
we'll just kind of go on things will be
the same no nothing like that it's going
to have to radically change but the
radical change could be a big
Improvement some everybody
likes well let's talk about the abortion
hoaxes so Tim wals even after even after
being fact jacked uh on Fox
News I'm sorry Tim WS yeah so Tim WS
goes on Fox News Shannon Breen uh fact
checks him on the thing that they say
Trump wants to have a National Abortion
ban not only does Trump not want to have
a National Abortion ban but he's
pro-abortion right am I
wrong he he's in favor of abortion my
understanding is in Florida he thought
the six weeks was a little too short
which suggests that there's some number
below which he would say abortion is
okay that would be in favor of abortion
now not in favor of 9 months abortion
which is my next topic but to go from
somebody who has all his life been
essentially pro-abortion as long as it's
within the first X number of weeks uh to
say that he would be for a national ban
that is so obviously not true it's just
like super obviously not true and he
says it's not true it's not true with
it's not compatible with anything he
said in the past you know basically he's
been completely consistent all his life
on on abortion as far as I know so has
something different let me know so
that's a that's a clear hoax now how
does a national candidate get away with
saying something on the most important
topic to voters you know at least on the
left it's the most important topic
abortion that's completely 100% a
lie well Trump has his own version Trump
has the 9month abortion lie which then
the Democrats have a lie to respond to
the LIE
so the entire abortion conversation is
just people lying that's all it is so
here's what I here's my take on the 9
month
thing so you you'll see Shannon bream or
other people asking somebody is it true
that it would be legal in your state to
abort at 9
months what is the answer usually the
answer I think KL Harris did this on the
podcast recently the answer is Nobody
Does that that doesn't happen but was
that the question no now the question is
does the law allow you to do it if you
did it would it be
legal and the answer will be nobody's
doing that okay again that was not the
question the question is does the
current law say that you could abort at
9
months nobody's doing that again can you
answer the question so I think what you
see is that everybody just answers a
different question
so but so there's a what really happens
and then there's what's legal According
to some laws would it be legal for a
doctor and a woman to decide to have an
abortion at 9
months I think it
is but that the situation where that
happens would be an extreme situation
where the mother's life is in danger and
the the child isn't viable in the first
place in other words everybody knows
that once delivered or aborted whatever
they do with it um it's not going to
make
it now I'm not giving you my opinion on
what they should do in those situations
because I leave that to women I think
women should be the primary deciders on
all of it but when we're discussing it
just understand that people are trying
to conflate two different questions one
is it
legal and the answer is yes as far as I
could tell is legal in some states at 9
months has there ever been even one
example where somebody had a healthy mom
and a healthy 9-month baby inside them
and then aborted it for let's say just
didn't want it and then the doctor said
you know all right you really don't want
this baby
is perfectly healthy at 9 months and
you're perfectly healthy and there's no
no reason you can't deliver it yeah
let's uh let's just abort this
thing has that ever happened even
once I don't know the answer to my own
question but my belief is it hasn't in
the whole country ever recently recently
now some of you are going to say yes it
has but be careful you might be looking
at some cases that everybody would
assume was were illegal right it seems
to me that if even though the law allows
you to do it that if the doctor and the
mother decided to do it at nine
months and there was no medical
necessity or even medical argument even
not even necessity just an argument
there's just no medical argument do you
think that would be legal think that
doctor would stay in a jail and retain
his doctor license I I don't think
so I don't think so to me that would be
murder but I ask you this
question regardless of whether that law
existed or did not
exist couldn't a mother and a doctor and
whatever willing nurses around can't
they murder babies now no matter what
the law
says as long as nobody knows right as if
the only people know about it are the
doctor who's willing to say was a
medical necessity even if it wasn't so
the problem is if people are willing to
do the worst thing that humans could
do the current law or any other law
isn't going to stop them because if
nobody's watching well if people want to
do it they're going to do it so I don't
think that that uh the risk of having a
baby in N9 months that's maybe the
abortion didn't work and the baby was
born alive I don't think these are baby
that are going to
survive now again I'm not telling you my
opinion in what it should be done I'm
just clarifying the issue that if you
think there's a whole bunch of healthy
babies being born and then killed after
they're born I think that's probably
zero and if it has happened once that
would just be a murderer there are
murderers murderers exist so I'm not I'm
not discounting the fact that there
might be murder but it's got to be so
trivial that it shouldn't be part of the
discussion really really in my opinion
it is not worthy of being in the
discussion but here's the thing if
you're in a presidential race and it's
basically a liar's race and your
opponent says you're in favor of a
National Abortion ban and you're not I
don't have any problem whatsoever with
Trump completely lying that they're
going to allow healthy babies born in
nine months and then murder them it's
not close to true but neither is the
National Abortion ban so if they can
both just tell outrageous lies about
what the other
believes if they're both going to do it
that's fine I think I would have more
more trouble with it if one was doing it
and the other wasn't that would feel
like okay what's wrong with this but if
they're both telling outrageous lies in
my opinion outrageous lies about what
the other is planning to do or will do
or has done yeah it's just a liar's
competition I guess
anyway
um so but the important thing you should
know is uh KL Harris announced she's in
favor of mandatory burkas wow so
apparently uh uh in order to win the
Islamic vote in the United States K
Harris has come out in support of all
women having to wear mandatory you know
full body
covering I told you it's a Liars contest
if you can say anything about abortion
you can just make up any you want
right find people hoax drinking hoax
drinking drinking bleed ches but you
know once it's a liar's contest all all
the gloves are off there's nothing that
it's not in oh oh yeah she's in favor of
eating babies uh the the babies have to
be in burkas and then aborted let's just
make up any kind of as long as
we're just making stuff
up all right uh CBS News is warning that
uh there might be domestic violent
extremists around the election because
they would have election related
Grievances and let's see domestic
violent extremists do you think they're
talking about
antifa because they would be domestic
and
extreme no I think that they're trying
to uh set up the country so that if they
steal the election which I do believe
they plan to do the Democrats
uh that they can put you in jail if you
resist so they'll they'll be saying well
we told you the the domestic violent
extremists were coming to complain about
the election and here they are but of
course it's also signaling a strong
intention to rig the
election that's how I hear it so am I
right I don't know I don't know I can't
I mean I'm not magic I can't see the
future but the way I receive this is oh
my goodness the news organizations which
we all know are rigged um are trying to
get us used to the thought that if you
were doing anything protesting let's say
or getting a little too agitated about
the election results that you would be
called a domestic violent extremist and
this is just another way to say you're
going to end up in jail if you complain
about the election now is that literally
what they're doing and saying and why
they're doing it I don't know that's how
I receive it though
under the current
circumstance that's how I receive it I'm
sure you do
too well there's uh accusations that the
Democrat U funding entity called act to
Blue has been acting as a money
laundering organization and that it's
not small donations coming in from all
over the country but rather there might
be some rich sources that are uh
laundering things into smaller donation
and putting it through act blue so it
looks like it's all
appropriate um and there are some
attorney generals from several States
looking into it there is a strong
indications early on that there is
something there you know there's a lot
of smoke we don't know if there's fire
but where there's smoke there often is
now remember AC blue is not a government
it's a bunch of individuals in an
organization individuals are innocent
until proven guilty so although I say
there's a lot of smoke we cannot say
there's fire because it doesn't work
that way if it were the government I'd
say oh yeah there's so much indication
they're going to have to prove they're
innocent or I'll assume they're guilty
but these are individuals I'm going to
assume they're innocent unless somebody
has the goods which I haven't seen
yet all right um CNN and some of the uh
left leaning media
is trying to make a big deal about Elon
Musk supporting Trump and especially
going to the Trump rally Etc and uh
because he owns a big media platform and
he's a billionaire and he's putting
money into his preferences they're
saying that he's somehow distorting the
process but how do they ignore George
Soros uh the only thing that musk is
doing is trying to match the energy and
strategy of the other billionaires on
the other
side I don't see him as being the one
billionaire who got involved in
politics you know years ago somebody
explained to me the best way to
understand
politics is um like Game of Thrones
meaning it's a bunch of Kings these
would be the billionaires who are all
vying to be the the big king of it all
or at least to influence the things they
care about and that if you don't
understand it's just a billionaire
competition and the people running for
office are always you know usually
puppets or patrons of the billionaires
then you don't really understand the
country because it's mostly a
billionaire fight and the rest of us are
pretending that we know what's going on
but
don't the things we see are like a level
below that reality so we're just seeing
the weeds we're not seeing the sky the
sky is it's just a billionaires fighting
with each other trying to gain Authority
or resource or
whatever now Trump kind of broke that
because he came in as his own
billionaire and but he also has
billionaire donors right so he's he's
got a few billionaires on his side as
well um so there's yeah Peter teal for
example and um who's the Widow
of uh the Las Vegas cassino guy can't
remember anyway so he's got his own
billionaires but uh why they think that
musk is somehow special and he's more
special than Mark Cuban being on TV
every day or uh Reed Hoffman you know
being the biggest
funer um so why is he special what what
makes Elon Musk the one billionaire
who's not supposed to be uh actively
using his money and power and influence
to
influence uh the
election every everything he's doing
is completely legal and where it needs
to be it's
transparent is that a
problem no you know I I can put up a lot
with a lot when there's
transparency so this is why I don't
complain as much about um uh APAC the
Israel Lobby that some say is running
the United States policy at least on the
Middle East now I say yeah they're very
influential yes they absolutely you have
a lot of control over the government but
then I say it's all
transparent the reason that we believe
that APAC has a lot of control over our
government is that we can just look at
the data and we can look how much they
donated and then we can look at what
they vote for and then oh yeah it's
really obvious they have a lot of
influence but completely
legally completely transparent there's
nobody who's fool by it there there's no
trickery involved and these are our laws
and it's free speech so you can hate it
all you want but personally I just I'm
just uh prevented from full-throated you
know complaining about it because we
built this system it's our system we
built it if we want to change the system
and make it so that nobody can influence
with money we could do that but we don't
have a system that can change itself
that way because the people in it need
that money and they don't want it to go
away so anyway yeah billionaires in
politics I would say the only thing I'll
ask is for lots of transparency but
let's not be naive it's always going to
be billionaires fighting and you know
we'll we'll think it's something else
what would Lost In The
Weeds well do you remember that uh there
was this big uh prisoners swap where
Putin wanted Back The Merchant of Death
guy Victor bout so he was this big arms
dealer and uh we had
him and uh they had um who was it uh the
Griner the basketball player and we
traded the basketball player for the
Arms Dealer then the basketball player
went back to play basketball and the
Arms Dealer is arming the hoties
I'm not so sure that deal worked out
because the hoties are the ones who are
going to block up International Trade
which will cause your inflation to go up
which will make you not be able to
afford to be retired
so you know
um on one
hand I like the fact that the United
States will do whatever it needs to do
to get a citizen and a jail or at Le Le
still try pretty hard and this is
definitely trying hard because what they
gave up to get this one basketball
player was seriously
bad so I guess I have mixed feelings
about this I I I can't give you a
preference I'm glad we got back in
American but boy was that expensive I
mean I mean that could be a trillion
dollars but we got back one
American and that's not nothing you know
you I I do appreciate living in a
country where they're going to you know
burn down anything they need to to get
you freed from another
country now I'm oversimplifying because
it's always political on top of that
but this is disturbing no matter how you
look at it meanwhile keris was on 60
Minutes with her usual word salad um you
know
that just think about this every time
Harris does a public anything that's
unscripted the next day all the news
will be about how she didn't make any
sense and she was totally looked like an
idiot now I'm going to say she seems the
dumbest presidential candidate I've ever
seen how many of you would agree with
that is she the
dumbest presidential campaign you've
ever
seen we've seen some VPS that were not
exactly lighting up the uh the universe
but as a presidential candidate I I
think she comes off I mean I don't know
how she'd do it an IQ test but she comes
off as the dumbest one I've ever seen
here's an exact quote when asked about
uh uh the US's uh relationship with
Israel especially in the context of
what's happening over there now and
she's she was talking to somebody named
Bill and she said and I quote well
Bill the work that we have done has
resulted in a a number of movements in
that region by Israel that were very
much prompted by or result of many
things including our advocacy for what
needs to happen in the
region
what
what that doesn't even sound like you
did your homework for being the
president that that is so
embarrassing that is
pathetic if you want a word that will
cause young people to not vote for go
with
pathetic because they're thinking that
Trump is
dangerous do you think they're going to
vote for dangerous or
pathetic if you're young pathetic is
worse dangerous is well especially if
you're male did you say he's dangerous
what's his name again and he's dangerous
you say h i I'm kind of attracted to the
dangerous one but nobody nobody male or
female old or young is attracted to
pathetic her performance in these Realms
where she's unscripted is pathetic it's
pathetic and that's that is a killer
killshot word you you can't get people
to endorse somebody's path
so I would use that it's probably too
late to influence anybody at this point
but that's that's your uh your
persuasion lesson for the day is that
the word pathetic is super powerful
dangerous not so much you unless it's
real if everybody agreed that they were
in immediate danger then the danger
would be much more persuasive but when
the when the danger is sort of this
political rhetoric danger people don't
exactly feel that is
real um but pathetic they do yeah
pathetic is a conversation Ender use
that
one anyway she also said to when asked
about her economic plan she said quote
my plan is about saying when you invest
in small businesses you invest in the
middle
class my plan is about
saying so her plan is to say
things or for planners to say
things what so CBS follows up and says
uh the question was how are you going to
pay for
it now it's funnier now that you know
the question was how are you going to
pay for it now listen to her answer of
how she's going to pay for her policies
my plan is about saying when you invest
in small businesses you invest in the
middle
class uh the question was are you going
to pay for
it and then she said I'm going to make
sure the richest Among Us pay their fair
share in
taxes then CBS but we're dealing with
the real world here how are we going to
get this done and then she said
something about oh congress knows has to
be done which is not a real
answer so
pathetic not not
bad bad is better than pathetic
you know there there's like great job
good job pretty good job U poor job
terrible job bad job and then below all
of them is
this it's not even good enough to say
it's bad it's just well that's kind of
pathetic so not exactly why I want to be
the brand of my country there's another
big migrant Caravan being organized
South of the Border
um this could be a bad visual if that
Caravan starts Crossing uh and maybe
there's a big fight over it and they get
stranded at the border and there are
lots of visuals of the massive number of
people coming across the border or
trying to it could actually move the
election you know if the major news
covers
it so they
won't Fox News is going to have you know
wall to--all pictures of the migrant
Caravan and if you go to CNN they'll
like and there a caravan uh in our next
story Trump said something we don't
think is true but what about that
Caravan oh there's a caravan and then
Trump said something else we don't think
is true we're going to fact check
him so you won't hear much about that
except on Fox
News Now the other thing affecting the
election as we all know is the North
Carolina the hurricane um has made it
impossible to communicate or travel for
a huge number of people in North
Carolina Our concern number one just so
I make sure I say that first is the
lives and the
well-being um and the survival of the
people there the destruction is massive
and
unprecedented some of the worst things
youve ever seen and maybe it's not
getting better as fast as it
should so saying that first there is
also a political ele element to it they
can't be ignored but here's my
question take the setup there's natural
disaster so there are physical
limitations to voting people have lost
their ballots so now if they were going
to do mail-in ballots might be too late
or too hard to even get their new
ballots because again there's no
Transportation you know they don't have
the internet to order new ballots so
so you got lots of Republicans and
you've got physical
obstacles uh roads are washed out and
communication is
broken but I get back to my first point
it's filled with
Republicans so now game it out in your
head if you were going to if you were
going to write this movie what happens
it's full of
Republicans they know that their votes
and their State could be the difference
between Trump and and
Harris but there's huge physical
problems like big big physical problems
the road is just washed out like lots of
Roads washed out so what
happens game it down your head
Republicans equals trucks probably lots
of
trucks Republican equals power
tools bulldozers
ATVs physical
labor and don't with
me put it all
together Republicans trucks ATVs
Bulldogs Earth movers physical
labor don't with
me there is some chance and I don't want
to get optimistic cuz you know they're
they're they're dealing with very
survival so survival comes
first but it seems to me that if the
Republicans as a group could communicate
and again they can't communicate so
organizing might be tough but I don't
know if they need to communicate because
everybody knows what they need to
do
men they know what they need to do they
need to figure out how to build
temporary Bridges and if they can't
build a temporary Bridge they need to
figure out how to drive up to it unload
the senior citizens put them on a boat
cross them over put them on the next
pickup truck and take them to the next
place that they need to cross another
road or another something washed
out I think that Republicans might
self-organize meaning that they will
realize that the government can't fix
the roads in time and if they let the
country down they're going to know that
they let the country down and
Republicans don't do do that not the men
you know the women either but the men
will be moving the big equipment and
driving the trucks and building the work
around I've got a feeling that already
there's a whole bunch of bulldozers and
trucks and stuff going on I think there
are people with chainsaws taking down
trees and building temporary workarounds
to the roads around how long would it
take a state that's packed with
Republicans to make temporary roads and
workarounds and transportation and then
organize Caravans so if your car can't
go through the mud don't worry you get
on the back of a pickup truck and it
will take you the half a mile through
the mud then you get to another bus you
get on the bus the bus takes you to
maybe not even the regular polling place
cuz that already washed away but it
takes you to the temporary ones that
they set up because they had to
now
imagine the images of
that imagine watching it happen in the
say three weeks up before the election
watching the chainsaws come out the the
Earth movers come out the pickup trucks
come out they'd have to figure out how
to get gas to all these people because
it's not easy to even get gas um and
they'd figure have to figure out how to
coordinate and they could probably do it
without
Communications so you send one truck up
into the stranded community and you say
on Election Day there's going to be a
truck here and it's going to take
anybody who wants to vote tell everybody
telling everybody will get done if they
don't have internet and stuff they're
all talking right they're all outside
they're all talking so you could you
could potentially coordinate the most
massive Patriot Caravan that the
country's ever seen uh it would be
visually as inspiring as the Canadian
truckers because the one you if you the
thing the Canadian truckers got right is
the
tonnage right it wasn't a bunch of
people it was the tonnage they were
moving gigantic amounts of weight in the
form of trucks and putting them where
they wanted it so there's something
about persuasion and humans that when
you see humans moving
tonnage that means something more than
somebody just talking hey here's my
piece of pap paper read my piece of
paper all right that's kind of weak but
if you see somebody with a bulldozzer if
you see somebody who built their own
temporary Bridge because they had to and
and they and they did it with a
chainsaw and they just like knock down a
couple of big trees and put some boards
across and said it's not safe but it
works you could see the most inspiring
thing that we've ever seen in you know
recent America history maybe but will it
happen well some of it depends on
whether the the regular recovery is good
enough that people think they have a way
to get to the because you three weeks is
a long time to go without roads so I
think that some official FEMA or
government entities would be working
hard as well to make sure those roads
are passible in three weeks so we'll see
but I'm going to put my confidence in
the citizens of North
Carolina I think that they're going to
work just as hard to recover from their
own disaster as they will be to make
sure that the country is
served I think that's who they are so
we'll find out it's sort of a it's sort
of a deep character
test uh what I would expect of people is
to take care of themselves and take care
of their neighbors that's the only thing
i' expect that that's way
enough but they do have a certain
character
and maybe they will do all of that stuff
taking care of their neighbors taking
care of their families and also take
care of the
country because I think that's just who
they are but we'll find out so North
Carolina we're counting on you
Pennsylvania we're counting on
you
Georgia it's
time it's time men it's time I so a
uh well let's let's do
this I realized yesterday that Trump
could have the weirdest record of all
presidential candidates which is that he
could win three out of four
contests because if you think about it
he in 2016 so he's got one in the books
but he also beat
Biden he beat Biden right it didn't he
didn't go all the way to election day
but Biden got nominated and Trump beat
him would you
agree he got replaced but I call that a
win Trump trump beat him so he's two for
two now 2020 you could say Okay
technically the system says he lost in
2020
now what if he wins this time if he
beats
Biden
Harris and Hillary
Clinton he will have won three out of
four uh presidential
elections let's take it to the uh next
extreme if we someday find out how the
2020 election was stolen because I think
most of you think it was stolen I do he
will have won four and a four
presidential
races and that's not
impossible he might actually win for an
of
four remember when I told you I thought
he was the most
persuasive human I've ever seen you know
politician for
sure you can't get much more persuasive
than winning four out of four
presidential elections when when the
entire media machine is against you
that's pretty impressive now I'm not
going to say I'm not going to call that
a fact because the 2020 election is more
of an opinion in my opinion we haven't
had Fair elections probably in my
lifetime I'd be there there's nothing
about the way our system is set up that
suggests it's intended to be
fair you have to meet the first standard
the first standard for me is can you
tell me that it even looks like it was
intended to be fair and it doesn't
really meet the first standard you don't
even have to check if it's fair it's
designed where you just look at it you
go really you mean I I wouldn't know if
somebody mailed in a vote or if the
mailman threw it away that's your design
and I'm supposed to believe that that's
fair all right so you could go four for
four speaking of polling rasmuson says
their new numbers have Trump up by two
nationally two points nationally and
Atlas Intel who by the way you should
know rason and Alice inel um have been
in the top five so they're both top five
pollsters now top five is really really
good because there are a lot of
pollsters so if you're in the top five I
mean that's pretty impressive so in in
recent election they were both top five
so Alice Intel has them up
three now keep in mind I think I'm right
about this that uh if everything goes in
a normal fashion
if a republican is up two or three
that's a landslide in the electoral vote
because Republicans can win nationally
if they're
below um the competitor in the national
election so when you look at the
national election you really shouldn't
be seeing a republican ahead at all they
should be a few points behind even if
they're going to win but if you're a few
points ahead in two of the most accurate
polls a few weeks before the election
the the landslide signal has gone from a
faint
hum to sort of a beep beep beep beep not
guaranteed still a lot of time before
the election could be more surprises you
know the future is unpredictable but at
the moment the landslide signal is very
distinct and you should expect that the
other pollsters are likely to converge
on rasmason and Atlas Intel because I
suspect that they use a more reasonable
set of assumptions for the the mix of
who's actually going to vote how many
Democrats and how many Republicans
because there are a few different ways
you can measure that you can say well
it's the same as this prior election or
it's the same as the people who say
they're going to vote there's a whole
bunch of ways to say whether somebody's
likely to vote and that's the whole
game the
likelihood anyway um here's a persuasion
tip for you I've tried to give this one
but maybe I did it better this time if
if you're a politician and you're in
this race and you go on the news and
let's say you're a Republican and
somebody says um when the election comes
in and if Trump doesn't win will you
accept the outcome will you accept the
vote now this is not a sincere question
a sincere question would be H I'd like
to know the answer to that question and
I believe my audience would too so I'm
going to ask the sincere question
because I don't know the answer it's not
a sincere question it's a priming
question the priming is so to see if
you'll trap
yourself if you say well I don't know it
depends then you've just outed yourself
as someone who will not respect the
Democratic process you're probably a
dictator so that's the Trap they're
trying to set up but if you if you go
the other way so you can't win by saying
I don't know maybe I won't you'll
definitely lose if you say no or or if
you don't say yes but suppose you say
yes well you just found a second way to
lose so it's sort of do you still beat
your your spouse it it's the yes doesn't
work and the no doesn't work which is
how you know it's not a sincere question
if you could lose just as badly by
saying yes as saying no it's not a real
question right it's political question
so how do you answer a question that's a
setup here's the way you do it you call
out the
setup and you
say so ask me the question Scott uh will
you accept the election if uh Trump
doesn't win and you support Trump and if
he doesn't win will you accept the
election and I say oh let me ask for a
clarification on your
question now is there anybody who's
going to say no I won't clarify my
question no no everybody says of course
I'll clarify my question say are you
saying that would I accept an election
that had no indication of uh any
fraudulent
Behavior see where I'm going then they
say well you know no I'm just sort of
general you know forget about the
assumptions I'm just asking you would
you accept it I go but I don't quite
understand the question are you saying
that you think I should act the same if
there's no indication of fraud then I
would if the fraud is just glaringly
obvious so let me return the question to
you Mr
stenopus would you accept an election
result if Trump was polling even with
Harris but he won by 20 points on on
Election Day which you would probably
suggest would not be an accurate result
would you accept that or would you say
wait a minute there's something that's
so far out of line we should take a day
to look into this at least what would
you do
George
now why can't any of our politicians
figure that
out because the the making you think
past the sale is just so obvious the
thinking past the
sale is that you you asked to
uncritically accept that the outcome of
the election looks credible on the
surface that was not the case in 202
in 2020 Republicans said on the surface
this looks obviously rigged were they
right well I don't know I I assume all
elections have been rigged in my
lifetime I don't but I don't know the
details of any specific
ones um so don't allow them to make you
think past the sale they have they have
to back up a level so make them back up
before you answer the question oh that's
an excellent question George stefanas I
I think we should all answer that
question in fact uh I'm going to give
you my answer to the question and then I
think your your audience would like to
hear your
answer if the election looks totally
credible would I accept it yes would you
George if the election looked totally
credible and you didn't see any problem
would you accept it well of course I
would yes okay we're on the same page
now if it looked like it was obviously
or at least potentially something's
wrong with it and you know that a lot of
other people are seeing the same thing
and it could be a big big problem if you
don't know why it's so an awak let's say
it's completely an awak with exit
polling and completely an a whack with
what the polls were before you went and
under those conditions George would you
accept the outcome if it looked
obviously
rigged because I would say we should
take a pause and maybe look into it what
would you say George because I think
your audience would like to hear your
answer do you do you think there' be a
better response than
that don't let them sell past the clo or
don't let them make you think past the
sale they're trying to make you think
that the election will look credible and
that anybody looking at it would say oh
yeah that looks like our normal election
so we know who won don't accept that
assumption because that's not what
people saw in 2020 they saw things that
didn't look like the Bell weathers were
going the way they normally go that
there were some very unusual outcomes
now there might be reasons for it there
there could be entirely you know valid
reasons why one election is radically
different than the polls could be a
reason that is radically different
from other elections in the past but
would you uncritically accept it if you
didn't know why it was
different it's a good question for the
for the question ask her as well as
answer all right uh so Elon musk's mom
may may
musk um she was commenting on X about
the fact that there're places where
you're not going to be asked your ID to
vote and she said
uh um should that Elan should tell his
followers to uh use 10 fake names to
vote
so she's basically saying well you know
if if they can't tell who you are when
you vote why don't you all just use 10
fake names and and vote uh now here's
the fun part she said this on X and the
xplatform fact checked her and said uh
that's
illegal that's illegal so just to
clarify it's possible for somebody who
is not a real person to vote cuz you
don't have to give your
ID uh it is not legal to do it it's just
possible and you know you might get away
with it I suppose that's possible I
don't know the odds it's possible I
wouldn't take the chance so let me say
as clearly as I
can don't cheat in the
election don't do it it it would be
crazy for you as an individual to do
that even if you're positive the other
side is doing it don't do it
yeah so I think I think May might have
been speaking more uh with more
hyperbole than it looked so I'm not sure
that she meant that like literally but
it's funny that she got fact checked on
X all right I know you want me to talk
about whether manipulation and did the
government or the Democrats or somebody
else cause the hurricane to be worse or
to make it aimed there is lots of
evidence that the United States has and
other countries have tried and maybe
successful uh tried to alter the
weather now the way that we know it
works is we know that they can seed
clouds so we know that they can make it
rain more than it was supposed to rain
and one of the problems with the uh uh
North Carolina earthquake I'm sorry the
uh the hurricane that uh hit North
Carolina and neighboring states is that
um it rained a lot lot before the the
wind hit so you had the you know the
double whammy so could it be that some
terrible evil entity in our government
or any place else saw that uh the
hurricane was coming and they thought to
themselves well if we add a little extra
rain and over these Republican areas
that hurricane is going to be way worse
and they won't be able to
vote what do you think do you think that
happened let me take the tempure of the
audience that would be an
[Music]
outrageously evil thing and then other
people are saying B Scott it's basically
what they did in Lina in Maui and uh
it's sort of a version of the same play
you know there weather manipulation or a
laser from space or space lasers
changing the weather something like
that um I'm going to
say uh unlikely
I'm going to go with unlikely that there
was weather
manipulation now it is apparently it was
sort of an unusual event in the two
hurricanes being in the Gulf the same
time the new ones coming um you know
there there's definitely some
unlikeliness to it but hurricanes break
records all the time don't they like
it's not that unusual that there's a new
pattern or a new thing that happened any
given year
so and then you could also imagine that
maybe the the uh the climate change
alarmists would like to have a little
extra emergency to you know push their
uh climate change crisis alarm message
but I can't I can't see anybody doing
this um it would be hard for me to
imagine that you could get enough people
because it's not like a one a one person
job if you're going to change the
weather change the weather seems to me
like kind of a big job you you can have
at least several people who know what's
going on you know at least several so
could you get several people to
do basically genocide in the United
States I don't know that'd be a stretch
you you know the odds of a whistleblower
seem pretty high because anybody who was
messing with a hurricane that was going
to hit the mainland would know they're
they're messing with mass
murder like they everybody would know if
you intensify a hurricane you're killing
people so how many could you get like
seven
Americans I'm just going to pick a
number some small number of you know
plotters who who are all on board with
killing hundreds or maybe thousands of
America Americans with a trillion
dollars of damage to affect the
election there probably are people that
are that evil in the world but it'd be
hard to get five or seven of them
without at least one of them saying uh I
got to talk to somebody about this it's
possible though so I'm going to say that
the odds of weather manipulation being
part of this story I'm going to give
it
5%
5% now
remember 5% doesn't mean it's
impossible so if it turns out tomorrow
we find out it was happening I'm not
going to to say I was wrong because I'm
saying it's 5%
possible I'm just saying if the only
things you know are the things that we
know so
far I wouldn't expect it to be
true but you honestly can't rule it out
we live in a world where evil things do
actually happen and as scale pretty evil
things at a pretty big scale so 5% seems
like a big number to me
anyway uh did you watch the all-in Pod
and Mark cubin so David Sachs got into
him a little bit there was some
controversy about you know whether it
should have been moderated differently
or not um I I watched the clip and I
thought it was fine um I liked watching
them go at it enthusiastically but I
would remind
you people keep asking me what's up with
Mark cubin like what is what's going on
there is he is he being being
blackmailed or does he have some some
kind of profit motive is he really dumb
and that's all we're saying is he
brainwashed does he have TDs is it
personal and I would say it doesn't
matter if you spend any time trying to
figure out his personal thoughts it's
probably a waste of time here's the
thing we can tell it doesn't look
serious meaning that it looks like he's
enjoying it as a competition a sport
yeah he seems to be playing it like a
sport and I don't think he's super well
informed on the topics he's talking
about you could see that with David
Sachs filling in some you know things
that he was apparently unaware of and I
don't think that that even
matters it would matter if he were
trying to be a
serious you know voice in the
competition the political competition
but I think it's just team play and it's
competition and if he says some
anti-trump things in public and people
hear him and believe him he wins a
little bit but here's what I don't think
I don't think that the things he's
saying and doing are indicating what his
private thoughts
are that's what I think because the
things he says and argues when it comes
to Trump are so qualitatively different
than what he talks about on any other
topic on any other topic I stop what I'm
doing to listen to him because he's
really smart on a wide range of things
so the odds of him being really smart on
a wide range of important things in the
world and having demonstrated talent in
a V variety of fields it would be really
weird if he had just this weird pocket
stupidity that only applied to this one
category so I can't believe that it's
dumb
uh he might be a little less researched
than some of you but also because he's
not playing it like it's a serious thing
I think he's just having
fun and so if you make too much of it I
think you're just being drawn into the
game so it's fun it's fun to note what
he did and you know note who he's talked
to and maybe how they responded but I
wouldn't take his argument seriously
because I just don't know that that's
the game is in I I don't think he's in
the game of uh I want the best outcome
for the
country so let's you know let's make
sure we've transparently looked at all
the
issues but but he's not alone there it's
not like the rest of us are doing that
right it's not like it's common for
people to say you know really we do have
to look at both sides nobody's doing
that nobody I mean I my show is mostly
about trying not to be just in the
pocket for one side of the other and
even I am at this time of season I mean
I can't pretend I'm not 100% in the bag
for Trump I'm 100% in the bag for Trump
right I
mean so you know when I argue things am
I being biased I assume so I'm trying
not to be I mean I do make an effort not
to be but I'm also aware that it's not
really completely possible yeah I'm
biased as hell
well speaking of bias uh there was a
alleged video of some people from FEMA
on some kind of a zoom call and the
funny part is I could not tell if it was
parody or like a deep fake parody Or
real because the real world has become
so absurd that you can't exaggerate
enough that your parody looks like is
fake so what they were talking about is
uh you know that they should focus or
their attentions on the
lgbtqia people because they struggled
the most before the
storm and somebody said FEMA relief is
no longer about getting the greatest
good for the greatest amount of people
it's about disaster
Equity now if you told me that the
people in charge of Disaster Recovery
had rejected the notion of the greatest
good for the greatest amount of people
and instead we're looking at their uh
what kind of genitalia they put in their
mouth say all right um this group of
people uh what kind of genitalia do you
like to put in your mouth uhhuh uhhuh
okay so we're going to treat you a
little bit better and uh you people what
do you oh my god what do you put in your
mouths oh no no no no you're you heteros
you heteros are boring me first of all
and you've had too good a run it's time
that we balance things
out if if you told me that that was
really happening in the real
world I would have said that didn't
happen in the real world you wouldn't
say that out loud even if you thought
it so I don't know so I actually even
now I'm not sure it was
real now it's not so hard to tell an AI
fake uh unless the original image is
really bad so there was one fake I'm
sure it was fake where that image of the
person's face was uh smudged out
allegedly for protection or privacy but
really it also made it harder to know if
it was an AI fake because you couldn't
see the lips moving in the eyes and
stuff but on this one it was a bad Zoom
call so there was like a a natural delay
between the lips and the audio anyway
and you and it was a heart bad picture
so with the bad video you actually
couldn't tell if it was fake so I don't
know I have no idea if that was real or
not as of today I have no idea but the
fact that you can't tell a funny parody
from
reality is funny by itself I mean that's
how bad things
are anyway so apparently in North
Carolina there were uh 40,000 absentee
ballots were mailed out to people but
less than a thousand fewer than a
thousand were returned
so if that's the case uh then the
difference in voting patterns for North
Carolina could be completely
reversed by the fact that uh just most
people won't be able to vote so yeah the
the state's completely in Jeopardy now
election
wise um Andrea
Mitchell was talking about politics I
think it was today or yesterday and uh
in the middle of a sentence she just
dropped in the thought that
uh Trump's supporters might be
undercounted in
polls so that's Andrea Mitchell she
thinks Trump supporters might be
undercounted now I need a fact check we
know they were undercounted in
2016 I heard somebody say that Trump's
supporters were undercounted in 2020 so
even though there were more Biden votes
allegedly um was it also true that Trump
did better than anybody expected Trump
to do and that that his performance was
uh under uh he he over he he did better
than they expected is that
true because if it happened twice
there's not a chance in the world is
it's not happening a third
time because whatever people thought in
in 2016 and
2020 they still think meaning that if a
pollster calls them their their
incentive to say
uh I'm not a trump supporter might be
for a different reason now because in
2016 maybe you just didn't want to admit
it because you'd sound like a racist in
2020 you might have been playing a
little bit of that game but also the
game of you just wanted to make sure the
pollsters were
surprised but this time in
2024 I don't think there's a single
Republican who isn't at least aware that
other Republicans are lying to poller
which means it's in play as a strategy
everybody has it right there they can
just say the words and they can be part
of the prank so yes I believe that Trump
voters are being underestimated again I
think they are so we'll
see um Israel's always asked when it's
going to stop fighting and ceasefire and
Nan Yahoo said they're going to keep
going militarily until they've achieved
all of their
goals now what would that look like to
you if Israel is going to keep fighting
until they achieve all of their goals
one assumes that their primary goal is
to make sure there's not anybody
shooting missiles at them how far would
they have to go to make sure that their
neighbors are not shooting missiles at
them really far like farther than
anything we've ever seen before by a lot
all right so if you want to know what
the future looks like it doesn't look
like there's anybody who's going to
restrain Israel from doing what it
thinks it needs to do and if you think
that Lebanon is just going to work on a
deal of like no no you know we're we're
not going to shoot any more missiles
that's not going to
work as long as there's even one missile
left in Lebanon Israel can say we're not
done so I think that Israel will just
keep
going and I think they're going to take
it take it on
offense um I don't know if they're going
to do something today because it's
October
7th I'd be worried about a terrorist
operating today but I can't tell if
Israel is going to look for a payback on
October 7th because that would be a
meaningful date or they just going to
focus on the
victims which would be that would make
sense um and maybe take the day off from
fighting because you know just one day
to concentrate on what they lost maybe
but it's a dicey day so anything can
happen today so be alert be
alert and I guess
Colombia uh saw their donations dropped
29% this year according to New York Post
so you know Colombia had all those
anti-israel protests and apparently that
cost you $20 9% of your
donations I would I would expect this
would be a common thing to happen around
the other colleges as well all right
that's all I got for you today remember
my book wi bigley second edition is now
out if you want to learn persuasion the
Trump way this was written around the
2016 after the 2016 election about how
he did it and it will be twice as
relevant now as you see that the
predictions in the book about his
persuasion skills have certainly been
solidified and also the Dilbert page day
calendar if you didn't know is now
available but can only be purchased at
the dilbert.com website uh link go there
for the link it'll take you to the page
but you can't buy it on Amazon and you
can't buy it in the bookstore or
anywhere
else um all right that's all for now I'm
going to go talk to the locals people
privately so I'm going to turn off this
feed we're going to come back tomorrow
same place same time and uh Monday's a
little slow Newsday today but it's going
to get exciting tomorrow because that's
Tuesday Tuesday is always a big news day
all right bye for now
