you know people are always asking me
they're saying scott
what is the best hour of the day because
you got
24 hours in a day and people quite
reasonably are saying
is there a good one is there one of
those hours that's the good hour
yeah there really is do you know it's a
bad hour of the day
four o'clock nobody likes four o'clock
in the afternoon
bad hour you know what's pretty good a
pretty good hour
eight o'clock at night eight o'clock at
night
it's a very good hour but the best hour
is this one at this very time every
single day
when coffee with scott adams happens the
only unifying thing
in the whole world everything else is
divisive but you can enjoy this
unity with a copper margarita glass of
tanker tells us that in a canteen sugar
flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine
hit of the day the thing that makes
everything better except
dominion software it's called the
simultaneous
happens now go
yeah that's good uh i've been corrected
that 4 p.m uh
is good 4pm it turns out
because that includes 4 20. so
i stand corrected all right here's the
most exciting news of the day
i didn't know this was even happening
but apparently
years ago a spaceship was sent into
deep space to find and track down
an asteroid land on the asteroid
burrow into it grab some
some dirt from below the surface of the
asteroid
and send it back to earth
and land it i mean
i don't know if land is the right word
but we got the capsule back
i almost can't even speak those words
that is so
freaking cool we put
we humanity i didn't have anything to do
with it we put us
we put a rocket into space that chased
down an asteroid
dug a hole took some dirt and sent it
back to earth
can you believe it you think that's
amazing
you haven't even heard the wackiest part
so the capsule just just got back to
earth and when they opened it
nothing but trump ballots inside
apparently a lot of trump ballots had
been buried
on a distant asteroid
and it's only luck that this spaceship
found them
it makes you wonder makes you wonder how
many other asteroids
have ballots inside them right
because they look like regular asteroids
on the outside but
they could be hollow they could be no
i'm just kidding there were no trump
ballots in that capsule
uh it was only uh alien spores
so nothing to worry about just alien
spores
i don't see how those could hurt us
well we also had some news up in the
state of washington
where some mega people had some kind of
support the police
event which was crashed by a number of
antifa who apparently had not calculated
the numbers
correctly you know if you're going to
join antifa
i would recommend that you have in your
little
group you know each group of little
terrorists
you would have somebody who's good at
math because i think they got the math
wrong
because the group of antifa turned out
to be roughly
the same size as the group of mega
supporters
well it didn't go well for antifa
now i think they really need a spotter
and
a mathematician to kind of you know kind
of scope out the
the event and say it looks like uh
i think they got 150 people at that
event
uh we've got uh went to
35 run
run run away yeah
the reason that i have never been
worried about antifa taking over the
country
is because the minute they get out of
the city we're going to beat the
out of them
it's not even going to be close just get
out of that little city you
get just just come out to the country
come to the suburbs pay us a visit
we are gonna kick your asses all
the way back to your little city
which you can have you can keep the city
i don't care about the city
i don't live there and the cities are
doomed anyway i mean
if you think about it between the fact
that people are going to tell the
commute
probably from now on because the
coronavirus then you add the lawlessness
and who the hell would live in the city
if they had a choice
right living in a city is going to turn
into
like what happened to your life you must
have made really bad choices
you live in the city why would you do
that
if you're worried about antifa spreading
from the city to the country
there were quite a few uh mega people in
washington state who would like to
suggest that
that won't go so well
um all right
here's a statement that i think sums up
where we're at uh i tweeted this i think
the fake news
uh destroyed america
and so unfortunately the fake news has
this weird power
where they can break something but
because they're the news
they can simply report that you broke it
ima imagine if you know when you were
growing up you had siblings
imagine if you had one sibling just just
one of your siblings
who had the power of the press so you
had a sibling that could go break
something
go break a window and then one mom and
dad came and said hey who broke the
window
your sibling who broke the window said
well
i've been the designated news so i'm the
news organization of this
family and uh the news is that uh
my sibling broke that window and your
parents say
okay you're the news so it must be true
and then you punish punish that other
kid
now would you think that was a good
system would that be a good system that
one of the kids could simply blame the
others for their own crimes and the
parents would say
yeah that's a good system fine with us
no you would not think that was a good
system
but that's what our our press has turned
into
they can literally destroy well i would
argue that they destroyed the republic
literally we don't live in a republic
anymore it's some kind of bulliocracy
cheatocracy i don't know what it is but
it's not anywhere
close to a republic
the the fake news pretty much destroyed
that
i think we'll get it back and i'll talk
about that in a moment but at the moment
we don't have a republic
we we have something like a zombie
republic
that has you know some outward
manifestations of looking like it came
from a republic
but we don't have a situation where
people vote and the will of the people
gets translated into their
elected representatives who make
decisions on their behalf nothing like
that's happening
you know that's how it was drawn up on
paper but we're not living in that
system that's for sure
so and imagine this
imagine this if the fake news had never
told you
that uh half the country were neo-nazis
supporters let's say neo-nazi supporters
that's what the news told you for
three years do you think that has any
effect
on the divisiveness of the country
being told for three years that half of
us are neo-nazi supporters
which by the way if you're new to my
periscope it's not actually true
turns out that the number of neo-nazi
supporters is
vanishingly small among every population
in the united states
but not according to the news the news
told you it was
rampant must be at least 74 million of
them
imagine if the fake news had been
credible enough that it didn't destroy
your trust in
every other institution because i would
say that when the news
fell and the news has fallen right and
can't get up
when the news fell and you couldn't you
couldn't trust the
what you thought would be the
gatekeepers of information
when that last thing fell that kind of
took everything with it
didn't it now maybe you don't process it
that way you're not consciously thinking
oh
if the news is fake that must mean
everything else is fake
but i don't see you could separate those
things because once you learn that the
news is literally made up
what are you going to believe about the
news's report
about science what are you going to
believe when the news tells you the
scientists say this is true
we're not going to believe it because
you don't really get to see the science
right when was the last time you did
science
maybe never the thing that we think is
science is somebody else telling us what
the science was
the thing we see is the somebody else we
see a person
telling us what they think they saw in
the science we never see
science we see some interpretation
of a person who's trying or sometimes
not trying to tell you what they saw
now if the news can't do that for you
and or you don't trust it to do that for
you
then you also have no information about
science
none you have reports
but it's coming through through a
mechanism the fake news
that has no credibility so
the dumbest people in the world
are the ones who say
follow the science and it's a good thing
i know what the science is
because i heard it on the news that's
the dumbest thing you can say in
2020
is that you understand science because
somebody who doesn't understand science
explained science to you that's all you
have
is people who don't understand it
telling you
what they thought they saw which isn't
even close
it's all you got all right now you
didn't really
feel that until the gatekeepers
collapsed right until the news became
completely undependable as opposed to
something that
sometimes makes mistakes then you
realized
holy crap not only can i not trust the
news
but they're the only source i have
for what science is telling me
so science is gone it's just not
something you can trust anymore
because you don't have any access to it
now if you had access to it
and you were the kind of person who
would be rare who could judge it
and you know you had enough wisdom and
you knew the area and you could tell
what was missing or maybe what they left
out
you could look at the numbers there are
people like that there are some people
who could
have a pretty valuable opinion about the
quality of some science
but you don't know those people i don't
know any
can your neighbor do that my neighbor
can't
i mean i haven't checked but i don't
think so
so i'm getting into the good news later
we'll we'll talk about the crazy stuff
so senior advisor to biden
simone sanders you all know simone
um she is she's black which is important
to the story
again i'll remind you i look so forward
to the day when no story requires you to
know the race of the people involved
like if we ever get there or you can
just tell the freaking story
and you don't have to throw in
somebody's ethnicity because it doesn't
matter
that will be a good day that day has not
come
because the story requires you to know
that simone sanders is black
because what her quote was on the news
in public
with no shame said the following thing
out loud she said we don't need white
people running
the democratic party now now she went on
to
explain what she meant that it's a party
of
uh inclusion and etc so she wanted to
make
you know the democratic party look like
the country
that part's good but how does that fit
with the sentence
we don't need white people running
democratic party now
you would get fired for saying
that
wouldn't you now just replace it with
any other ethnicity and you get fired
how does simone sanders not get fired
within an hour of saying white people
shouldn't be running the democratic
party how is that even
possible it's because
the fake news controls your opinions
if we had independent opinions we'd look
at this and say
well i'll tell you one thing this is one
person who should not have a job
doing anything important she's just a
flat-out racist
and she's not hiding it i'll give her
credit
for being transparent she's not hiding
her racism
even a little bit she's saying it write
out write out loud in direct words
i think if you asked her to clarify she
would clarify it the same way
because i don't think there's any
embarrassment there's no pushback
this is exactly what she meant to say
and it has been accepted by
cnn and the news as an acceptable
statement by a high
official a high advisor to the president
it's okay no problem
so that's shocking uh there's a new
report on cnn so you know it's true
it's on cnn that the uh there's been
continued government studies of this
alleged
sonic weapon that allegedly hurt people
in various embassies including cuba
and now they're saying that they don't
believe it was a sonic attack
they believe it more likely was a
microwave energy weapon
or at least microwave energy they
haven't identified that it was
necessarily a weapon
but they feel confident it was probably
microwave energy because
i don't know why maybe the maybe the
nature of the
of the damage or something so
suppose that's true and i would say the
odds of this being true
are low you know just because it's cnn
and it's in this domain of things that
we never really know
we'll never really know the truth etc so
i wouldn't
i wouldn't trust i wouldn't trust this
at all
i would put zero credibility on this
report
zero not even a little bit and the
reason is
that this is spy stuff if cnn tells you
a story
from the government so remember this was
a government study
and the government told cnn
that uh you know here's my explanation
and there's there's no spy stuff
happening
would you believe it you shouldn't
because the government should not be
telling cnn any spy secrets
because let's say we knew what this
alleged weapon was we knew it was a
microwave energy or something
should they be telling cnn that i don't
know
maybe not it feels it feels as if they
might have looked into it a little bit
further before they told cnn
and so first of all i doubt that it's a
microwave energy
weapon but at least you can't rule that
one out
you know when when the sonic attack came
i i quite famously and publicly said
this is a story someday you
will learn
there was no secret sonic weapon
well now that's the the government's
official story
is that there was no secret sonic weapon
so maybe i got that part right but now
they're saying
oh this might have been a microwave
energy weapon might have been a
microwave
maybe so at least we're in the realm of
something i could imagine would happen
i mean it's possible i can't see a
major power doing this and thinking that
would be a good risk reward
you know attacking an embassy imagine if
you were a major
power or a country just a country and
you got
caught attacking an embassy
do you think you'd pay for that that's
about as
that's about as bad as it gets if
there's any country that thought that
was a good risk reward
take out a couple of diplomats who would
be replaced in an hour
and risk losing their whole freaking
country
because if you attacked our embassy
that's an act of war obviously
and we would retaliate quite
aggressively
so i'm not buying the energy weapon
microwave energy weapon unless it was a
freelancer
and even then i'd have to know that a
freelancer could build such a thing
maybe all right there's a voter fraud
map
that uh i tweeted at the heritage uh
foundation
so you can uh you can click on your
state
and find out how many uh prosecuted
election frauds have happened so
everybody who thinks
election fraud is really rare or anybody
who thinks
it's very common you can go there and
you can actually see
so i would say that's a really good
source i assume it's accurate enough for
this purpose
but there are lots of examples of
election fraud
so here's something we know if all of
those people
on that list and all these states and
over the years
have attempted ballot fraud
and got caught why did they attempt it
why did why did so many people attempt
stealing an election well obviously
to win right but beyond that why did
they think it would work
why did all those people who got caught
think they could get away with it
i'm just going to speculate now i think
the reason that
so many people thought they could get
away with rigging an election
is because the things they were doing
were undetectable
without a coincidence so in other words
there was probably
just some weird coincidence or you know
something popped up
or somebody knocked on somebody but i
have a feeling that the people who did
all of those frauds that are listed and
have been actually
prosecuted for they had to know
that they were doing something that
wasn't witnessed how many of those
people did their crime in front of a
security camera
well i don't know but i'm guessing
nobody because wouldn't you know you'd
sort of
check for the security cameras you're
not going to do a crime right in front
of them
so the fact that there were so many
prosecuted
election frauds suggests there were
probably a lot that weren't prosecuted
and probably the people who tried the
crime
had a reasonable expectation of getting
away with it
which means there are holes in the
system all right
um doesn't it feel like politics became
a video game
you know if you play video games long
enough you get used to
things happening on the screen and
people are getting hurt
and beating each other up and it's drama
and stuff but then you just walk away
because it was just something on a
screen
and the news has become that thing it's
this something on a screen for most of
us
if you're not directly you know in the
in the riot or something
and like a video game we all get to play
weirdly because if you can tweet or do a
social media post
you're playing the game you're you know
maybe you have a small influence
uh some people have bigger ones you know
i have a relatively larger influence
bigger audience but to me
i i have to say i sometimes catch myself
playing it like a game you know what i
mean
do you ever feel it and maybe even when
you watch me you feel it
that there's something that's
entertainment
about all of this it's it's fun
just like a video game except that it
has the
the downside that it's also real
because i don't i i feel as if the yeah
the antifa
the protesters etc it's very much like
dress up
entertainment is sort of replacing
sports because there aren't as many
sports on tv
it feels very video gamish and i think
that's to our detriment
because we're we're dehumanizing each
other and then on top of that
we're wearing masks for a year we're
hiding our faces from each other for a
year
the the risk of dehumanizing each other
is enormous
now i haven't seen that become like a
world
problem yet but i'd keep an eye on that
one
here's what i think though is our
solution going forward
in my opinion the uh the republic is
gone
so we don't have to worry about hey
might we lose the republic that's gone
and it's gone
with certainty because the uh
the ballot counting in key cities
were not transparent and they were not
witnessed
and that was done by force so that's our
government
our government was the force that
drove the witnesses out of the office
our government was not the vote
the government is the force because if
they can do that
and obviously they got away with it so
far that's the government
right i mean i feel that's fair that
doesn't even feel like a stretch
the government is what happens that
creates your leadership
what happened was some force
that made the system non-transparent and
that caused
biden to get elected that is your
government i don't know what you call
that but it's not at republic or even
close
then on top of that you had the media
influence the
the changing of the rules the political
bs definitely wasn't
a republic but here's the thing could we
get it back
do you want to get it back do you even
notice
here you are here i am i used to be in a
republic
where i thought i was now i'm not
what's different what's different
my coffee tasted exactly the same but
i'm not in the republic
so the first thing you need to ask
yourself is does it matter that much
the next thing you need to ask is how
long have we not been in a republic
because i doubt this was the one
election where elections could be stolen
does that seem likely you know if you
believe it was stolen this time
would you really believe it never
happened before
if it happened this time it probably at
least was attempted
every time it doesn't mean it worked
every time i think
trump might have surprised them with you
know higher votes than than they could
cheat in time
but you'd have to assume it happened
here's what i think is the fix
engineering
engineering and in this case i guess
re-engineering
is the fix let me give you an example we
have a big problem with the vote
could you engineer a solution that would
improve
credibility yes yes i think mit has a
voting app
i believe it's blockchain based i
haven't looked at it called
votesvotz or something now
would we just take one of these apps and
just put it into service
in the next election i don't think we
were there yet
but we could run it in parallel you know
find a bunch of voters who are willing
to vote in person
and also use the app and then just see
if it's different
you know do do at least one one live
you know live test but
so there's an example where engineers
could simply
invent stuff that solves a little bit of
our problem not all of it right
then what about adding uh
auditability to the rest of the system
you know because it probably won't be
all app could we do that yeah
we know how to do transparency etc what
about
re-engineering uh our government
well it looks like that's going to
happen because i would imagine that
if things go the way it looks like
they're going which is always
a gamble but if things go the way they
should be going i would expect
republicans will
own the congress and own the entire
government
in two to four years that's what
i would imagine would happen um
what about uh you know maybe
emptying out the cities and just finding
a better way to live
i think that'd be good right so
if we fix the voting i think we can fix
the republic
but until we do that we're just not a
republic
but we could be one as easily as
implementing
a reliable technology for voting
so it's not like it's not even if you
were to look at the
you know the history of problems and
sort of rank them
like how big is this problem how big is
this problem
well losing the republic sounds like the
biggest problem in the world
but probably isn't it probably isn't
we'll probably just still go to work the
economy is a little bit separated from
all of this business
the economy doesn't really care except
interest rates and you know some stuff
like that but it doesn't care what
system
created it so i think the economy will
chug along
and we'll figure out how to how to fix
the vote
and we probably will recover and become
a republic probably
close to 100 i think our odds are really
good
here's the funniest thing that's
happening now
just to summarize how absurd
our current situation is all right
this is how absurd it is
that president-elect biden is calling
for democrats to unify
with the people that biden calls
neo-nazi supporters
and no one is asking a follow-up
question which is sort of
the punchline of it no one's asking a
follow-up question
don't you think that that deserves a
follow-up as
in why would democrats want to unify
with who biden believes and of course
he's wrong
but biden believes he's been saying it
for a few years now
that trump supporters are basically
neo-nazi supporters because of
charlottesville because of the president
et cetera so
why would he want to unify
with neo-nazi supporters according to
him now obviously it's not true
but that's what he believes he sold that
to the country
maybe he needs to live in it maybe he
should live
in the country that he sold to his
idiot voters what he sold was a half the
country
is irredeemable don't ask me to be
redeemed
don't ask me to be redeemed this is
unforgivable
unity with people that you've smeared as
neo-nazis for three years
just isn't gonna happen i hate
his guts
and by the way i've never said that
about a president i've never said
even if i disagree with the president
don't like the policies
i've never said i hate their guts but i
hate
biden because of this
i mean this daughtering old fool
has you know could destroy the whole
 country
just by being an now
in other news
here's another one uh i love watching
glenn greenwald
uh dunk on people on twitter not not
only because he's good at it but because
he doesn't call favorites
like if if glenn grindwald thinks you're
a bad person
he's gonna he's gonna take you out on
twitter
it doesn't matter what party you are it
doesn't matter anything else so i
i always appreciate his consistency and
transparency and by the way i think he's
i believe he's insulted me on twitter
some opinion i had at one point
so i don't like him personally just
just to be clear but as a media
personality he's really valuable
so i i value him in that sense so he was
talking he tweeted today about a
tweet by casey hunt who works for nbc
and casey said this about biden she said
i'm just struck by the reality
that we'll now have a president who as a
rule
doesn't lie even when it might be easier
and she was referring to the fact that
she asked a question or somebody asked
biden a question
and he refused to answer it so
a direct response by nbc employee
to biden refusing to answer a very basic
question
and she's wowed by him because
as a rule he's not going to lie so how
did
glenn grindwald take casey hunt's
fawning opinion
that biden who just stiffed her for an
answer
he just stiffed the press
for an easy simple direct answer
and she's praising him for his
transparency
what did glenn greenwald say about this
he said
and i quote aside from the fact that
biden has a long history of
pathologically lying from claiming he
marched
with mandela to having to drop out of
his first presidential race for
seriously
lying about his background it's bizarre
to see a journalist
be grateful for being stonewalled
she was acting grateful for being
stonewalled
i mean you know i i said on twitter this
morning that uh
comedy is dead right but
this is comedy how do you how do you
read this exchange and not laugh
comedy can't work on tv or movies
anymore because you'll get canceled if
you if you say stuff
but this is just pure comedy and i'm not
joking
when i say that i watch uh cnn for the
laughs
because they'll come up with something
that's just so clearly not true
and i'll just laugh i go i'll bet people
believe that one
and and by the way just to be clear
you know i think that the news on the
right is going to get pretty bad
you know if we if we end up with a biden
administration
so it's not about the left exactly it
has more to do with the way the system
is designed
all right uh
here's the story
um the chairman of
smartmatic is a guy named
lord malik brown and george soros
uh just tapped him to lead george
soros's open society
organization now
i call that ironic
but turns out that that word ironic
is i'm trying to think if there's any
other example in the english language
where a word can mean what it means but
it also simultaneously means the
opposite of
of what it means so ironic if you
if you use the real classic historical
definition of the word
would be let me give you an example of
something that would be ironic
if you were the strongest man in the
world and you moved into a town
that was called weekville that would be
ironic
you're the strongest man in the world
but you moved into a town called
weakville now what people think
the word ironic means is coincidence
which it doesn't
it it's it's you know it's a kind of
coincidence but it's a special kind
that i just mentioned what would be just
a coincidence
would be if the strongest man in the
world moved into a town called
strongville you'd say oh that's a
coincidence
but it's not ironic because they're both
strong
all right so here's the guy who's the
chairman of smartmatic the voting
software
which the biggest thing in the news
right now is that the voting
software is not transparent can't be
audited
we don't we can't see the code so he's
literally the chairman
of the most famous for being not
transparent company in the news
at the moment and while he's being
famous for being the chairman of the
least
transparent company he got to be the
head of the open society
so the least transparent person is the
head of the
open society that's ironic
because he's the least transparent in
the open society
all right now i don't know what to make
about this
except that obviously you can't use
smartmatic software anymore
obviously is that even any
in question anymore is is there any
smart
person who says that we can still use
this voting system of course not
we're way beyond the point where this is
a judgment call
way beyond that we're at the point where
the only
thing you need to know is if the
chairman of smartmatic
is working for george soros
it doesn't matter if george soros is
innocent of
everything he's ever been blamed of it
doesn't
matter what the base reality is the
united states
will not accept an election that they
know
the the head of the smormatic company
is also the head of open society that's
not even close to something we'll accept
it's not in the zip code of something
americans will accept
now we accepted it up till now because
people just weren't aware of any
connection but if we assume this news is
true and i suppose i could find out in
10 minutes
it's a fake news but it was in the news
it was in the news or it was on social
media but let's assume this is true
it doesn't mean that this lord malik is
doing anything bad right
there's no evidence that he did anything
bad and i'm not
i'm not alleging that he's guilty of
anything
i'm just making a very common sense
statement
that if let's say
oh i don't know vladimir putin
became the chairman of our voting
company's software
would we say well there's no evidence
that putin was messing with the software
and we liked the software
so i mean i think we could get over the
fact
that the chairman of the company is
vladimir putin
you know right yeah we don't have any
transparency
and if he did rig the system or he was
part of it we would have no way of
knowing
but again telling me that vladimir putin
is using the software to rig the
election do you know what i call that
baseless it's basils
that is baseless because there is no
evidence
the vladimir putin allegedly
or not allegedly but if you could
imagine in your mind that he was the
chairman of smart medics which he isn't
would you say that's okay we can let
that
stand because there's no evidence of
bad behavior no of course not
of course not so it doesn't matter what
lord malik brown has or has not done
or might do or could do none of that
matters
none of that is part of the decision all
you need to know
is that this setup is unacceptable to
americans that's
it that's it that's the end of the story
and
mike kudray i don't know how to
pronounce his name
cowdray he's an entrepreneur and
activist and he's calling on
president trump to declare that dominion
and smartmatic are a national security
threat
and to do that by executive order and to
borrow them from every doing business in
the united states
and he finishes his tweet by saying we
cannot allow foreign companies
to control our elections now
does anybody have any
problem with that i mean annie
can you think of even even as a
you know devil's advocate if you just
wanted to even pretend
you were on the other side of that
argument that we should ban them by
the executive decree or what do you call
executive order
i don't i don't even know if you could
find a democrat that would disagree with
it
would you i mean once you explained it
if you just threw it on somebody they
they will just you know take their sides
but if you actually sat down
any democrat and you just said here's
the situation
half of the country doesn't trust these
machines they're not
auditable and we're sending data through
foreign countries and is owned by a
foreign country
is there anything else you need to know
about whether we should use these
machines i don't think so
do you need to know that there's
definitely a problem
in the 2020 election no
no you don't need to know that do you
need to know if the
if the 2020 election was perfect
no it has no bearing on the decisions
nothing that happened this year has any
bearing
on the fact that it's a situation
that is completely insecure and
i don't think anybody's even arguing
that so
of course we should do it as part of
homeland security
of course why would we even
debate this and why is the president not
doing it already
i would expect him to do it before he
leaves office so do you think that
and which would be fun because it would
require
biden to undo it imagine that
imagine that biden would have to undo
that if if he thought it should be
undone
that would be pretty awkward wouldn't it
because it's one thing to have a
situation and
maybe you just get used to read it
didn't notice but the moment
that trump banned them it becomes a
gigantic story if biden
later unbans them he's got to have a lot
of explaining to do
so the president the current president
has
lots of ways to make things interesting
for a biden
administration uh let me give you an
update on world war three
which um some of you probably don't
realize that we're in
now you may say to yourself how could we
be in world war iii
nothing's blowing up or at least there's
not enough blowing up that it looks like
world war three well here's the thing
imagine using a nuclear weapon against
china or
russia or vice versa will that ever be a
good idea
no no imagine china
sends its tank tanks to attack
russia or whatever would that ever be a
good idea
nope nope under no scenario
will it ever make sense you know if
you're being rational
under no scenario will the big countries
fight each other directly militarily
because it's self-insured destruction
but they can hack each other apparently
all day long
they can do propaganda they can do dirty
tricks
as long as it's hard to know who's doing
what to whom
there's no limit apparently all those
limits are off
and those tools while they used to be
strong but not strong enough to
necessarily overthrow the united states
or necessarily overthrow like a major
country
they are now they are now if you ever
believe
that those propaganda persuasion
disinformation
dirty tricks if you ever thought that
they weren't that strong
and maybe they could only work in a you
know a third world country
south america where you're trying to
overthrow a third world country
but even then you probably have to arm
the rebels
right so even if you're talking about
you know overthrowing some small country
you're probably at the very least
need to put some weapons in the hands of
the the people who want to take over
but we're in a we're in a world where
the the
power of those tools the propaganda
misinformation etc
because you can test it so quickly okay
we put that out
nope nobody retweeted it try again boop
because you can rapidly test it it's
gone from something that could
maybe take over a country or destroy a
country
to something that will all right it's
the the question of whether it's strong
enough to take down a major power
i think that's really clearly yes at
this point
very very clearly yes and you wouldn't
need any
to fire any bullets or drop any bombs
you could just take over
you could destroy their economy with
disinformation you can destroy their
system you can destroy their trust
it looks like that's what's happened so
although i don't uh like you i don't
have the ability to say oh that thing
happened because of these dirty tricks
that's how they work the reason dirty
tricks work is you don't know where it
came from
and you don't know where this tweet came
from and is this disinformation and
where did that come from you just don't
know but we do know
i think we can say this with absolute
certainty that the united states and
china are in a hot war
and have been for some time a hot war
of these non-kinetic things from
persuasion to dirty tricks
likewise i assume china and russia are
probably fighting it out
under the hood where nobody sees it i
imagine
europe is deeply in the war i imagine
every major
country is either being affected or is
on offense or both you know i assume
that we're doing
we're giving back to china as good as
we're getting we just don't hear about
it in the news because it's
you know spy stuff so
world war iii is raging right now
it's raging what will
protect us well some of it is
you know a lot of it is uh adjusting as
you go
so you know if you're in a war you can
have a plan
but as as famously said all all war
plans
disappear as soon as the first shots are
fired and then
all hell breaks loose so
i don't know if there's some specific
plan
that we need to to win world war iii or
to
be protected or anything you know we'll
be adjusting and
working on it as we go but i don't know
that it could
end you know if you have a kinetic war
we know how to end those we're not good
at it but at least we know how
we end it by it becomes so bad that one
side
sues for peace you meet you sign some
documents you know how to end a real war
you know the old fashioned war but how
do you end a propaganda war
because you can just say it wasn't us
so here's why i think that
uh there's a gigantic shift coming
and you're probably participating it
right in it right now
the only thing that can protect you
is people who are not on the take
that's it you you and i think that means
independent uh journalists and
independent
people who have the benefit of these
tools
where they can have a big reach but they
can help you sort out
what is real from what is not real
because the news
has abandoned that business you know
they even started a fake
fact-checking business to really
to really reinforce how not in the
business of facts they are
they they've all you know created fake
fact checking
uh which is just amazing to me and so
you're gonna have to rely on the future
on people
i'm not gonna say me but people like me
which you can say uh
it doesn't seem like he's getting paid
by somebody to do this he's not working
for china
not running for office not going to run
for office
i've got enough money more money is
great
you know everybody likes more money but
there are some people there there will
be your uh
your your independence who if they don't
become stronger in terms of their
messaging and power to
you know de-hypnotize you uh yeah i
guess unhypnotize you
um without that i think we're lost
so it seems to me that ensuring that our
social media
platforms will allow independent voices
to continue to be heard everywhere
without that we're in real trouble
but i think we'll be able to maintain
that i think we'll be able to keep that
so that's the way we're going we need to
educate ourselves as voters i would
recommend
my own books for that these two in
particular
win bigly and uh no this one loser think
because the better you are at uh
spotting bs
and that's what both of those books will
help you do spot things that aren't true
but that are being presented as true
you need to build that into your talent
stack
so that these citizens can take over the
country
again as we
have before so this is a bit of a 1776
but it's the digital version
meaning that meaning that
we don't need to form a you know george
washington
militia and attack the armies of another
force
we do need to form a digital militia
in effect of people who are hardened
against fake news
and can there therefore you know
de-hypnotize
the people who are not hardened against
it yet
and then of course our technology people
need to uh you know as
as mit did coming up with the voting app
and
other apps to give us transparency and
and we can
we can uh survive this we will
i think you'd be fine there are 522
deaths
cumulative in my county from covet
522 i don't know any of them
so i'm not aware of anybody in my county
personally
who died of covid uh it's a big county
though so it includes
you know some metro areas but
that's pretty scary so i'm in california
and i'm
officially locked down i think today is
the beginning of the new lockdown
so i can't i can't eat in a restaurant
even outdoors
i'm not supposed to go anywhere unless
it's required
um and i don't know how long this lasts
but there's a good chance that i'll
start doing some evening broadcasts i
have to see if
if i can you know i can uh rally for
that
but uh it's gonna be a tough a tough few
months
the only thing i'm positive of with no
doubt whatsoever
is we'll get through it that's the weird
thing about this pandemic is it does
sort of have a timer on it
you know we don't know when the timer
dings but the timer is set
we will get past this we won't all be
here to enjoy it
but we will get past it
all right so um you know in addition to
the voting machine stuff
there's uh let me reiterate the
claims made about georgia that are not
exotic
and have not been you know debunked by
anybody as far as i know
2500 felons voting 66
000 underage ineligible people this is
just
georgia allegedly 2 400 people not
registered a thousand people registered
with a
p.o box 5000 people
voted after sorry after their
registration date
10 000 who were deceased now
do you believe those numbers because you
probably shouldn't
they're they're not they're not numbers
that are based on
somebody counted it up right you know
they they had proof and they counted it
i believe that these numbers come from
the data
in other words the the initial look into
the data
suggested that these are uh either true
or you definitely ought to look into it
you know at the very least
you need to look into this stuff and i
believe that this
would fall into the category of what i
was telling you from the very beginning
would be the quote good stuff
so i you've never heard from me that the
voting machine
criticisms were the good stuff you've
never heard from me
that the the video of somebody allegedly
doing something during the bell
accounting
you've never heard me say that that's
the good stuff this was the good stuff
if it's good enough i suppose we'll
we'll know someday
we'll see uh walmart's selling some home
cover tests but you still have to
send them in but maybe maybe this is a
big deal
if you could find out if you had a
coronavirus within two days
maybe that makes a difference but you
have to get to the point where people
can do it without sending it away to a
lab
but at least walmart's making a
difference so good for walmart stepping
up
i appreciate that all right
that is what i wanted to say for today
do you have any questions that's there
anything you'd like to know
uh we somebody says we'll be a country
of oligarchs and welfare groups
yeah you know one of the things that and
i mentioned this before
historically there's this cycle i don't
know if this is the fourth
turning or if it's just a cycle
but apparently when a civilization such
as the
the united states becomes very
successful then there's this
income inequality that happens and then
everything goes to hell
now that's historically that happens
sort of close to all the time will that
happen now
here's my optimism on that i say no
because the the the pre-history
let me say it clearer the history of the
world before the internet
just can't look like the history of the
world after the internet
there isn't any way that those should
look similar
so i can certainly see how a
civilization that did not have
instant and good communication could
fall apart
could fall apart in a number of ways but
we have this because of our
communication being so good
now we're a little bit self-healing
if you look at how our economy can
recover from just about anything now
you you could if you took the economy of
the united states and go back to
pre-internet days
you know one good punch and you got the
great depression
it's just one punch boom depression
but at the moment because we're so much
smarter about what to tweak and when to
tweak it and how much to tweak it and
everybody can communicate and get on the
same page and
you know all of that stuff i think we're
in a world
where we can just re-engineer when we
need to and we need to
so we're in exactly a point when you
know our
uh our commuting patterns are changing
the way we eat
the way we entertain is changing
healthcare is completely changing the
cities will probably
yeah who knows what's going to happen to
the cities but you have all all this
change happening and all of it requires
re-engineering so if you have
a world which is now you know connected
by the internet
and we could all sort of work as one
that's a really different situation
let me give you just the the smallest
example
all right just the smallest example and
some of you saw this in real time so in
the spring when the coronavirus came out
uh the president was looking for
people to suggest what should we do
that isn't already obvious are there
other things that
the administration should be doing now
one of the most phenomenal things i've
ever seen in my life i mean really
just like goosebumps kind of stuff
is that lots of people responded to that
just ordinary smart citizens
who said i've got an idea i'll bet you
didn't think about this one
submitted it to people who they knew
could get that information to the
administration
and and i watched it happen in minutes
as in somebody would send me an idea
that i thought was worthy enough
that the administration should see it i
would send it to
you know my closest contact that could
make that happen
and i would sometimes hear within
minutes
that the chief of staff had just looked
at it
and had a comment in minutes
that was happening and what didn't
happen once
this was a system that just sort of
spontaneously
grew up and did that now one of the
things that i sent
in as a suggestion was to
get rid of the limitations on telehealth
across
state lines because we had this
ridiculous situation
that you couldn't talk to a doctor who
practiced in another state
on the phone how crazy is that
now that was a perfect example the
administration if they had not been
prompted by a member of the public in
this case
it was just something i had this weird
knowledge about
if if i had not sent that was it going
to happen
maybe maybe but i don't know that
i'm just using it as an example of how
this mass
communication that we have allows you to
quickly adjust
to even something as big as a pandemic
in a way that you couldn't even imagine
before
i mean you can really get a lot done
when you're connected
so in my opinion the economy doesn't
have the same risk of shock it used to
have
because we have more information better
communication and also
the system itself doesn't have that risk
anymore
so i would say that the internet makes
all of our history sort of
non-predictive anymore
and that's the good news all right
yeah biden somebody says biden keeps
saying he's gonna
control that virus but he doesn't say
how well he did say he was gonna
ask for a hundred days of mask wearing
a mandate will that make a difference
i don't know how do we deprogram people
we
know a proven protocol now a lot of
people have asked me this because
people want to deprogram their spouses
and i want to help you on that but
here's here's the obstacle
if you um if you're trying to deprogram
one person as opposed to just things you
spray into
the social media but if you're working
with one person here's the
the hypnotist's rule and this is why
it's hard for me to give you this advice
in this medium if you're working with
one person and trying to
hypnotize them or persuade them or
anything in that domain
the biggest part of the technique is the
ob
the observation so you try something
that works you know generically and you
see if that worked for this individual
if it does work you do more of that if
it doesn't work
you say oh better try something else so
without that
iterative part of the process you know
you standing with your spouse and you
you can iterate
in all the right ways i can't give you
like the kill shot
say just go to your spouse and say this
sentence and that'll reprogram
so that doesn't work yeah it's sort of a
lengthy process of
iteration etc that said
there are some things which are better
than other things
so i would attack whatever is their
strongest
point that they're that they're married
to
so rather than go through all the things
that they believe just find that one
thing
that they're they're sure is true and
see if you can convince them
on just one thing that something they
thought was
both true and important
isn't true it would be important if it
were true but
it isn't true so do that because
what that does is it allows people to
change their own mind
if you attack all of their belief as as
a whole
like democrats are bad socialism
and that's no good that has no no impact
no impact at all right you gotta you
gotta find a
like a weakness or a specific target
target that thing for destruction you
know a belief
if you have a belief that's really core
to your whole package it doesn't you
know the rest of it doesn't necessarily
fall apart automatically
but if the rest of it you believed in
the same way
that you were certain about the thing
that just got debunked
so if you can take out somebody's
strongest belief
then they can sometimes talk themselves
out of the rest
so that that's a little bit of a
technique but like i said i would not
expect you to
to go forth and you know immediately
deprogram your spouse
it's sort of an interactive long scale
kind of a thing and then
and frankly doesn't even work for most
people no matter how hard you try
scott how about the 11 year old killing
himself on zoom
i do not know about that story but that
might be just about the most horrible
thing i've ever heard
in my whole life that's really bad
um let's
uh a taste of armageddon yes star trek
okay just looking at your comments here
now on both
youtube and periscope
do you see a state reversing after
signature verification
well let me reiterate my prediction
i believe that history will confidently
say
someday not anywhere maybe not this year
maybe not next year but i believe
history will eventually come to believe
that the election
went to trump and he didn't get the job
because the the fake media is so strong
they can just say biden got the job and
everybody will act like it was real
now if you don't think that's real you
might be surprised
the media can simply tell you that a
thing didn't happen
and sixty percent of the country is
going to act like
it didn't happen that's the world we're
in now
so that's that's like an amazing power
that i don't know if they always had
before
but anyway uh somebody says the
uh hydroxychloroquine zelenko study
shows that it has worked all along
well there is a retrospective study
that's newish that is very strong
evidence the hydroxychloroquine with the
azithromycin
and with the zinc as zelenko describes
it
works but it's a retrospective
how much should you believe
retrospective
studies in the comments
show me how smart you are how much
credibility should you put in a
retrospective study
let me answer it this way do you know
why
randomized controlled studies were
invented the reason that science
prefers randomized control studies
is because wait for it wait for it
retrospective studies are not credible
they're useful but they're not credible
does that make sense things can be wrong
now let me put it another way things can
be not credible
but very very useful so if you look at a
retrospective study
and it says very clearly
hydroxychloroquine worked
in the past that doesn't tell you it
works
and if you get fooled into thinking
that's what it told you
well then you don't understand science
because the whole point of science is to
save you
from exactly this kind of mistake
science was invented so you didn't think
retrospective studies were science you
know you could be easily fooled
now so here's the point if the
retrospective study shows that something
looks solid
the credibility you should give it is
zero
but certainly enough credibility to do a
you know controlled study if you can
do it now on top of that let's say it
was impossible to
to do a controlled study randomized
control study
or let's say you don't have enough time
if you don't have the time
or it's just not possible some way then
i would look at the
i would definitely look at the
retrospective study and i would say
well i hate doing this
but it's all i have now at that point
then it becomes a risk
management decision it's not really
about science it's risk management and
you say to yourself
all right if i'm wrong and i take these
meds
and they're not what the retrospective
study says
am i going to die and the answer is nope
they're really safe so as a risk
management decision
if your retrospective study is as strong
as
what dr zelenko says is the case
for this latest information if you don't
have any other information
and you can't get it in time
i would say you're not crazy to use that
as as a decision-making
thing but do it as a risk management not
because you think
science told you it was real all right
um i was once on a
in a randomized controlled study in my
20s
i decided to uh take one for science
and uh i ended up being on the placebo
so that was that's a lot of wasted time
somebody says stop using retrospective
all studies are retrospective okay
if you want to be pedantic all studies
are about something that already
happened
that's that's sort of the point right if
you're done with the study
it's about something that already
happens it's the randomized control part
that is the important part i think
you're telling me
somebody says i was in a few oh cool
and lsd study now i wish
well of course if i was if i were in an
lsd study
you can't do a placebo for that one can
you
there's no way to do a placebo for an
lsd study is there
uh
does the senate hold this is really
interesting
if you go by the pollsters that you know
they're saying that the republicans
should hold but of course it's a weird
year so anything can happen
but i get back to this
if elections are being massively stolen
it's going to happen again how much
transparency do you think there will be
in the ballot counting
if you had to guess let you move your
mind into the future a little bit and
it's after the
senate special election and we know you
know who got the most votes allegedly
after this election are you going to be
saying to yourself
that there were not witnesses sufficient
witnesses in the right places at the
right times
to actually watch the election
are are you going to say to yourself
that looked good
i feel as if they got away with
chasing witnesses away why wouldn't they
do it again
can anybody give me any like
reasoning where if if you assume
that election stealing is possible and
that it happened
give me one reason they wouldn't do it
again now if you're saying to yourself
well scott they're going to be looking
pretty closely now
i mean maybe quite a soft guard last
time but this time
they're really going to be looking
closely what evidence do you have
that we will look closely at this
election the ballot counting or any part
of it
what would suggest that we'll do it
because do you know what people intended
to do
in the general election there were
i don't know what the number is but
let's say tens of thousands of witnesses
and volunteers
hundreds of thousands i don't know
what's the number tens of thousands at
least
were there not tens of thousands of
people
who woke up the morning of election day
and believed
that they were going to do something
called witnessing the vote counting
they all thought it was a thing and it
wasn't
not only did it not happen it turned out
it wasn't much of a thing
that even if they had been allowed to do
whatever they were going to do
they couldn't see everything that needed
to be seen to
eliminate the risk so
uh you know if if tens of thousands of
people
thought they were going to be witnesses
and then they weren't
why would that be different for this
election i can't think of a reason
can you because i think all they have to
do is make sure there are no witnesses
again which looks trivial
this looks pretty easy and they they own
the country
the stakes are through the roof
and they just got away with it days ago
allegedly right so under the assumption
that they did get away with it in the
general election
of course it's going to happen again i
don't know how it could not
of course all right
uh they could not witness the envelopes
yeah that's right they thought they
would be witnesses but indeed
they were not so
that's all for now i will talk to you
tomorrow
and you youtube people let's see if you
have any uh
exciting questions here before i sign
off
uh twenty 000 lawyers at
that's an idea oh my goodness that's a
good idea
let me just toss out this idea it's not
mine i'm seeing it in the
in the comments let me just toss it down
a hundred percent of the witnesses have
to be
attorneys
just think about that suppose you just
make this one change
i don't this may be too late for any of
this yeah it's probably too late
but suppose georgia just said look we're
going to try something
because we have this this issue about
witnesses and we want to be credible
for this election 100 percent
of the witnesses not the belt not the
counters the counters will be just the
normal people
but the witnesses have to be attorneys
do you know why can you imagine trying
to chase a room full of attorneys out of
her room
good luck attorneys are sharks
what what happened was uh mild-mannered
good patriots and citizens you know the
the average person who's just you know
salt of the earth just wants to help
wants nothing except a good election
just just good people
we're sending our ordinary good people
into battle and they got creamed
because it wasn't it wasn't a fair fight
right
the the bullies just had more firepower
now now imagine that all of those just
ordinary good
people who just have good intentions are
replaced

attorneys
do they get bullied out of the room nope
no they do not now attorneys
do not get bullied down at the room and
if they do
none of those votes are going to count
none of those votes are going to count
if you kick a bunch of attorneys who are
witnessing it
out of the room if you have a bunch of
attorneys witnessing it do you get the
blonde lady with the big blonde hair and
people are feeling maybe that she's not
as credible
nope no attorneys
their job are just a little more
credible than the average person so at
least it helps there
now of course you'd have maybe attorneys
on both sides you got that problem
but i would throw an attorney in there
i i wouldn't let any witnesses
have no attorneys with them in the room
you know maybe they don't all have to be
attorneys but
they they certainly ought to have one
and again i don't mean
that the attorney will use some legal
trick
you know to avoid problems i'm saying
that an attorney
doesn't back down because it's just sort
of built into the
you know the framework of what they do
for a living if you
if your attorney backs down that's
pretty bad attorney
so not backing down is sort of built
into the model
all right that's all i got for now
that's actually an interesting idea i
like that
bye for now
