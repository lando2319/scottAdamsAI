good morning everybody
and welcome to the most surprising and
amazing experience of your entire life
some say
it's a highlight of civilization
and they'd be right it's called coffee
with scott adams and it's the only place
you're going to hear
useful stuff
everything else is
pure
fake news but here you're going to get
the good stuff
and uh let's check the headlines is
there anything in the headlines
uh
well if it's true
but it's not
and
if you'd like to take your awareness up
to the highest possible level for today
tomorrow might be a little bit higher
but today
all you need is a copper bug or a glass
a tanker jealous to style the canteen
jug or flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine the other day the
thing that makes everything better
is called the simultaneous sip
go
oh
you know there was a uh
tv show
years ago
uh battlestar galactica
there were two versions of it in the
newer version
there were
artificial beings who were
indistinguishable from
normal beings
unless you had a special test
there'd be a special test to find out
who was human and who was
some form of npc
and you say to yourself wouldn't that be
useful to have now
wouldn't you like to know who among you
are the cylons to use that phrase from
the tv show and who among you are real
people and it turns out that
maybe you don't have access to this tool
but i do
i do
i have an actual tool to determine who
are npcs
they're the people who leave comments in
my twitter feed
to say
something like
well
i didn't know it until now but adams is
the pointy-haired boss
or
what about lasagna on mondays
so i'm going to start uh tagging all of
the npcs that i see today
so i'm just going to do hashtag npc
because they're the ones who have just
the little canned obvious things
so
so when i uh announced the other day on
twitter
that we had entered to phase two
which i had not defined at that time
a lot of people came in and said
well not people npcs and they said how's
phase two going
how's phase two going scott have you
read the news lately
we'll expect your apology because if you
didn't know it
the reporting last night
was that president trump
might have been
storing nuclear weapons secrets
at mar-a-lago ha ha-ha
idiot cartoon boy what do you say about
that what do you say about that cartoon
boy how about that
right we gotcha
gotcha
gotcha
so that's what my evening looked like i
went to bed to that
and i said to myself
i'll probably look into this in the
morning
must be some new news
and then i saw the news
the news
let's talk about the news
have you ever heard of a thing called a
uh what's it called a
wrap up
uh wrap up smear
do you know what a wrap-up smear is
well
tactic it's a self-fulfilling let's have
nancy pelosi
explain it you demonize and then you we
call it the wrap-up smear the wrap-ups
cause a wrap-up smear you smear somebody
smear somebody with falsehoods
falsehoods
and then you merchandise then you
merchandise it and then you write it now
you write it this is reported in the
press
this and this it's in the press now so
they have that validation that the press
reported the smear reported the sphere
it's called the wrap-up smear now i'm
going to merchandise now your
merchandise report on the smear that we
made and it's it's a tactic it's
attached
it's called the wrap up smear
now nancy pelosi was describing
how she believes her opponents use it
but
once you know it's a thing
you kind of see it everywhere
and let's see if we can
identify
a wrap-up smear
in the news today
are there any wrap-up smears happening
right now
that the npcs believe is actual real
news
maybe
because
we woke up to some interesting news but
first let's do this in order
uh a.g garland
went on tv to announce
uh his statement about the raid on
mar-a-lago it turns out he did authorize
it
so that was news
and all the smart people said uh
what are the odds he didn't authorize it
because remember the first story was
trying to make it seem as though
christopher wray authorized it because
he was a trump appointee
see how the fake news works
oh no it was a trump appointee who
authorized it
but it turns out it wasn't
not only was it not
it was you know a obvious democrat
appointee garland
but
they kept that from us for how long like
a day or so
so there's maybe 40 percent of the
public will never hear the correction
and they will always believe that it was
a trump
appointed person who authorized the raid
they'll never hear the correction
so that's the first trick is uh that the
fake news always travels longer than the
correction
so you see that trick
i have a question about who advised
the attorney general garland
to act totally guilty in front of the
public
do you think anybody
gave him that advice
because it looks like he took it
i've never seen anybody act more guilty
than that guy
and you look for the things he doesn't
say right
the things he does say is oh we had this
reason to do it
and
and the reason
because
and he doesn't say because it's a secret
and then he says oh we're going to call
your bluff and we're going to release
the the warrant the part that would just
say what things they were looking for
and then trump says i want it released
too
and then the public says
you don't have it
they handed you a copy
but then you look at the reporting
have you seen what words the reporting
uses
to describe the
let's say allegation
that the trump team has in their
possession the copy of the warrant
now my understanding of the process is
they have to have a copy of it
am i wrong about that
the process pretty much guarantees that
somebody has a copy of it on the trump
side right
but when you look at how the trump
people talk about it
and how the news reports it have you
ever noticed that they never say
they never say there's a confirmation
that trump has a copy like a physical
copy because there was some weird
reporting about
how maybe they showed it to some people
but didn't let them keep it does that
sound that doesn't sound real does it
but that's one of the rumors we heard
lyle says scott's spinning hard
oh lyle
stick around
stick around my npc friend
you might learn something
it's going to get we're going to get
wild here in a minute this is just the
introduction
you haven't seen anything
all right so
the the words that are used about the
warrant being in the hands of the trump
people are things like
they were shown the warrant
shown
now i think i'm making that one up but
if you look at the actual words it's
like
they were presented with a warrant
they showed them the warrant
of course you had to show the warrant
of course it was shown
but you notice all the words are lacking
the retained part
now i believe it was retained if i had
to place a bet i would bet that somebody
on the trump team has a physical copy
but even as of this morning fox news
says they couldn't confirm it
this morning like just an hour ago
fox news says they can't confirm that
the trump team has a physical copy
now i'm pretty sure they do
does anybody believe they don't have a
physical copy from if you're taking it
from a persuasion
perspective
trump is playing this exactly right
because he's being vague about whether
he has the warrant which makes you
wonder if everything was copacetic
so it's actually smart from a persuasion
perspective
you can argue the ethics of anything
here that's that could be your
conversation with yourself
but in terms of effectiveness
trump is doing two really good things
he's being vague about whether they have
the warrant which makes everybody get
excited and then he adds to the
ambiguity
by saying he agrees with the
attorney general and he would like quote
all of the documents released
do you think trump is talking about the
same documents that the attorney general
is talking about
of course not of course not that's how
the trick is played so trump is cleverly
expanding the definition of the
documents
to be beyond what the attorney general
is saying which is just the list of
stuff they're looking for
and then a receipt for the things they
took
which could be slightly different from
what they were looking for
probably is different
but those are the only things that
that garland was talking about
beyond that there's somewhere there's
something called i think the affidavit
right
that is a long description of why they
thought they needed to operate quickly
why they needed a warrant why they
couldn't do it in any other way
that document is surely what trump wants
you to think
is the missing part because it is
missing now the the process itself
keeps that away from the public
so if you didn't know that we're not
allowed to see that and there's a good
reason
because you don't want allegations out
in the public you want to keep that
within the legal system
until something gets you know more
public or more closer to proven
so what trump is saying yeah release it
all
he knows that can never happen
and it will always look like they're
hiding something
and they are
they are hiding something and now
they're hiding it behind a legal
requirement that i agree with
so they have to hide it but i think
they're pretty happy that they're not
showing it to anybody for a variety of
political and practical reasons
so trump's
persuasion approach is pure
i think is pure but pretty good
pretty good now the other the other side
of course is also pure
but we'll talk about how well they're
doing it
pretty good actually
if i'm going to score
the democrats for just persuasion
as opposed to again ethical or moral
treatment same as i did with trump
right you make your own decisions about
the moral or ethical angles it's
politics
right in politics you think your team
can do it and the other team can't so
you know there's nothing to talk about
there
but
um so trump is playing it well uh he's
keeping it alive by not showing you the
warrant which i assume he has a copy of
he's broadening the description of the
documents to include the affidavit which
you know you're never going to see which
will always look sketchy to the public
because the public won't catch the
nuance
that you're not allowed to see that kind
of stuff at this phase of of a legal
process
now
garland having looked perfectly guilty
of
something horrible i but we don't know
what
um got some cover fire today
and did he notice that the cover fire
was exactly the right timing
because just when the news cycle had
turned
desperately bad for the democrats
it looked really bad and garland didn't
fix anything he made it worse
just when it was the darkest it could be
the washington post
tells us that they have two anonymous
sources
anonymous sources
washington post
anonymous sources
so credibility looks good so far
and there's something negative about
trump
anonymous sources
washington post
negative about trump
how would you rank that if you didn't
know anything else
the only thing you knew were those facts
how would you rank the credibility of
that report
well let me tell you how cnn ranked it
cnn is reporting on washington post
reporting
it says we can't confirm it
they can't confirm it
but they can report the out of it
can't they
not only that but here's what these
 do on uh twitter
on twitter where they do the uh the
trending stories and stuff
uh let me let me tell you how twitter
or whoever does that
whoever writes the summary is wrote
here's the summary
um
god damn it do i yeah
or do i
let me look through my own notes there
it is
damn it
oh i guess i don't have that but the uh
the washington
the so the summary on twitter
says that um
that trump
oh here's the summary all right got it
so here's the headline see if the
headline
uh
feels accurate to you here's the
headline
fbi sought classified documents related
to nuclear weapons during the mar-a-lago
search
comma
according to the washington post
do you see what they did
let me read it again see if you can find
the the brainwashing and manipulation
it's just one sentence it's right here
fbi sought classified documents related
to nuclear weapons during mar-a-lago
search comma
according to the washington post
according to the washington post
now is it according to the washington
post or is it according to two anonymous
people that the washington post talked
to
well both
but i think if you leave out the
anonymous part that means something and
if you put the according to at the end
of the sentence instead of the start of
the sentence it's completely different
imagine this
imagine just rewording the same sentence
according to the washington post
only
according to the washington post only
uh trump was you know had access to
nuclear weapons secrets or something at
mar-a-lago now if you put the source
first it debunks the story before you
read it if you put the source last
you you accept the story because it's in
the news
it's the news it's headline
so you read the news and then your brain
just turns off after the according to
because do you care
it's like according to somebody
important all right so it must be true
so last night all the people who don't
know how to consume news
were trying to dance on my grave and
insist on my apology and they couldn't
wait to get here this morning because
i'm gonna be eating some crow because it
turns out the least credible source in
the solar system
said something that might be bad for my
side
so they're pretty happy the npcs are
just
have you ever seen npcs dancing
it's disgusting it's like a lane from
seinfeld just all of them
sort of like that that's what they're
doing today
anyway let's uh dissect their diabolical
plan
so i tweeted today
where we're heading
so here's what's definitely gonna happen
so the bad guys i'm gonna call the bad
guys the fake news purveyors right so
the bad guys are all the democrats and
the fake news people who are supporting
them
so here's where we're going so the bad
guys are going to claim that uh because
it's coincidentally
and this is a
this is really lucky for the democrats
pretty coincidental
that the thing that they say
or not they but two anonymous sources as
they do the wrap up smear
so you see the wrap-up smear
so the way nancy pelosi explained how
it's done
is if somebody makes a claim
this would be the two anonymous sources
that is reported in the news the
washington post and then the cnn reports
cnn reports that washington post is
reporting it and by the time you see it
in cnn
you've lost
the anonymous source part maybe
and and
basically it just turns into something
that looks true
now if you go over to fox news they
won't be reporting it
and here's a good bs filter if both fox
news and cnn say something is true it's
probably true for example
did the fbi enter mar-a-lago looking for
documents
fox news reports it yes
cnn reports that yes you could probably
depend that that actually happened
right
if
if cnn reports that washington post
reports that there might have been
nuclear
weapons secrets in mar-a-lago
but fox news does not report it
is it true
it could be
but probably not
right if you're going to play the odds
something that's reported as
true on one and untrue on the other
is probably
fake
now the hunter laptop story is a notable
exception
but if you get if you get either one of
your uh entities saying that something
is fake it's probably fake
so actually the laptop story does work
because fox news always said it was true
and
the other side said it was fake but they
had such an obvious
um the 50 intelligence people were
obviously lying so that was an operation
so
that was an exception i guess
all right so here's how you uh do
a hoax
first you get your anonymous sources
check
then you make sure that the timing of
your fake story is just perfect
this was perfect timing because garland
had just failed
january 6 hearings had completely failed
the you know basically everything that
they asserted had failed including the
fbi raid so they were at their deepest
hole
and just in time
just in time an anonymous report
which we call the wrap up smear
appears
so now the wrap up smear is in full
effect
perfectly timed and one of the tells for
it being fake news is
a little too perfect
if you were going to make up a story to
make
to make trump look bad
imagine a different topic
what would be worse
uh trump has the
secret ufo files in his
mar-a-lago
i'm not even sure i'd care i get that
it's top secret but
i don't know i would just think that was
funny
if i heard he had the the ufo secret
files
or how about this is actually a true
thing the the united states was once
involved in actual research to see if
there were any psychics
that they might be able to weaponize
that's a real thing so somewhere there
are documents about that
what if you for what if you heard that
was the secret documents he had
again it might be important if if it
turns out there are any real psychics
i suppose
but you would just laugh at that
wouldn't you
you just think it was funny
almost yeah what if it was like the the
jfk
you know assassination secrets you would
just laugh at it
almost anything else you can think of
you'd probably laugh it off it's like
yeah that's secret but yeah
if they told you he had troop you know
troop movements or military readiness
stuff in his files what would be the
first thing you think
why
why would he have that
why would you want to keep it
if somebody asks for it back why would
he give it to him
now take that to the nuclear weapon
secret
imagine this conversation and then you
tell me this really happened
i'm going to give you a really on this
okay
uh hello this is
this is the biden administration
uh we have good information that you
have in your files
uh sensitive nuclear weapons stuff
can we get that back
and then whoever where they were talking
to said no no no no
we like to keep the nuclear weapons
secrets in a in a
mildly secure place here in mar-a-lago
really
really
do you think
do you think that the trump
administration and trump in particular
had been informed that he had in his
possession
nuclear weapons
secrets
in a not secure location
and that he decided to not give them
back
that's the story we're hearing
that they knew what the documents were
and that they knew where they were and
what it was about
and they told the trump people and then
the trump people said no
we're going to keep those nuclear
weapons secrets right in our storage
room here in mar-a-lago that's what
we're going to do
can we all
can you play along with me
give me a really on this
really
really
really you asks for your nuclear secrets
back
and trump said uh oh
i'm keeping you your nuclear secrets
really
really
that's actually what they're trying to
sell us today
the some version of that actually
happened
really and let me say if you're
believing this story
based on the 10 hoaxes that the
democrats have played that follow the
same pattern
if you're not using this one as your
as your hoax identification filter
you're missing a great show
this one they're signaling way in
advance
they're telling you here's a play
we're running an op
it's going to look like all of other
other fake news ops and here's the
playbook
it's going to be here's the playbook
anonymous sources perfectly timed the
story is too on the nose which is what
makes people believe it really
it's not going to be confirmed by the
reporting they'll amplify here's the
real trick they're going to do a lot of
if it's true reporting
well if it's true that trump has nuclear
weapons secrets
if it's true that he wouldn't give back
the nuclear secrets if it's true that he
was planning to sell them to a foreign
adversary i'm not saying it's true but
if it's true if it's true if it's true
if it's true until their idiot npc base
stops hearing if
if will disappear after a while
all they're going to do is turn on the
news and hear something about trump had
nuclear secrets and wouldn't give them
back
that's all they're going to hear
and they're going to believe it
all right
so we're into the amplified if it is
true stage but what is the final stage
what's the final stage of the
uh
the wrap-up smear
the final phase always looks the same
someday you'll find out that it was fake
and it will be too late
just like the mueller report so you
could call it the mueller report phase
where you find out the whole thing was a
hoax
but it's so deeply embedded in the mind
of the public
that the hoaxers can say
but we proved it was true
and then you say
well you actually proved there was no
russia collusion
well look at all this russian
interference no we were talking about
russia
collusion as in trump colluding with
russia
that's not russian interference
yeah nice try nice try i go nice try
are you saying those are not different
topics
one is russia interfering in a trivial
way every year like they always do every
election
and the other is
a presidential candidate
colluding with a dictator
against the united states
those are not close
what about manafort
okay again
yeah if manafort showed some internal
polling stuff
to a russian which probably had no value
whatsoever to the russian
and that was bad and he went to jail for
it
but none of that is trump colluding
what about the troll farm
yeah again the troll farm is not
collusion
that would be russian interference at a
very very small scale
like always
what about what about russia hacking the
emails like like trump asked
there's no evidence of that at all
your government told you that they
caught somebody right
would you believe the government when
they told you they caught the hacker
that is not even slightly believable
we don't have a government that tells us
the truth about that kind of stuff
not even close
so it might be true
but we don't have a government you could
believe about that kind of stuff i mean
that's exactly the stuff they lie about
anyway
so in the final phase
we'll find out it was all and a
wrap-up smear but by then it'll be too
late
and i want to do some of this uh
so even the midas touch what uh twitter
feed
already started the the what if was
donald trump trying to sell intelligence
about our nuclear weapons to foreign
adversaries
what if
what if
uh i i wanted to tweet my own what if
today
it goes like this
is joe biden a human being or an
abandoned bird's nest
what if he's an abandoned bird's nest
and he got elected president what if
what if we have an abandoned bird's nest
as a president what if
all right
there's a lot of fun stuff happening
today
um i love the fact that even cnn doesn't
believe the washington post report
but they um so here's how cnn
launders the fake news
so who is cnn let's see if you can guess
this before i tell you
so cnn hears this washington post report
there's two anonymous sources and even
cnn knows that's
right
don't you think that the professionals
of cnn the actual news people
don't you think jake tapper looked at
two anonymous sources in the washington
post at exactly the right time
do you think jake tapper thought oh
that's true
my guess is he thought it might be true
because anything might be true these
days but do you think he bought that
no
no no i think whatever you want to say
about jake tapper and i'll just use him
as an example he's very smart
he's very experienced
he knows what real news looks like and
he knows what the fake stuff looks like
you know maybe not 100 agreement with
what my opinion is but he knows what it
looks like for the most part
and two anonymous reports from the
washington post with a long history of
fake news
that doesn't look real
because the timing and the perfect
nature of it etc
so the cnn has this problem they would
love to report the story
but it doesn't pass even their own sniff
test so
who do they assign the story to
go
who is cnn do they assign the story to
if the news people know it's
um
let's say for writing
i i guess i should have said for writing
not for on-screen on-screen
selter yes stilter
but an opinion what opinion person would
they assign to it
so liza somebody says
i've told you this so many times
it's stephen collinson
yeah stefan collison apparently is the
one who will say anything
if it's reported in any way
he's going to run with it now he's not
saying i don't think he's saying it's a
fact
but
i don't think you could get a news
person to touch this story except to
report that it's being reported
but if you want to like give it a little
life
you know make it seem like there's a
little more substance to it you give it
to stephan collinson because he'll write
anything apparently
i can't read his mind but if i look at
his work
all of the sketchiest stuff comes from
the same guy
right if it's completely speculative
or it's already been debunked or there's
a major piece of context missing
who do they give it to
stephen collinson
so you should recognize that name
because when you see him writing about
it but it's not being reported by the
news people even as true
that's that's a tip off
so get to know the actual individuals
you know if if you thought that maggie
haberman was a source of actual news
you need to learn who the players are
right
there are some people who are more close
to a punch line
if if they bring carl bernstein on
to say something is worse than watergate
you shouldn't take any of that seriously
that's just the punchline
that's closer to a joke than it is to
news
all right
um
rasmussen is reporting that the
the generic republican versus the
generic democrat for the midterms is
down to a three percent advantage
for republicans now a three percent
advantage in a generic race
i feel like there's basically no
difference because i don't think these
polls are accurate enough to pick up a
three-point difference you've got eight
percent or undecided
who are probably not undecided
so
basically it looks like a tie
going into the election
so i'm not entirely sure why so people
are so sure it's going to be a red wave
except that it feels like it
stefan collusion that's pretty funny
um yeah
so i wouldn't i would feel a little bit
concerned if i were republican thinking
that this election is going to be easy
and it'll be a red sweep i don't see it
in the data
hello youtube you back
um
interesting having a little trouble on
youtube
uh do you want to bet that this stream
will be difficult to download
how much you want to bet
so there are some topics which when i do
them on youtube it seems like there's a
coincidence that it has technical
problems and it's hard to download and
stuff like that
i feel like
i feel like this is one of those cases
because this is one of those cases that
completely changes civilization
and i am the strongest voice on this
topic
let me say it again
this question of the mar-a-lago
documents
is the most important question in
civilization because it will determine
whether trump becomes president or not
probably i mean
i'm making a lot of assumptions here
that that's going to be the biggest
factor but it might be the biggest
factor in in the world
right now
and i am literally the strongest voice
persuading it
persuading you to understand that it's
 so what are they going to do to
me
you should expect
that the the fury that's coming after me
will be heightened today
now i'm going to tag everybody as an npc
that comes after me with a cartoon joke
or
tries to dismiss me because my stepson
situation or something like that so i'm
going to do hashtag npc and all those
so later today if you want to you know
search for the hashtag npcs you can see
how similar their comments are
they're completely uncreative
you can also see i'm hashtagging a lot
of them with artists
the number of failed writers who are
coming after me today
it's really hilarious
so i try to call them out when i can and
even the ones who don't say the writers
it looks like they are
yeah you can tell there's a an
indication that they're trying to be a
writer
yeah
so failed writers
um
and npcs are all coming after me today
so watch that show now let me ask you
this
could you do what i'm doing
have you ever spent any time looking at
the social media reaction i get
the the number of people who
come after me personally and very
very personal
so every day i get to read
that somebody thinks i killed my own
stepchild through neglect or something
every day every day i get somebody to
tell me that i killed my own stepchild
could you could you do that
it's hard right but i can
and you know why i'm doing it for you
because i'm doing this basically for you
because i can
because i can
if you could
i would damn well expect you to do it
right
if you could do what i'm doing
you could debunk these things at the
gigantic personal risk at a huge expense
do you know how much this cost me
you have no idea how expensive this is
this is tens of millions of dollars this
cost me personally
tens of millions
that's how much i would have made if i'd
never talked about trump
like the extra amount it completely
devastated
you know my entire business model so
could you do that
you could not
most of you could not and i wouldn't
even ask you to because it would be too
too much to ask but i could do it
so it's sort of like
you know jumping on the hand grenade
thing
sometimes you're the hero because you
jumped on the hand grenade and you you
saved the platoon
but here's the question that must be
asked
wouldn't it have been the closest person
to the hand grenade
maybe the entire platoon would have been
willing to jump on the hand grade
but there was only one person close so
the closest person jumped on it died and
saved the platoon
i feel like i'm just the closest person
to the hand grenade
i feel like if you were in my position
you would do what i'm doing
and you would take you would also
you would take the expense
and you would take the hit
because
you could
so in this scenario if you could do it
you would
do
do you know there's a movie out about
the
um the rescue of those people who are
trapped in the underwater cave
i don't know i don't remember the full
details but there was one part where a
experienced diver
did something
almost impossible like went through this
you know tunnel cave
you know just the deadliest thing you
could possibly imagine and saved
everybody
now
what do you say about that person
the reason that person did it do you
think they wanted to
yeah do you think the person who rescued
him wanted to sign up for that
job
no
that person did it because one reason
one reason
because he could
because he could
that's very powerful
because he could
once you find yourself in that situation
that you know you're the only one who
can do it
you just have to
you know you can get kel the hero
because you did it
but the fact is you don't have a choice
if you think i feel like i have a choice
i really don't
like it doesn't feel optional i feel
like i have to do it because
i can
and that's it that's the whole story
i'm an american
i'm a citizen of earth
i'm a human being
i live with other citizens who i
appreciate and value
then you put me in this situation
what am i going to do
i don't have a choice
i'm going to do this
now to be fair
if it were the difference between i'm
going to starve
or do this i'd probably eat
[Laughter]
i don't want to leave you with the
impression that there's something
special about me but the entire the
entire point of it is that it's not
special
i'm in a coincidental unique situation
but it's not special it's just sort of
coincidence that i could do this and get
away with it and you can't
well i don't really get away with it i
just don't get completely crushed by it
so that's the situation i deserve
in my opinion i don't deserve any kudos
for taking a risk on your behalf
because
because you would do it for me
that's what i believe
and and really that's what keeps society
together right
the reason that i might stop and pull
you out of a burning truck
is because you'd do it for me
i don't need a better reason
do i
do you need a better reason you do it
for me
right i'll do it for you that's it
all right
same as trump well i don't know maybe
i mean trump does fall into the category
if he's the only one who can do it
yeah there's very much that going on and
you wonder how much that matters to him
you know i i feel like
um
i feel like
what trump's doing we kind of owe him
something in return do you ever feel
like that
because even though i get you know he's
he's a you know
egomaniac you know i get that he likes
the attention i get that he's doing it
for personal reasons
i get that
but the way he's doing it feels like
some of that is for us
it feels like it i feel like he thinks
the fight is real
as much as there is on both
sides and a lot of it is
but i think he thinks the fight is real
that's what i think
and can you imagine anything smarter
than retiring
all trump had to do was start a media
empire
he could have completely redeemed his
brand
completely
and i think he knows it
but he needed to do this
now he you know is compatible with his
ego if he wins
but i think he i think he also feels
like there's something he needed to do
that's what i feel
but can't read his mind so we're only
guessing
will our country burn when trump runs
scott's subtext is always please kill me
what
so watching the the npcs go crazy today
so watch that we'll make them part of
the show i guess keith olbermann is
keith olbermann is tweeting the aza show
today
in which the award for worst person in
the world
is down to charlie kirk and me
so that's why i've designated keith
olbermann as my mascot
and i would recommend to you to watch my
mascot show
and find out if i win or charlie kirk
wins
for worst person in the world i have a
feeling it's going to be a tie
i don't know
i feel it's going to be a tie
all right
and i have my my esg jokes are coming
would you like a preview
um too bad you're only going to see them
on locals
so i'm going to show the locals people
what uh dilbert comics are upcoming
they're not completed yet
i can't show them on
on the
youtube
but i will show them to the subscription
service they'll get to see them later
today now they won't be drawn so you're
just going to see the writing so you'll
see what's coming
so and
i use them to help me write
yeah you know i really hope i hope that
uh the story about the possible nuclear
secrets
i hope that we get 50
current and former intelligence agency
professionals to say that there really
were nuclear secrets there
because that would really
that would sell it
or would that be more proof that is
all right
have you also noticed that when they
speak about the nuclear weapons secrets
they say
related to
have you caught that
related to
nuclear weapons
give me an example of some things that
are related to nuclear weapons i'll go
first
let me write a personal note to kim
jong-un
and kim jong-un
dear
kim jong-un
thank you for your nice notes i hope to
see you someday
the united states
has many nuclear weapons but we would
like to not direct them at you
maybe we should talk and we could have
all of our nuclear weapons
maybe not pointed toward each other
because i would like to be your friend
sincerely donald trump
is that document
related to nuclear weapons
it is
it totally is
you see the trick
i do believe that they will be able to
demonstrate that there's something in
there about kim jong-un
see where i'm going
anything that trump said to kim jong-un
that we don't know about
is very likely to include a reference to
what we will or will not do with our
nuclear arsenal
am i right
he may have even made an offer
he may have said and yeah i'm just
speculating but suppose
he said something like you know we would
turn our weapons off you know if you do
the same
and that's something that nobody would
want out right that would be that would
be a top suit secret
nuclear weapons related document
and it would also be a big nothing
so here's the thing
that i would look for the most obvious
way this is going to go
is that there will be something that's
related to nuclear weapons
how much you want to bet there's at
least something in there that they can
argue is
related
do you know how the russian interference
is
related
to russian collusion
but it's not the same thing
it's just sort of related and so that's
how they can say later well we told you
there was russia collusion because here
we proved the russia interference
and you go well those are different
topics
and then later
we're going to find out that there was a
let's say a personal letter to kim
jong-un
and they're going to say well there it
is
there's your nuclear weapons related
document right there
because what was the entire conversation
about
nuclear war
the conversation with kim jong-un all of
it is about nuclear weapons even if it's
not it's all about nuclear weapons
because that was the thing we cared
about
right so you don't think that there's
going to be something in there that's
related
yeah they're going to say that it was in
there because it was something related
or
0.2
they're going to say
it was confirmed
because adam schiff saw it in this
gif so we took those documents that we
found at mar-a-lago and we put them in
the skiff
that's the place that you can go look at
them but you can't take a copy
right so the skiff is like a top secret
facility that you could put wherever you
need it i think there was one actually
at mar-a-lago so you put it in the skiff
and then you put shift in the skiff
so you gotta put a shift in the skiff
and then shift
will tell you some
that he supposedly learned when he put
schiff in the skiff
so it's a shift skiff
kind of a play
and then the other people who are in the
shift will say
uh we didn't see anything like that we
looked at the same document you did and
to say that that's related to nuclear
weapons is such a stretch that is closer
to a lie
and what will
schiff
say oh it's right there i saw it with my
own eyes
and how many times will we have seen
schiff say he saw something with his own
eyes or that indictments were coming or
that the law had been broken and they
have the proof
only to later find out none of it was
even close to true
completely beta
so shift skiff is the next
is the next phase look for shifts gift
 shifts gift shift skip
and that's how the left will come to
believe
that that uh trump did in fact have
nuclear weapons related
stuff just they like they believe that
russian interference proves that there
was russian collusion
so
imagine if the government had a uh
a department of word smithing
i think trump should create a
cabinet position for defining words the
old way
like every time the democrats try to
tell you that a word doesn't mean like a
raid doesn't mean a raid and
all this you just go to well let's let's
check with the cabinet
and then somebody comes out preferably
be like wearing a long robe so they look
official and they say
the definition of raid is as follows and
has not been recently changed and then
you say well there it is
the the department of definitions has
said that
your definition of a raid is incorrect
your definition of related to
collusion is incorrect
yes this shifts in this test if if you
put shift in the skiff
you don't want to sniff what comes out
so you don't want a sniff of of shift in
the skiff that's for sure
and if
shift were to
take a in the skiff
you wouldn't want to sniff that
so
i i think
i maybe added material here
i may be completely done and it took me
a moment to realize it myself
apparently i'm completely out of
material
comedy gold
yes dr seuss would love me
all right i'm going to open it up on
youtube for npc comments
go
with the npcs
please show up i'll read or read you
their comments as they come
i know you're coming don't hide don't be
shy
don't be shy
come on
come on
come on
come on clock come on npcs come on
let's go
what are you hiding
it seems like all the npc's have
suddenly disappeared well you got really
quiet
yeah where are you now
all gone
where are all the people saying but but
you're like the pointy hair boss
i used to like dilbert
but this guy
this guy
so there was
somebody who listed themselves as a
lawyer
who came at me on twitter
with just personal insults about what a
horrible person i am
and i had to ask because it was a lawyer
right somebody who actually is good with
words and
understands complicated things and so i
thought well i can finally get an answer
to a question i've wondered
and i tweeted back and i said what is
your motivation
like what is the motivation for coming
on twitter
and making a personal insult to me
without any regard to
my point of view or politics or factual
anything just a a pure
horrible comment about me as a person
and do you know his answer was his
motivating
feeling
his answer was disgust
in other words disgust
with me in my opinions now the part that
he's disgusted then is never my actual
opinion
he's disgusted with something he
imagined i said or imagined i believe
not anything i actually said
but think about that
he actually said his motivation was
discussed
imagine that being your operating system
that you're going through life
and when something disgusts you
that becomes your activating trigger
do you know what activates me
good stuff
or trying to solve a problem
so i get activated by trying to solve a
problem that's like a real problem or i
get activated to do something fun
oh i'd like to do that i'm totally into
that
but here was somebody who admitted
being activated to actually go act
based on disgust
being a motivating force
how do you go through life
being motivated by disgust
even if you even if you say i'm worthy
of the disgust
let's say he's right
let's say i'm disgusting
why did he need to tweet at me
would i not be just as disgusting if he
tweeted or not was he fixing it was it
entertainment
because he didn't say it was
entertainment he said he was operating
on disgust and the thing is
i don't know that he was wrong about
that
i think maybe it actually was the
motivating factor if you look at a lot
of the other comments
the people who are the most angry about
me are
what class of people are the most angry
at me today artists yeah
people who are not successful enough
at their jobs and they don't think that
the guy who does a comic strip
should have gotten all the money and
success they did because hey it's just a
stupid comic strip and so is garfield
and garfield isn't high art so therefore
mine isn't so therefore why aren't they
more successful
well they're not smart enough but that's
another story
yeah so the the artist
definitely have disgust
the artists when they see me they are
disgusted because
i project
some level of success
which really bugs you if you don't have
it i've been in that position
i i guarantee you that before i was
successful as a writer
i'm sure i said horrible things about
people who were
i don't remember any specific examples
but i'm not above it it's sort of a
natural
instinct right to
to have some bad feelings about somebody
who succeeded that's why
the kardashians get so much love and so
much hate
the hate part is the disgust
but the disgust is driven by the
contrast with somebody doing well
and how somebody feels about themselves
so if somebody's disgusted
by the way i present an opinion
it's almost certainly not about me
exactly it's more about something
they're struggling with
so
if you see somebody who's operating out
of disgust they're almost certainly
coming from some dark place
right
uh and then the npcs can just say
whatever is the most obvious thing to
say
so in every situation you say to
yourself what's the most obvious thing
to say
if a cartoonist that you don't know from
any other context
says something in politics that you
don't like what's the most obvious
response
or go back to comics comic boy
oh
and then make a joke about some
unrelated comic like oh it's
are you done writing kathy
are you done writing
dunesberry which one are you
the least creative
yeah it's the soylent green garfield
people
i call you baldi
here's another here's an npc
not really other successful people look
at you as a weirdo chasing clout it's
pointless what you do is pointless
is it pointless
why would so many people
come to insult me if it's pointless like
it's doing something
but you don't think that
teaching people how to
read the news
more efficiently is useful
just just imagine that point that it's
pointless
yeah
you just prove there's a point
yeah yeah yeah okay
scott's waking up okay now i know that's
a joke so i won't be mad at you anymore
oh i've got 3 000 people watching me on
youtube is that a record holy
yeah it looks like it's a record
audience today
so
but no more npcs you don't want to make
yourself known
you know it's funny that anybody would
make a comment about somebody using
social media
and say that it's pointless
it's also weird
when
people criticize me for what i state i'm
doing
so so here's somebody who says that i'm
chasing clout
that's what i tell you i'm doing
don't i haven't i said that directly
lots of times
i've told you that if i reach a million
followers on twitter i can run the world
i'm very clearly and intentionally and
publicly and transparently chasing clout
i want more of it
because i can do i can do more stuff
is there somebody who wants less clout
is there somebody who's chasing uh
ineffectiveness
is there somebody who wakes up in the
morning man i would like to have less
impact on the world today
if there's things that need to be fixed
i don't want to be anywhere near that
give me away from things that need to be
fixed don't need any clout
no of course i'm trying to get clout
as much as possible
yeah you you're gonna have to come up
with a much better insult
so here here let me tell you the insults
i got yesterday
a bunch of people telling making
reference to my comic strip
one of the most successful comic strips
in the history of comics
other people
pointing out that i have a history of
having wild experiences with women who
are beautiful and much too young for me
no
stop saying these mean things about me
but my favorite is somebody who tweeted
my own selfie
uh to insult me
to which i thought
well i'm the one who tweeted that
i wanted you to see that
because i wrote a book about fitness i
mean there's a chapter in there about
fitness so
if you write a book about how to become
fit
and how to have a good diet you better
take off your shirt
am i wrong
if you're an author
and you have a book out right now
that purports to tell you a system for
losing weight and being fit
take off your shirt
if you don't take off your shirt
nobody's going to buy your book they
shouldn't
you got to show your work
so of course i tweeted this
so my critics are showing me my own very
fit body this was taken in my late 50s
which would be impressive for anybody in
their late 50s i can't do this right now
by the way
my abs don't look like that right now
but my my upper chest and shoulders are
much bigger than this picture
so i kind of moved my emphasis from
from abs i just wanted to see if i could
develop abs so during this phase i was
just sort of seeing if i could do it
but people seem to prefer arms and
shoulders and chest
by people i mean women
so i moved my emphasis to you know upper
upper chest and starting to get some
benefits
yeah so
focusing on shoulders that's correct
all right uh
and erica says you're an old man taking
off his shirt geraldo
npc
all right so that was an npc trap so the
trap here was that if i tell you about
taking off my shirt
and npc will make a geraldo comment
what is the most obvious thing you could
say about an older male
showing off his shirtless profile is the
most obvious thing right so that's how
you spot the npcs they can't go beyond
the most obvious comment
i could do this all day long and and
attract it in pc
so uh yeah the geraldo comment is just
the most obvious thing and what about
when you're talking about the safe and
mar-a-lago
if you talk about the safe at mar-a-lago
and you're the 9 millionth person to say
but what if geraldo could open that safe
that's probably an npc however if you
were the first person to say it
or you thought you were that was pretty
good
it was a good call back
but if you're the millions person to say
it
npc
um
i should shelve my ideas
oh yeah and also the putin the putin on
a horseback
yeah the most obvious comments
it looks like ai has given me some
muscles
there's a funny picture of me
with a fake body over on locals
alex berenson twitter news
what's happening with alex berenson did
he get back on twitter
or is he suing them which is it
um
can somebody tell me what's the alex
berenson story
both
he's back on twitter and easter
interesting
the government asked twitter to ban
berenson what
what
what
are you serious
the white house emailed twitter to ban
him what
are you kidding me
you're you're serious
oh my god
oh my god
now which white house
which which white house did that
was that biden
that was biden
um
wow
i'm blown away okay i'm gonna have to
follow up on this because i'm i'm
reacting to a first impression i don't
know what the actual story is
but so let me give you my my baseline i
don't think that alex berenson
um was right
about a lot of what he said
i don't believe he was right
uh i do believe he was useful
meaning that i kind of appreciate
there's somebody out there making a
strong case
for an alternative that you don't want
to forget about
you know the strong cases that the
experts were wrong or lying
and we live in a world where if you
don't think about that every moment
you're going to get in trouble
so you need somebody like a berenson all
the time
that yeah if you didn't have a
berenstain you'd have to invent one
because you need one you need somebody
telling you every minute this could be a
lie
i think they're just lying it's just
 don't believe the data the
data's wrong
because that little voice in your head
is really useful
that said i don't think he got the right
answers
in a number of situations
but
the fact that if this is true that uh
that the white house was involved in
banning him
uh
i'm on his side completely
that that if that's true so i'm going to
wait to find out it's true but if it's
true that the government was trying to
shut him down
i don't care that i thought most of what
he said was wrong
and i'm completely on his side at that
point
all right
let's uh talk about something else and
uh i'm gonna talk to the locals people
in a minute but youtube thanks for
joining
biggest crowd ever
i hope i didn't disappoint probably was
the best live stream you've ever seen
probably
bye for now
