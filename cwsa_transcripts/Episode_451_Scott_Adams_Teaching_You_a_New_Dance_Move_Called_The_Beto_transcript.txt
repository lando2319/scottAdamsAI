[Music]
hey everybody come on in
here you know it's not every day that I
teach you a valuable skill but this is
one of those days this is a bonus
Periscope in which I will teach you the
new dance graze called the
Betto now you may have heard of uh Betto
oror
looks like he's running for
president and he's really the originator
of this dance um I'm just the instructor
so I don't want any credit for it please
don't give me credit for this but I
wanted to show you how to do this dance
called the bet now the first thing you
need to do is you have to wear the right
um dance outfit uh here you see me watch
wearing the most boring buttondown shirt
I possibly can you can't see this but
it should be it should be tucked
in all right now if you can't get a
button- down
shirt uh a a good substitute would be a
sweater that your wife bought you so
either a sweater that your wife bought
you or a boring button- down shirt
tucked in that would be your your dance
outfit and now if you get that you're
ready for the
moves it's important to loosen up Lo
loosen up shoulders loose now
forward you got to get the
right lankiness so you make make sure
you got a lot of a lot of looseness
going forward all right and now here are
the moves I'm going to I'm going to give
them to you slowly and then I'll put
them all together you ready first one is
shooting shoot shoot shoot and you want
to go way out don't go like this
that's not dancing this is not dancing
that's not dancing this is
dancing all right so that's shooting
then there's a next move called the
mime all right so you've got the
shooting and the mime we're going to put
it all together in a minute and you've
got the left-handed
shooting it looks a lot like
this except it's the other hand
shooting and then he's got when he talks
about let's say deficits and crime he
likes to say bring it down bring it down
bring it down all right maybe sometimes
two hands bring it down bring it down
and then the patented bet uh love
yourself which goes like this now I'm
going to put it all together you might
want to play along at home
and it goes like this shoulders ready
shoulders ready shoot shoot shoot mine
mine mine shoot shoot shoot bring it
down bring it down love yourself love
yourself shoot shoot shoot mine mine
mine shoot shoot shoot bring it down
bring it down love
yourself got it
now if you've mastered that move and I'm
sure you have by
now um let's talk about another really
interesting thing that's happening in
the
news uh which is you saw the vote that
the Senate has uh turned
down the bill um for that would have
supported the president's uh
executive order is that the right way to
say it anyway we've gotten to the point
where the president is going to have to
veto the um they're G have to veto the
uh Senate bill so that he can keep his
executive
order
now here's the interesting thing about
it the Republicans wanted to accomplish
two things they wanted to get the wall
funded but they also did not want to
give presidents new powers by setting a
precedent that an executive order can
affect the budgets but there were two
things that seemed to be
impossible to get at the same time you
know how did how did you how do you
avoid set setting the president and also
get the money they didn't have a way to
do that so what they did is the most
clever thing they a dozen or so I think
it was a dozen of the Senators
Republicans decided to vote against it
so a dozen or a dozen Republicans
basically voted against the
president but it was probably the people
who have the best chance of getting
reelected in other words it probably
won't hurt them and it looks like
they're making a stand on conscience and
supporting the Constitution so this is
that rare case where voting against the
president probably isn't going to cost
you much but here's what's fun if you're
worried about the president what's weird
about funding the border is that
everybody wants it Democrats want it
Republicans want it they all think
border security is important and if you
ask them how is the best way to do it I
believe both Democrats and Republicans
would say let's ask the experts and once
the experts have weighed in we'll fund
it so this is a weird situation to use
an executive order because it would be
hard to recreate this situation how
often do you find a situation where the
Congress is on the same side and still
can't pass a bill that's very rare right
normally they would have to be on
opposite sides but it's only this rare
situation of President Trump where for
political reasons they just can't let
him have anything so they can't even
agree with their own opinions if it
gives Trump a a victory so what exactly
is the precedent that's being set
and I would argue that the president is
in one sense the president is that the
executive order is is gaining more power
which means that the presidents of the
future will have more
power but there's something specific
about this
precedent and the precedent is that both
sides want what the executive order will
order yeah there's a small difference on
you know the amount some differences
maybe on their preferred method but they
would all like border security and they
would all like to largely follow what
the experts say is the smartest thing to
do so they're not really that far off so
if the presid the president is that the
president can override a constipated
Congress where everybody's on the same
page let's put some money toward border
security that should be the president so
the president is that the president the
president can use the executive order
when everybody's on the same
side it's how about that being the
president because when's that ever going
to happen again and if it does happen
again and it happens with a different
president different president let's say
there's a Democrat
president and and for whatever reason we
get the same situation where the
Republicans and the Democrats don't
really disagree but they're still
fighting each other for political
reasons would you care if that future
president said look we all want exactly
the same thing or close enough to the
same thing I'm just going to do
it um now the you know the veto could be
overridden if the Congress voted in in
larger amount I guess two-thirds or
whatever to override it but in a
situation where people weren't on the
same
side you would probably quite easily get
the two-thirds vote to limit the
executive order if it was again
something about money so I'm not
entirely sure that the that the
Republicans didn't do one of the most
clever moves you will ever see it looks
like they put the safest Senators
forward the ones who tend to vote on
principle a little bit more than the
others you know then you throw in Romney
just because you know he's Romney um
so I I feel like they they thread the
needle where they created a very narrow
precedent which is what they cared about
at the same time they can say well we
voted against it those those ones that
did the others can say we did everything
we could do to get funding for the
Border it's kind of starting to look
like one of the smartest things I've
ever seen like assuming it was organized
Now by organized I mean somebody's
counting votes you know did Mitch
McConnell and some of the people who
voted against the president did they
talk about it and did they say look
we're gonna you know a dozen people
voting against him prevents the
president it it shows that there's
resistance it shows that the Republicans
are not trying to take over the world
that we have um we have principled
resistance even within the Republicans
uh We've made a stand for the
Constitution it's a lot of good
stuff right it's it's not too hard to
defend any of this so maybe it was just
a happen stance maybe it was luck maybe
nobody planned anything maybe they're
all just pursuing their own
self-interest but it's weird that they
hit on exactly the right
formula which is voting against the
president but not in a high enough
number that it could get overturned it
it feels like that's exactly where they
want it to be
so um you've got that going
on um does anybody have a good nickname
for
bet I'm I'm very entertained watching
CNN and folks uh who are
anti-trumpers uh becoming anti- BOS he
is getting roasted on
CNN um so he made he made that
cringeworthy comment that he was born
for this
that he was Bor he was born to run for
president and that's a real bad look if
you're a Democrat and you're and you're
you're a good-look white
guy uh it was probably it probably you
know removed any chance he had of
getting elected but you know that that's
one of those cases where he clearly
didn't mean it that way you know there
there's no real chance I don't think I
don't think there's any chance that when
Bo said that he was thinking in terms of
you know I'm a white guy so it's my
destiny to be president or something uh
I can't for a minute believe that that's
the case you I can't read his mind but
that would be hard hard to believe um
the the ordinary way to say that is that
you think you're well suited for it and
it's just a turn of turn of the phrase
that was poorly executed so I don't
think there's anything real there but
it's he's attracted the wrong kind of
yeah uh was it Kennedy or somebody on on
Fox News who came up with beta beta
odor I don't think that's the right
nickname so here's some persuasion uh
some persuasion
advice uh you don't want to be calling
Betto oror
beta can anybody tell me why politically
that's bad now humor-wise you might
think it's pretty hilarious and I'm not
going to I'm not going to argue on the
the humor level but can anybody tell me
why it would be a huge mistake to call
him
beta um well I'll jump ahead and just
tell you you don't want to insult
voters you don't want to insult
voters do you know why a someone running
for president should not fat shame
another
candidate I'm pretty sure Trump's
probably done it but um in general you
would never want to Fat shame your C
another candidate because the voters
here he doesn't like me
either because we've got a we've got a
pretty hefty country here so there are a
lot of people who probably don't like
that word beta they probably wonder if
they are called that maybe they've been
teased that way before maybe maybe
they're a little sensitive about that so
if you call if you call the opposition
beta no matter how hilarious you think
that is and I won't I won't I won't
dissuade you from your fun but it's very
counterproductive because what you
really did is you told the whole bunch
of Voters that you probably don't like
them either terrible move uh somebody
was suggesting goofy now goofy is is
really
[Laughter]
good uh
goofy uh you know the character Goofy
from Disney
um oh but the problem is you wouldn't be
able to use it in ads so let me let me
quickly switch gears it just occurred to
me that uh you couldn't use goofy in the
sense of uh tying it directly to goofy
the character from um you know from
Disney because you would actually have
you would literally have a copyright
problem that would shot you down right
away so you couldn't put it on a you
couldn't put it in a meme that would
last long it would be taken down right
away uh but if you used it in the
general
sense without reference to the character
which would be impossible because people
would just use the character
anyway um it could have some legs
but anyway uh that's all I got for now
and I will talk to you later
