um
hey everybody
good morning it's time for coffee with
Scott Adams the best part of your day
and it just keeps getting better even
when you think you can't it does
and all you need is a cup of micro glass
a tanker tells the Steiner canteen
chocolate plastic vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite
liquid
I like coffee and the tears of my
enemies
but join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine here the day
thing makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous Sip and watch it
happen right now go
hello Northern Colorado
good to have you in the house
well as you know I have sometimes had
some issues with my audio on these live
streams and somebody was nice enough to
send me a sign
that I could hold up so that it wouldn't
slow down my
um my flow
but before I show you the sign
I have to give you a warning
the sign has some offensive
words on it
and offensive concept too
so if you would be offended by
some words that are pretty offensive
uh you don't want to watch this next
part so I'm going to show you the side
but I'm not going to read it out loud
so if you're home you'll just have to
guess if you're listening and not
watching you could have to guess what it
says well I'll probably tell you all
right so here's the sign
but we're good we're gonna modify it a
little bit
okay do you think this is funny
how many think this is funny
all right it's very offensive right
so what we're going to do
is
we're gonna have to monitor whoops hell
hello don't break my camera
um we're gonna have to modify it a
little bit
so this is very
very bad
so we're going to cover it up a little
bit
just some of the bad parts so I can use
it
and
I think we're almost there
parts and I think this is gonna work
at
this and here at home listening to this
one
you must be so disappointed
because visually it's stunning
well there you go
uh so now I've turned it into a Yoda
version
so it says Jesus king is
the audio is fine
that's right Jesus king is
now before I modified it with the sticky
notes for those of you who are just
listening at home it did say something
about the Lord and his name being taken
in vain and you know that's
inappropriate so
so if anybody has problems with the
audio remember
Jesus king is the audio is fine okay
taking care of that little business
let's move on have you all seen the uh
the launch of Jeff Bezos rocket
the the blue origin
now I don't know if you've seen a
picture of the rocket
have you seen a picture of the rocket
because the picture of the rocket
um
I don't know this to be true but I I
think it's a fair assumption that it was
designed based on Stormy Daniels
description of Trump's penis
um
now that doesn't sound funny until you
see the rocket itself
trust me on this
Stormy Daniels description of Trump's
penis there's your rocket there's your
rocket right there
um now I I tweeted cleverly I thought
that all it needs is a scrotum otherwise
it's on model
but I was uh I was one up in my
witticism
when I noted it doesn't have a scrotum
as Dr sexy on Twitter said and I quote
that's because the nuts are on the
inside
Dr sexy
not often do I get busted in humor on my
own topic
I'm a professional
but this time I've got to admit the nuts
are on the inside
pretty good pretty good
all right now here's a question for you
if you were trying to race into space
and you were a billionaire and the
billiard who beat you into space
was in a rocket called virgin
how would you design your rocket to one
up
a virgin
well you could make it a shaped like a
gigantic penis
because maybe the Virgin got there first
but I think the
the Blue Horizon uh may have penetrated
space a little faster you know what I
mean
and uh it puts a lot of pressure on Elon
Musk to design his next rocket to look
like a giant baby bottle
really just to keep the theme alive
you know the the virgin then the giant
penis then maybe the baby bottle
give it give the whole Space thing maybe
a narrative
a meta narrative
well here's a story about the worst wife
ever
now
you might think to yourself
that you have marital problems
maybe your spouse is not perfect
but I'd like to read a story to you
about somebody who's got it worse than
you do
ex MLB star Ben zobrist
um he's got a little issue it's reported
in the paper that his wife
had an affair with their pastor
now if you
if you have an affair
with your family pastor
pretty bad
right I don't know if that would be the
worst wife ever because you know people
have affairs
but
um
to cap it off apparently the wife while
she was having the affair with the
pastor
threw him a a retirement party
which cost her husband thirty thousand
dollars husband didn't know which
account it came out of so he didn't
realize how much it cost
and while they were giving the the
retirement party for the pastor
who the wife was having the fair with
she danced suggestively with the pastor
in front of all the guests
not an ideal wife really
and now
she's suing the uh the uh her husband
for millions of dollars
so that her contribution to his life
will be to
pester him because he quit because he
wasn't making enough money having an
affair with the pastor
using his thirty thousand dollars to
throw a party for the pastor that she
was having the affair with and dancing
suggestively with him in front of all
their friends
then taking millions of his dollars and
leaving him a shell of a man
I'm only telling you this story so you
feel better about your own life
do you feel better now
you know your your spouse is maybe not
putting the top on the toothpaste
right doesn't seem so big now does it
yeah your spouse
gambled lost some money doesn't seem
like such a big deal no does it bought a
boat without asking
not such a big deal
you're welcome
well the Huffington Post has some fake
news and it's reporting
fakely
fakely but truly strangely enough
sometimes the news is true and fake at
the same time
how is that possible well it can be true
but because the context is manipulated
it could give you a false uh false story
and that's happening here they often
post is reporting that Texas or at least
maybe is one County or something wants
to ban the teaching that the Ku Klux
Klan is morally wrong
does that does that sound like real news
it's in the it's in the Huffington Post
so it must be real right
often poster wouldn't try to fool you
and tell you a story like that Texans
are trying to not teach that the KKK was
morally wrong
they wouldn't say that would they
yeah the whole story is so
here's what really happened
what really happened is that there was
some changes to how history was taught
and a bunch of things were removed
including the way they were teaching
about slavery and Eugenics and Ku Klux
Klan and stuff like that but
does that mean that they're not going to
teach that stuff or is there just
removing the lesson the way it was
let me ask you this
if your children are old enough
to learn about the KKK because you know
you're not going to teach a two-year-old
about the the clan but if your kid is
old enough to learn about the Ku Klux
Klan
aren't they already old enough to know
it's wrong
is anybody sending their kids to school
and they they see a lesson about the Ku
Klux Klan and is that kid sitting there
and thinking well that looks pretty good
where'd all that go we need some more of
that
if your kid is having those thoughts
maybe the problem is in Texas
maybe it's not the school system
I'm just wondering when World War II and
the Holocaust is being taught in schools
do they specifically add the lesson that
the Holocaust was morally wrong
or do they kind of make the assumption
that you'd figure that out on your own
was there a time in American history
where you had to tell kids that the KKK
was wrong yeah yeah there was a horrible
time in history where you actually had
to explain that that was wrong
but today
today
do you have to explain to a kid today in
2021 that the KKK is
not your ideals organization I don't
think so
so I'm gonna call this fake news I don't
think anybody needs to tell anybody that
the KKK is a bad deal
and it was just part of a larger lesson
that got readjusted I guess
all right uh there's a fascinating
compilation clip
no not that kind you dirtbags a
compilation clip on politics this time
and uh it shows a bunch of Democrats
Jack posabic was tweeting this uh in
2018 talking about the lack of security
and voting
specifically with voting machines the
electronic ones
now is it persuasive
to see the same people who are saying
the elections are fine
just a few years ago complaining that
they're totally not fine
does hypocrisy
persuade anybody
nope it's the weirdest thing you would
think that pointing out that somebody
used to say the opposite of what they're
saying today and nothing changed you
know it wasn't because there was new
information or something they just
decided to say the opposite because it
was good for politics there is no way
they're pointing out hypocrisy has ever
changed anybody's mind I've never seen
it happen have you ever had an argument
where you say well yeah your side says X
the last week they were saying why so
now change your mind
does that ever worked
oh no in the history of the world
pointing out hypocrisy has never changed
anybody's mind I don't think I mean I've
never seen it maybe somewhere I can't
say zero people have changed their mind
but I've never seen it
so
it's great to to look at that but it
doesn't really uh it doesn't penetrate
so there's your your persuasion lesson
for the day
is that you are sure hypocrisy would
change Minds if you can point it out how
starkly it is but it doesn't just
doesn't change anybody's minds and the
reason is that nobody nobody formed
their opinion based on facts
if they had ever made their opinion
based on facts and reason maybe they
would change their opinion if you showed
them something changed or there was
hypocrisy but since it's not a
legitimate opinion in the first place
nobody's going to change it
Rasmussen reports
uh that they asked this question of
likely voters are we facing the most
significant test of our democracy since
the Civil War
and uh
56 percent agree
that's the most significant test of our
democracy since the Civil War
what is what exactly which part is the
test of the democracy
is it
that the vote wasn't trusted is that the
test
is it the way the social media companies
are manipulating communication
is it the the news telling us fake news
what exactly is it oh is it the the
Insurrection with the guy with the hat
the Viking hat
so how do 56 percent of the public think
that we're having the most significant
test of our democracy since World War
since the Civil War
he said what
to me everything looks sort of the way
it's always looked oh oh you're thinking
that elections used to be fair
and then now they're not
I don't think that's the case do you
think that elections are are less Fair
now than they were in this around the
Civil War
check out some history our elections
have been pretty sketchy for a long time
right the Kennedy election being a
classic one
so I have to say that the number of
people who think that things are the
worst since the Civil War for our
democracy are just being
um they're being persuaded by the Press
by social media I just don't think the
evidence is suggesting that at all
how many people think election reform is
needed
61 agreed but what do I tell you about
the 25 percent
the on almost any kind of poll question
25 percent will have the dumbest answer
you could ever have you could ask people
is oxygen good the 25 will say no no
oxygen is bad we don't want that
so 25 strongly disagreed with the idea
that election reform is needed
what
now you
how could you possibly think that
election reform is not needed
even if you believe the election was
perfectly Fair
can you not at least observe
that half of the country isn't so sure
wouldn't wouldn't a a better system be
one that you could audit easily in right
away
you know why could we count why is it we
can count the votes in you know a day or
two
but you can't audit it for months
don't you think you need a little
election reform
so that you can audit it more easily at
the very least make it more auditable so
people's complaints go away
but 25 of the public says Nah
nah we don't need that
25 it's so consistent
all right um
so we're seeing a new cottage industry
by CNN and MSNBC which is
misinterpreting Fox
hosts to make them look worse than they
are now of course that's the game they
all play because they're in competition
but um the current move is to say that
Fox News is killing us viewers by giving
them misinformation about vaccinations
and whatnot
but what exactly is that misinformation
because if you actually look for an
example
it's not really there
so you'll see Tucker Carlson asking
questions for example he said how do we
know the vaccines work
if a person who's fully vaccinated can
get it and give it to somebody else
who's fully vaccinated
is that is that saying the vaccines work
well it does keep the men of the
hospital so I would say it works but the
question is a reasonable question
now if somebody asks reasonable
questions
but the viewer comes to a wrong
conclusion about those questions what
they mean and how important they are is
that Fox News
is that there is that on them
because here's the thing
is Fox News your doctor
CNN and MSNBC have decided they're your
 doctor
and that you should get your information
on medical stuff from them
from Washington CNN you should make
medical decisions literally that's what
cnns tell you watch our show and then
make a medical decision based on that
not just what CNN is giving you as facts
but also their opinion
that CNN's opinions
should form your medical advice and
MSNBC the same thing now Fox News I
would say
is a little bit more transparent about
saying we're going to look at all the
all the questions
even if that maybe influences you a
different way because it's up to you
decide whether you get vaccinated it's
not it's not up to Fox News
they're not trying to be your doctor
so CNN and MSNBC are trying to be your
doctor giving you actual advice on what
to do Fox News isn't doing that does
that mean the Fox News is the bad one
because that's more of uh
an opinion than a fact right because I
do think you could make the argument
that maybe the way Fox News treats these
topics
might influence people to get fewer
vaccinations than otherwise
so would that make a difference to how
many people live and die am I it might
but is it Fox news's job to be your
doctor
or can they just say hey we've got a
question about this a question about
that here's a skeptic who has an
opposite view of this and then you talk
to your doctor and make up your own mind
it's a it's an interesting ethical and
moral question I don't think we would
ever ask this question except in the
context of a pandemic where the stakes
are so high
but um
you know just just ask yourself is your
is your new source trying to substitute
for your doctor
now one of the things I find most
interesting about this whole pandemic is
that the two worlds interpretation is
going to survive long after the pandemic
and what I mean by that is that some
people are living through a non-pandemic
meaning that as far as they are
concerned there was never a real
pandemic over 600 000 people reportedly
died in the United States alone
but there could be a lot of people who
lived through all of that and said no it
was basically just the flu oh it was a
bad flu it was basically the flu
and other people say it was a pandemic
and then of course there will be people
who say masks worked people would say it
didn't people who say vaccinations
worked people would say it didn't and
there's no data no facts no news that
will come out of this that will change
the fact
that we're all going to live through
this thing or most of us will live
through this thing and we won't even
agree on what it was we lived through
it's not like a war where at least you
agree you all went through the same War
some people are going to say there
wasn't even the pandemic it was just it
was just a pretend you know pandemic and
it's amazing to me that that I can
predict this so far in advance and be
entirely confident that that's what's
going to happen
so how many of you
have checked your predictions since the
beginning of covet I'm going to run
through some of mine just so you can see
how well I'm doing and if I forgot some
you'll you'll remind me because I was
just running from memory I'm sure I
predicted a lot more things than this
and probably probably forgetting the
ones I got wrong
um which would be normal
so I remember people saying that it
wasn't going to be worse than the
regular flu but now we have six hundred
thousand or more Americans who died from
it allegedly now even if you took off 25
percent for you know miscounting let's
say you were super conservative he said
I think 25 of these are BS
a lot right so I would say I was right
that it was a real pandemic as opposed
to the flu
um I've always been on the side that
says it was at least possibly engineered
so I would say I'm I was right on that
because at the moment the experts still
say well it's possible but we don't know
for sure
um I told you early on and notably that
we would not run out of food and that
the economy would not completely crash
and that we'd be fine
and we are I would guess that that maybe
was my best prediction that we wouldn't
run out of food because it was the most
important one it's the one that would
contribute the most to reducing the
panic
um I predicted very early on that our
Medical Health Science people would not
only rise to the challenge but would
impress you how quickly they did it in
other words I predict the Therapeutics
would come on fast I was less sure that
vaccinations would eradicate the problem
but I thought they too would come on
faster than normal
so my prediction that we would be
surprised on the upside that our our
science would do so well with the
Therapeutics Etc I would say that was
right wouldn't you say
um I said early on that genetics would
matter we know that now I said vitamin D
is probably a big variable
we know that to be true I I said that
when when the experts said masks don't
work I said they do you still think they
don't
and that will never change
we will never settle whether masks work
or don't
I'm very comfortable knowing that it's
almost certain that they do
but there are no guarantees in this
world uh hydroxychloroquine I was open
to it working and as if you watched you
saw that I dropped my percentage of
likelihood that it worked every day that
we didn't have confirmation of it
working and now it's basically zero or
close to zero and so far I've not been
proven wrong about that but I could be
um
I said that America would surprise the
World by performing better by the end
but not until the end where we'd see it
than it did at the start because you
could say we had a bad start
but I think you could say that we're
doing well now because the vaccinations
are going well compared to other
countries
and I was never for full lockdowns as
long as they lasted you know I thought
it was worth a try for a few weeks but
that didn't work
yeah and I think I was most wrong about
how long anything would last I didn't
think it would last two years
so I was wrong on that
all right
um
I said show me the under 70 year old
celebrity death rate
yes that's right
um and so far none right there's nobody
who died of kovid who's a celebrity I
think I used different years I might
have said under 65.
but I don't think there's been one has
there
all right
um
so if you
here's what I here's uh some fake news
um so there's fake news that says that
Fox News is now requiring uh vaccine
passports when their hosts rail against
them
Is that real news or fake news
that Fox News is requiring vaccine
passports for their own employees at the
same time that their hosts are talking
out of against having vaccine passports
and the answer is fake news because it's
just an option so now if people are
vaccinated at Fox News then they don't
have to go through the other protocols
but if they're unvaccinated they go
through the other protocols so basically
just fake news
um
so let's see what else we got a question
can a vaccinated person
give the virus to another fully
vaccinated person now the technical
answer is yes
because vaccinated people can get it and
vaccinated people can spread it
but how often has it ever happened
because you've got you know two factors
here one is that if you're vaccinated
it's hard to get it
but the other is it's really hard to
give it those are two hard things and if
you put them together
how often does one give it to the other
now I saw an anecdote in which there was
a wedding in which a bunch of vaccinated
people still got infected which would
suggest that the vaccinations are not as
effective as maybe you hoped but when
you're reading the article there was a
guest who came from India had been
vaccinated with one of the Indian
whatever they were using in India maybe
not as effective as the modern and fisa
for example
so do we have any example I'd like one
example
of a moderna vaccinated person giving it
to another moderna vaccinated person
now probably we can't really know just
be hard to know for sure if it was
that's where somebody got it from but
you could
maybe you have some good guesses
because if you notice that whenever we
talk about the weakness in the
vaccination or we need a booster or
whatever
it feels like it's never the moderna
shot
am I right about that
every time we hear about the moderna
shot it's a positive
have I missed any stories because we've
heard about the Pfizer shot some
questions we've heard about J and J and
having some questions on that as far as
I know
I've not seen a negative moderna story
um
yeah
so I wonder about that and
just keep an eye on that now let me give
you some
let me give you some vaccination
persuasion
um if I were the news business let's say
I were CNN or an MSNBC
and it was I thought it was my job
to convince people to get vaccinated now
you could argue whether they should do
that or not but let's say let's say you
thought you should
how would you how would you modify your
news reporting
to get the best vaccination result
well here's what I wouldn't do
um 258 people on average in the United
States are dying from covid every day
so that that's what's reported in there
was 258 people dying of coronavirus
every day therefore you should go get a
vaccination is that persuasive
258 people every day
in the United States of 370 million
people whatever does that make you want
to get a vaccination
probably not right not by itself because
that's actually not very many people
compared to 370 million and and then of
course in your mind you're saying yes
but they're 100 years old and they're
obese and that's not me
right so I would say that when they
report it this way they're not really
encouraging people to get vaccinated at
all
now here's an alternative way to report
the news
two statistics number of unvaccinated
people who died today and number of
vaccinated people who died
because the number of vaccinated people
who died is close to zero
at least the number of vaccinated people
who are even hospitals in LA and San
Francisco at least the other day was
Zero
there weren't any
now imagine
those two numbers being reported every
time by every entity
now keep in mind I would also say you
should report any vaccination side
effects
because that's part of the that's part
of the story right you can't leave it
out now you might not know your number
about side effects is accurate but you
could put a range on it you know maybe
modify the reporting a little bit and
say well we don't know what it looks
like there's some questions because so
you don't want to leave out the side
effects you don't want to leave out the
risk of the vaccinations but if I were
trying to persuade I would not report
the total number of people dying per day
ever again let me say that again
if I wanted people to get vaccinated
I would never again report
the number of people dying from covet
I would only report the number of
vaccinated people dying per day
and the number of unvaccinated people
dying per day don't do the whole year
doesn't make sense just per day correct
just those two numbers and just leave
and just let it go
because if you see the news every day
and it's like 300 unvaccinated people
and one vaccinated person died
it's going to wear you down
it's going to wear you down but it
wouldn't be fair persuasion unless you
also showed the risks right as best you
could
49 of people in the U.S are fully
vaccinated two vaccine at least two
shots for the two shotters and
um I don't know is that good 49 percent
this isn't bad
it's not not as good as it could be
um
The yougov Economist poll and I think
the press secretary sake mentioned this
um apparently 20 percent of the voting
public or not the voting public but 20
of whoever they talk to in the United
States
20 percent think uh it's definitely or
probably true that there's really a
microchip in the shots
and that the government is trying to
chip you put a microchip in you via the
shots
uh
20 percent
almost yeah there's the 25 rule right so
I've told you before that somewhere in
the neighborhood of 25 you know ranging
from say 20 to 30 percent somewhere in
that range
will have the dumbest opinion on every
question
it's just it's very consistent makes me
wonder if it's the same 25 percent
like are there are is it true that a
corner of the country gets every
question wrong or is it just no matter
what the question is you always have a
quarter of the people who are on the
wrong wrong answer
isn't it weird how often that
25 ish thing comes up for for dumb
people
well
I don't know for sure
whether there's a chip and the
vaccinations or not
but if I had to make a guess
and bet my life on it
did not I think the Safe Money says no
no microchipped in the vaccination
and if you're not convinced because of
me saying it ask yourself this
do you think you could get exactly one
chip into each vaccination what happens
if you get two shots to get two chips
somebody says that's just the chip
talking Scott
yes the chip is running my voice I can't
make my own decisions anymore because
the microchip is in my body
two of them
how do you know you don't get hundreds
of microchips how many of them do they
put in each shot
there are no microchips in your in your
vaccine if there's anybody listening to
this who thinks there's a microchip in
their vaccination
oh maybe you need to watch something
else
because there are no there are no
microchips in your vaccination
they're really not
all right I'm going to change the topic
here
well actually before I do that there is
reported that the people who watch the
most conservative news
also have the lowest rate of
vaccinations
so does that mean that watching
conservative news causes you to be less
likely to be vaccinated
they might
but it also probably means that people
who are the most conservative are the
least likely to trust the government
putting a chemical in their body
so I'm not sure that the watching the
news makes you less likely to get the
vaccination or that it's just people who
are less likely to get the vaccination
are watching the most right-leaning news
so uh you trust the news somebody says
well I don't all right another topic
who can tell me what uh an atom is made
out of a t o m not not Scott Adams you
already know I made it I'm full of
so that was an easy question but what is
an atom made of
well it's made of neutrons and protons
and electrons
what's an electron made of
well I believe it's a fundamental
element
which means it's not made of anything
except itself
neutrons and protons are made of what
quarks
right
so the atom is made of these three
things and two of these three things are
made of quarks
what are quarks made of
so if the atoms are made up of quarks
what the hell is a quark
and somebody says the Quark is made of
God yeah well
strings good answer whoever said strings
you've been following your news
well even if it's made of strings what
are the strings made of
so my point is if you keep if you keep
going down and down what is everything
made of
and I've got a feeling that the answer
has got to be ones and zeros yeah as a
sour patch rash is saying in the
comments here it's got to be ones and
zeros
because what if you drilled all the way
down to the lowest level of reality and
found out it was all the same
what if it's all the same
and how can there be
let's say different kinds of quarks
because you got your charms and your
your up quarks and your down quarks but
what are they made of what's a quark
made of and if they're fundamental
how could there be more than one kind
if a quark if whatever a quark is made
of is itself
you can't have multiple different quarks
could you well now of course I'm I'm way
into territory that I don't understand
well my point is
that you reach a point in physics where
they replace understanding with just
words
and the words are just placeholders
because we have no idea what's happening
down there just no idea
um
somebody's I'm seeing a comment about
vaccinations and Pfizer Israel used
Pfizer exclusively and it isn't keeping
vax people in the hospital
um
well
but I think it's eliminated their deaths
right
I think the death rate is basically
close to zero
so anyway my point is
um how can anything move or how could
there be any energy in the world if if
you went down to the lowest level of
material
and it was all the same
they wouldn't do anything it would just
sit there
the the only the only way that things
happen is if things that aren't the same
are near each other
right now let me ask you is that over is
that simplification too much
I'll say it again the the only way
anything moves in this world
is if different things are near each
other
such as wind and a sail
right if you got down to the lowest
level
it would just be things that are exactly
the same sitting next to each other
they wouldn't have any effect would they
except I don't know gravitational pull
so my point is that the more we know
about the nature of reality the more
likely we are going to get close to the
idea that we are a simulation there's
now a big project going on to map the
entire universe so to get these big
telescopes they can look look at stars
so far away you can find out what the
universe looked like 11 billion years
ago and apparently they'll be able to
actually create a three-dimensional map
of the actual Universe not only where it
is now but apparently how it started
what do you think is going to happen
when we can map the whole universe
I think we're going to find out where a
simulation
I I think all of this ends in the same
place
I think every mystery in physics every
mystery in the cosmos just ends in the
same place that we're obviously a
simulation
but
um somebody says the universe is
currently collapsing untrue
not only is the universe expanding but
the rate of expansion is increasing
uh
do you know why the rate of expansion is
increasing
because that's how you program gravity
it said this years ago I've not probably
nothing has gotten me more trouble so
here's a little uh mental mental thing
for you imagine there are only two
things in the universe
say
let's say this yellow stinky pad and
this stylus
and they're they're touching
and then let's say The Stylist jumps
jumps up but everything in the universe
is getting bigger at the same time
what would be the impression of the
stylus that jumped up off of this this
yellow sticky pad if both the stylus and
the thing got bigger at the same time
they would touch again
because the the two objects would grow
in size until the distance that it
jumped it closed and it would look a lot
like gravity
wouldn't it
so
one way
to create gravity that nobody can
identify like you can't get a handful of
gravity you can't block gravity did you
know that there's nothing you can put
between the Earth and an object
that would make the gravity lessened
so what the hell is gravity if you can't
block it
it's probably just an impression it
could be that everything is just getting
larger programmatically and that's what
causes you to have the impression
of gravity
now you say to yourself but wait a
minute Scott here are all my exceptions
where your model doesn't work to which I
say just like a software program
you catch the exceptions and then you
just deal with them programmatically so
yeah you could have some exceptions
where it wouldn't work that just making
everything bigger gives you the same
result as Gravity by the way there's
there are real people uh physicists who
have done the math and found out that if
you model the universe as everything
expanding you get a very similar output
to if you imagine there's gravity
now
um
yeah the exceptions are now bugs exactly
eventually it will stop expanding and
collapse will it
I'm going to say it'll never stop
expanding because if it ever stopped
expanding the illusion of gravity might
disappear
all right so another all that's just for
fun don't take any of it too seriously
um if you haven't noticed my my grasp of
science is less than complete
um and is there anything that I missed
today
uh that would make volume more important
than Mass
that is exactly the correct thing to
note however you could correct for that
programmatically and most things
do have a
most things the mass and the volume at
least have some correlation
all right
uh
would I do a simulation live stream
for locals only well I've done a few few
topics on the simulation oh the audit
well every day that we go without
hearing some uh real real audit issues
as opposed to issues that apparently
apparently can be explained away pretty
easily the less I would think that
you're going to find anything
so
I'm still open-minded but every day that
goes by the odds of that we find
something goes down
um
comment on the rise of D economics
the National Review don't know what that
means exactly
uh why do you mind if others
are vaccinated
well
you know I I'm not the one who mindset
all right stock market stock market
always goes up and always goes down
uh
if you have cash on the sidelines
a good time to buy
and this is not investment advice don't
get your investment advice from me but
as a general statement if you can
identify times when the market is going
down irrationally
with emphasis on irrationally that's a
good time to buy
now so the question is is the market
going down irrationally because of the
Delta variance to which I say
good chance
yeah don't know for sure because maybe
the Delta variant is the thing that
re-crashes the economies but I don't
think so I feel as if our learning curve
and our vaccinations and everything are
going to head that off
it'll be a big problem but I don't know
that it would change your investment
decisions
so
uh I feel as if this is a buying
opportunity but don't take your don't
get any investment advice from
cartoonists
uh you talk about it as if you do care
oh let me explain that so people saying
if it feels as if I'm
persuading anybody about vaccinations
uh let me clarify when I talk about what
is good persuasion versus bad that's to
teach you
that doesn't mean anybody has to use it
right so the the government need not use
any of my suggestions I'm just teaching
you how to persuade and I'm using the
headline topics to do it the other thing
is I think everybody should have the
best thinking
and data to go into their decision about
vaccinations so you know whenever I can
help clarify the thinking
I'll do that
but whether you get a vaccination
I'm vaccinated I don't care
you know if you're not affecting my
economy and I can still use my hospital
if I need it
do what you want to do
um
all right what is the simulation use of
covid it feels like a reboot it feels
like almost a system upgrade the whole
coveted thing because the covert changed
so many things in our reality it just
feels like a like a major software
upgrade with lots of feature changes
so maybe it's just that
all right
um
how did the simulation get made by
somebody who lived before
now that still still begs the question
how did the first person get here but
that's a different question
all right
um that's all I got for now and I will
talk to you tomorrow
