me just saw some news I didn't want to
see all right what's the problem
here look like I got a bad
printer
huh well my printer is dead today it's
good time to find out just when you
start the show
I got lots of
notes but I will look at them on my
phone instead of my uh
notes oh no turns out I'm not synced to
my phone so I can't even look at my
notes there we go there's an update
we're back
online wonder why wonder why my computer
isn't working
today oh

shall
we but I'm going to call up a special
feed here just for my beloved locals
people so I can see you
specially and the rest of you thanks for
joining all
right and we'll be up and running in one
moment here or maybe not this doesn't
seem to be working either
all right well starting the day with
massive technological
failures but is that going to stop me
possibly there we go everything's
working now we're all
good all right
welcome
me I I think everything that could go
wrong has gone wrong so far but let's
see if we can get this
going oh my God that's not working all
right we got another
problem all
right
so uh let's see should I continue with
my technology not working at all yeah I
think we can do this we can do
this uh except I don't see any
comments which suggests that uh a lot of
things are not working at the moment oh
you know what I can do I wonder if I can
print
from my
phone let's see if it's the printer
or the
device
um it should be a button to print
all right ladies and
Gentlemen let's see if my printer makes
a noise now oh it is look at that
everything's working
now all right so that means I can put my
phone onto
comments and then the show will
begin okay are you seriously
all right so the show's not showing up
there I'll find
it this is going to work damn
it there you
go there we
go I got notes I got
comments I got a sound
I got
lighting the worst beginning of a show
ever let's try that
again oh welcome to coffee with Scott
Adams the the worst produced show in the
history of
shows I don't think anything could go
more wrong than they have so far but if
you'd like to take your enjoyment to
this day up to levels that nobody can
even understand starting from this
pathetic beginning all you need for that
is a cuper marer a glass of tanker CH
Stein a canteen jug a flask a vessel
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dopamine here
the day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous
siing happens now
go that's so
good all right looks like everything's
working
now the first story of the
day there's a new study that says
drinking coffee or actually it's a new
expert saying this an award-winning
doctor is saying that uh the way to
boost your bedroom
happiness and the strength of your
orgasms is coffee apparently
coffee can make you have stronger
orgasms so
I could use a little boost I don't know
about you a little bit extra
anybody anybody want to put a little
charge in the uh pencil
no well I would like to suggest a toast
if you haven't had enough coffee yet a
toast to Steve Bannon who is apparently
uh going to die on the cross for our
sins and um he's going to be executed Ed
and put put in a big cave for four
months they're going to roll a big rock
in front of it and hope for the best I
feel like he's going to come back
stronger and I feel like that's not
something that
uh that they've totally anticipated so
we'll see how that goes all right um
Devon nness Devon Nunes had a defamation
lawsuit against the Washington Post and
that didn't work account so judge
Nicholls has ruled in favor of the
Washington Post and uh I didn't read the
actual ruling but since uh malice was
not
proven uh their defense was I believe
something like
this uh you and the jury you know we
still employ Phil bump right and people
would say Phil bump I've heard of him
yeah he still works there so our
defenses that were dumb enough to hire
Phil bump and keep him on the staff so
it probably wasn't malice it was
probably just
stupidity and the jury
said you still have Phil bump on your
staff we do oh well we don't need to
hear anymore rest of your case you're
obviously too stupid to have
malice so that worked
out
um so Rowan Chung is saying that agility
robotics it's a robot making business
they just signed this multi-year deal to
provide Ser robots as a service in other
words they're renting robots to a big
Warehouse uh plant and it's subscription
based it looks like so you be you'll be
able to buy robots
by the hour I guess so we're getting
closer and
closer to the day I told you is coming
where currency whatever our currency
becomes will be backed by robot time and
electricity the the two things that we
know we'll need forever into the future
robot time not the robot necessarily
itself but like an hour of robot time
because robots are going to be pretty
similar after a point you know they're
all going to be lifting things and
seeing things and thinking things
largely the same as the other
robots um
so uh Elon Musk is saying according to
Mario nafal that uh grock 2 will be
released in August and here's why it
took so long were you wondering why
grock wasn't updating as fast as other
things there's a reason according to
musk quote it takes a lot of work to
purge llms from the internet training
data in other words musk was not GNA be
happy with a AI that he made that was
woke now I'm putting my own spin on this
he didn't say that but it seems to me
that they had to get rid of all the
 and the lies on the internet to
create an AI That's useful for
anything now if you've tried using one
of the big commercial
AIS they're a little bit woke there's a
lot of stuff they won't even talk about
they'll even say that's not appropriate
I can't even have that
conversation so let's see if that
works and then by the end of the year
we'll have grock 3 and it's going to be
quote really something
special now when musk says that
something is going to be really
something
special has he ever lied about anything
like that I mean that's the man that put
a put a Tesla in
space when he says something's going to
be really something
special he doesn't really have a he
doesn't have any kind of history of
exaggerating not stuff like that so so I
got a feeling it's going to be pretty
darn special we'll
see anyway uh musk was also mocking the
politicians and Comm Harris in
particular because uh he said when will
the politicians learn that you can't lie
on uh X because it gets fact checked by
Community notes so Kam Harris was uh
posting on X that Trump will ban
abortion Nationwide which is literally
the opposite of what he promised
so she got community noted I don't think
it makes any difference you know the one
thing that we know for sure is that just
people don't really care if something's
true or not they really care if it's
Trump or not Trump but beyond that they
don't really care if the politicians lie
or they just want what they
want so here's my uh enduring question
can anybody explain to me a Democrat can
any Democrats explain to me what makes
Trump so scary because they're all quite
afraid of him or or so they say but what
exactly what exactly does he have claws
you know give me give me a little detail
because I guess stuff like he'll steal
our democracy he wants to be a dictator
he's going to bring chaos he thinks he's
Above the Law and then the latest one
their new campaign ad is he doesn't care
about you
does any of that even sound a little bit
true he's going to steal your democracy
become a dictator and he doesn't care
about you why do they have to make stuff
up if he's bad if somebody was really
bad you don't have to make stuff up do
you let me give a
demonstration uh Hitler was
bad and he uh was in charge of the
Holocaust how hard was that
that wasn't hard Hitler Holocaust real
stuff you know but now let's do
Trump
uh well he was colluding with r okay he
wasn't colluding with Russia no that
didn't happen um he's going to steal
your democracy like he did on January 6
well no he didn't steal any democracy on
January 6 because it wasn't even a
possibility I mean how do you trespass
your way to conquering a country not
really a path
there so he thinks he's Above the Law is
that a real statement about anybody have
you ever met anybody who thought they
were Above the
Law it's not even a real thing it's not
just not a real thing for Trump is not a
real thing for anybody no nobody has
ever thought they were Above the Law
it's completely an imaginary
problem so now they're saying that uh
Trump doesn't care about you
at the same time we're seeing that the
Democrats have been running a brain dead
zombie thanks to Jill Biden apparently
she's the key to this and did any of
that sound like they care about
you do does Jill Biden seem to you that
she's acting in a way that she cares
about you I'd say no is Joe Biden acting
in a way that seems like it's good for
the country
clearly not not even a little
bit do you do you know what's the
difference between Biden and Trump in
terms of caring here's the main
difference Trump is still capable of
caring because his brain is still
working if Biden had the capacity to
care at one
point at the moment he doesn't even have
the capacity to know there's something
to care about he would be unaware of his
own dementia that's the way it works
everybody's sure everybody can see it
but the person who has it so do you
think uh do you think Biden's doing a
lot of caring about the fact that he's
brain dead and he might be president
again no whatever is happening is a lot
of not caring about you do you think
they cared about the January 6 people
they put in jail nope they only cared
that it was good for their team do they
care that theyve bastardized all of the
legal system just to get one guy nope
they don't care about you they care
about getting Trump so it's the weirdest
most artificial madeup ridiculous
projection you'll ever see in your life
but they're selling it to their idiot
followers because they've been so
brainwashed they'll buy anything at this
point so Jill Biden is on the cover of
Vogue um not the best
timing if you were going to be accused
of being the real power behind your
dementia
president the last thing you want the
same week is to appear on the cover of
Vogue that's a really bad
look that's a whole let them eat cake
look and uh as Molly Hemingway was uh
reminding us on X that Vogue went four
years without putting an actual
supermodel Melania on the cover you
actually had a first lady who for the
first time was an actual cover model
nope didn't make it both thank God we've
got this vision of beauty uh Jill Biden
so she made it and she said uh so
apparently Joe Biden was not talked into
leaving his family wants to hold
tight and Jill says we will not let
those 90 minutes Define the four years
he's been
president they're literally doing the OJ
defense OJ only had 90 bad minutes if
you look at the average average over his
whole life pretty good pretty good
average uh it's just that one0 minute
period of slaying you take that out of
the mix and everything looks different
people everything looks different sure
if you take the fact that he now has
severe dementia to the point where he
can't do his basic job of doing a debate
if you ignore that yeah he looks pretty
good yep if you ignore all of his
policies too
looks pretty good so if you ignore all
of his policies all of his performance
in that 90 minutes well people he looks
pretty good under those
conditions
so um Republicans though have a plan to
lose I didn't realize this there's
something called the project
2025 plan which I'm just finding out
about I haven't seen but apparently
there's an extensive document put
together by somebody in the Republican
world world that says all the Republican
things are going to do when they have
power that might be the dumbest
thing I've
seen in a 100
years yeah do do you know what is the
only way you can lose this election
under the current situation you know
unless something bad happens to Trump or
some new new thing what is the only way
that Republicans can find a way to lose
this election it's this put together a
big document with lots of scary stuff in
it that can be misinterpreted as worse
than it is and they did it now I'd love
to know who's behind it can somebody
tell who's behind this project
2025 because whoever it is is not is not
doing the work of the
Republicans there's somebody who's
trying to figure out the best way to
lose an election it looks like this and
by the way I don't even know what's in
it
but I assure you it's stuff that sounds
really scary to Democrats and really
terrific to Republicans or you know a
little bit
hardcore why in the world would anybody
create that document which looks like
it's hundreds of pages of reasons not to
vote for
Trump I mean it's not what it's trying
to be you know that didn't seem to be
the intent but that's what it is it it's
it's basically
a a gigantic document about why no
Democrat should allow a republican ever
to get in office why would you create
that I mean seriously I'd love to know
who's the author of that like the main
author because I have some suspicions
about that I don't think they're on your
side is what I'm
saying yeah and why is it that I don't
know because usually a story like this
would come with the author right if
something was in the news and it was
[Music]
important oh here we go I've got
pictures of the
authors um Paul Dan Heritage
Foundation Spencer cretian and Troop
hemond way so it's the Heritage
Foundation right so is the Heritage
Foundation uh trying to lose the
election is that what they do well what
does the Heritage Foundation do besides
try to lose an election and destroy the
country do they do anything good or just
only bad things like
this it's just such a head Shaker that
somebody would put their effort into
making their team lose there's nothing
good that can come from that
document all right um I saw the uh the
account called the fisher
king um and he said that large numbers
of people are incapable of Performing or
understanding irony
comedy requires verbal dexterity a
playfulness with reality uh that is just
beyond many people and he thinks that
the part of the Trump phenomenon and the
unreal hatred boils down to this basic
stupidity the inability to get a
joke now as you know I've been on this
page for a while and I've observed over
many years that about onethird of the
general
public literally doesn't have a sense of
humor l
you know in the same way some people can
taste cilantro and it's bad and some
can't it's it's really just basic
biology some people don't have the
circuitry for a sense of humor now why
is it you don't know
that if it's the first time you're
hearing it why is it you didn't know it
before and the reason is it's well
hidden for example uh I used to give
lots of presentations and I'd see the
I'd look out in the audience and you
know 2third would be laughing their
asses off and onethird would be sitting
there like when is this going to be over
and I thought well maybe it's just me
like maybe I appeal to you know some
number of people and not
others but I
contend that that's the ratio that
you'll see everywhere in every context
is not just me on stage that there there
are a number of people who will laugh
and so therefore you think they have a
sense of humor but if you drill down on
what they're laughing at
2third of the people would be laughing
at things that look like jokes onethird
would be laughing because somebody fell
in a mud ptle falling in a mud puddle is
not a joke I mean it doesn't have any
complexity to it it's funny I like it
too but the people with no sense of
humor will laugh as somebody falling in
a puddle or getting hit in the balls but
that's not exactly a joke that's
literally something bad happening to
somebody think about that one3 to the
public will only laugh as something
where something unambiguously bad
happened to another person and that's it
they don't need any punchline no
complexity I just want to see something
bad happen to somebody I don't know that
is their sense of humor now if you
understand that you understand why
people would think wait a minute when
Trump says he wants to be a dictator for
a day how can I possibly interpret that
other than he wants to be a dictator
if you had no sense of humor you
wouldn't even understand what he was
talking about you you just would have no
filter you'd say it sounds like he wants
to be a dictator no it's just a funny
way to say it he'll be a dictator for a
day it's just a
joke and and a third of the country is
like no he's a dictator he's
coming all right um I think there's more
to
it I think that uh you know actually
I'll get to this hold hold that thought
and we'll get back to it uh tuer Carlson
says he has what he calls an unusually
good source about uh Biden and Obama now
if you don't know Tucker if you haven't
watching if he says something like I
have an unusually good source that would
be in the category of things you should
really take seriously if he says uh had
some guests son that said we have UFO in
a warehouse and he believes it
hypothetically that's not something you
should believe because that's that would
be Tucker believing somebody else but if
Tucker tells you a fact that he saw
himself such as I have a unusually good
source that doesn't mean the source is
right but it does mean that Tucker has
an unusually good source now here's how
I interpret it family member I think
it's a family member I don't know who
but I don't think you would say
unusually good source in this situation
unless you really had somebody who's in
the room and that would have to be a
family member so um or maybe it's
somebody in the Obama team but anyway
here's what he says he says Obama's
Tweet supporting Biden which happened
yesterday or the day before was
disingenuous in private Obama is telling
people Biden can't win and he is
therefore in favor of an open convention
Obama will not say whom he supports nor
as of yesterday afternoon had he met
personally with Biden to deliver the
message relationship between the Obama's
and Biden's have never been
warm you know that that feels right to
me you know Obama and the bidens have
been selling this you know we're best
friends story it never felt
real I always felt it might be a little
tortured but that's so that's what
Tucker saying and he says uh at times
they've been
hostile but recently they've
deteriorated further mostly due to Jill
Biden that sounds
right in the hours and days after the
debate she kept her husband cloistered
away from anyone who might convince him
to drop out and Jill Biden is a driving
force behind her husband's re-election
campaign as she was in
2020 uh and other family members
including Biden's sister Val considered
him too impaired to run back in 2020 the
next generation of potential Democratic
candidates understands uh as an
opportunity in their circling
particularly Gretchen
Whitmer all right
so I wonder how much anybody knows about
the inner workings of
anything uh I'm always a little bit
skeptical when somebody's got reports
about what somebody's thinking you know
what their motivations are behind closed
doors if they haven't said them but
these do seem within the reasonable
range right it it does seem to me that
Jill Biden does seem to be the key
character that would be convincing her
husband he's healthy enough to run and
uh you know but I but I won't go further
into saying she's a you megala maniac
who wants power for herself that that's
a little too far I think you could
observe that she must be the influential
one because she's the one who's closest
she's the gatekeeper but to go further
to say what her internal motivations
are that's a
stretch we don't like it whatever it
is uh Wall Street Silver is reporting on
X that uh uh Biden's sources of funding
is drying up and that some of the donors
were even asking for
refunds how bad would you have to mess
up before your donors ask for re
refund that's uh I think asking for a
refund sounds like a little bit of an
understatement imagine how mad you would
be if you gave money under the
assurances that this man was capable of
running for office and then you find out
in the worst possible way during the
debate that Not only was he not able to
run but people knew it it's the people
knew it that's the problem if I were a
donor to the Democratic party I would
never give again because they lied in
the most basic important lie of all is
the candidate mentally capable of doing
the work that's about as big a lies you
can get and if I gave a million dollars
or more to a party that lied to me to
get the money I would never give again I
might not give to the other party but I
would take myself that process so fast I
would just say I'm out I'm never going
to give you money again I wonder if
that'll happen but here's what I'm
watching
happening is it is it your understanding
that the only way we could get to the
point where America was
surprised that the the Biden has
dementia the only way you could get
there is if the entire media colluded to
keep that information from you that was
kind of obvious is to all of them now
the media on the right the Fox News the
breit Barts you know they were always on
this they they knew exactly who Biden
was and where he was at but if you
didn't see that news and people on the
left don't see any of
it it was their own media that convinced
them they weren't seeing the
obvious but now that same media Who
convinced you that what you were looking
at was not what you were looking
at once they got caught
have you noticed they're blaming Jill
Biden they're blaming
Jill they're they're making it a story
about how she's the gatekeeper she's the
one who's behind everything and she's
she's the one who's kept this from you
no she
didn't no Jill Biden is the person who
tried to keep it from us the one who
actually kept us from it you know given
that the all the signals were clear the
one who kept it from people was the
media and they're and to watch them
throwing Jill Biden under the bus now
maybe she deserves a little under the
bus treatment but to imagine this she's
the reason why Democrats don't know that
Joe Biden has
dementia that's not even close to True
what's closer to True is the media
didn't report it they could see it just
like we could you anybody who saw the
videos and they they tried to sell it as
cheap f
even when you saw it with your own eyes
they said well I don't know I don't know
if you're seeing with your own eyes what
you think you're
seeing so yes watching the media blame
Jill for all of that is pretty
sickening Trump is immune unless it's an
unofficial
act hey so we've got an update let's
take a look at
this all all
right um Trump is immune unless it's for
unofficial acts so the nature of
Presidential Power entitles a former
president to Absolute immunity from
Criminal prosecution for actions
within uh within his authority basically
and he's also entitled to at least
presumptive immunity from prosecution
for All His official acts there is no
immunity for unofficial acts okay now
pulling all this together if Trump has
immunity for official
acts but not for unofficial
acts uh now connect the dots if he has
immunity for official
acts that would include the official a
of
what i' I've confused myself on the
lawfare does this affect the Box gate or
January 6 or
both we we'll have to catch up with this
after afterwards but uh I'm not sure how
this will really affect things so I
think it's going to take a few hours for
the pundits to sort out whether this
really matters or not because something
tells me that uh the weasels will find a
way to say well it wasn't really
official was it how official was it
really yeah it wasn't totally official
what does official mean anyway so since
we know that Democrats change words to
mean different things when they don't
like them if they don't like this word
official they're just going to redefine
it well I think official means you have
to be sitting behind the desk in the
Oval Office well nobody said that no but
that's what it means that's what it
means no but really a reasonable
interpretation of official would be sort
of anything he does within his job no
he's going to have to be sitting behind
the desk in the Oval Office or doesn't
count now I don't think they'll do that
specifically but how many times have we
seen them redefine a
word because they don't like what the
word meant well that word is not working
on our favor we're going to redefine you
until we get something we
like all right we we'll check back in on
that could be a big
deal um
so let's
see
um yeah we the question we have to ask
is why if Trump is such a bad criminal
why why do the bad guys have to make up
crimes if he's just such an obvious
criminal why do they have to make stuff
up it all looks made up to me at least
made up in the sense that other people
would not be
charged all right so the hill is saying
the these major media have called for
Biden to resign the New York Times the
New Yorker The Economist Chicago Tribune
and the Atlanta Journal
Constitution um but the Washington Post
has not uh said
anything
so I feel
like I feel like there's some
celebration in the uh the Biden
household I can imagine Jill Biden
looking at the the headlines and she's
like oh damn we lost the New York Times
what the New Yorker or to The Economist
Chicago Tribune no no the Atlanta
Journal too we've lost all of them and
then in a moment of calm she
says thank God we still have Phil bump
at the Washington Post we haven't lost
Phil bump and so that's something to
cling to they still have Phil bump
the least credible journalist in the
world all
right uh there's a former uh Biden Aid
who Michael L Roa he used to be the
press secretary for Jill Biden so he's
not anymore but he says
quote
J he said uh I want to get his exact
quotes
uh he said Jesus Christ what's with all
the
[Laughter]
gaslighting so this Biden Aid has
realized that he worked for a group that
does nothing but makeup stories about
the gaslighting so he's basically he's
out he lashed down at the White House's
former communications director Kate
bingfield uh and argued that she was
gaslighting the American
people Ju Just hold this in your
head Michael L Roa he was the press
secretary for the first lady Jill Biden
that's about as inside as you can be and
he's telling the world publicly they are
gaslighting you he's telling you he knew
from the inside he's saying they're
gaslighting
you and they
are all right uh Michael lean black uh
posted the other day he's uh
he he's sort of mocking people who don't
agree with climate science because 97%
of climate science are on the same page
he says and therefore you know why do
you think they're wrong I mean come on
97% that's a
lot am I right I mean if 97% of the
experts are all on the same page well
that can only mean one thing they must
be right
right
right well here's the fun part if you're
a Democrat right now and you're on your
road to
Enlightenment where you're waking up
from the gaslighting that Michael L Roa
tells you about here's what that path
looks
like number one wait a minute what what
are you telling me that Russia collusion
was a hoax all along what
Russia collusion was a
hoax huh well well at least hoaxes are
not common in
politics at least it's not
common wait what are what those 51
intelligence professionals all lied
about hunter's
laptop wait a minute that was real the
laptop was real the entire media said it
wasn't
real that's weird huh well but that's
just two things I mean you know it's not
like the media is just making hoax after
hoax it's just
two no big
deal wait a minute wait a minute did I
just see a CNN legal analyst say that no
one but Trump would have been charged
with these lawfare
trimes oh wait no one but Trump would be
charged I thought I was on the team that
was no one's above the law but that
sounds like somebody's being abused by
the law on my team my team's doing that
wait a
minute you're telling me the CNN and Fox
News both
agree that that the New York case
against Trump was made up and the law
doesn't even
exist wow that's weird but it's probably
just about Trump I mean it's not some
kind of General thing it's just maybe
that's just a special thing about Trump
number
four why do all the weird scare stories
about Trump sound totally made
up how exactly would he steal my
democracy uh were the January 6
protesters minutes away from Conquering
the combined military might of the
United States by their method of
rearranging lect turns and
trespassing how how exactly did would
that work why didn't any of those people
use guns at least the people who were
protesting huh I thought they like guns
but they didn't bring them it's almost
as if that January 6 thing was
completely made up and what they were
really doing was protesting an outcome
of an election that looked a little
suspicious just like Democrats
do and then from there we get the holy
 moment that goes like
this I'm watching this debate between
Trump and
Biden holy was the entire media
landscape lying to me about Biden's
mental accuity wait they were all lying
except the people that I thought only do
fake news okay I'm maybe I'm not
understanding this let me see if I can
understand this are you telling me that
100% of the media that I I consume knew
that Biden had bad brain but acted like
he did
but the media that I was sure I was told
they all told me this is the fake news
the Fox News is you know the the breit B
why did they get it right from the start
but my news got it all wrong every every
single one of them well and now why are
they pretending they didn't know until
the the
debate why are they gaslighting me that
this was a big surprise that snuck up on
them how could they possibly have been
I'm surprised by
this well at least all of the big
surprises are
over well if this describes you and
you're a Democrat and you're on your
path to waking up to what has been done
to you let me tell you where it's going
next this will be you and maybe a few
years at least I know climate change
isn't totally made up I Mayan
how could 97% of scientists be
wrong so at least I have something to
cling to that yeah maybe it is true that
my team lied to me about really
important stuff like really important
and it is true that they do ops where
they make up an entire story like the
laptop and like Russia collusion so it's
not just being wrong there's actually
coordinated operations to create
narratives that weren't
huh
well well I want to give you a spoiler
if that's where you are so if you are at
the point where you're starting to
question all those other things that
have been confirmed not to be true that
you were once told were
true um this is what you're going to
find out
next now I want you to sit down because
this isn't going to be easy if you're a
Democrat sit down seriously sit down
uh the only way that 97% of experts
could be wrong about climate
change would be exactly the way they
were wrong about the
pandemic you know key facts about the
pandemic and the same way that 97% of
journalists told you that Joe Biden was
mentally
fined do you see the pattern
yet that 9 7% of experts in every
field have no predictive power so long
as they also have
bosses that's the pattern you look you
saw the wrong pattern if you think the
pattern is if 97% of the experts agree
that must be true that's not the pattern
the pattern is that if all the people
who have a boss say it's true then
you've you've heard
nothing that would be the same as no
information
because the boss whoever the boss is or
in this case it might be entities that
do grants and funding people will give
you money basically if they if they have
to agree with the narrative because
they're an entity and trying to operate
in the real world and they have to make
their customers and stockholders happy
the big entities don't really have an
option of bucking something as important
as climate change so they make sure that
their employees and the people they give
grants to are all in the same pace
age but the person who's the expert is
not the
boss the expert needs to get paid if
there's one thing we know for sure
experts will either shut up if they
don't want to lie or they will
lie sometimes they don't know they're
lying because money will distort you
that way it's like no I'm not lying I
just need money
so that's that's your next surprise and
I think for a while I'm going to back
off on uh explaining to people why
climate science is
 which by the way I don't know
if the climate is warming and I don't
know how much if anything um human
activity matters I'm just saying that
what they're telling you is obvious
 I don't know what the truth is
I just know what they're telling you
isn't because the prediction models
cannot predict the future that's not a
thing so now I'm just going to say wait
a you find out about the 97% of the
experts because everybody who's looked
into it found out it's sketchy everybody
everybody who's looked into it but if
you've never looked into it and you just
heard on TV that 97% of experts are on
the same side that would be
persuasive so I'm just going to say way
do you find out about the 97% of
experts that that's when you get out of
the Matrix that's the big
one but you know while it seems that
every single thing the Democrats have
touched is crooked corrupt uh
gaslighting or a pure
lie can we agree on one thing thank God
our elections are clean oh man can you
imagine what a bad situation we'd be in
if if our elections were not pure but no
we managed to use the only kind of
electronic devices that are
unhackable all the other kind can be
hacked you know that right the kind that
we use to protect our nuclear
facilities uh the military stuff things
on airplanes you know a lot of those
things you'd think they're important too
but they can't be protected because we
know that the hackers get in all the
time in fact we think that Chinese
hackers might be in every one of our
critical infrastructure systems which
have the maximum cyber
security but thank God they can't get
into our election systems I mean we're
lucky about that aren't we
Democrats way do you find out about our
election
systems just way do you find out about
that because I feel like you're going to
I don't know when could be years but
where do you find out that you didn't
really live in any kind of democracy or
Republic not really but you believe you
did anyway I think the uh Democrat TDS
landscape is made up of the following
people
people who don't have a sense of humor
so they can't tell when Trump is joking
or not so they take him literally
instead of you know in the fun way uh
there
are a lot of PE a lot of women who are
frightened of men and the more of a
bully that man looks the more frighten
is so some people are just frightened of
men then there's a Hitler
brainwashing that that gets to the
weakest Minds so the weakest minds think
hit is coming so that's not something
that works for smart people but the
weaker Minds can be convinced of that
and were then there's the people who are
believing things that even on paper
don't look real he's going to steal your
freedom they're actually saying he's
going to take your freedom away or your
bodily
autonomy he said the he said the
opposite said the opposite he's not
going to do a national ban on abortion
and he's not in favor of the abortion
pill being
illegal and he's already kicked the
abortion thing to the states which means
he he washed his hands of it he's
completely done on that topic he's not
going to do anything to your bodily a
autonomy your your state might maybe you
should talk to your state but he's out
he's completely out of that business so
they just have these imaginary things
like he's got my botly autonomy he's
taking my freedom he's got my he's going
to round us up put us in camps
these are purely imaginary things purely
imaginary and then there's a group that
believes the news is still
real and it's it's funny because they
pop up on social media in my
criticisms and as soon as you see
somebody who believes the news is real
you really can't have a conversation
with them no debate can be had with
somebody who's operating at such a low
level of understanding
that they think the news is real or even
trying to be real I don't think it's
even
trying and then of course some people
are just irrational and some are team
players but it's it's kind of a mental
health question meanwhile over in France
um they've done the
impossible I was assured that this
couldn't
work apparently they did handc counted
ballots required identification and had
a result in 24
hours
huh I I don't know about you but I've
been told by the gaslighters that you
can't do that it doesn't even work do
you know why France doesn't have voting
machines soes anybody know why they
don't have voting
machines yeah it must be because they're
bad at analysis because you know you the
voting machines they they're not seeing
the benefits for example the voting
machines would be uh a lot fast okay
okay they wouldn't be faster not
actually faster than this uh because
they were done in 24 hours with the hand
counting but at least the voting
machines will save you a lot of money
okay they don't actually save money they
cost a lot of money
okay but at least it's way easier for
the
voter okay that can't possibly make a
difference um but the the result the
results from the voting machines are
more reli
reli okay they're not more
reliable
so it's not because they're cheaper
they're not more
reliable they're not
faster huh I don't know it's almost like
the French looked into
it you know what I mean maybe they
looked into
it if you looked into
it maybe you'd like paper ballots too
they just look into it maybe the French
heard that there's no such thing as a
secure electronic
system apparently in the United States
we don't know that we think they
are what we should teach the French all
we've learned about secure elections
with our automated voting
machines now we should teach them a
little lesson you know they gave us the
um Statue of
Liberty I think we could at least give
them some voting machines
return well the big winner was the uh
and it's not over yet that's just the
first round of elections they have to do
at least another round I guess but in
the first round Marine leen's National
Party National rally
party emerged as the clear winner with
34% of the vote with multiple parties
and there was chaos there was chaos and
I said to myself why is there chaos
what exactly is she suggesting that
sounds so darn dangerous so I asked
grock to give me a summary of what it
was she wants to tackle the cost of
living she I guess it's a crisis over
there surprise um she wants to Target
immigration and have more Law and Order
in Immigration she wants to expel
foreign
criminals she wants to abolish the right
of nationality for some immigrants not
all uh she wants to ban mobile phones in
schools and re roduce uniforms
interesting and she wants to use the
respectful form of Vu to address
teachers instead of two is it Vu instead
of two it's been a long time since I
took
French which one of these things sounds
like it will destroy
France uh let's see uh sure don't want I
sure don't want anybody near who's going
to tackle the cost of
living or uh enfor Force the laws about
immigration that are destroying the
country or take phones out of school so
people can learn for the first time or
reintroduce uniforms so that people are
a little bit equal and uh at least at
the child level I think that makes sense
and
then respecting
teachers well isn't she a crazy I
can see why they're rioting over there
we can't have any of this Law and Order
so I guess she's probably the only thing
that's stopping France from becoming the
first
uh first country to fall and to a
complete you know immigration
overthrow so we'll see how that goes uh
we'll see if that's a trend that's
sweeping the world and I guess in Great
Britain uh farage who would be
considered right leaning is uh making
some noise so we might see a big wave of
anti- anti- crazy stuff
uh Nancy Pelosi here's the most predict
predict predictable thing that's ever
happened uh Nancy Pelosi says that
Trump's the one with the
dementia you never could have predicted
that the narcissist would blame you for
what they're doing in front of you oh no
Trump's the one with the
demena now I feel like this is a good
time to say cuz I know know this is
going to bite me in the ass later so I
need some witnesses can I get a witness
because later somebody's going to accuse
me of not being right on what I'm going
to say so I'm going to say it as clearly
as I can it's not safe to elect
Trump because of his age that's not safe
he does look fine to me you know he
seems completely fine at the moment but
he's going to be over 80 if he gets
elected I don't think there's any good
argument for somebody over 80 being your
president none now he might be a special
case he does seem unusually healthy
right and his family's lived a long time
and you know he's hasn't been a drinker
his weight's a little problem but seems
to be doing okay
but can you do me a favor and remind me
that if something goes off the rails
with Trump should he become president
and we're two or three years in and he
starts
sketchy like uh are you starting to lose
it can you remind people that I told you
this was a pretty big
risk so I think G given the two choices
of trump or Biden it's a no-brainer get
it it's a
no-brainer let me say it again for the
people who didn't catch up the choice
between Biden and Trump is a
no-brainer yeah it's a dad joke
anyway but uh if you think you can be
comfortable with any president who's
over 80 you're crazy you should not be
comfortable with a president over 80
period and Trump's a special case but
not that special right yeah it's a
no-brainer all right um there's some
Reports say Gaza is rearming the
fighters in
Gaza so here's the thing is it going to
be impossible for Israel to actually
destroy Hamas because they can wait as
long as they want until Israel gives
up I would recommend this to Israel
Israel I would not do anything that
looks like rebuilding or repopulating
Gaza ever unless some objective
standards are met it's got to be
objective it should be something like no
reports of a Hamas armed person there
like something impossible possible you
know in another words something that
will never be never be accomplished and
they should just say we will never
rebuild it and we will just play whacka
mole and we'll just shoot everybody
who's got a gun who comes above ground
and we'll just do it forever and if they
want to stay there then that's what Gaza
is Gaza will always be Rubble with a
bunch of bad guys that when they come
outside they get killed for as long as
it takes because I think I think the
biggest mistake would be to rebuild it
where there's a bunch of people rearming
themselves just to recreate the
situation there will be pressure to do
that because people who are not good at
planning will think well that should
work out let's just rearm the people who
attack this and give them a new hiding
place I don't see where that could go
wrong no the the most and by the way I
don't support Israel let me say that
clearly so I'm not a supporter of the
country of Israel doing anything they
want to do in any situation that's
that's not my
deal I I love the Jewish people but I
like people in general too so uh I think
that they get to do what they get to do
because they're a country and I don't
run their country so they get to do what
they think they need to do that's just
the way it works everywhere not just
them everywhere everybody does what they
need to do so if I if I simply
observe what would be a reason
reasonable thing to
do that's that's not you know being uh
beating the drums for Israel that's just
common sense says you don't rebuild a
place that's you know infested with
armed armed people who want to kill you
just let it Langer Langer languish I
don't even know what words I have I
think I have dementia now but uh they
have no
obligation and really would be
strategically dumb to every even suggest
they're going to build it back they
should say We'll build it back when
there's nothing there to worry about
because maybe that'll never happen and
then it's just an objective standard you
know they they could say something like
if nobody Fires at us for six
months right it could be something like
that but they need an objective standard
which I believe could never be met
almost any objective standard is going
to be stop shooting us and they're not
going to do that
so just say you have your own you have
your own fate the fate of Gaza is in the
hands of the people there and whenever
they want to rebuild we're cool we're
cool with that whenever you want you
just can't be shooting at us of course
you got to give up your guns and and the
fact that there would ever be a
conversation about it when the when the
hostages haven't been returned there's
still hostages right I'm not wrong about
that am I there still
hostages or is that not confr
give me an update do they still have
hostages because I wonder even if they
claim they have
hostages I think I'd be asking for a
sign of life because I don't know if
they have felt living
hostages so that's the other thing they
could do they could say until we have
all the hostages and all or or at least
all the bodies of the hostages there's
no conversation to be had now orever
now or ever a thousand years from now
nope nope we didn't get those bodies
back so that was the
deal
so I think they needed an objective
standard so that they can argue that
they shouldn't start rebuilding
it and I remind you that part of the
reason I don't support Israel as a
country not the people I like the people
is uh because Israel the country doesn't
support me
period it's got to be
reciprocal as long as the country of
Israel is okay with you know the uh the
ADL sliming people in the United
States I'd like to see them have my back
I I love an official statement from the
government of Israel saying we we
disavow the
ADL easy to
do but if the ADL is over here
with me don't ask me to support Israel
you they need to be on my side now I
know they don't control the ADL I know
that I'm just saying they need to be on
my side if they want me to be on their
side so I'm not supporting Israel's war
because they don't they don't even
support my basic freedoms to be free
from a Jewish support organization
attacking me personally in public with
some
 it's got to work both ways so
I'd love love to support Israel but I'd
love it if they supported me and other
people who have been maligned by the
ADL that'd be
great and uh I'd love to see APAC um
show some uh concern for Thomas massie's
family and his re recent
tragedy just uh just a note that says
none of this is personal and we we feel
for your personal tragedy
how about uh maybe a little bit more
respect both ways works both ways a
little bit more respect both ways would
be
good all right that's all I got for now
I'm going to say a few more words to my
beloved local
subscribers
um and I will see you in the man cave
otherwise if you're in locals and uh
