[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and I'm
pretty sure nothing better has ever
happened in the history of the universe
if you'd like your experience to go up
to levels which nobody can even
understand all you need is a cuper muger
glass of tanker cheler Stein a canteen
jugg or flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dopamine here
the day the thing that makes everything
better including my audio it's called
the simultaneous Sip and it happens now
go oh we already have a complainer about
the audio on the locals now you know the
rule if you complain about the audio
during the show I turn it off do you
think you could do you think you could
hold it for a minute because you don't
have to be an in the first five
seconds all right I got it you canceled
your you canceled your subscription now
you've said it now shut the
up okay good all right we're all on the
same
page all right there's some uh
interesting story about Vince
McMahon has anybody seen the Vince
McMahon
story I'm not even going to tell you
what the claim is but if you want to if
you want to see something disgusting I
don't recommend you Google it I don't
recommend it but if you can't stand it
and you've just got to find out what
somebody is saying about Vince
McMahon uh I guarantee you none of it's
true all right so I'm not even going to
tell you what the claim is but there's a
woman making a claim and let me just
tell you this as a public
figure I know what a stalker crazy woman
claim looks like because they have a
certain quality about them and I've
received many I tell you often about the
the the woman in Canada who I've never
met who claims that I go up to Canada
and rans Sack her apartment and rape her
on a regular basis and she calls all the
people I've ever worked with to tell
them I go to Canada to rap
her that's a normal occurrence for a
public figure is is to have crazy people
come up with insane stories about things
you allegedly did because once it gets
in people's head they can't get it out
it's terrible so uh without telling you
any of the details that are just
disgusting about Vince McMahon no no he
didn't do those things I don't have to
be in the room to know that this
well I shouldn't use that word to know
it didn't didn't happen it didn't happen
that's that's my version of it how about
that story about the woman who uh took
two bong hits and claimed it caused a
psychosis that caused her to stab her
boyfriend 118 times and then stabbed her
dog to death and then tried to kill
herself by stabbing
herself and
so and so she she got a light sentence
for being uh temporarily
insane triggered by the
marijuana
now here's what you need to know about
that story it's not exactly what you
think it's not really saying that the
marijuana made her do it if you read it
that
way that was too much it's sort of
saying that the marijuana triggered
it
so uh let me tell you this without being
any kind of a medical expert there's no
way in the world that two bongs make you
stab somebody 118 times that's not a
thing that's definitely not a thing
however it could be that it triggered a
psych a psychotic episode could be I
don't you know I don't know one way or
the other but I could imagine that some
event especially
paranoia would trigger you if you were
already nuts so the important thing is
that the the weed didn't make her nuts
apparently there was some you know
nuttiness that was just basic to her but
it's possible that you know the the most
recent thing that happened before she
went nuts was a couple of bong hits so I
think the judge
was saying too much by connecting the
bong hits to The
psychosis but it might have had some
kind of introductory triggering
mechanism I don't know if it did or
didn't but it doesn't seem
impossible yeah what seems far more
likely is if the bong hits had anything
to do with it they were laced with some
other kind of drug but I would think
they would have tested for that so I
feel like it would be part of the story
but I don't know anyway I wouldn't I
wouldn't think that two bong hits makes
anybody stab their boyfriend that's not
really a
thing um few minutes ago Dilbert was
trending on X why do you think Dilbert
was
trending just because women were really
mad at
me so a number of women were reposting
one of my posts and uh their their
comments were not about the content of
it there was no argument about my point
of view there rarely is do you know what
the what the uh attacks on me usually
are let let me uh quote with
some can you believe this is the guy
that used to make
Dilbert and that's
it how about what's wrong with my
opinion or is there something I left out
is there an important context that
should be considered when reading my
opinion no people just want people to
know that I'm a horrible person no
reasons given I'm just the person who
used to do dilber
hahaa but what they don't understand is
that I'm an energy monster who's already
been cancelled
so just send your energy my way do you
know what part of this story I
remember Dilbert was trending on X do
you know what part of the story I don't
give a
about what they were complaining about I
don't
care but they send me a lot of traffic
thank you appreciate
it well apparently there were some deep
fake Biden Robo calls so uh allegedly
some somebody used some AI software to
do a fake Biden Robo call that was
telling people I don't know not to vote
or something and uh I guess 11 Labs was
the AI app that they used people assume
but here's the interesting part 11 Labs
which allows you to clone somebody's
voice in much that manner so it was
probably their software They al they
also have a piece of software to help
you detect a
fake that's kind of
that that seems like a good um good
management thing that they decided if
they're going to make things that cause
people to be confused they would also
make the tool to check it and it'll tell
you if it's made by their company that's
a pretty good product but there's a
separate product that does the same
thing called uh let's
see uh maybe I didn't write that down
but there's another app that can do that
as
well so the good news is if you wonder
if something is real or fake uh
voicewise you do have a way to check it
so you can just Google how to check
it but this raises an interesting
question isn't it the weirdest
coincidence in the world or is it that
at exactly the time Biden is declining
to the point where he can barely go in
public and his campaign will largely
involve
hiding that there emerges a technology
that can completely clone a person's you
know
look and and
voice and it makes me wonder how long
could Biden be deceased before the
public would find out now that used to
be just sort of like an obvious joke you
know like a weekend Beres you know so
it's like the oldest weakest joke in the
world but what's different is this is
the first time in history you could
really do
it like honest to
God you could just have a video of Biden
that people thought was real and it
wasn't and as long as he doesn't do Live
Events if he stays in his basement
campaigning and just puts out videos and
statements how would you even
know I mean other than uh his little uh
fake jog to his helicopter every now and
then how would you ever know he could he
could be dead for days and you would
have no idea you would still think he
was doing the
job so that's a real thing well uh Leah
Thomas famous trans swimmer I say that
Riley gains who speaks out about the
trans swimmers and or the trans athletes
and women sports um he's taking legal
action against the world
Aquatics because they banned him from
competing in the women's category but
but if he wins it could uh
potentially create a precedent and open
up a spot on women's Olympic
teams so we might be on the cusp of
America winning everything in women's
sports because we just send our trans
athletes now I can't think of anything
that would be more fun than watching our
trans athletes win every medal in the
Olympics now you could say that would be
a
travesty and it would be in a way and
you could say that would be terribly
unfair to the uh hardworking young
Olympian women who were American who
should have gotten those spots but
didn't to which I say no nobody cares
about the Olympics if you spent your
entire life getting ready for the
Olympics you wasted your time what what
a complete waste of energy preparing for
the
Olympics when I see people in the
Olympics I feel sorry for them I think
God your life must have been terrible
like getting up at 4 in the morning and
then really your whole shot was that if
you don't do well in the Olympics it was
all
wasted I have I have no respect for
anybody who is practicing for the
Olympics no respect it's just a complete
waste of energy and it's so it's so for
yourself it's like oh I've got to be the
Gold Medal winner what did that do for
anybody
anyway that's my personal thing so I'd
love to see an Embrace and amplify where
the Olympics becomes nothing but trans
athletes because it it would make me
watch the Olympics for the first time I
mean I used to when everything was
boring but as soon as other
entertainment became interesting you
know like my smartphone and
stuff why would anybody watch the
Olympics the Olympics I don't think it
can last in the long run doesn't seem
seem like it's interesting enough yeah
it doesn't really do anything for you if
you're already connected if your
countries are already connected by the
internet and travel you don't really
needed Olympics you know the Olympics
was sort of a way for countries to get
along it doesn't really fit anymore
doesn't make
sense well as you know millions of
military age men are streaming across
our Southern border uh and possibly form
paramilitary and terrorist organizations
to take down the country in October 7th
fashion and that's pretty bad that's
pretty bad but not nearly the trouble
that Canada
has
Canada had Tucker Carlson giving a
speech in
Canada and if you were to listen to
uh uh
Trudeau who somebody some people call
Castro's illegitimate son who some
people call
castr which is pretty funny if you think
about
it um he's all melting down and angry
about tuer Carlson visiting Canada and
apparently uh Trudeau has met with some
other powerful people to see how they
can survive if Trump becomes
president yeah you like that
castr it's a
keeper people have to look it up but
once you look it up it's pretty
funny anyway so yeah poor Canada they
had to deal with Tucker
Carlson in his free speech and his
opinions he's going to bring down the
Great Northern country of Canada with
his opinions he's a danger to the world
but not as much as Donald
Trump returning to the
presidency run away be afraid
well here's something I don't understand
and no matter how many times it's in the
news I'm going to say I don't understand
it inflation is coming
down
how how how how's that even possible can
anybody explain how inflation can come
down is it is it just
lies yeah maybe it's election of your
lies I know I mean I mean it it is it is
true that the price of you know gas is
down from what it used to
be
um from what I used today
oops I just have a look at
that all right I just got to compliment
by
text well so you know I have a I keep
telling you this I have a degree in
economics
and I don't know how inflation could be
coming down you know in what world do
you have you know debt through the roof
and all that and so much money was
pumped into the economy inflation's
coming
down I don't know I don't quite get it
because we have full employment like
none of this makes sense so that there's
something deeply mysterious about it all
and it could be that we don't understand
economics it could be that there's some
other Distortion in our
system that could be a problem later
that we just haven't noticed yet I'm a
little worried about this honestly
inflation coming down if it's not
true is a sign of a much bigger thing a
bigger problem yeah it could be just the
election
year all right let's talk about that
weaponized Department of Justice I saw a
post by
amuse so you know Peter Naro uh who was
a on the uh Trump staff but he refused
to uh do testimony to the illegitimate
January 6 committee uh who lost all the
records of the test yeah lost half of
the records the illegitimate January 6
committee um because he said that it
would violate Trump's
immunity because Navaro was you know
under under the Trump you know staff
basically now that was rejected and so
he's going to go to prison for uh what 4
months now does that sound like
something that would have happened to a
Democrat no there's not a chance
a Democrat would have gone to jail for
this this is the weaponized Department
of Justice if I didn't already have
enough reason to support Trump I would
support Trump just for this
thing just for putting Peter Navaro in
jail this Peter Navaro is me he's
 me if they're putting Peter
Navaro in jail for there's
nothing protecting you so I'm I'm down
for the United States of Texas the
federal government has lost it
they do not have my
support they do not have my support I've
never said that before yeah the American
government has just lost its entire
legitimacy with the public you put Peter
Navaro in jail for one day and
I'm done with you United
States you know a as a respectable
institution I mean I'm not going to move
because I still like the
weather I like the Healthcare in the
weather it's hard to move but oh my God
I have no respect for the government
whatsoever uh this this is a travesty a
crime
of honestly I don't think anything's
bothered me more that this Peter Navaro
thing because it's so personal you know
that there's what there's a person who
is just trying to do his job this guy
was this guy was working for the
government you think he did that for the
paycheck you think he took a job working
for uh Trump because he thought that was
like his his good paycheck no he was
serving the country in a way that I'm
almost positive he thought was helping
and he goes to jail for it right
let me let me say this if Trump gets in
office I do want him to get
revenge I do want him to get revenge and
not because of revenge is a good
thing not because it's a good thing you
just need mutually assured destruction
whoever is behind the stuff like this
the January 6th committee they all
belong in
jail the January 6 committee belong in
jail and if Trump could do it I I would
back that completely because they they
did an illegitimate process they knew it
they they lost or encrypted half of the
notes
uh and they're putting this guy in jail
and the entire thing was an OP January 6
through the committee was all an OP
every one of these people belong in
jail and you could call it Revenge but
you need mutually sure destruction you
do this to Peter
Navaro and I'm in favor of our
government coming for
you just for this just for Peter yeah
this one's too personal I this isn't the
news
the the Navaro thing is purely personal
th this is me against the government
because I I just feel like I'm him I
feel like I'm in that
jail um so I back Texas and I back Peter
Navaro and the government you
you've just lost
it
anyway um would you like to see a how
the
uh Washington
Post who works with
Biden to smear a
critic that sounds like business as
usual all right so this is uh the
Washington Post reports that some Biden
friends you know people on his team met
to try to figure out how to go after the
public critics of the bidens you know
especially the the criminal rery
allegations and one of those is Jonathan
Turley who's writing writing about it
now here's the interesting thing why
would the Washington
Post that is very Pro Biden why would
they write a story about a secret
meeting between people who were going to
try to smear public
people um and maybe do lawsuits and and
go after them why would they do
that there's only one reason there's no
way this little group of people could
not have kept this a secret it obviously
was part of the operation that the news
would cover it so they get the least
ethical group The Washington Post who
were not really I wouldn't call them a
serious newspaper or anything uh they're
just basically a Democrat um tool and so
they write this story that normally
nobody would have access to because it's
part of the op the the op is to scare
people to stop talking about Biden of
any potential crimes that's a real thing
that's happening you're and you're
watching it now if you didn't know the
players you wouldn't know this was
happening because if you didn't know
that the Washington Post is not a
legitimate news source it's just a
Democrat tool you would say oh looks
like they got a scoop no probably
not you know I wasn't there but probably
the most likely explanation is that
they're part of the off
and they're part of scaring people away
from free
speech that's right it's just another
one of many efforts to suppress free
speech to make it
illegal so do you think they're going to
do a Peter Navaro on
turly you know find something that they
can get him for illegally yes it looks
like they're going to go after him
because he's the best he's the best
voice for this legal stuff on who you
know that is read by Republicans at
least so everything about this you
should be worried
about all
right um I would like to
uh now
uh I'd like to cause some trouble this
might be one of the reasons Dilbert was
trending today they don't like to use my
name so they they Trend Dilbert instead
so I I get less attention
but here's something that I uh propos
today on the
xplatform and I'm serious about
it so just listen to this all right
here's a reframe for understanding
basically everything wrong with The
Country right here's a big
reframe uh we think we have racial and
political
divide we do not we have a broken mating
system marriage in particular is broken
now uh I didn't write this but I'll I'll
say it now um one of the best frames for
understanding the world is
energy If
energy um is taken from some situation
it doesn't disappear it just gets
transferred you know energy doesn't get
destroyed it's just a quality of physics
so if energy is removed from one
situation it's got to go somewhere there
are whole bunch of more single people
than there ever have been and so the
energy that Society used to give pretty
much to their family you know their
their greatest energy they don't have
that outlet anymore so where did all
that energy go what happens to all the
energy that a species that was designed
for
mating if they can't do the primary
thing they're designed for by a million
years of evolution where's the energy
go right where does it go it doesn't go
away it goes
somewhere and you're watching that
happen in real time the energy is going
in two different directions now you saw
that um in a number of uh countries
including the US South Korea South Korea
Germany Great Britain that women are
becoming more Progressive and men are
becoming more conservative like a lot
it's like a big
divide what's driving
that it's also the the failure of the
marriage and mating process now marriage
as a proxy for the The Mating strategy
in general is what you want to think of
so it's not about the the rules and the
laws around marriage it's about the The
Mating instinct which marriage used to
handle now I go on when men and women
have adequate matings strategies they
put their focus on
mating and in so doing they become
biologically
satisfied uh or at least it keeps them
busy right I'm not saying everybody who
has kids is is delighted about it but at
least it keeps them busy you know their
energy is going to a productive thing
for society but when meeting strategies
fail for a variety of social reasons
like now you know you have everything
from only fans to women are working in
you know earning their own money to uh
you can have a kid and a wedlock
to um you you name it basically all the
forces that make marriage less valuable
than it used to be so when mating
strategies fail two things happen men
become dangerous and women become
badshit crazy and those women if you
believe
biology the women uh would be doing
things that would give them more access
to
sperm so what you would expect is that
the men who don't have a purpose would
become
dangerous and sure enough seems like
there are a lot of single dangerous men
streaming across the border starting
Wars in other country Etc
um but for women their primary incentive
is to get closer to
sperm which is carried in humans so if
you look at all the uh look at all of
the things that women are
backing when when the traditional mating
strategy of marriage doesn't quite work
anymore suddenly women are in FA favor
of uh open
borders now this is a generalization has
to do with Democrats not Republicans and
it's not every Democrat but if you took
these single women out of the mix we
wouldn't have open borders do you all
agree with that you know on average if
you took women out of the democratic
party the men would say you know what we
probably ought to close these borders so
it's it's mostly a male female problem
not a politics problem and not even a
race
problem now what about
Dei if you're a woman and you want to
get closer to
sperm does Dei do it it does because
without Dei women might be relegated to
women only jobs where there are fewer
men but Dei puts the woman in the
Executive Suite surrounded by high
quality men with good sperm it also
guarantees that uh masculine men from
other races are coming
in right so so I believe that women are
pursuing a mating
strategy that is best embedded in the
Progressive um
philosophies so uh everything about
bringing in literal
millions of young mating uh level men I
believe is a mating strategy it's just
that we believe it's politics or we
believe it's race or we believe it's
something else I think it's a mating
strategy right now if you looked at who
is uh providing all the resources and
charity for the immigrants who are
arriving I don't know well I'll bet
they're more women does any anybody know
that I mean the prediction would be that
the people who are taking care of the
zillions of men coming in would be more
women than men because again they would
be getting close to the
sperm now I'm not saying that to be
disgusting I'm just being biologically
specific that that they have a million
years of evolution that makes them have
to be near sperm because it's just a
biological imperative which they may not
consciously be aware of so here's the
problem every time we talk about the
problem the crisis on the border do you
know what we inaccurately say actually
it's
accurate but it's the wrong frame what
we say is they're all military age
men that's true and it's a very big risk
but you know what we're missing the base
the base problem the base problem is
that they're all reprodu uction age men
and that's why they're coming in because
our women are fed up with the men in
this country and with marriage and
they're just saying let's just open the
 border and let um you know 10
million young men who who look like they
have
testosterone come
in so uh what you think is Democrats
versus Republicans uh is not that it's
uh that's a downstream effect do you
remember Andrew breitbart's famous thing
that politics is Downstream from
culture well culture just got rid of our
best mating strategy
marriage and so what's Downstream from
that culture now looks like we have a
Democrat versus Republican problem and
we don't what we have is women trying to
get closer to sperm men who don't have a
purpose which makes them
dangerous and and we're acting like it's
some other problem the base problem is
that we don't have mating strategies for
either men or women that are as good as
they used to be and that energy is going
somewhere else and a lot of it is to fix
the problem so women are trying to fix
the problem by bringing in so many
men that their odds of reproduction go
up if you were a woman who can't get a
guy but you would like to get married do
you think you have a better chance if
you bring in 10 million PE men from
other countries and no
women yes the the math
suggests that if you add 10 million men
to the equation and no women you know
obviously there are women coming across
the border but you know on average it's
men uh your odds of finding a man of
some sort who has testosterone and can
make you a baby is much
better so every day that we think this
is some kind of of a congress problem or
democrat problem or it's a political
problem or it's a race problem those are
all
true it's all of those things and it's a
crime problem and a terrorism problem
all true but the base problem is that we
don't have a mating system that
works and everything else is Downstream
from
that so let's see who knows that we have
a problem well let's say Bill Aman um
who is not a republican has famously
said and he said it again today on X
that uh the current immigration crisis
would should guarantee Biden losing in
the landslide which is what he doesn't
want I mean he wants a Democrat to win
but not Biden necessarily so Bill Amman
who is male and Democrat says uh oh no
close the
border RFK Jr who is running for
president and is Democrat says loudly
and clearly close the
border right because he's a
man and that's more important than the
Democrat
part um how about Obama and Biden in
2007 both Obama and Biden were very much
against illegal immigration in
2007 uh back when they were both men
Obama is still probably a man and still
opposed to this level of Biden is
neither a man nor a woman he's he's more
like a
Cav but what about the
women well let's look at a recent
Supreme Court
ruling Supreme recent Supreme Court
ruling when
54 that um the federal government could
uh take down some of the barb wire that
Texas was putting up we'll talk about
that in a minute
but all four of the women in the Supreme
Court voted for less Security on the
border now John Roberts voted with them
that gave them the majority 5 to
four
um yeah let's sip to that 34 Minute
glitch we're going to sip to the glitch
we don't know what it is but at 34
minutes into my um live stream every day
there's some kind of a technical glitch
sip to the glitch sip to the
glitch
it's a good idea we're going to use that
energy all right so the men who were
Democrats and prominent and willing to
speak out uh you know Amman RFK Jr even
Obama earlier were against illegal
immigration being under of
control and the four four out of four
women on the Supreme Court voted for
something that would make us less secure
at the border and then John Roberts
joined them but he's It's Not Unusual
for him to you know be an unusual
vote
so I feel like every every sign is
pointing in the same direction that we
have a mating a broken mating system and
all of it is just up the whole
country everything is based on that
everything all right
um so
let me say this cuz I haven't weighed in
on this yet in 2016 I was opposed to
mass
deportation and a lot of you gave me a
hard time and you were all pretty angry
about it because you like the mass
deportation and I get it yeah I I I
would not even criticize you for your
opinion we we had a different opinion
about whether we could absorb them and
you know what was what was the more
American thing to do you know given that
we're an immigrant country and those are
actually honest
disagreements
however I was operating under the
assumption that it wasn't so many
immigrants that we couldn't absorb them
it wasn't a perfect system but you know
if we just stopped the extra ones from
coming in we would absorb the ones who
were here they got jobs they want to
work they have American character you
know family religion work you know I
like all those things so I'm very Pro um
specifically uh Central American and
Mexican immigrants and part of that is
emotional because I have I have lots of
contact with that Community you know as
Californians do and they're all awesome
I mean I I have
Universal Super positive experiences
with the Immigrant Community most of
them are working uh they often work for
me and various capacities you know and
you know if I need help and whatever
there's always seems like there's always
somebody from another country who's
doing the work so for me the immigration
uh had more positive than maybe you
could see and so we would have a
disagreement on
that however that said that was
2016 and it's not irrelevant the rate of
people coming
in that's really relevant so uh
officially I would like to reverse my
opinion on mass deportation I think
every person who came in uh not from
Mexico not from Mexico but every person
who came in not from Mexico during the
Biden Administration I think they need
to go home I think they need to be Mass
deported now what we'll end up with is
probably a more targeted deporting I
think what we'll really do is is we'll
try really hard to vet people if
somebody already has a job we're going
to say ah okay you do have a job so I
guess you can stay that's probably how
it'll turn out because you know in the
end politics is
compromise but I don't think that works
because if you don't kick out every
single one that came during the Biden
Administration not counting the Mexicans
because I am treating them as special
and
Superior uh Superior in the sense that
Mexico is our
neighbor and the Mexicans coming in are
almost entirely just want work and a
good life the people coming from other
countries might actually be here for
military reasons and I don't have any
patience for sorting out the good ones
from the bad ones none now I get that
Mexico might send some MS13 people too
but that's that's a risk so far we've
been able to to manage and I'm I'm more
Pro Mexico and pro Mexicans than I am
Pro anybody from anywhere else who who
doesn't have American interests because
the thing about the Mexicans that come
in besides the fact that they're good
Americans you know almost all the time
except for
MS13 um is
that they they have a stake in America
succeeding because there's no way Mexico
does well if America fails but people
coming from you know the Middle East
maybe they don't care if Mexico and the
United States fail so there there's a
whole I have a whole different level of
feeling about the Mexican immigrants and
I might extend that to Central America
uh you know once you get to Venezuela
there's question about them emptying the
prisons so you know maybe I'd cut it off
with Central America but where I'm at is
we probably have to send 10 million
people back
minimum so I I I want to be as clear as
possible that this is a a reversal of
opinion but not because my opinion
changed it's because the facts changed
and now the facts are it's an
un it's just an unacceptable flow we
can't have
that so Trump says uh you know mass
deportations and the first time he said
it I didn't think he was going to do it
and he didn't which is one of the
reasons I supported him because I didn't
think he meant it when he said he was
going to deport 25 million people it
didn't seem possible but deporting all
of these people it is possible the ones
who came in the last four years uh and I
support it so weirdly I supported Trump
the first time because I didn't think in
part because I didn't think he would
really Deport and he didn't now I think
he will and so I support him because he
will um I don't think anybody else would
all
right and then there's a photo of the
Utah Democrats uh Dressed in all black
to mourn the passing of a bill that
banned men from girls
bathrooms and banned Dei from public
education were most of the people who
thought that was the most important
issue of the day were most of them women
yes they were there were a few men
hiding in the back but basically it was
a you seemed to be and organized by
women so there again the men are
assembling to defend the border and the
women are complaining about uh that men
can't use the girls' bathrooms now when
they say men we're really talking about
trans so that's what their their big
issue was so what do what do you get if
um trans people use girls
bathrooms it puts women closer to sperm
right every time you put somebody who
has sperm in their body in a woman's
competition women are closer to sperm
now is it a mating strategy that they
want trans to use the bathrooms not
consciously that would be insane that
wouldn't be any kind of conscious
decision but it has the same effect and
biologically I think we're driven
biologically and then we rationalize
things after the fact so I don't think
it's a coincidence that every time women
get involved is to increase their
exposure to people have sperm in the
little bag they're carrying around does
that seem like a coincidence to
you let let me let me test the audience
here because I I gave you quite a bit
how many of you are accepting or at
least you're thinking about it the idea
that we have a broken mating strategy
and that it's we see its activity in
everything that's
broken all right I got some NOS I got
some
yeses good well that's perfect for what
I'm
doing if I divided you on that question
it means you're thinking about
it yeah no the the the bathroom one
could be a
coincidence but keep looking for the
pattern look for the
pattern that it seems like some kind of
bad correction for a mating problem all
right um find the
propaganda here's a test Joe Scarboro
is's talking about the Border bill so
apparently there was a uh proposed Bill
to correct the Border did you all hear
that Governor Nas Nome is saying yeah
you know it's the Republicans the
Republicans want it as an
issue they don't want it as a solution
because we Democrats offer this the best
the best border bill that's ever been
offered it was the best one and then the
Republicans turned it down and there's
some quote or report that Trump had said
directly he doesn't approve of the bill
he'd rather have the issue because he
can win on the
issue is there anything left down to the
story did I leave anything out like Joe
scarbo is let's read Joe Scar's
take
um he called it the toughest border
security bill in the
generation he said that Republicans
recklessly killed the toughest border
security bill of the generation and then
complain about border security because
they have no shame is that what
happened was it the toughest security
bill in the
generation yes yes it
was was the toughest bill in a
generation
adequate no no it wasn't he's he's
basically saying uh if you don't accept
the serial killer that only killed 10
people I don't think you're considering
that serial killers have sometimes
killed more than 10 people so really if
you're not in favor of murdering 10
people you have no
shame it it's actually crazy talk
now do you think
that Joe Scarboro is not aware that the
so-called toughest bill was going to
allow in allow in and this doesn't even
count the people that were getaways it
would allow in 1.8 million people a
year so the bill that was supposed to
fix the Border specifically would make
it worse because it would make it legal
for 5,000 people a day to come in and
they wouldn't even start trying to catch
people or stop them until the first
5,000 walked
across that is not really a border
security bill that's some that
they tried to put together and then they
tried to pair it with the Ukraine
funding so the entire point of the
Border bill was to be this fake border
bill that they could say in public hey I
know you people aren't going to read the
details of the Border bill but let me
tell you because you believe anything
Democrats say that was a great border
bill in fact it was so great it was the
best one in the
Generation Now who says that who says
it's the best one in a generation when
what you really meant to say didn't you
is that it would solve the Border
problem huh why didn't you say that bill
would solve the Border problem since
that's really the question nobody said
can you please compare this border bill
with historical other border bills
nobody asked for that they said we have
a problem we know how to fix it can you
do a bill that will fix it well how
about the best bill in a
generation oh okay it's like you didn't
even hear
me I'm saying could you make a border
bill that would stop the flow of people
coming across the
border I'll tell you what I can do for
you I'll give you the best border bill
in a generation no you stop saying
that I don't want the best bill in a
generation because that's still going to
be worthless could you do a bill that
would stop the illegal
immigration I can give you the best
border bill in the
generation so that's that's the game
they're playing so look for that
propaganda that is your propaganda watch
list watch for them describing the
Border bill as the best one they've done
in a generation do you know what the
correct answer is well thank you for
reminding me that Congress has been a
piece of for my entire
life and there's still a piece of
 so if your argument is that
Congress has been a useless piece of
 for my entire life yeah
it's the best bill in the generation
congratulations good job now how about
stopping the the threat coming across
the border oh no best one in the
generation
all
right um then there's the question of
did Trump really say he wants to kill
that bill so he can use it as a
political thing and suppose he did how
do you feel about that suppose that was
true suppose Trump said kill it because
I I prefer it as an issue o is that
bad
nope that's not bad cuz the thing he
wanted to kill was repeat after me the
strongest bill in the generation and
 he wanted to kill
because doesn't stop the Border
but having it as an issue so they can't
say hey look we did something we we did
the best border Bill uh it hasn't
stopped it yet but you know we just
started we just got the money the
Republicans are dragging their feet so
basically the the Democrats wanted their
own issue and not fix it they wanted
they wanted to say hey we've got the
political solution but not actually
solving it because by election day you
wouldn't know if it worked or not they'd
say oh I need a little more time it's
going to work through the system it's
all it's all taken care of just give us
another month after the
election Trump quite reasonably and
wisely said that he would get a
political advantage of if they don't
pass that but it's not like that was
going to fix it and he's the guy against
the fix he's the guy against the fake
fix that would allow the bad guys to win
and the and the borders to be open
forever so yes he should use this as a
political
ax exactly the way he said and yes his
allies should kill that bill which it
looks like they
did so good work Trump
um and uh here's some news that you
you're only going to hear from you know
people like Ted Cruz and people who
understand what's going
on we don't need a new border
bill because Trump didn't have a new
border Bill and he stopped immigration
do you know how he did it uh he did the
rainan Mexico policy that Biden
revers he was building a border wall
that didn't make a difference yet but if
he'd kept going by now could have made a
difference and um Biden stopped it and
then Biden reinstituted Catch and
Release none of those things required a
border bill they were all things that
Trump did and got away with and they
were all things that Biden undid and
destroyed the
country so even the conversation about a
border bill is completely
because we don't need one we just need
to enforce the law and use executive
power the way it was meant to be used
executive power was meant to be used
exactly this way you know those those
gray are situations where you got a big
crisis and the only thing you can do is
you hope your leader is strong enough to
just do the hard stuff and ask questions
later that's what it's for that you want
a strong executive who's willing to take
a chance to do the right thing you know
if maybe has to explain it later so
that's our deal we give the presidents
power but we know they're also taking a
risk on our
behalf all right
um so uh I've told you that one of the
best follows on the xplatform is kakoa
the great how many of you have are
following that account if you're on X
Canoa the great I just want to see all
right uh a lot of yeses all right here's
what I want from you if you're on X uh
and you're not following this account
yet I'd like you to do it today and
today specifically and there's a reason
I'm going to tell you what the bad
people have done to him because he's
reporting on it today he's one of the
most
useful and accurate in my opinion um
independent journalists in the world at
least in America so he's he's a great
asset to the country and here's what
happened to them and now this is not a
story about what happened to one person
this is a story about how it's done and
it's called the wrap-up smear and it
works this way generally and they'll
tell you how it worked in this case the
the way you do it is you find some
organization that somebody's heard of to
condemn somebody with you know you call
them a bad name they could be a racist
or whatever what whatever it is you can
call
them then once any entity has made a
claim every other entity after that can
then refer to the first entity and say
well he's an accused or you know racist
or whatever it is right so the wrapup
smear is somebody doing a fake news and
then the so-called legitimate news which
is also just fake news will refer to the
first one as if that had somehow been
proven but of course it's just
all right now given that you know that
that's a real thing and it's not just
something somebody observed you know by
accident happened it's an actual op
is something people plan and execute on
a regular basis in the field of politics
right so now that you know it's an op
and a normal one that they run and now
that you know that they're targeting
anybody who had any voice that was
useful and not on the Democrat side
Peter Navaro for example right people
like me being cancelled and you say to
yourself that wasn't political wasn't it
of course it was yeah now I gave people
a reason to cancel me but it was still
political I mean it wouldn't have
happened
otherwise so here's kako the great story
in his own
words um The New York Times is saying
I'm a a qanon influencer and an election
misinformation super spreader on X now
that's pretty bad if you tie somebody to
qanon you're smearing them by
association and election misinformation
that's really bad bad you know did
either of those things happen nope
uh kakoa has no contact no association
nothing to do with Q it was simply a
statement that somebody made and I'll
tell you where that came from right
here's the thing that kicked it off uh K
cor the great shared a 32-page report on
Election fraud from the previous
president so Trump apparently posted
something about ction fraud and kakoa
shared
it now that should have been the news
that everybody was sharing in other
words every legitimate news story should
have said are you saying that Trump is
sharing a 32-page report on Election
fraud whether you believe the report or
didn't it's still the same news isn't it
so kako the greaty being an independent
journalist type reports the news
that's just the
news
so and then he goes on rather than
disproving the report the New York Times
just calls me
names that's exactly what was happening
to me when dilber was trending today on
X the people were coming after me didn't
have any argument about anything they
they didn't even have a disagreement
that I could find they just came to call
me
names um shouldn't people he both sides
the debate to decide what's true so read
the report decide for yourself um isn't
that better than those in power labeling
uh anything against their narrative as
misinformation and censoring it which is
our current system for example uh cisa's
emails this week show they were worried
about mail and voting but still pushed
big Tech to censor users with similar
worries doesn't that seem fair to report
that the very people who were censoring
you for those concerns had the same
concerns yeah that seems pretty fair to
report that um doesn't that show
labeling things as misinformation is
more about controlling the narrative
than the truth yes it does that that's
exactly what that shows because they
were censoring information they agreed
with because it didn't work for them
politically they agreed with it and they
censored it and it's in writing that
they agreed with it and then they
censored it or tried
to and then kenoa says I've written over
60 articles made thousands of social
media posts and got billions of online
views in the last three years and I've
never promoted
qanon yet Media Matters oh here it is
Media Matters huh you ever heard that
name before Media Matters if you know
the players you know that Media Matters
is not a legitimate organization they're
a Democrat hit organization so Media
Matters called him AQ non influencer so
all the other garbage media Outlets
repeat their claim their evidence here's
the evidence he shared a JFK speech and
the video creator wrote the hashtag of
uh
wwg1wga it's sort of a q andon hashtag
on it even though the video had nothing
to do with qanon it was a JFK
speech he literally shared a speech by a
president of the United States with no
commentary but because it was a little
uh hashtag on it he got called a q andon
guy there there was no Q andon anything
to it was just literally the president's
speech
unedited right so now they now Media
Matters smars them because they found
that little that little hidden Easter
egg
there uh they also say I'm a q andon
influencer because I shared posts to a
telegram page with over 50 people some
of who promoted qinon so in other words
he shared some information on telegram
but some of the people he shared it with
were qinon people so he's being
accused for the habits of his
audience now my audience Are all uh
law-abiding awesome people but if
anybody snuck into the mix who was bad
wouldn't I be associated with that by
and that's the same thing they do with
Trump they say look at all these bad
people supporting Trump that can't be a
coincidence smear by
association uh K car says I can't
control what other people write on the
internet of course and he says that's
also how telegram works I shared my post
to a handful of channels and others
shared theirs that's the whole story he
just shared some stuff and other people
shared it too I'm not responsible ible
for the content others
post uh but this is how the game played
so Media Matters accuses them of being a
qon influencer then the ADL publishes a
negative story also labeling me a q
andon influencer so now you've got two
sources well if you don't believe Media
Matters you're certainly going to
believe the ADL you've heard of them
right so they wouldn't lie to you would
they well let me tell you the ADL the
president of the ADL this year well
within the last year said in
public that I'm a holocaust
denier now I'm not a holocaust Deni I've
never even met one I don't I literally
I've never met one I don't even know
what that's all
about but do you think the ADL is a
credible Organization no they're just a
democra hip uh organization like Media
Matters but if you have two of them
agreeing with each other and their names
you think you've heard Media Matters I
feel like I've heard heard of them well
if they're saying it you well oh but the
ADL agrees oh okay well now you got
Media Matters you got the ADL that's
that's that's a lot of evidence there
but that's not all uh substance really
uh and then Business Insider attacks
Elon Musk for engaging with a supposed
qanon influencer citing Media Matters
and the ADL now remember the ADL also
targeted Elon Musk and now Business
Insider is use the ADL and Media Matters
as their Source because um as Bill akman
said today on X Business Insider is
basically just a sess
pool um I'm paraphrasing but even Bill
akman Democrat said no be Business
Insider is just a a Cesspool is
nothing close to being a any kind of a
you know legitimate media
Source following suit Forbes claims
qanon influencers are gaining traction
on X and they they reference Business
Insider see see you see how it's done
immedia matters just make something up
you know based on some
hashtag then ADL backs them and now it's
legitimate so Business Insider piles on
now it's more legitimate these are all
just Democrat um organs and then Forbes
which is now a Democrat organ it didn't
used to be but Forbes um I think it was
sold by the Forbes Family but it turns
into just garbage at this point Forbes
is so Forbes is just Democratic garbage
uh and then the Washington Post the New
York Times and other media Outlets then
they site Forbes and Business Insider to
perpetuate The Narrative uh in reality
the corporate media uses personal tax
blah blah it's propaganda not
journalism now do you do you see how
they laundered the fake
news if the only place it appears was
Media Matters that's the lowest level of
credibility because even Democrats know
that that's just propaganda right there
there's no I I don't think there's any
Democrat who understands politics who
thinks Media Matters is some kind of a
journalistic
Enterprise so then the ADL which has a
slightly better reputation than Media
Matters because people don't know that
maybe they used to be good but but
they're definitely just corrupt and evil
and malevolent Democrat Force at this
point so now ADL adds a little
credibility because people don't haven't
caught on to what the adl's up to and
that allows Business Insider that is the
is just a little bit more credible but
shouldn't be than the ADL so now you've
you've ratcheted up your credibility
from the worst Media Matters to just
slightly better but terrible ADL to just
maybe slightly better Business Insider
but now you're talking about something
everybody's heard of huh maybe you
didn't know what the ADL was maybe you
didn't know what Media Matters was but
you probably heard a Business Insider so
now it sound incredible because you
don't know that Business Insider long
ago turned into a cesspool and just a
Democrat
organ but now Forbes gets in and you say
to yourself Forbes isn't that like a
republican thing oh my God even a
Republicans will say it but you don't
know that Forbes is no longer any kind
of a credible entity I guess it used to
be but at the moment it's just a
Democrat organ but you probably didn't
know that how many of you knew that I
found out when they went after me when
Forbes started hammering on me I thought
what's going on here Steve Forbes
literally would contact me every
Christmas for several years to ask me to
autograph my books for members of his
family Steve Steve
Forbes he owned
Forbes and I couldn't understand why
Forbes was going after me and I
complained to him once and I don't
remember what he said but I didn't
realize the business had been sold so it
I think that's I think that's what's
going on I think the business was sold I
need a fact check on that but I think it
was um so if you didn't know that you
think oh my God even even Republicans
have this opinion about this and then by
the time he gets to the Washington
Post even Democrats don't know the
Washington Post is not real
journalism and they think that the New
York Times is real as well so do you see
how they laundered it let me give you
the list again and and is from the least
credible up to what Democrats think is
credible but Republicans know better
least credible Media Matters next
ADL next Business
Insider next
Forbes Washington
Post New York Times so they got this
 from one hashtag all the way up
to the New York Times now that's
good now if you didn't know that this is
a well
organized understood op and that it
won't be the first time or the last time
you see this
play it it's completely different once
you see the gears of the machine isn't
it and I think that's what's different
about 2024 in 2024 we're calling all
their plays before they happen because
now we see the gears of the machine um
you know smart people you know the Glenn
and greenwalls and Etc and kakoa uh have
been uh helping us understand how this
big Democrat machine works and once you
see all the gears of the machine you can
predict what it does next right and
we're doing it people are predicting
what's we all expect that they'll be uh
big
protests at least in the summer and
certainly if Trump gets elected that
they'll be protest after but we all know
they're not
real when BLM was happening it kind of
looked real to me and when antifa was
happening I was thinking they don't look
totally real but maybe a lot of them are
but if it happened today we wouldn't we
would know that none of it's real and
there might be like some new
organization the the new the new uh you
know Wall Street whatever that group was
or you know it's going to be some new
fake organization popping up if they
need one so we knew all the
plays so and that's why I tell you if
you're not following kako the great what
you need to do if you want this world to
be a better place is follow him because
of this because of this you want to
boost this signal every time they come
after one of
us your your best reaction your let's
say your bodily defense system you know
your white blood cells if you if you're
looking to defend the organ ganism
against attack you need to concentrate
your fire and make sure you're boosting
the message of the the good ones and
kako the great is absolutely the the
content is
Sensational uh but you need to follow
them just because they're coming after
them that'd be good enough by
itself all right well uh so basically uh
Israel uh so the international cour
Justice ruled
15-2 uh on the question I guess South
Africa brought to the international
court of justice the question of
Gaza and whether or not it was a
genocide being committed by
Israel now um this is one of those
stories I think the initial reporting
was basically all
wrong um and we're just getting a
clearer image of it now
so so it looks like the court basically
basically is asking Israel to maintain
records and demonstrate in the future
that they're not committing a
genocide now that's not
terrible but it still puts Israel in the
position of uh they have to defend
against being a genocide which sort of
is the Assumption you're a genocide
unless you provee otherwise you know the
opposite of innocent will proven guilty
but it's a government so you know
governments have to be transparent now
do you think it's in any way possible
for Israel to uh keep all the
information that would get to the point
of whether somebody else thinks that it
was a
genocide because that's sort of
subjective isn't it they would have to
guess was somebody else would think they
should be keeping I don't know how you
could possibly do that so it seems like
a setup that there's no way they can
accomplish what the court is asking
which is make sure you're transparent so
we can decide later if you were a
genocide or not I don't think anybody
could do that even if they wanted to
because you don't know exactly what
information in the future you should be
protecting or what they'd ask for and if
they ask for more than you legitimately
thought was worth protecting what are
you going to do are you then guilty of a
genocide because you didn't know what
records to keep or something like that I
know so the whole thing's
illegitimate I don't think it'll have
there's you know no real impact on
Israel at the moment
but uh Netanyahu of course blasted them
for for even entertaining the thought
the self-defense was
genocide now here's how I see it and
probably many of you do as well let's
say your neighbor had 15
children and you went over there with it
one day with a machine gun and you shot
everybody in his family sort of a mass
murder genocide in that case wouldn't
you agree I would I'd call that a a mass
murder you know sort of in the the
family of a genocide but smaller yeah so
at least a mass
murder now suppose
instead that neighbor was training all
of his own children to wear suicide
vests and one at a time they were coming
to your house to try to kill you but
maybe maybe you got lucky and you
weren't there once and you know it blew
up the living room but you got it fixed
and the next time the next kid came up
um you know you had a gun so you shot
him in the sidewalk and he detonated in
the sidewalk all right now you're still
living next to your neighbor he's got 13
kids left and he's told you directly I'm
training them all to kill you so instead
of waiting for them to come one by one
from next door to kill you you say I'm
going to take my machine gun and I'm
just going to kill everybody there I'd
call that self-defense what would you
call
it what would you do you call it I'd
call it self-defense I would say
murdering his 13 children who had
committed no crimes under that specific
situation 100%
self-defense and with no ambiguity to me
that's not even a gray area now I don't
think analogies should be used yeah
right I don't think analogies should be
used in place of
reason so you shouldn't use the analogy
to decide what Israel you know should do
or can do or did right so don't take the
analogy and say oh let's just apply it
to Israel and we're done thinking
instead use the analogy in the correct
way which is to sort of open your mind
to a frame for understanding Israel so
now let's just look at
Israel if Israel doesn't kill basically
everybody who has sworn to kill them and
has tried then they have not executed
self-defense very well in my opinion
they have a right to kill everybody who
ever said we want to kill kill the
Israelis because they have clearly shown
that it's not just talk they're
operationalizing it they're training the
kids they're brainwashing them they're
they're literally training them to go
kill Israelis under those conditions you
can kill all of their
children I mean the the the push back
would be insane and I don't think that's
going to happen I don't think Israel is
going to kill all their children but uh
they do have an ethical and moral um
right to do that it's just so
impractical it can't possibly happen but
in my opinion Israel is operating under
complete
self-defense um I'm 100% supportive of
everything they do it is war and don't
be silly there will be war crimes maybe
not
prosecuted just like every other War
there will be terrible atrocities that
won't be prosecuted like every war so
the question is do you do War or not in
this case it was obvious they had
to so do I care that the Palestinians
have weaponized their kids to the point
where Israel would be wise to slay
them it's a
tragedy it's also nothing else she can
do about
it yeah nothing else she can do about it
so I don't think there's any chance that
Gaza will be ever run by Hamas or even
even the Palestinian without Israel's
thumb on everything and that's the only
way it's going to go uh meanwhile the
hoodies fired another anti-ship
ballistic missile this time towards the
USS
Carney
what what I thought they were just
shooting at transportation and tanker
ships they just fired a ballistic
missile at one of our
warships now we shot it down so the ship
had anti-ballistic missiles and luckily
it
worked
but now the the Carney is a destroyer so
that's a pretty serious
ship well what are we supposed to
do yeah it's easy to say War but that's
what they're asking for aren't they
aren't the hoodies trying to lure us
into
war because they're not just trying to
stop shipping I think they're trying to
lure us into
war wouldn't it make more sense to take
out the leadership of
Iran than the
hoodies and I feel like I feel like
Trump would put that on the
table and I think it needs to be on the
table at this point I think somebody
says you know the last thing we want is
a war with Iran but we'll take out your
leadership if you've keep this up and
then do it then do it cuz I don't think
we could have a greater risk than we
have now CU see Iran is clearly willing
to do lots of dangerous things to
destroy everything in the Middle East
including us and Israel and under those
conditions um you know the last thing I
want is a war with Iran a war with Iran
would have blowback in the Homeland
would stop start blowing up in America
really fast yeah you you wouldn't be
able to travel in the inner cities for a
while yeah we we would America would
close down for a few months if if
Iran got taken out uh because there are
terrorist cells I'm I'm sure here
already I'm sure they're here and ready
to activate without any with any orders
they would just see that they it's time
to activate so I don't think I want to
war with any part of Iran's military but
dropping a mother of all bombs wherever
the great leader is and just saying we
warned you but at the very at the very
least we should warn them that that's
what we plan to do because I don't have
a better plan what's a better plan than
taking out the
ayats do you have a better
plan I don't know I don't think there's
an economic way because the um the
countries that get any kind of economic
sanctions they just find ways around
it take out the oil oh oh there you go
take out their entire oil
industry yeah that's the way to go
that's better that's better yeah we we
we could actually here's what I'd
do I I would make a Target list of
Iranian
assets and match them one toone with
hoodie missiles or even the attacks on
our proxies and attack on our troops in
the Middle East where they're stationed
and I would say the the the next missile
is is going to cost you this facility
the one after it is going to cost you
this facility and actually just give
them a menu say here's your menu these
are things that are going to disappear
in Iran and on this schedule and every
time you send a hooti missile at
us um we're going to go down the menu to
item number two and it's just going to
disappear all
right um one head at a
time this assumes they don't already
have the
bomb
yeah it does assume that but it also
assumes that no matter what they're
going to do with the bomb Israel is
going to destroy them once it's
operational because they have
to
um see a government that will not adhere
to the Supreme Court of will be left
okay well Trump was trying to bankrupt
them but it wasn't
working um because their facilities were
still making and shipping oil now I
assume that if we were to do something
like that take out their oil facilities
that their terrorists would take out our
oil facilities and they would attack
Israel directly and all that
stuff plutonium and Richmond
project yeah that seems like that would
be
fruitful all right
so um that's all you got for today
thanks for joining on the YouTube and
Rumble and X platforms and I will see
you tomorrow for more
fun
