good morning everybody
and welcome to the highlight of your
life
my life
civilization itself
historians will write about this moment
forever
and if you'd like to take it up a notch
i know that's the kind of people you are
you're always ready to take it up a
notch well you don't need much all you
need is a copper mug or a glass a tanker
chelsea style canteen juggler flask
vessel of any kind
if you fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure it's the
dope being here the day the thing that
makes
everything better
it's called
the simultaneous sip go
oh i undersold it again i undersold it
it was better than i thought
i don't know i'm just going to have to
invent new words for the greatness of it
well cbs evening news had an important
story
about a prominent french scientist
who tweeted around a photo that he
claimed was an image of a distant star
taken by the james webb telescope
but in fact it was not a distant star no
it was not a distant star
it was a slice of a sausage
sitting on a counter
so apparently the prominent french
scientist said it was a joke
but
i feel like we overspent on the james
webb space telescope
i don't know what the budget was
to build a space telescope
but i'm thinking it's not cheap
and do you realize that everything that
you can see in the space telescope
already exists in your own kitchen
yeah
you want to see an asteroid
it looks like a grape
um maybe it looks more like a raisin
so i mean a desiccated grape plus a
um
yeah it's all there
it's all in your kitchen you do not need
the james webb space telescope big waste
of money
well lightning struck three times near
dc and
hit three people
so three people were struck by lightning
near
near the capitol
uh how do you think the news handled the
fact that three people got struck by
lightning
um if you thought that they blamed that
on climate change
well bingo
bingo yeah it turns out that now climate
change is going to start
uh killing individual people
just sort of picking them out
and sort of like you see that guy you
sort of loitering around by the white
house fence
should we send a
you know maybe a flood
no we don't hate all the people there
how about some kind of a hurricane
situation
no again
we don't hate everybody but we kind of
hate that guy lightning
how about just a lightning strike
yeah we got him
good job
and that's how climate change works it
targets individual people now they've
taken it up a notch
what's missing in the story is the
political affiliation
of all three people struck by lightning
i'd like to know for example
were they democrats
i don't know i mean statistically you've
got to ask that question
what if all the people who are struck by
lightning in washington dc
are democrats
i'm not saying that would mean anything
but it would
this is the one time they don't put that
information in the story about
washington dc i feel if it's a story
about washington d.c
they're going to throw your political
affiliations in there no matter what the
story is
not if you got struck by lightning
because if it looks like god is picked
aside
you don't want to report that exactly
the way it happened
well it seems that god has picked
society doesn't like the democrats three
down so far now there's nothing funny
about people getting hit by lightning
you people are disgusting
that's not funny
so stop laughing
well this alex jones trial went to a new
level i guess the jury decided on the
punitive damages
so he was already on the line for four
some four point something million
but now they've added 45 million in
punitive danger damages so now he's up
to 49.3 million
and that's just two of the people who
have sued him
i don't know how many other people will
sue him
now
it seems to me that free speech got a
lot more expensive
are you all aware that there's a thing
called professional liability insurance
have you ever heard of that
it's what people like me
have to get
because we get sued a lot right this
just sort of comes with being a public
figure he is sued a lot
now i wonder if he had such uh insurance
probably not i mean i've already heard
of it i think the insurance companies
would be putting up the defense if that
were the case but there is insurance
that you get so that you don't fall into
this situation
where you know you don't have any
coverage
so
what is this going to do to the rates i
pay for my insurance
this is very expensive for me
like literally
this
i think i mean i'm speculating
but if this becomes the new normal or
the insurance company imagines this
looks like the future
then what the hell are they going to do
to my premiums
because i would be the next 50 million
dollar loss right
potentially
you mean i could say something crazy and
somebody consume
now i don't do what alex jones is
accused of doing
which is intentionally spent spreading
uh conspiracy theories that's what he's
accused of his defenses that he believes
what he says
which is a really good defense
how did how exactly did they prove that
he didn't believe it i didn't watch the
details of the trial but were there text
messages or any documentation
that proved he didn't believe what he
was saying because that's important
right
have you seen that reported in the news
it feels i feel like if that came out at
trial
you would definitely see that right
he didn't put on a defense
there was no trial who's saying that
who's saying there was no trial i'm
watching it in the news
it was a default judgment because he
didn't put on the defense
something about this doesn't make sense
a default judgment for not complying
with discovery
huh he's prevented from defending
himself all right so there's something
else going on here
is that was a default judgment
that does not sound like
something that will stand up on appeal
and i don't know anything about anything
and even i think it won't stand up on
appeal
because
isn't there a part missing here there's
a part where they have to prove he knew
that it wasn't true
what he was saying right
i didn't see any evidence
presented that would suggest he knew
that
if you could be sued for 50 million
dollars successfully and i suspect it
won't be successful but don't know yet
if you could be sued for 50 million
dollars
for saying something that you believe to
be true
and it turns out to be wrong
uh do you want to live in that world
is that the world that where just being
wrong is enough for you to be sued for
50 million dollars
we're all wrong all the time it's a
pretty common situation
so to me this alex jones thing uh
i don't know
the degree to which the jury was
properly vetted but to me it just looks
political
it looks like a political outcome it
doesn't look like a legal outcome to me
uh the important news today is that pete
davidson and kim kardashian apparently
are breaking up
well who saw that coming
to me they look like a couple that could
last the ages
um i mean it's not like either of them
have any issues
so i'm surprised that didn't work out
uh well israel's under attack pretty
pretty major attack rocket attacks
coming in from gaza
and the iron dome is stopping some of
them
but
um it looks pretty grim over there and
i'm seeing some videos where apparently
you have like 10 to 15 seconds
to get to a bomb shelter if you're in
one of the affected areas in israel to
get to a bomb shelter from the time that
the alarms go
how many people are within 10 to 15
seconds of a bomb shelter
maybe in israel everybody is i don't
know so it's just a question is that
practical
how often can you even get to a bomb
shelter
and what qualifies as a bomb shelter but
i guess things are pretty grim over
there so the iron dome is catching some
of the rockets
but not all
now effectively this is um
israel's at war with iran won't you say
because the the rockets coming in are
from iranian proxies they're funded by
iranians they're propped up by iranians
so isn't this just israel being at war
with iran
and i would say that this gives israel a
full moral cover to attack iran itself
i'm not saying they should
but in terms of morally or in terms of
the rules of war or any of that
um i think iran is now fair game
for israel
don't recommend it i don't recommend it
but they've they basically said here we
are come get come get us
so maybe that will happen
well here's a little celebrity news do
you know actress anne hesh or heish
h-e-c-h-e
ann heyche apparently she's got a little
uh
mini cooper and she crashed into a house
uh in mar vista
so there was quite a quite a bit of
damage she crashed into a house but
that's not the interesting part she
apparently got her
car out of that house
that she damaged and very soon um drove
into another house
and the second one caught on fire and
she had some burns
she went to the hospital and she's not
in good shape
pretty major burns
so one actress destroyed two houses with
a mini cooper and i'm thinking
how many
how many actresses with mini coopers
would it take to take care of this whole
gaza rocket situation
because i feel like you just drop enough
actresses with mini coopers
over in the whole gaza area and just say
do some chores you know do a couple
errands
oh just drive around a little bit
i feel like they would
you know
destroy enough things that the rockets
wouldn't be able to shoot i don't know
it's just an idea i'm just i'm just
brainstorming here
so
do you think i should run for president
does anybody think that
any any votes what are you hearing me
does anybody think so
no
well uh what do you think uh
artificial intelligence thinks about
that question
so uh i keep mentioning machiavelli's
underbelly the
twitter account where there's a lot
about ai and
and we see a lot of questions being
asked to ai by the owner of the account
who shall remain nameless
but here's the interesting things number
one here's how this started
uh so machiavelli's machiavelli's
underbelly that's the twitter account
he tweeted this
he said i'm available as an ai conductor
for political campaign strategy
and ai empowered and automated memetic
warfare operations to the first
politician who offers me one million
dollars
for the duration of the campaign
plus a 10 million dollar bonus when you
win
what do you think of that now you'd have
to assume first of all that the person
making the offer is qualified
he does seem to work in this area
and from what i can see knows more about
ai than most people
you know that i know
so he does seem to have some credentials
and he's made this offer to use ai to
help somebody win a campaign what do you
think of the price one million dollars
with a 10 million bonus for success what
do you think
well
it's either way too expensive if ai
isn't quite there yet so if ai can't get
the job done it's way too expensive
if ai
is up to the task
it's really cheap
so this is either the most overpriced
offer in the world
or it's really a bargain and the answer
is where is ai right now
well the person making the offer says
it's there already
there meaning it could help you win the
campaign
i don't know it might
i mean i feel like there are some things
it could do already and probably will
uh
become more important yeah even even
though the interfaces are open to the
public
that doesn't mean you would know how to
use them
asking the right question is important
for example
a question was recently asked
should scott adams
run for president
and uh you know machiavelli's underbelly
asked this question and fed into the ai
i forget which one he was using
um
the my wikipedia page
so based on my wikipedia page plus
i don't know does ai look for other
sources i'm not sure i don't know if it
automatically does that
but here's what the ai said to this
question
should scott adams run for president of
the united states
the answer was yes scott adams would
make a good presidential candidate
he has the ability to appeal to both
sides of the aisle and is able to
persuasively argue his point
additionally he has a strong track
record of correctly predicting political
outcomes
keep in mind
that was all the ai
i don't believe that there's anything in
those words that it found
it drew i think it drew those
conclusions based on looking at the
evidence
i don't think you just took somebody's
opinion and parroted it
i think that's actually its opinion
it's not a it's not a correct opinion
but i think it's actually it's opinion
all right here's some more
so there's a follow-up question the
follow-up questions are just to get it
to keep talking right
next question was uh what are some re uh
some other reasons he should run
some other reasons that scott adams
should run for president of the united
states include his experience as a
successful businessman
questionable and his desire to help
improve the country well that part's
true he has also been endorsed by some
high-profile people including donald
trump
has donald trump endorsed me
not as a candidate obviously
but
i don't know endorsed
again
a.i chose that word
because i don't believe there's any
human who ever said that
trump ever endorsed me
i mean give me a fact jack but i don't
think any human ever said that because
there's nothing in evidence like that
but hey i think so
ai thinks that trump isn't endorsing me
sort of in kind i guess in in a way
so then it was asked what else can you
tell me that might convince me and then
the ai says other reasons to support
scott adams as a presidential candidate
include his intelligence
okay
and his willingness to listen to all
sides of an issue
how did it know that
how did a.i
identify me as someone willing to listen
to both sides of the of an issue
because i think it's true
but whoever wrote that down
did somebody read that somewhere
because i don't believe
you know i see it on twitter sometimes
but it's not like there's some
uh i don't believe
wikipedia says i listen to both sides of
the issues
where does that come from
right
somebody says ego buffet we're going to
get rid of you the all the people with
weak egos
can't handle a conversation like this so
if you have a weak ego
you should go work on that but i'll hide
you from this channel so that you don't
bother the rest of us
all right uh and then the last question
was what else just to see if there's
anything the ai has to offer
it says adams has also been praised for
his strong communication skills which
could be a valuable asset in his role as
president
additionally has a proven track record
of being able to get things done
both in business and politics
where did that come from
again i don't believe there's any human
who has ever said in public
that i have an ability to get things
done in both business and politics
now i think i do i think i do have that
ability but nobody's ever said it like
in those words that i've ever heard i
mean i imagine i would have heard it
sounds like something i would have heard
but i've never heard that
these do look like ai opinions
it looks like it formed a freaking
opinion
without parroting a human what do you
think about that
now here's the problem
ai only operates on the information that
is provided
or
or does it
or does it do you think the ai just
looked at my wikipedia page because
that's what it was fed to know who i am
or did the ai go and look at everything
that can be said about me and then use
the wikipedia page basically to know
it's the same person and not much else
i don't know
i don't know
but it's pretty shocking
that this thing had a full-blown
perfectly written opinion about me
that isn't too far off
from what let's say from what other
people might say yeah i'm not claiming
that it's an accurate summation of me
can you deal with that on
youtube for the people on youtube have
weak egos
can you deal with the fact that it's
interesting that it said that
it's not about me telling you how
awesome i am that's not really the point
all
right it does
the ai makes excellent sentences
and the ai sentences are perfectly
um understandable more so than human
sentences by far
all right yeah i think it took the
wikipedia thing and then extended it by
what it knew from the rest of the world
so that's happening
does anybody remember that
in the
election between
trump and hillary clinton does anybody
remember that early on in that cycle
i offered for one billion dollars i
would help hillary clinton win the
election
anybody remember that
and
and the thing the reason i thought it
was funny to do it
is that
i was the only one who knew that it was
a bargain
that was it was sort of like a
a public prank
you know the prank was that you don't
know it's worth it it was totally worth
it if they'd paid a billion dollars it
probably could have moved moved the
needle for it
um
yeah because because hillary needed a
little help it wouldn't have been that
hard really it wouldn't have been
just you know do something about the
deplorables and you'd be fine
how easy would it been for hillary to
win the election
i feel like pretty easy
i think she would have just had to say
stuff like
you know um
you know i probably shouldn't have said
that deplorable saying why don't why
don't we all just come together and stop
bickering i mean it would have been easy
it would have been easy but she didn't
go that way
all right um so
million dollars were worth the price so
i guess uh
china has uh
lobbed a whole bunch of missiles in and
around taiwan just to
show them what for because
nancy pelosi visited
and
china is getting really tough so here
are some of the things that they're
doing because of that pelosi visit to
taiwan
china will no longer be talking to the
u.s and coordinating
with us about climate change
now
how about that
china is no longer going to be
coordinating with us and talking to us
about climate change
what were they doing before
that's going to be different
before they were just talking to us
and trying to get us to do expensive
things that they didn't need to do
are we worse off not talking to them
i feel like that was sort of a neutral
situation
so i'm not too worried about that but
that's not all they're also not going to
be talking to us and communicating about
their military
decisions
now again i have a question
i haven't followed it closely but i
don't recall the time
when china was checking with the united
states
to see what kind of military decisions
they should make
were they doing that before
we're thinking of building a battleship
but we don't want to do it unless you
guys are cool with it
and then we say you know we're cool yeah
just go build a battleship that's fine i
don't see what could go wrong
and then they do is that how it worked
before
now i get the part where maybe you want
to warn the other side if there's going
to be a military exercise
just so there's no
false signaling
but i imagine they would still do that
because that's good for them as well
so
have we just learned that we don't need
china for anything except
manufacturing
and and that we need to get back as soon
as possible
yeah i don't know
to me it doesn't look like we lost a
thing
and
what did we learn by seeing that china
can
put a bunch of missiles
uh on all sides of taiwan what did that
tell us that we didn't already know
well nothing
there's nobody who didn't know that
china could conquer taiwan if it wanted
to
it would just have massive losses and
you know repercussions politically etc
but nobody's under the impression that
they can't do it
of course they can do it
all right
um
what else is going on
uh so yeah and also china has sanctioned
nancy pelosi personally
and
that should make a big difference
because what was nancy pelosi doing
before
that required china's approval
thinking
uh was nancy pelosi getting her fentanyl
directly from china
and mixing it up in the lab or did she
do what everybody else does and get her
fentanyl through the cartels
originally from china but
i don't know these are devastating
sanctions
so now nancy pelosi can't
i know
get discount fentanyl i don't know i
can't think of anything that makes a
difference
well let's talk about elon musk and
twitter
i finally got a little bit of maybe a
beginning of an understanding of why
elon musk thinks he can prevail
now the setup is that
the deal the original deal
that elon musk is trying to get out of i
guess
said that
twitter couldn't guarantee how many bots
they had so you just have to do the deal
without knowing that for sure
i'm paraphrasing but essentially they
did have very clear language that says
we're not
we're not guaranteeing the number of
bots being a percentage of traffic at
all
now
so if the only thing he he complained
about
was that there were too many bots
i'm not sure he would have a case
because he signs something that says it
doesn't matter how many bots there are
that's as clear as they can get right
sign this that says you don't care how
many bots there are and you're not going
to make a big deal about it
hey there are too many bots let's make a
big deal about it so that's the way the
news is reporting it
but there's a level of
nuance here that i had not been
associated with before
and it i saw andre
on andrei
andrea oh andrea stropa
had a tweet in which elon musk confirmed
that that's the situation so i'll read
her tweet and just know that elon musk
has confirmed that this
describes it correctly
um
she says about musk's counterclaim about
twitter
clearly from the twitter's sec filings
the m dao and that stands for
monetizable daily active usage
so the number of active users
that you could put commercials in front
of advertisements
that's how many you can monetize
so the number of people you can monetize
is different from the number of trolls
because you can't monetize a troll
if you know the ritual right nobody's
going to want to advertise to a troll
or to a bot
and so
twitter
twitter filings said that that's what
the key metric is this monetizable users
and um its market value depends on that
and then it says that it's an ad hoc
metric created to protect this is uh
andrea's opinion i guess it's an ad hoc
metric created to protect twitter's
interests
no competitor uses something similar so
in other words twitter has developed
a thing that they measure
measure then nobody else uses the same
measure so you can't compare it so you
wouldn't be able to say oh twitter has
more or fewer bots than facebook or
whatever based on this alone
you couldn't do that
um and this says we define i'm sorry
um
and then when uh when musk requested
more information about the spam and fake
accounts
twitter provided a vague response they
gave some outdated data
then they offered fake data that's you
know
not a real fire hose
ngss then provided a clean data set
where they already suspended the
malicious accounts so basically it
looked like twitter was trying to
conceal
the data rather than present it at least
that's the allegation
and must said it's a good summary of the
problem
and then musk says if twitter simply
provides their method
their method
that's the key word if they just provide
their method of sampling 100 accounts
and how they're confirmed to be real
the deal should proceed on original
terms
what a baller offer that is
oh my god
so
here's the nuance
elon musk is not complaining directly
that there are too many bot accounts
he's complaining that they're selling
him a company with a metric
that
that is just
so basically it's a fraudulent metric
it's not a question of what number it
produced
it's a it's a question of the metric
can't be used for anything useful
or it's not credible the way it's being
presented so in other words he doesn't
know what he's buying because although
they've said it doesn't matter how many
bots there are they have said wait for
it
they have said
that the measure of the monetizable
users is key to their business
now try to hold these two things that
you had at the same time
this measurement that they use to tell
how many are real users
is fundamentally it's the driver of
their businesses creates all of their
value
all of their is based on this metric
they won't tell you what it is
you you want to spend 44 billion dollars
on a company
that's got a little metric
and the entire value of the company
depends on how that metric works
and he says show me the metric
and they won't do it
now that's different
that's different
from show me the data you got that
that's a big difference
if the problem is show me the data he
has no argument
because he already signed something that
says the data might be wrong
right and it looks like he's not
fighting that point
he's not he's not fighting the point of
is the data right or wrong which we all
thought he was he's fighting the point
of you're selling me are you trying to
sell me a company
that has as its claim of value this
algorithm that you won't show me
why would i pay 44 million dollars for
an algorithm
that is the engine of the company and
you won't even show me how it works on a
sample of a hundred
see how clever that is
and and why did we not understand that
until today and i'm not even sure i
totally understand it yet but i feel
like i'm closer
right
so it's not about the data because he
wouldn't win that it's about the
algorithm to come up with the data
because if the algorithm is completely
he doesn't have to argue about the
quality of the data
i think
i think
does that sound right
is anybody here who's a little closer to
this story
that could uh
you know i'd like to hear barnes or
fry talk about this a little bit
sounds close
okay i think it's close
anyway
um
as i told you omicron and joe biden go
together real well
so omicron joe is got something called
permanent omicron
he just keeps testing positive
uh
but it's sort of ideal because the
symptoms are trivial
it allows him to hide from the public
which always works well for his his
approval levels they're creeping up and
it best of all it keeps them out of hair
sniffing range
from miners
because he doesn't really need another
photo of him sniffing a little girl's
hair he really doesn't need that
uh so omicron joe
he's he's got a good thing going he
should ride that
now there's a story
that
director ray of the fbi
um handed over thousands of
tips about kavanaugh during the
kavanaugh hearings
and he gave it to the white house and
then the white house is who determines
which ones get investigated
and so the scandal here
according to the democrats is that there
were thousands of things that were
thousands of accusations against
kavanaugh that were not
followed up on
but the fbi says well
we don't follow up on just anything just
to follow up we have to have a client
basically and the client was the white
house so if the if the white house says
follow up on these but not on these
they're just going to do what they're
asked sounds like and apparently that's
the way it's always been done
so there's nothing unusual about that
the fbi would only act
on the tips that the white house looked
at and said yeah these look serious
and these are not
so here's the question
did kavanaugh
rape thousands of women
and
the information was not followed up on
or is it more likely that in this sort
of situation you would get thousands of
fake
allegations just like you'd expect
well you have to think that almost all
of the allegations if not everyone
were fake
so was the fbi supposed to follow up on
every
scamp thing
here's the dirty secret of this sort of
stuff
you can usually tell by looking at it
if it's credible
right you just hear the story you're
like
uh-huh
and then then you say he flew his
spaceship
to kansas where he molested you okay
you know generally you can kind of tell
from the story itself
how likely it is to be true and you
don't have the ability to follow up on
everything
you can't follow up on thousands of tips
literally thousands you can't follow up
on
so i'm not sure there's any story here
at all except that the system worked the
way it always did
and the democrats are saying my god that
means that kavanaugh was really guilty
no
i don't think it means that at all
i just think it means that of course
there are going to be thousands of tips
in this situation and
almost all of them or all of them will
be just complete
well here's the payoff
now there's two payoffs i now get to the
best part
of the presentation are you ready so you
waited through all this
this first part here's the good part
story number one
why can't i get anybody in the news to
ask of this question of a prominent
democrat
i'm going to keep pushing on this
this is the question i want any
prominent any prime minister democrat to
be asked doesn't matter who
any prominent democrat or supporter or
pundit
just ask this question
if
if you could rig an election
to keep a white supremacist out of
office
and you believe that that was the actual
situation
would you do it
that has to be asked of every democrat
because remember they do believe
that trump was a white supremacist
so you need to ask them would you
be okay with the white supremacist
president
or would you take the risk of rigging it
if you could and you thought you'd get
away with it
you have to make the democrats you
meaning the news industry and
and the public we have to make them
answer that question
because they've been getting away with
it far too long
the the imagination that
that they wouldn't have a reason to rig
an election
and again there's no evidence that i've
seen
that suggests that the election would
have gone differently
because it was rigged i've not seen any
evidence that convinces me that happened
but you need to ask them
if it was a reasonable question
and the problem is it was completely
reasonable for them to rig the election
under their assumption that they were
stopping hitler from taking power
basically
so
make them answer the question
make them answer the question now i know
people don't like to answer
hypotheticals but this one's a real
special hypothetical isn't it
you really have to put yourself out
there and say what's more important
what's more important that the system
worked
or that you kept
you know what you thought was a monster
out of an office
because i would have rigged the election
in that in that situation
if i believed
what they say they believe
that trump is such a monster if i were
in that situation
and i had to save the country from the
monster
i would ring the election if i had any
control over it
would you
let me ask the question of you
if you were in that situation
and you thought joe biden was not just
you know incompetent
but you thought he was hitler
would you rig the election if you could
i hope so
now some some of you actually wouldn't
so you would actually let a dictator
destroy the country
because you protected a system that
wouldn't exist after he destroyed the
country
does that make any sense
i think i'd have to push back on that a
little bit i get what you're saying
about the system being more important
but i only agree with you if who you're
looking at is a
a real live trump not the exaggerated
one
and a real joe biden not the exaggerated
one where he's already brain dead
if you're looking at that choice
then i would definitely say let's
protect the system even if maybe the
system had some
flaws in it
the system would be more important but
if you talk about literally electing
hitler
hitler is going to change the systems
the systems don't matter
if you wouldn't stop hitler from coming
to power if you could
you've got a lot to explain
now if you said you're afraid
well okay
that's actually a pretty good reason
yeah i actually completely
i give anybody a pass who just says
they're afraid
because you can't compare how afraid you
are to how afraid somebody else is
we like to do that
we like to think that the people who
went to war were brave
and the people who stayed home were not
brave
and maybe there's something to that
but i have to think we're just built
differently
there's some people who are brill who
are built to not worry about stuff that
they should
and there's some people are built to
worry about things that maybe they
shouldn't
all right so be careful about protecting
the system i'm all for protecting the
system
over small imperfections
but not over electing hitler you know if
you're going to do that then i'm going
to destroy the system if i need to stop
it
all right here's the best thing of the
day
i have no source for this whatsoever
but it was a cool uh video that i saw on
instagram so i
forwarded it to my story so go to
instagram and
uh look for me
i think
my instagram is
scottadams925 i think that's my
instagram
title
scottadams925
uh but anyway it's not i don't have a
check mark over there i don't have a
very big account but the thing i said
around was there was a researcher
who
was trying to figure out if what physics
suggests
is true
and what physics suggests is that our
consciousness can alter our reality
not just the way we see it
but the actual reality
and the test that he says they did and
he was involved in it
is that they had some true random number
generators and they had some people try
to move the random generator
such that instead of drawing a straight
line it would you know maybe go up
or down
and what they found was
what they found was
some people could change the random
number generator by their intentions
what
and others could not
what would be the name of the the people
who could not author the reality
yes npcs
so there actually now is a test to find
out if you're an npc
you can actually test for it you just
put them on the random number generator
and see if they can change it
and if they can't
they're just scenery
and if they can
they're a player
now i ever told you that i can author
reality
and you thought to yourself
well not literally
literally literally
yeah that that is my actual belief
my actual belief
no reservations
is that reality
at least whatever this reality is you
know might be bits but our reality is
absolutely changed by our intentions
the first person who told me that
is worth
many billions of dollars
the first time i ever heard that
it was mark benioff who uh
founded salesforce
and i was asking him you know about the
secret of his success or something like
that one day i was just chatting with
him before a speech i was giving for
salesforce
and
he told me that intention
is the thing that drives everything
and i remember hearing that and he
sounded smart he was obviously
successful and i could not process that
for years i could not process that i
knew it sounded right
but i couldn't figure out how to get
from the intention to
like what's the connecting tissue
how does intention get into the real
world except by actions right so i
thought that that really what was
missing is a system versus a goal you
know a process how do you get the
intention into the real world
well
maybe you don't have to do it
maybe the intention just goes into the
real world because that's what this test
would suggest
that you actually change random outcomes
by wanting them to change
now can you reproduce this test
i doubt it
it's a lot of fun to talk about but my
guess is
that if you try to do this and reproduce
it i don't think so
i would bet against it
but
my philosophy of life says that you
could
that it would be reproducible
i just don't know in the real world if
it if you could
just uh this test is a blind study or
it's just bs right so somebody says if
it's not a blind study it's bs
i'll accept that
um
you thought physicists were still in
disagreement
yeah but i think the disagreement has
more to do with the words they put on it
they don't disagree on the formulas
and the formulas suggest
exactly what we say i mean the
experiments and formulas do suggest
that human observation changes reality
and now we have a test that seems to
suggest it but
again
i'm going to put my skeptical hat on and
it was i it was something without a
source
on social media
what do you think of claims without
sources on social media that are
really big claims
i wouldn't believe
i wouldn't believe it
all right
um
isn't that exactly evidence of free will
if it is true
um
no
good question so the question is
would free will exist if we can change
our reality by your intention and the
answer is
in that example
your intention happened on its own
the the thing that would have free will
would be the things outside of you
because they could go either way
but it's your intention to move this so
you re you also remove this free will
now
so so i believe that no matter what
happens inside you
it's just what happens
i i guess i guess the edge case would be
if you use your intention
to change your opinion
if you use your intention to change your
opinion
or if you use your intention
to give yourself free will
i don't know that it's logically
possible
there are things that are um
unpredictable but that doesn't mean that
they're free will
they're just unpredictable
there's a hole in one an example well
hold on could just be chance
how much pot did you smoke this morning
not nearly enough
no i didn't smoke any pot this morning
this is this is my actual personality i
know
scary
all right um fate is succumbing to an
internal vacuum of ideas
huh
you know one of the most uh
you want me to say something that'll
blow your mind forever
i'm gonna leave you with a thought
who just that's just going to f you up
you ready
consciousness
is just that friction you feel between
what you expected to happen
and what actually happens
now that's the first part and i've said
that before
and you could disagree or agree now i'm
gonna now i'm gonna prove it
and my corollary to that that the only
the only way you experience
consciousness is that if what you expect
to happen
is a little different than what happens
even just in small ways
and then i'm going to take that to the
next level
if everything that happened
happened just the way you expected it
your consciousness would flip off it
would just turn off
do you know why
because everything you expected
would be just like you expected and
pretty soon you would stop seeing it
it would disappear
there's no friction
there would be nothing to keep alive
your consciousness
now
you're not sold yet are you
what is it that you do to go to sleep
you lay completely still until
until
what is happening to you your body
is exactly what you expect to happen
wait i'm laying completely still
the way i feel now
should feel exactly the way i feel in
the next second
the moment it's right
the moment is true
the moment is true that you're laying so
still
that your next moment will be identical
to your current moment
that's when you fall asleep
because as soon as the next moment and
the current moment are the same
you lose
consciousness
because you can't maintain consciousness
if what you expect
is exactly what's happening
and the only time you ever see that in
your real life is when you're laying
completely still
and trying to go to sleep
how about that
[Laughter]
how about that
explain anesthesia same thing
anesthesia as soon as you get it
it puts you in a case where your body
doesn't move
and so your next moment on anesthesia
will be just like your last moment
and then your sleep
now the the drug to sleep part is i
think a special case so i wouldn't i
wouldn't go too far into that example
but
consciousness is nothing but the
difference between what you expect and
what happened
and all you have to do is give the robot
that
sensation which is easy
and it has consciousness
the robot needs to know i think if i
take this step
i'll just move forward and everything
will be fine boop
true
i i think the temperature will be x well
it's this
if as long as the robot or ai is moving
through the world and measuring the
difference between what it expects and
what it's recording
it would have consciousness
that's it it would have consciousness
that's all it takes
you know assuming you could process that
difference you have to be able to
process the difference
it's that processing that gives it the
illusion of consciousness
what is a seizure then i don't know
so
so what do you think
that going to sleep proves that
consciousness is only the difference
between what you expect and what happens
you didn't expect that to be so good did
you no you didn't
well that is going to get you thinking
today
how high were you when you realize this
that's a good question
pretty high
pretty high
all right and that's all for now youtube
talk to you tomorrow
