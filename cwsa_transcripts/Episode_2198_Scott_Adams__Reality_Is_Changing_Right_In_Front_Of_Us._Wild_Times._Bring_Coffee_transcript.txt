that's the name thank you for reminding
me
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization
and you know what I say
let there be light Let There Be lighting
let us be prepared for once look at that
look at that
that's called production and quality
impressive I know if you'd like to take
this production quality up to a level
that nobody's ever seen before
well all you need is a cup of mug or a
glass a tanker cellist I'm a canteen
geographer of Alaska vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee
and join me now
in the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine hit of the day the thing makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens now go
yes I did get a haircut thanks for
mentioning it do I look more like my mug
now
yeah look at that identical
you cannot tell the difference between
me and the picture on my coffee mug
which one's me
you can't tell
you can't tell
well
today is just the weirdest weirdest
wonderful day
there is bad news too
but
everything is weird
and I'll I'll walk you through it but
that's the theme for today
reality has started to bend
in a way that's really remarkable
everything's in play right now
everything you think is true
is on the table
doesn't mean it's false but everything's
in play right now I don't think I've
ever seen that before have you does this
seem different to you are we here's what
I think
I think that the civilization
is going to another level of awareness
and it's going to be a bumpy ride
the bumpiness is what we're feeling now
but if you look at what we understand at
least the informed part of the public
what we understand to be true is
changing in such a fundamental way in
just the last few years but it seems to
excel have accelerated
and even today I would say has reached
some kind of Peaks so far
it's going to keep going
but here are the stories of the day did
I see that Sam bankman freed the crypto
alleged scammer guy
is back in prison
and is it true because I saw this and I
need a confirmation to this did he
really get put in the same jail that
Epstein died in
does that really happen
in the real world that actually happened
can somebody confirm that
can you confirm it's the same place that
Epstein
I mean not the same cell but
all right I'm not seeing a confirmation
of that but I I saw it on social media
so I don't know
I thought I thought you'd be confirming
that by now but you're not
so let's put a question mark on that
so uh Stephen King famous writer and
Lefty political person Stephen King
um
he asked this question
and uh
uh I thought it was uh worthy of me
answering it on Twitter he said on
Twitter so here's a question
if you consider yourself a loyal
American how can you possibly support a
man who fomented Insurrection in the
United States capital
that was that a good question
well it's a good question if you live in
a certain bubble of reality
so I thought hey
who better to clear up this situation
than me
so I answered him and I said
he was talking about the January 6th and
I said it's an absurd narrative half the
country believes
that's why you were so confused you have
literally been brainwashed by your team
and then parenthetically I said I'm a
trained hypnotist by the way so I'm
speaking as an expert
uh and then I said find out how many
times you've had the same experience
with this quiz and then I attached to
his tweet the 20 or so I don't know what
it's up to 20 or so major political
hoaxes that everybody on the left
believed
now what do you think happened if he saw
my tweet
now I attached 20 examples that are just
like this one 20. they're just like this
they're things that didn't happen but
his news told them they did
now
now he hasn't responded so at least I
haven't seen it I don't expect him to
respond
um but are you curious what somebody's
brain would do
aren't you
he did
no he did he didn't block me
um I don't think he blocked me
but are you curious what would happen to
his brain if he saw it
so just walk yourself through this
so suppose he sees that the Tweet comes
from me
now presumably he would know
what Dilbert is and who the Dilbert guy
is do you think
is that a fair assumption that you would
recognize my name
what do you think
probably probably you know most writers
know other writers
Etc so he would probably be aware
and then he might check to see how many
followers I have as sort of a you know
indication of weight so you see I have a
million followers
and
he would see that my interpretation is
very different from his
and that my interpretation does answer
the question
that doesn't make it right it's just
that you know the answer I gave
fits the variables in question right
there's nothing that's not explained by
it
but what would he do what do you think a
normal human brain would do when
presented with an opposite reality
that actually makes sense
now it's it's doubly interesting because
he's a fiction writer of you know great
renowned if you're a fiction writer
isn't it a little bit easier to move
from you know one reality to another
if you're given the opportunity
I think that people write fiction can
move move realities a little bit easier
than other people because they're used
to sort of living in a fake reality
while they write it
you know so it's just a it's a
capability you develop if you're a
writer basically a fiction writer I do
it when I write comics
in order to write a Dilbert comic I put
myself in the office I go okay I'm
standing there I'm in this situation
what's happening now
so
I'd be very curious if he looks at the
list of 20 hoaxes and he does what I've
seen other people do
all 20 of those are true
do you think that's going to happen
do you think he's going to look at a
list of 20 hoaxes which by the way the
news the news admits are hoaxes like the
you know the the hunter laptop would be
the the best example
anybody who looks at this list can very
clearly see that the news has been
giving you ridiculous fake news for
years
what do you think it would happen
now
here's what should happen
there should be massive cognitive
dissonance meaning that the reaction
would look like word salad or or an
attack
here's what you would expect
he would attack me personally
oh aren't you the canceled racist guy
right
so that would give him something to say
without having to address any of the
points so that'd be one way so you could
predict that one thing would just be a
personal insult another thing would be
ignoring it completely because it's too
awkward to respond to it can you imagine
if he responds he's never responded to
me in the past I've tweeted at him a few
times
so not responding would be my first
guess I think the odds of him responding
are no more than 10 percent
but the other possibility is wild
hallucinations
where you say everything on the list is
true why are you saying these are hoaxes
etc etc but he actually believes
that people wandering around without
weapons were at intent on literally
Conquering the country like actually
you believe that
you know a lot of people do I saw the
comments uh well the U.S Department of
Health and Human Services
has advised their employees in San
Francisco to work remotely because the
city is too dangerous
that's right
the federal government just told its
employees not to go outdoors in San
Francisco
it's too dangerous not to go Outdoors
don't even be there the place is too too
dangerous
um so at the same time a uh it was a
video of the Oakland Police riding
around in a armored vehicle
an armored vehicle in Oakland so
basically the you know the police have
gone full military I
do you think you should walk around in
Oakland no
also do you think you should drive
through Oakland or near it
not unless you got a full tank of gas
and make sure your cell phone's charged
because you don't want to have your car
break down anywhere near Oakland
our cities are frankly too dangerous
a number of people ask me my book will
be I hope if everything goes right on
Thursday this coming week my book will
be available for sale my new book called
reframe your brain which will be the
biggest thing that ever happened in the
United States
um
even if you don't realize it it will be
anyway you might not know it but it will
be the most important book ever
published
excluding religious documents
um
but people ask me hey Scott are you
going to do a book tour you know where
authors go and they they go into
population centers and they sign books
for people
not a freaking chance
do you know what it would take to get me
to go to a city
in 2023 do you think I would actually go
to San Francisco
how about Berkeley
do you think I would go to Berkeley
do you think I would visit Oakland and
sign some books
how about Washington D.C
New York City
Los Angeles
because those are the places you go
right you always do Los Angeles New York
maybe Washington DC those are the book
tour places not a chance I'm not going I
wouldn't go near any of those places
number one as a canceled person who just
wouldn't be safe
I would make one exception though
I would make one exception
uh it's unlikely that this would happen
but if I ever got invited to be on The
Breakfast Club
uh this is Chicago right
Chicago
I would do that I would actually get on
the plane and go to go to Chicago to
talk to those guys because I think
they're kind of cool and they would be
exactly the it would be exactly the
right
you know kind of tension
for entertainment but I would take a uh
risk of dying to go into Chicago
to do that because I think it'd be worth
doing
all right
um so no no city tours
um I do plan to do some podcasts but
we'll see how that goes
well ESG continues to decline there's a
report for Bloomberg
the ESG has been removed from some parts
of the McDonald's website
um
now I don't know if that was intentional
or maybe they were just you know
revamping the website or something so
there could be an explanation but I
would say would you agree that ESG is
literally embarrassing
who who would agree with me with that
characterization that if you work for a
company that's putting ESG on their
website
that's embarrassing
because I think we all understand what's
going on at this point
you know I don't know who doesn't know
at this point that ESG is just
ridiculous destructive
ridiculous destructive now you
might not know that the other day I uh
changed the world
you don't know yet but you'll figure it
out and I did it with a reframe by the
way the new book that comes out next
week is a book of reframes teaches you
how to do it and gives you a bunch of
them to change your life in a variety of
ways but the reframe was that all
success is based on imitation
all success is based on imitation
we first look at what other successful
people do
and you at least adopt those things you
know okay they work harder they do this
they take some chances they stay out of
jail they don't do drugs or at least not
so much that it stops them from working
um
and it's it's pretty obvious stuff
everybody who has succeeded anywhere
ever
imitated other successful people now
most of the time the the really
successful ones added their own spin you
know your Steve Jobs your Elon Musk
at some point they're creating the rules
that the rest of us follow right so at
some point they're actually creating new
new techniques and rules
but mostly I think it's safe to say they
were also aware of or students of what
works and what doesn't and the only way
you know it works is you looked at other
people doing it oh you did that thing
and it worked I'll do that too
the moment you accept and by the way
there's no choice you will accept it
it's easy to accept the imitation
creates success because we all see it
a reframe works very quickly the moment
you heard that you agreed with it show
me prove it the moment I said to you
that success requires invitation
what did you say you said yes 100 of you
100 said yes right now when I said the
next part of this which is the critical
part if imitation requires success
how do you succeed if you're a black
person in America
because you would be asked to imitate
the people you've been told by ESG
are your oppressors
who Among Us would imitate our
oppressors
I wouldn't
I would not do that
if you're if you're Jewish and they said
you know to be successful you should
really dress up and Nazi regalia forget
that that doesn't make sense but imagine
a world where you were asked to do that
oh you know it's just symbolic no no no
no don't yes I know about the Holocaust
but let's not think about that now
to be successful everybody's wearing
these Nazis uniforms so you should play
along too you know I know you're just
being over sensitive about the past can
you let that go can you let the past go
just wear the Nazi uniforms like
everybody else and you'll be successful
too
imagine if that was the Jewish situation
the only way to do it
was to dress like a Nazi would they do
it
no well you know it's a big world so
there's always somebody who'll do
anything but now
if you were in that situation you'd say
okay show me any other way I can survive
that I don't have to wear that uniform I
would do anything but put that on
now that's a little more dramatic maybe
maybe not much than the Black American
situation
you've been taught since you were born
you know there was slavery you were
oppressed by a certain class followed by
you know how many decades of you know
severe discrimination at the hands of
who people who look like me right people
who dress like me look like me you talk
like me
then you then you get your CRTs and you
get your Dei then you get your ESG and
there's an entire industry
that's evolved to reinforce
that there's an oppressor class albeit
mostly the past but still in the in the
present
and there's a victim class
whoever was taught that they were a
victim and then asked to dress and act
like the people who were their
oppressors has that ever worked in any
society ever
of course not
of course not it couldn't possibly work
and every one of us know it and every
one of us can see it
so here's the part I'm
I'm adding today
let's let's say you buy into my
um my framing and I know you do every
one of you agreed by the way I'm
watching the comments
not a single disagreement
just think about that not a single
disagreement not a single person
you all see it it's obvious
here's the second part that's that you
might disagree with
the
the why of it you know the why black
America is not doing the things
they're successful people do
and again this is on average right there
are plenty of successful black people I
don't have to go through the whole
speech about whenever I talk about a
group of people I'm never talking about
all of them
never it's never about all of them
people are too different you don't need
to tell me because I'm telling you that
any mention of a group does not require
that you believe all of them are alike
right so we're at least adult enough not
to fall into that trap all right but
generally speaking there's some
generalities so the number one thing
that I'd like to add is that if two
groups act differently
it is not your problem if they get
different results and you should not be
the one to solve it
the only ones who can solve it and I
don't know what the solution is and I
think it would be arrogant and
inappropriate if I were the one who said
you know you black people should do this
thing differently
I feel like that's just a mistake
because remember I'm part of the alleged
depressor class the last thing anybody
wants to hear is advice from the
repressors
so I'm going to take that
as the smartest move
it's going to look like a lack of
empathy it's the opposite this is the
opposite of a lack of empathy I'm going
to show the greatest level of respect
and empathy for my fellow citizens of
the United States by saying you can
solve this
you know exactly what the problem is I I
honestly don't know the solution and I
don't even know what I'd try I don't
even know what I try first I have no
idea but
that's not for me to solve
I can tell you what it takes to succeed
but I can't tell you what's in your head
or how you should change it or how you
should think differently that that would
be completely out of place
I wouldn't want to hear it from anybody
else like if somebody were giving me
that kind of advice it wouldn't go down
that well
I'd like to figure it out myself
and I think that we should
we should be willing to give Black
America
the respect
of letting them work it out
and and the longer you try to fix it for
them the worse it gets
the worse it gets now I don't think this
was always the case I think when things
were you know slavery and Jim Crow and
all that stuff that you needed a big big
outside push
so in that case yeah white people should
be fully involved trying to fix this
horrible systemic situation
but once you get to where we are now
where it's really about any individual
who walks into a job can probably get
that job if they do the right things
did you hear the story about the uh the
Highly Educated uh black guy this just
happened he he had an engineering degree
no drug problems never been in jail
and he starved to death because he
couldn't get a job did you hear that
story
it was tragic it was a black man with
Highly Educated did everything right and
then he starved to death he actually
starved to death because he couldn't get
a job in America do you know why you
haven't heard that story
because it never happened and it
never will happened that cannot happen
in America it just can't happen
there are no poor educated people who
stayed out of jail
there aren't no well educated to the
point of being an engineer let's say you
certainly there are people with
educations who are struggling for
different reasons but if you do the
things that people do to succeed
it just works
there's not special rules for one class
of people
everybody who does the same rules of
success
they get there
now should I worry that one group has on
average on average
lesser performance than some other group
no stop caring about that it was it was
right to care about that when things
were dire slavery if you talk about
slavery absolutely you're talking about
classes of people that is the right
frame to talk about what's happening on
oh a whole class of people are slaves
the whole class of people are suffering
Jim Crow
in those situations yes you should
absolutely focus on the group because
you got to fix a group problem but we're
way beyond that now we're now in the age
of the individual
if the individual does the right stuff
they'll do great
do I care that one individual does worse
than another hmm not really because it
has to be that way there's there's no
way that will change do I care that the
average of some group is not doing as
well as the average of some group under
the specific situation
that they all have access to the same
rules of success in that case I don't
care
as long as the law is giving everybody a
good shot is every as long as everybody
has some path to succeed maybe not
identical paths but some path
you just have to let people work it out
so I think now we have to push it back
to the individual
and say look honestly I don't know why
things aren't working out for you I know
what works and I know what you're doing
and it's all the stuff that doesn't work
but you need to tell me why you're not
doing it it's not for me to tell you why
you're not doing it because as soon as I
tell you why you're not doing it
it's just trouble
I should just show you what works I
should make every availability to you
if you like an introduction yes
if you'd like some mentoring yes
if you'd like some access that maybe you
feel you're denied yes just ask if any
individual
wants individual help
yes
yes if a group wants to increase their
group average compared to another group
average no interest at all
because I'm not a group
and you're not a group
right I'm not a group you're not a group
I have no interest in making some kind
of weird average equal
but I'll help you
you individually sure
and if you bought my book you would be
on your way to success
all right uh here's a question that I
saw is that is the U.S government behind
the cartels
Jim beckmeyer asked that on Twitter
is the U.S government behind the cartels
now behind the cartels could be
defined in a number of ways
I would say that one way would be let's
say the CIA is working with one of the
cartels or something
another way would be if members of our
government were accepting bribes for the
benefit of the cartels
another way would be if they were just
afraid of the cartels maybe no money but
they were just afraid of them
no I don't know I don't have any
specific evidence of any of those things
I have no evidence
that would suggest any of that but I did
say this
um
I can't think of any other explanation
for what we're observing can you
what would be another explanation
for a complete unwillingness not an
inability not an inability
an unwillingness of our government to
stop this problem because would you
agree that we're not dealing with an
inability
does everybody agree with that
there's no there's nothing like an
inability to stop it
you do know that Afghanistan is out of
the sound of the poppy business
because Isis just decided or another
Taliban the Taliban just decided I guess
we're just not going to have drugs in
this country
they had the ability even the Taliban
could remove drugs from Afghanistan so
yeah we have all the ability
is clearly an unwillingness
what would cause an unwillingness
to solve our biggest deadly problem in
the United States fentanyl what would
cause that
well the only explanation is that the
government
has been co-opted in some fashion
and I don't have a I don't have a
hypothesis of what that fashion would be
but when we look at it do you think it's
a coincidence that the people who who
have the most aggressive stands are
independently rich
and Outsiders
independently Rich Outsiders want to
shut down the fentanyl trade to close
the border
people who are not as independently
wealthy and are and have been in the
government for a while they seem to be
less willing to do stuff that needs to
be done do you think that's a
coincidence no that's not a coincidence
and we live in a world now where the
reality is you know slowly becoming
clear to us all I'll tell you the
pandemic was the best thing that ever
happened to our brains
it doesn't feel like it it feels like it
feels like it broke your brain but it's
the only way we could get to the next
level of awareness
that level of awareness is everything
that can be corrupt is
everything
everything that can be corrupt it
already is
except for the elections all 50
elections you know run by the different
states those are all done properly
nobody knows why it's like a mystery
it's kind of but but I tell you there's
no evidence no evidence
all 50.
it's amazing it's like a big coincidence
all right
um so here's a report in the Wall Street
Journal that traded with China's way
down so China accounted for 13.3 percent
of U.S Goods Imports Imports during the
first six months of this year
thus below a peak of 21.6 for all of
2017.
the current level of goods of U.S Goods
Imports uh is that the lowest since uh
uh lower since 2003.
two years after China got into the World
Trade Organization
all right so this shift
um do you know when this started do you
know when the
the trade with China started to fall off
a roof do you remember what year it it
all happened
according to the Wall Street Journal
this happened the shift started in 2018.
as the Trump Administration imposed
tariffs on a range of Chinese products
2018. was there anything else that
happened in 2018
what else was happening in 2018
relative to this
2018 is when my stepson died
of uh fentanyl overdose
2018.
2018 is the year that I told you I was
going to destroy the economy of China
and I was going to make us decouple
the shift started in 2018.
probably just coincidence
what year did ESG start taking its
nosedive
did you did you notice that ESG sort of
fell off a cliff
right about the same
yeah it's 2022 wasn't it
what year did I say I was going to
destroy yes she
2022.
2022. was it 21. I think it was 22.
so probably just coincidences right
how many of you are looking at this
situation and scratching your head and
saying are you kidding
is this real
you can't tell can you
did I just predict well and you know get
in front of I prayed that was going to
happen anyway
or did I tell you what I was going to do
did I point for the fence and then hit
the ball over the fence where I was
pointing
which of those two things happened you
know that when I said China we're going
to decouple from China 100
of the people who earned me said that
said no it's just gonna be more every
year
one hundred percent one hundred percent
of everybody said that's not gonna
happen
I was the only one who was right
and 100 of the rest of you were wrong
just
if you're keeping track
keep track of that
all right let's talk about some other
things uh
um I guess uh attorney general Garland
has appointed a special counsel
for this Hunter Biden's stuff
Mark Levin who knows the law better than
I do so I'll just read his comment he
said a special counsel must be chosen
from outside the Department of Justice
so how did Garland appoint Weiss the
special counsel
now that's an interesting sub question
and I don't know the law well enough to
participate in this one but is that a
thing
did Garland actually pick
somebody that's not really even
the right person
and it was kind of interesting picked up
somebody this wise person now why is
Weiss famous
what did Weiss do recently that we
already knew about
wasn't he behind the the hunter Biden
sweetheart deal
or is it right what was he bad
Russia collusion somebody says I don't
know about that but he was behind the
sweetheart deal right
yeah so
now
if you appoint a uh special counsel what
do you think that does to the congress's
investigation so Congress was speedoons
you know in the middle of subpoenaing
people and talking do you think that
Congress can keep doing what they're
doing
once the special counsel is on board
I think the answer is no right
so this would shut down the Republicans
who were having great progress by the
way the Republicans did great
can we
can we say that
you know I spend most of my time
criticizing bad behavior but I gotta say
this Comer fellow
and uh and Jim Jordan and there may be
some other people that I should mention
but have they not done a great job on
this
I think they have I think this is real
service
I think the
I think the country should appreciate it
McCarthy yeah so you know they don't
they don't only make mistakes you know I
got lots of problems with both the
Republicans and and Democrats but in
this one situation I would say there are
several people who did exactly what I
would want them to do as a citizen so
thanks for that
um but can we agree that this looks
suspicious as hell
suspicious as hell it looks like
uh it's a play or an OP to keep Hunter
safe it does not look like any kind of
Justice the way you would recognize it
can you agree that it does not look even
slightly like a legitimate process we
all agree with that right it doesn't
look legitimate
now the argument that it is legitimate
is that this is the person who you know
was involved in the original
Hunter investigations and apparently he
was limited in his abilities although
there's a big question because Garland
said he wasn't going to be limited but
maybe there was after all we're not sure
that sort of might be more of a
bureaucracy question but this should
authorize him to do everything that
needs to be done
to to bring us to a good conclusion
about Hunter and what he did and did not
do and what to do about it
so on one hand you can make a real
strong argument that it's the right
thing to do
on the other hand every bit of it looks
crooked
would you agree they they can definitely
make the argument oh this is the right
person because reasons reasons reasons
and you listen to the reasons reasons
reasons you go okay well those are all
true
I mean it does make sense that one
person who knows the most and is already
involved and he's available and blah
blah blah yeah finish the job
on the other hand this is very
conveniently taking him out of the takes
him out of the headlines you know when
the election is coming
so it looks dirty to me
would you agree
I I would think that if they wanted
something like a good conclusion they
would have picked somebody else I think
if they wanted a a political conclusion
they would pick Weiss
so to me it looks crooked
not illegal bug crooked
all right let's talk about hunter's gun
charges I don't have I ever talked about
that my opinion about the gun charges my
understanding and I might have this
wrong I think there might be more to the
gun charge than this but isn't part of
it that or maybe the main part they lied
on his gun application and he said he
wasn't an addict
do I understand that correctly that
that's that's the biggest issue that he
said he wasn't an addict so he lied to
him how to use Second Amendment People's
Square
your desire to be prosecuted with that
now I'm no no expert on the Second
Amendment but let me give you my
preliminary opinion
um it's probably a good idea
to have a law that says we don't
automatically give guns to drug addicts
that might be a good idea
because drug addicts
by and large not all of them but by and
large they might have trouble paying for
their drugs
they might say well I got this gun and I
need some drugs
so if you've got an addiction and no
money and you've got a gun that's just
begging for trouble
so we can understand why that law exists
and I would also agree with anybody who
said no the second amendment has to be
an absolute
people will die you know a lot more
people will die if the Second Amendment
isn't absolute
but you might want it that way anyway
because there are benefits from you know
not not chipping away at your rights
but here's my take does anybody think
that the law
that would deny a gun to somebody who
was an addict
do you think that law was meant for
somebody like Hunter Biden
do you think that a multi-millionaire is
who they anticipated when they said oh
we we don't want a gun in the hand of
that multi-millionaire
now so here's my problem with this
it may be technically against the law
and it may be true that Hunter broke a
federal law like a really important
federal law because it involves a gun
but it's also true in my opinion that he
was never a he was never a special risk
uh there was no chance he was going to
use the gun for offensive purposes am I
right
they're not denying guns to drug addicts
because they might accidentally shoot
themselves
they're denying guns to drug addicts so
the drug addicts don't use them to go
get some money
but that's not a risk with under Biden
he wasn't going to use a gun that he was
going to use the vice president to go
get some money and it worked really well
so he didn't need a gun now his gun was
clearly for defensive purposes would you
all agree
there's no question or at least there's
no indication it was for anything else
but the indication is was for defensive
purposes
you don't think the gun was for
defensive purposes
what do you think it was for
what evidence is there he was going to
use the gun for offensive purpose like
to rob a bank
there's no evidence of that
shoot his girlfriend
there's no evidence he was going to
shoot his girlfriend
no
so I'm gonna have to
you might not like this
but I'm trying to remain
um consistent with some standards and
one of my standards is
there's a reason that humans get to
judge the law right there's a reason
it's a jury there's a reason it's a
judge in some cases you need a human
being to say did this law work for this
situation
in my opinion this is a misapplied law
now nobody's above the law but the law
itself is not above itself
did that make sense
nobody's above the law
but that doesn't excuse the law from
being stupid the law can't be above
itself I mean the law still has to make
sense right if somebody passed the law
that said uh you can't wear a blue shirt
and they execute everybody who does
you wouldn't say to yourself well
nobody's Above the Law you say no we got
to change that law right away there's
something wrong with the law
you wouldn't say there's something wrong
with the person who's resisting the law
if it's a stupid law
and although the law is arguably makes
sense
you know I'm not sure I'm not sure I
would have backed it I'd have to hear
the argument but
I think there's no chance whatsoever
this law was designed or passed with
somebody like Hunter
in mind
so I think there needs to be a penalty
because lying on a federal uh lying on a
federal document that should have some
kind of penalty but I'm thinking
whatever is the smallest penalty
definitely not jail
definitely not jail
does anybody think you should go to jail
for that trying to protect himself with
his second amendment rights you actually
think you should go to jail for that so
I would argue that you're just in team
play you're in team play mode if you
think that
that just feels like a team play
decision you couldn't possibly think
there's somebody wanting a handgun
to defend themselves into in the United
States you can't think that should go to
jail
all right well
we won't solve this today but that's my
opinion now that doesn't relieve Hunter
of any of the other things he may or may
not have done
but I have a second question
so look at all the the influence buying
stuff
is it a fairer violation
to be an introducer
if your only job is to make
introductions
is that a fairer violation
now forget for a moment that there's a
debate about whether that's the only
thing he was doing
but if it's the only thing that could be
proven and so far it is so far the only
thing we've seen is introductions do you
do you think you should be illegal to
make introductions
I don't
if there's a law that says you can't
introduce people from another country to
someone in this country
there's a lot of people who are going to
go to jail aren't they
what would happen if you knew somebody
in another country
they were just a friend of yours and
they called you and said you know uh
Scott you you deal in politics a lot
could you connect me with
you know some senator
and I would say well you know what I
actually we follow each other on Twitter
yeah I'll send the DM
you know you've got a problem over there
maybe it's in our interest too you know
it's not against the interest of the
United States it's just somebody wants a
maybe no suit no Sue to talk to sort of
thing
so I wouldn't even think twice
I would think oh my Afghanistan friend
sure
um I'll send a DM to this person I just
happen to know I'll connect you would
that be a fair a pharah violation did I
just describe breaking the law
can somebody tell me the real answer to
that I mean I think we're just guessing
but
well even let's say you paid me let's
say I got paid for it let's say my
friend said you know what I'll uh you
know invest in your company or something
it'd be a nice favor if you could make
this introduction for me
um so I'm not going to say it's not
illegal because I don't know
but I'll give you my opinion
it should not be illegal
it should not be illegal if it is
you know maybe it is
Bo do you do you want to live in a world
where you can't introduce people
I mean seriously do you want to live in
a world where you need to sign a piece
of paper and a document and tell the
world I might introduce somebody now of
course if it's your main business you
know you're going to do a lot of it
but I have a real problem with
introductions being illegal now my guess
is this
my guess is that since Hunter was
operating somewhat openly wouldn't you
say
as do other people somewhat openly
making introductions
I don't think the hunter thought it was
illegal
do you
I my guess this is just speculation so I
can't read his mind right but without
the mind reading if I put myself in this
situation I doubt I would have acted so
visibly if I knew it was illegal I think
I might have said I've got an argument
why it's not
as long as I have an argument you know
I'm going to be okay the argument might
be a little spacious but as long as I
have an argument I think I'm okay and
the argument would be I'm not asking him
anybody to give any favors to this other
country I'm simply introducing them
and people meet people in the ordinary
course of Life maybe they could have
found this person on their own you know
it just would have taken more work I'm
just saving them some time
so I have a feeling that introducing
people is going to end up not being
illegal that there would have to be the
extra
you know something happened because of
it some influence yeah
so it's not illegal but maybe he did
more some people say now I'm not judging
them more I'm just trying to predict
where this will go
in my opinion Hunter is
not dumb
at least you know not the classic way
like his IQ seems to be high would you
agree with that he's done some things
that you wouldn't do and I wouldn't do
but you know drugs are involved Etc but
he's not a low IQ guy
nobody thinks he's actually low IQ right
nobody
so if you're that smart
you don't think you figured out a way to
do these sketchy things in a way that at
least you have a good argument because I
think in his case he probably thinks if
I have an argument
the government's going to keep you leave
me alone because I'm too politically
connected
if he had no argument it was just like
flat out crime well he would probably
think he wasn't protected
but if he had something of an argument
that's probably enough for the
government to leave him alone if you're
that connected to the government
I would not be surprised if none of the
hunter Biden's stuff turns into a major
crime with jail
I to me this is the stuff that ought to
get worked out now I'm not being naive
I do think that he was selling influence
or at least the illusion of influence
which is so close to real influence that
I don't know I wouldn't even make a
distinction really
but I don't think it's going to be
provable
do you
I just don't think it's provable
so I think the outcome will be no jail
and they'll they'll hide this as long as
they can statute of limitations will run
out and some stuff it'll just trickle
into nothing
well RFK Jr had a what I consider the
best take on the Hawaii fires which the
death count is up to 59 I think
no 80 I think the death count is up to
80 unless I checked and it's going to
get worse
um but instead of blaming climate change
which is the the idiot booth
if I can just say that blaming the
Hawaii fires just on climate change
that's sort of an idiot move
nobody knows that you know we can know
it's a factor it could be a factor
but we don't know that's the reason
um so RFK finds The High Ground here and
he basically says Hawaii fires a result
from poor tending of the land
so he goes into his explanation of why
why the the land was uh you know ready
to burn that way and but he doesn't
dismiss
that there could be a climate element to
it and then he then he but he says you
don't know
I mean that's that's way more than we
know right now that's consistent with
his his theme for uh drugs and food
we just don't know they're safe
and then he takes that to climate change
and says maybe but we don't know that
the part we know for sure is we're not
managing the land and the water
correctly
so then he ends with an appeal to find
the middle ground which is can't we all
just agree that we should manage our
land and our water better
we don't have to agree on climate change
you could disagree on climate change but
still don't we agree that we should
reduce the risk of fires
so it was funny for it's funny watching
him find the the common High Ground
that you can't argue with there's just
no argument to that who is it who say no
we should not manage our our fire risks
nobody right
of course so
I think you found the the perfect sweet
spot you know don't become a climate
change crazy person but don't ignore
that the brush is extra bad this year so
you should do something about it
I I just liked his reasonable Middle
Ground
because it's so rare
that anybody can find the mill
all right
uh CNN is starting to show a little
doubt about funding the Ukraine war
and I'm going to call this as a signal
of a some kind of a shift
so last week CNN had a poll that said 55
percent of the public doesn't want
Congress to give more money to Ukraine
and 45 say yes so that's a pretty solid
lead saying don't give more funding to
Ukraine
um and CNN's the way CNN is talking
about it is uh here's their actual
sentence on their website the White
House on Wednesday
downplayed CNN polling showing most
Americans oppose uh the funding of
Ukraine
think of that choice of words
this is CNN they they love them some
Democrats but they're saying they showed
their own poll
so their own poll
says that funding is not popular by the
public
and then it says the White House
downplayed the CNN poll
so you can see them beginning to turn
right they just turned on
it's like you're wait this is our poll
imagine being CNN imagine all the water
that CNN has carried for Democrats CNN
is just doing everything for Democrats
and then they put out their own poll and
the White House downplays their poll
imagine how you'd feel
uh I've been carrying your water for
years
I've told every imaginable lie you can
imagine and pretended we believed it
could you just tell could you just say
that the poll is actually meaningful
it's our poll a little bit of
reciprocity wouldn't be the worst thing
you know you can almost feel like the
tension there
starting to form uh of course you would
not be surprised that the Democrats are
strongly in favor of funding the
Republicans are strongly against further
funding
and where did we get to the point where
where the opinions about uh unnecessary
Wars reversed you know when did the
Republicans be the ones who don't want
unnecessary Wars
do you think that the only thing
happening
is team play
do you think that if a republican had
been the leader who said we got to do
this Ukraine thing do you think the
numbers would be actually reversed and
the Democrats would be saying my God why
are you funding this war of course of
course then let me ask you this
do you think the media is the reason for
the war
because the media is what causes us to
be divided the let's say the media's
business model of you know chasing
outrage it causes the the teams to move
to their teams
and now it's caused a huge number of
people to be in favor of an unnecessary
War
so that they can be on the other side
from the Republicans
to me it looks like team play
is why we're fund the war it doesn't
look like we thought it down and it's in
our favor and we've considered all the
Alternatives and you know it doesn't
look like that it looks like the media
poisoned the public to the point where
you just can't be on the on the other
side's team
is impossible
and that's why we have enough support to
fund it because 45 he can get away with
but much less than that he couldn't
all right I saw a video in which Klaus
and Schwab
if this is real because remember we're
in the age of deep fakes
I think this is real but I'm not going
to guarantee it so
put a little question mark put an
asterisk on this story because the video
itself could be fake I think it's true
but anyway here's what Klaus Schwab
allegedly said in the new world uh-oh
he's in trouble right off the world
right off the bat in the new world and
all of you just went oh what's wrong
with the old one all right in the new
world you have to accept total what you
have to accept total transparency it
will become part of your personality
you have to accept it
in the new world he'll have to accept
yeah
uh everything will be transparent if you
have nothing to hide you have no reason
to be afraid
so what do you think of that
is that the uh
is he telling you that he's going to
make you do it or is he predicting
is he saying he's causing it or is he
predicting it
how do you interpret this
all right well I'm going to make your
heads catch on fire because I agree with
him 100 percent
I agree 100 as a prediction
as a prediction
do you know why there's a hundred
percent chance that you will lose all
privacy does anybody know the answer
there's a hundred percent chance you'll
lose all privacy why
uh correct answer number one you already
have
you already have
do you believe that any of your
Communications are not monitored
they only need a reason
they just need a reason and they already
have access to all of your bank accounts
they can they can unwind your entire
life all of your private messages
Etc
yeah so yeah so you don't have much
privacy you just didn't know it was
happening it happened gradually until
you didn't have any but that's that's
different from
that's different from your neighbor
knowing what you're doing all right it's
bad enough that the government can know
anything it wants but it would be bad if
your neighbors could just see everything
that'd be kind of scary however here's
why I agree with the prediction this is
not a preference
I'm not I'm not talking about a
preference
I'm predicting
you will have no privacy whatsoever
because every individual will have the
power to destroy an entire city
do you disagree with my statement that
in the near future whether it's AI or
biological entities or building your own
nuclear weapon
do you agree that we're pretty close
maybe 20 years away
from the point where any individual can
destroy an entire city
yeah once you reach that point
will any cities be destroyed
once you get to the point where somebody
can will they do it of course yeah of
course will they do it more than once
probably probably after they've done it
three times and three major cities have
been completely destroyed
what will happen next
we will realize there's literally only
one way to stop it from happening again
and that will involve a complete lack of
privacy for All Humans they come in the
country anyway
they will have to remove all privacy
to prevent one person from destroying an
entire city over and over again
now if you don't believe that prediction
tell me how else it could go
do you believe that one person won't
have that ability
because that seems like a stretch
or do you believe that they won't use it
because that would be like not
understanding humans maybe any one
person won't use it but if you have
millions and millions and millions
billions actually billions of people
somebody's going to use it you only need
one to destroy a whole city
so and and what would be the other way
to fix it
the only way to fix it is to fix it
before it happens
have you noticed that there's uh
there hasn't been a major terror attack
in the United States in how long
when was the last major terrorist attack
in the United States
do you think that's a coincidence
do you think it's because no terrorists
wanted to attack
the fact that there's been no terrorist
attack for this this long
pretty much guarantees that all privacy
has already gone
would you agree
there's no other way we could be
stopping what I presume would be a lot
of terrorist attacks
there's no way we could have a hundred
percent efficiency
unless there's no privacy
I think it's a guarantee that we have no
privacy already now when I say no
privacy that doesn't mean they're
looking into your stuff
they're of course looking into my stuff
do you think I have any privacy
given what you know about what I do in
public and the things I say do you think
that and in fact that we have a democrat
in office do you think that nobody's
looking at my communications
I would be amazed I'd be amazed if
nobody's already in my WhatsApp and my
all my DMs I'd be amazed so I try not to
commit any crimes
because I already live in Klaus Schwab's
future
my reality is that I have no no privacy
because I'm a public figure and I talk
about politics so I just assume the
government's crawled through my business
more than once
w
ow yeah and I you know I run a clean
shop and I do that because I always
assumed I had no privacy so I run my
life like I have no privacy
and it doesn't really hurt me
you'd be you'd be amazed how rarely I
need to commit a crime
it doesn't come up a lot it just sort of
doesn't come up yeah I just do my stuff
so
um anyway yeah I think that we'll all
lose our privacy I can't predict that
it'll be good or bad and I'm not going
to get into that now but as a prediction
I think it's guaranteed
it might be good by the way you might
enjoy it and the reason I say you might
enjoy it is that
it doesn't really hurt me
maybe you'd find the same because I'm
sort of living in the future that way
all right there's a story there's a new
study that uh somebody found that the
Universe might be 27 billion years old
instead of close to 14. so maybe we're
uh we're doubling the age of the
universe now it's a study so who knows
if that will hold up
but
um
at the same time you know I've told you
this before that evolution
has been debunked by the simulation
theory in in my opinion
so but here now I'm going to tell you
something that maybe some of you haven't
heard before
25 years ago and by the way you're just
gonna have to take you're gonna have to
take my word for this I wish I could
like
find an email or something but 25 years
ago I promise you on my you know on my
dog's life that this is true on Snickers
life I promise you 25 years ago I said
to myself you know what would be fun
to predict that the most true thing in
science is really fake
and I said to myself if I do that and I
wait a few decades
Watch Me Be Right
and here's the part that'll blow your
mind
I wasn't fussy about what I picked
that's the weird part
I said I just have to pick something
that is guaranteed by all scientists to
be true whatever they say it is and just
say it's not true
and I'll say it in public and I'll make
a prediction that in your lifetime the
most true thing in science will be
debunked
and the reason is I don't think anything
is true
and I also don't think that science has
ever been close to the truth
it's pretty good at knowing what works
but not the truth
right it doesn't matter when the Big
Bang happened
because we can still build a rocket ship
it doesn't matter if evolution is true
because I can still drive my electric
car right so the things that don't
matter to your day-to-day those can be
completely fake
and you'd never know you just go through
life as if it's true
so I took some things which don't affect
our actual day-to-day life because those
things I think will be true enough
but things that are just Concepts
and I and I thought to myself you know I
could pick the Big Bang
because in my opinion the Big Bang was
the most ridiculous thing we've ever
believed I'm just by its nature
you know it couldn't possibly be what we
think it is I don't know what it is but
it's definitely not that
right
so here we are
so now there's a question that the Big
Bang even happened because there's some
I believe there's some galaxies that
can't exist based on the life of the
universe but now maybe we got the life
of the universe completely wrong
I think I think we're you know just a
few steps away from saying that the Big
Bang didn't happen
now I won't go into the long description
but evolution is largely debunked at
this point in my opinion and along
scientific and rational means not along
religious
arguments no religious argument needed
uh it's just the Elon Musk argument that
we can already build AI creatures and
tell them they think they're real and
they would go through their life
thinking they're real
so as long as that's something we can do
now
it's probable that if the universe is 14
billion years or maybe 27 billion years
that there could have been infinite
civilizations that also could build
simulations what are the odds that
you're one of the original species and
not one of the millions of of
simulations that each species that
reaches our level will create so the
odds are you know maybe a trillion to
one or a billion to one that you're an
original species
and it's like a billions one that you're
a simulation actually zeros and ones or
some form of that
so I would I would argue so the one I
picked 25 years ago in my book The
Dilbert future
published in 1997
25 years ago I said to myself I swear to
God this is true
I said
I'm going to eat ship for 25 years
but at the end of that 25 years
laughs it's going to be sweet
and so I wrote a book in which I
specifically said Evolution will be
debunked in your lifetime not in
religious terms and I said that not in
religious terms but in scientific terms
because we don't understand the nature
of reality itself
I said that specifically 25 years ago do
you know what happened
I got canceled
it was the first time I got canceled
does anybody remember that is anybody
old enough to remember the blowback
because I had a comic strip that was
mostly well not mostly but technical
people and stem people and sciencey
people really love Dilbert
when I predicted that Evolution would be
debunked
I lost almost all of them I was
completely canceled by science in 1997.
does anybody remember that now that was
before canceling was the thing it is now
so it didn't have that much effect on my
Publishers or my syndication but the
number of people who are willing to buy
my books and read my stuff plummeted I
was canceled probably I lost 25 percent
of my market like overnight
that was the first time I was canceled
so
25 years I waited to be right
could you do that could you eat
intentionally for 25 years under the bet
that you'd be right in 25 years
I literally did that
here we are
yes I'm not right
you say
um I don't know that I'm right I only
know that it's probably a billion to one
that I'm right
so I can't guarantee it's not the one
but there's a billion to one chance
summary
at least maybe a trillion one
um
so I saw a tweet from the whole Mars
catalog uh regarding simulation stuff
today and the Tweet says this world is
too crazy to not be a simulation
and Elon Musk reply to that with
tell me about it
is that the best tweet
the world is too crazy to not be a
simulation and then the richest man in
the world
who's building rocket ships to space
among other things among other things
says tell me about it
how could you be Elon Musk and believe
that this is a real reality
how could you
have you ever thought what would it be
like to be him
every time he sits on the toilet and
tweets
he changes the planet Earth
while he's on the toilet tweeting
that's that's real
now not every tweet because some of the
tweets are just jokes but
if he tweets something serious the
entire world looks at it reads it and
thinks about it changes how they think
there's a story about it how how in the
world
could he feel like he's living in
reality
now the reason that I'm sensitive to
that is that that's my life as well
my life is so unusual and and has been
forever that if I'm part of reality
I can't understand how that's possible
or at least you know the the reality we
used to think if it's not a simulation
and I'm not creating my reality as I go
how do you explain anything I've
experienced
my reality is so far out of anything
normal as is musks and you know similar
but very different scale
yeah I'm going to tell you a story
without much detail there's somebody in
my let's say my life
who I've been teaching the simulation
concept and the idea that you can
manifest your reality
and you know this has been an ongoing
conversation
and the person I talked to I believe has
incorporated this and I was having a
conversation uh just I think the other
day
in which the person was feeding back to
me uh some successes that were so wildly
unlikely I mean it involved like a big
coincidence
and and the person was telling me like
it was a coincidence
and I had to say hold on hold on
do you see what's happening here
do you have any idea what's happening
right now I taught you how to manifest
your reality and now you're telling me
that you've got exactly the the weird
unusual thing that you wanted and you
you're telling me that's a coincidence
you should have looked you should have
seen the look on the person's face
this is a human being that I I pushed to
a higher level of awareness
somebody who just figured out
that everything in this person's life
Suddenly at exactly the time they
learned the skill of manifesting
everything turned right in the weirdly
coincident coincidental ways that could
not have been under anybody's control
it looks like reality just wrapped
itself around this person
very impressed you know and I got to I
got to you know see the evidence myself
so
just the weirdest situation now this is
my everyday
I wake up into a situation that there's
something that happens that's so unusual
this in my favor
and it's something I wanted and wanted
to manifest and I think how in the world
how in the world is this real
anyway
so let me do it to you again right now
you're going to watch it in real time so
you can make your own decision am I
changing reality
or just getting lucky
because you're going to find that my
reframe about imitation is the only path
to success
at Black America needs to figure out
what to do given that they're locked out
of the only path to success because why
would you imitate your oppressors
right so they have to figure that out
that is not for anybody to tell them
what to do they have all the capability
they're completely capable and it needs
to be something they do on their own
but the tools are here so once they're
freed from that uh that uh I would call
the glass ceiling of types but once they
shatter the glass ceiling which
unfortunately nobody can help them with
they're gonna have to do it on their own
but once they do they'll probably
dominate Industries the way they've
dominated other Industries you know I if
you say that I've said this to some you
know black leaders before
but I like the way it sounds so we'll
say it again
whenever black Americans had full access
full access to an industry
they're usually dominated
right Sports
full access dominated
entertainment
fashion music
culture
dominated
dominated so why would we think that
that would stop
with some future industry that let's say
there's some you know systemic there's a
systemic reason that's keeping them away
from it as soon as they lose the
systemic
in this case I think the glass ceiling
of imitation is the problem but if they
can punch through that
they're going to dominate other
Industries why wouldn't they why would
they not every time there was an
industry they had full access to without
the systemic racism being the stopper
the Great
so
so why not assume why not assume the
best
and I I think that it's terribly uh
damaging to say that somebody else has
to change to fix their problem
if you're if your path to success is
waiting for your oppressor to change
uh how well are you going to do
but if your path to success is oh
everybody who follows these same tools
gets a good outcome boom
doors open highway is free drive right
down
all right so this will be your test to
see if I'm hallucinating that I can
change reality
because you realize that I'm in a
three-act uh three-act movie right do
you all know that
you can tell I'm in a three-act movie
right
and you don't know what my third Act is
well you don't know the solution to the
third act the third Act was getting
canceled would you agree
my third Act was getting canceled
worldwide
every book disappeared every comic came
out of every Outlet
same week
third Act
Thursday of next week
my book that got canceled but now is
Reborn
will be available for sale I'm assuming
that the tech the technical part works
it should be Thursday
so it'll be independently published with
the help of Joshua leisak who's helping
me with the editing and the the business
process of it
and
that book
needs to be the number one book in the
country
once you see it you're going to agree
because you're going to realize how much
utility isn't it
and part of that utility is selling the
idea that reframing works
I'm going to give I'm going to create a
micro lesson just for the people on the
locals platform they get so I've got
about 200 two minute lessons on a life
skill or different way to look at things
so I'm going to add one today that will
teach you
why mindset changes actual reality
and it's based on Old wisdom
not something I invented but it's going
to blow your mind so you have to be in
the locals platform that's a
subscription service
um and that ladies and gentlemen
is what I need to tell you today I'm
pretty sure that all of you are uh at
least emotionally on board with the
following point if not financially
financially if if you can't afford to
buy books don't buy mine yeah if you
have if you have any financial problems
at all you know don't buy my book at all
but if you don't and you can afford a
book down then you might enjoy changing
reality
because reality needs for me to have a
third Act
followed by a fourth Act
so if you want to be part of the fourth
act you get your chance next week
and I would appreciate it beyond beyond
imagination because as you can tell it's
it's not about the money at this point I
got I got plenty of money
so if you want to do something important
that'd be a good way to do it
and ladies and gentlemen
this completes my amazing live stream
for today
and I'm going to say goodbye to the
YouTube folks and hang around a little
bit with the locals crowd and
see you tomorrow
