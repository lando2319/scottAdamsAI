this could be one of the best coughing
scott atoms
of all time
of all time
and all you're going to need is a copper

okay i'm really struggling here
i just want to destroy that printer
right in front of you like i want to so
badly
i want to lift it above my head and
crash it on the ground on my ceramic
floors as many times as it takes until i
feel better
is that wrong
well before i do that why don't you join
me for the
simultaneous sip it's the uh
[Music]
thing that feels good
i'm totally off my game because of my
printer
all right take a sip
what
all right let's put on the microphone
for youtube and fix that problem
[Music]
see everything's wrong because my
printer is not working what a terrible
situation it is
um
honestly the only reason i'm not
destroying that printer in front of you
is that i don't want to sweep it up
it's the only reason
like i don't want to find all the shards
everywhere and try to clean them up
it's the only thing keeping me for doing
right now
all right
so let's look at all the things on my
phone because i can't print
there's a study that says if you have
three or more kids
has a negative effect on your late life
cognition
that you become
essentially mentally less capable
in your older life
if you've had three or more children
what do you think of that study
let's uh let's use your analytical
abilities
and tell me do you think that sounds
like a legitimate study
number one
if there's just one study on it
the odds are no more than 50
that they even did the math right right
so if you hear there's a study
50 chance is false before you even hear
about it
because that's just the ratio
can't be reproduced
now of the 50 that are true
meaning that it could be reproduced
does it mean they've interpreted it
right
because you can still reproduce the
result
and interpret it wrong
so here they found a correlation
between having more children
and being mentally less capable
do you think they have the correlation
right
does having the children make you
mentally less capable because apparently
he shows up later in life
or
was your propensity to be less mentally
capable
what caused you to have three or more
children
now it's not an accusation
i'm just saying
how do how do they know
when you find a correlation why do you
say that the correlation works one way
what would be the basis
for them to determine that the
correlation is one direction or the
causation is one direction
i don't see that
seems to me that if you find a
correlation could go either way
it could be that whatever it is that
makes them incapable later in life
is correlated with whatever makes them
want to have more
kids i'm not saying it is i'm just
saying you can't rule now
but probably the numbers are all wrong
anyway
so i don't know we could have ignored
this one entirely
but if it's true that
the more kids you have the lower your
cognition
the question that i would have to ask is
how many children did joe biden father
because it's looking like dozens
maybe we don't know about them all
well cnn has another propaganda story
so the only story about
the ukraine russia war
that i saw yet at least this morning so
this is the only story
is about this one russian officer who
resigned during the middle of the fight
and then the allegations are there must
be other to others like it and you know
rumors have it that there might be other
russian military people just quitting
and not wanting to fight because they
didn't know what they were getting into
and the reporting is that their cell
phones were taken away
and they didn't even know where they
were going to fight or why
maybe could be
um
but to me the story just looks like
propaganda
and i think there was a the russians
tried to advance somewhere and the
ukrainian army pushed them back
is that where we're at
now is is mario poll uh
that war that part of the war is over so
russia got married a poll and then what
are they done
there's nobody else fighting
how could you have a major war going on
that the united states is involved in
and cnn's only article about it is this
one russian officer allegedly quit in
the middle of the fighting
that's it
there's nothing else under attack
what's happening
isn't there something terribly missing
with this
like there's a war
so now is is kiev you know the capital
of ukraine is that though totally safe
we can fly our politicians in there and
they're not worried about getting shot
down or anything we could just fly our
politicians into kiev in the middle of
the war zone
did ukraine
kind of win
is it over
it feels like it's over
right now when i say over i mean
you know they'll be you know continuous
skirmishes forever
but in terms of there is a war in which
ukraine might be conquered by russia
i feel like that's over
tell me i'm wrong
the war in ukraine is over
i'm going to call it
i'm going to call it now
now they'll be in the negotiations and
there'll be plenty of fighting and
killing but in terms of a major war i
think it's over
because if if ukraine is not challenged
in terms of their sovereignty and it
doesn't look like they are
i'm being told i'm wrong but remember
i'm i'm going off the reporting
just going off the reporting
so the reporting would indicate the war
is over
it's not saying that
but it's indicating it by not covering
it and the one thing they cover didn't
have much to do with fighting
it had to do with quentin
quitting fighting
so
what exactly is going on what do you
think
do you think the war is effectively over
in terms of wondering if ukraine will
fall to russia
it's done right
am i wrong
the war is over
not the skirmishes and not the dying and
the shooting and stuff but the war
looks like it's over
i don't know
um
and again
if it turns out that i'm completely
wrong about this remember i'm just
basing it on the fact that the coverage
of the war
is treating it like it's over i'm only
going off of that
i'm not there
so if it turns out i'm completely wrong
about what's going on
of course
of course i'm wrong
all right
uh so we're still having major trouble
getting baby formula in this country the
only country in the world that can't
find baby formula at least
industrialized country
and uh
is there anything about this question
the baby formula problem
that you don't think trump could have
solved in 10 minutes
i mean actually 10 minutes
like literally 10
minutes am i wrong
because it seems to me that this is the
ideal executive
you know executive order situation isn't
it
it's an emergency
there's a bunch of rules that prevent i
don't know importing or
labeling or something it's a bunch of
red tape
it's not really a safety question
the safety question would be if you
don't do anything i mean that's the
unsafe part it's not terribly safe to
bring in some
some baby formula from other countries
where they've been using it for decades
i
how in the world did would trump not
solve that in 10 minutes i mean actually
10 minutes
because he'd say what's the problem
they'd say oh there's this red tape
or we can't buy it from these countries
for these reasons and you say okay write
me up an executive order and i'll change
that
would it be safe
and they'd say
yeah it would be safe
we're not saying it's unsafe
we're just saying the rules are in the
way and then he say okay we'll make
those rules go away temporarily
and then it would be done
am i wrong
is there something major about the story
i'm completely missing
it's protectionism yeah but all of those
things just go away if it's an emergency
and you've got an executive order
i'm looking for some pushback but i
think i'm right right
it almost looks like anybody could have
solved it except joe biden
anybody
you know and i'm not saying you know
trump is a god so he's the only one who
could i could have done it
if you put me in the job i think i could
have solved it in 10 minutes
tell me what the red tape is give me an
executive order okay what's my next
problem
can i explain why the binding
administration didn't do it i can't
neither can the news
have you seen any stories in the news to
tell you why the biden administration
couldn't get this figured out
i haven't
it just looks like
they just weren't trying or something
or it looks like anything that's bad for
babies is good for democrats
let's see letting children
decide their gender idea identity before
their brains are developed
probably bad for babies
abortion well that depends on what you
define as a life or a baby but
it's certainly not good for babies
um
see the uh
teachers unions bad for children
uh
is there anything anything at all
that's happening that's good for
children that democrats are doing
nothing right
it feels like the
biden is bad for babies
biden bad for babies
so now we're all looking at the
illegitimate news and how they're
covering the story that hillary clinton
was in fact
behind approving the scam
or hoax of the illusion
or the russia collusion hoax
the literal literally hillary clinton
now we know for sure
approved a disinformation program the
worst probably disinformation thing
that's ever happened in the country
and as r.e fleischer points out how the
washington post handles it
he says in a 33 paragraph story
the the washington post buries in the
27th paragraph
as kind of an ordinary thing
that hillary approved the dissemination
of a dirty trick attack
to pedal to the press phony collusion
info versus trump
this should be a feeding frenzy
imagine if it were the other way around
i mean the the top story is that trump
told people to protest peacefully
but things got out of control
like literally that's what happened
trump told them to protest peacefully
and but they didn't
and then there was also all of the
different things that people talked
about in the white house
but did not implement
in other words they considered a bunch
of things to
delay the vote or change the vote and
didn't implement them
you've got one person who implemented
the worst
hoax that changed probably the you know
the course of civilization
uh
and that's just like a story that they
put in the middle of a
larger story
meanwhile
trump basically says stay peaceful and
some people don't and then
that's a
that's an insurrection
oh well
all right
the most disgusting thing of the morning
is a cnn editorial
by a gentleman named keith mcgee
who based on his description and
bio and picture seems to be an
african-american man
and
he writes about this the white mass
shooter in buffalo and but he's talking
about white teens in general and
he writes an article which is nothing
but super racist
so let me say it as clearly as as i can
it's an article that my in my opinion
and lots of people who saw me tweet
about it would say this is clearly just
absolutely
disgustingly racist
super racist
here's some of the things he said
so it's part of the larger article but
he said
because you are male
that's also
we've got some of that in there too
uh because you are male you are born a
winner of the patriarchal jackpot
you are more likely to rise to the top
of the career ladder and will be better
paid on your way up
no you won't
that's not even true in 2022.
that's literally the data says the
opposite
then if you are black and female you
have the best chance of the
getting into college getting the first
job offer or getting a bigger
initial salary all of that's true this
is literally the opposite of current
data now this was true
it was true
but it's not true today
it's exactly the opposite
um
and this is his job his job is
apparently to write about this stuff and
he doesn't know that
sim is basically the most basic piece of
data on this whole topic he doesn't know
that
really
and then he says uh
if you're male
the state will not attempt to to dictate
what you can and cannot do with your own
body
what that's all the state does
the state doesn't do anything but tell
me what to do with my body
do you know what the state doesn't tell
me what to do with
my thoughts
i mean they try
but it's not
you know it's not official
constitutional policy you
 all the state does is tell me
what i can do with my body that's all
they do
that's what the government does
they tell you what to do with your
 body
right that's it
i mean seriously they tell you what
drugs you can put in it they tell you
where it can be and where it can be
they tell you what what your arms and
legs can and cannot do
they can't hit other people they can't
pick people's items off a shelf and walk
away with it
everything everything that the
government do is telling you what you
can do with your body
now i get that the abortion thing
doesn't apply to men
as much but i guess it does now
but how can you be so wrong about
everything
i guess that's what gets you a cnn
editorial
page um
secondly and i don't know if i've been
cancelled yet
but if you're talking about an abortion
and the and the accusation here would be
that the state
is telling one women what to do with
their body in terms of abortion
whereas that's not something that
happens to men
to which i say
 you it's not the government telling
you what to do with your body in that
case
in that specific case
that's women telling women what to do
with their bodies
now i'm going to get cancelled for this
probably
but here's my opinion on abortion
if women wanted the rule to be one way
or the other that would be that end of
the conversation
if 80 of women wanted
you know no abortion that's the way it
would be if 80 percent of women wanted
abortion to be limited or not limited
that's the way it would be
this is this is a decision solely and
completely made by women
that is processed through the government
but the government is just laundering
the opinion of women
this is women's opinion it's the
only way that abortion laws are created
by women for women
men just sort of watch
right
we don't have anything to do with it
we're literally
larpers or pretenders
every man who pretends to have an
opinion on abortion is just wrong
the supreme court wouldn't do anything
that that was against 80 percent of
women
if 80 percent of women want abortion
laws any way they want them
they're going to have it
so don't pretend the government
is making women do
it's women
it's women
women are making women act the way women
act period
now that wasn't always the case
that was not always the case
definitely it was true
that you know sometime in our history
most of it really that men were in
charge and men were making the decisions
and it was up to men
i would say that that's a good
historical
summary but it's not it doesn't describe
2022.
you tell me is there is there even one
person here who thinks that if women by
let's say an 80 majority
wanted abortion laws to be anything
whatever it is they decided do you think
that it wouldn't go that way you think
the supreme court is going to go against
80 percent of women no
no they will not
no do you think congress is going to go
against 80 of women no
no they will not
no way that will ever happen
all of the power resides with women on
the question of abortion
all of it
if they can't decide don't say it's the
 guys
it's not the men it's not us
you tell us what you want and
we'll give it to you
welcome to the real world
you tell men what you want make up your
mind just be on the same side eighty
percent so ask just be on the same side
we'll give you any thing you
want
stop blaming us
stop blaming us for your problem
now it was it was our problem ours
meeting men right it was our problem
historically
it's not now
stop blaming us
like just take the power that you have
and make up a decision then tell us what
you want and we'll give it to you
oh we'll complain and we'll say you
shouldn't have been the other way but
we'll give it to you you're still going
to get it
jesus
that is so not the government's problem
um
he says
if you're on top of that
says
keith mckee
[Music]
on top of that because you are white and
you live in the country that is
structurally racist you enjoy a huge
privilege that your skin color gives you
what would be an example of that
can somebody give me an example of my
huge privilege that my
white skin is giving me
what would be some examples
please anybody
some examples
there are no examples
none
now let's see if you can do it the other
way are there any examples where
uh being black
in america would give you some
advantages
anything
well you would get into college more
easily with the same grades
and you would get funded you would get
hired more easily by far
at least by the larger corporations who
have to have diversity
it's not even close
in 2022 white people don't have anywhere
near the
rights or privileges of black people
it's diamond clothes
and i am completely insulted that you
would even say this out loud and pretend
as if
you're not me while uh telling
me i'm in charge because you are you're
 me and telling me i'm in charge
at the same time just do one or the
other either treat me as a second-class
citizen and me
at least it makes sense but don't tell
me i'm in charge while you're me
all right make up your mind
then he goes on if you have the added
bonus of being let's see oh it's even
worse he goes no one will try to if
you're if you're white i guess no one
will try to rob you of your right to
vote
really
if you're white no one will rob you of
your right to vote
have you seen the
the video of the
alleged mule who is stuffing ballot
boxes with
i guess on several different trips
different ballots
now if that really is happening in a
widespread way
and if the allegations of
a lot of people
you know i would say these are
definitely unproven allegations but if
the allegations about the impropriety of
the
2020 election were true
i think that would be an example of
somebody robbing you of your right to
vote
he hasn't heard of that situation i
guess
but i would say there's at least
strong
would you call it
circumstantial evidence
that white people were definitely robbed
of the right to vote in 2020.
it looks like it
now i'm i i don't say that it's proven
no court has proven that i haven't seen
anything that would look like proof
but that's a pretty ballsy thing to say
that it hasn't happened because you
can't prove it didn't happen
can't prove it did happen at least at
the moment
um
you said you don't need you don't need
to be terrified of law enforcement
officers
you know
how much of that is my fault
you know is do uh do asian americans are
they terrified of law enforcement
if you you know if
if you go into an asian
asian-american community
are they all oh no the cops are here
we're all in trouble they're going to
beat us up
let's stop pretending that everybody
acts the same
can we are we adult enough to say
people act differently
different cultures
different ages
different everything like any subgroup
in america
would have a pretty distinct way of
acting
and it's not even just race it's not
even just gender
you could find lots of distinct
groups that would act differently in
different situations
so why do we act like they would all be
treated the same if they're going to act
differently
it's ridiculous let's grow up
let's grow up and be honest that if
people act differently they get treated
differently every time all the all the
time everywhere in every case
no exceptions
so if we can't even be adult enough to
say do they do they all act the same
because yes they're being treated
differently you know i'm willing to
accept that
that they're being treated differently
but you've got to act the same if you're
going to make that argument
all right and i don't know if they are
i'm not even saying they're not i'm just
saying that if you if you can't control
for that variable this is a ridiculous
argument
apparently
if you're white according to this
fellow you'll benefit from better
education health care job opportunities
and finances
will you
will you
it seems to me that that's more about
money isn't it
it seems to me that every black person
born with money
or who goes to school and does well and
you know
gets money don't you think every one of
them will have a good education health
care job opportunities and finances
as long as that money
so he's pretending that this isn't about
money
which of course it is
um would you rather be a
child of a wealthy black family
or the child of a poor white family
which one of them is going to have
better education health care job
opportunities and finances
well 100 of the time it's going to be
the wealthier black family would have
all of that stuff
and the poor white family would not so
what what does the race have to do with
it
now i get you know how we got here
that's a separate conversation
uh if you have the added bonus of being
christian he goes on heterosexual
cisgender and able-bodied that you might
well never know firsthand how it feels
to be stigmatized marginalized or hated
because of some aspect of yourself over
which you have absolutely no control
that makes you very lucky indeed
well who are the lucky people
because i'm an i happen to be an
able-bodied adult white male
heterosexual
cisgender
and
every day i wake up
i'm being attacked for those things
every day
on social media every day somebody's
attacking me for being white
or male
every day
so
do you not know this
does this guy not know that being a
white male is it puts a target on your
back
in 2022 how do you not know that
all right
um
and then he goes on and he finishes up
by saying this
he says i cherish my ethnicity
which feels racist to me
if you cherish your ethnicity
that just sounds racist to me
why would you cherish it
i could see why you would not have a bad
feeling about it and that would be good
why should you have a bad feeling about
it you shouldn't but why would you
cherish it
cherishing it
says it has value right
if you think your ethnicity has value
you are a racist
because it doesn't
why would you cherish it i mean that's
just such a red flag
i don't cherish my whiteness
does anybody cherish is their whiteness
like why
like i didn't pick it i didn't work for
it
it didn't you know other white people's
accomplishments i didn't get to get the
money from that directly anyway
indirectly i guess i did
all right
so then he says uh
i cherish my ethnicity while gladly
celebrating yours and would ask you to
do the same for me
no i won't do that
i will not cherish my ethnicity and i
will not cherish yours and i won't even
respect you for doing it i have no
respect for anybody who cherishes their
ethnicity none
i wouldn't respect myself for doing it
and i think he's in exactly the wrong
direction
we should
nobody should cherish their ethnicity
that's the source of the whole problem
stop
cherishing your ethnicity
how about cherishing yourself
or your family
how about cherish your friends
cherish people cherish babies there's
lots of stuff to cherish cherish your
country
cherish you down
you cherish anything except your
ethnicity it's like the worst thing you
could cherish
all right then he says
however this is the weirdest part
however we must die deny the existence
of race
for it makes victims of us both we must
deny the existence of race
meaning he thinks race is somewhat of a
cultural
thing
societal thing
he writes the whole article about
concentrating deeply on race
and then tells us we should deny the
existence of it it doesn't even make any
sense and this guy gets a
article on cnn
so that was just like super super racist
and anti-male
and uh
apparently there's no problem getting
that sort of thing published
all right i've ranted enough on that
um
i feel like it's not very newsy day
you know if elon musk isn't doing
something today
it's just not newsy
now what do you think of the fact that
as soon as elon musk said he was a
republican
there were
uh accusations
about a sexual impropriety do you think
that's a coincidence
like the day after he says he's a
republican he gets a he gets metoo'd
right
probably not a coincidence but
do you think he became a republican
to protect himself
because there's two ways you can see
this he's either smart enough to know
that he would be protected as a
republican
because he would be
and he wouldn't be protected on his own
team if he stayed democrat
so
it's either very clever or very
coincidental could be both
it could be
i mean
it could be clever that he took care of
those accidents at the same time it's a
coincidence that this
this came out
he said he's voting republican that's
right that's that distinction is worth
making voting doesn't mean he is
republican that is correct
i should have said that
um
yeah but
i i guess i would get back to
why is it exactly illegal to offer
uh a horse for sex
here's how i think i could run for
office and win the presidency
i would only have one policy
i would make hand jobs legal
for compensation
and i would just say all right
everything the other stuff keep that
illegal because there could be troubles
with that but
anybody can sell a hand job
anybody you can price it any way you
want
but you can just sell hand jobs
to anybody who wants one
what would happen first
well the first thing would happen is
that cheating would probably go way down
because people would have an outlet at
least the men
second thing that would happen
is
uh
of course it would be the bad situation
people would be like forced into this
situation and that would be
trafficking and bad and terrible
but the other thing that would happen is
there would be this great uh
income equality leveling
don't you think
and
suddenly anybody
anybody who wanted could get as much
money as they wanted
if they were attractive
can't beat it
now give me an argument for why hand
jobs are illegal to sell say if you're a
massage therapist or something why would
it be illegal
you can certainly see why the other
stuff would be illegal but you're
literally
spending an hour rubbing a naked person
like that's actually your job
and i'm not suggesting that everybody's
a massage therapist should even consider
doing anything else you mean doing any
more i'm not saying they should
everybody gets to decide you know what
they do but why is it illegal
like you're rubbing a naked person for
an hour and you can't rub the part they
like best
if you both think it's a good idea it's
just ridiculous
chiropractors had to work
i love that comment but i know exactly
what it means
erica says i don't think a lot of wives
would even care i'll bet you
and see here's the thing
if if massages did not already exist as
a thing that people routinely do if they
can afford it
do you think that if you went to if your
husband you went to your wife and you
said hey i've got an idea
um
there's this new thing i just heard of
it's called a massage
and it requires me getting completely
naked i'll have a little sheet over me
and then a woman that you don't know and
i don't know will rob every part of my
body except you know except my genitalia
and then what would the wife say oh that
sounds pretty reasonable okay
sign up for that
no
no your wife would say um no you're not
doing that
i don't care if this is the new thing
you're not doing that
the only reason that it's even a thing
is because it's been a thing
like we just got used to it
we get used to anything if
you do it long enough
doesn't everyone get a massage
no
i would guess that 80 percent of the
world can't afford one
that would be my guess
yeah lots of people don't get massages
some people it's creepy they don't like
being touched lots of reasons
um
is the third party hand job somebody's
asking is a third party him job better
than doing it yourself i don't see how
it could
be how could it be
i don't know
[Laughter]
i'm not even going to go into that any
further
it would be a slippery
slope i don't know was that supposed to
be a joke
that's pretty funny a slippery slope
um
somebody says 120 is the going rate good
to know
all right
that is all i have to say today because
it's very slow news day did i miss
anything
is there anything in the news that i
should have mentioned
is the pennsylvania election still up in
the air did anything happen there
yeah i'm getting tired of talking about
bill maher says something about
democrats because it's happening all the
time oh monkey box
yeah
so monkey pox basically has killed zero
people so far
and i guess the smallpox vaccination
uh slows it down quite a bit
i don't know i feel like this monkey box
thing
uh
there's a wait and see i don't know if
it's a news driven or health driven
thing
watched 2000 mules i have i have watched
it we talked about that already
um
but we're still waiting for dinesh to
come up with the videos of the same
person going to multiple boxes i guess
he's working on that
so i'll wait to see that i think that's
the next thing next time to comment on
it
how many of you
have
totally fallen for the persuasion in the
tom cruise movie top gun two
yeah i've been saying that i don't want
to watch any movies because they're all
bad nobody makes a good movie and then i
see the trailers for the top gun 2 movie
and i said to myself
i'm going to watch that movie
i'll actually go to the theater to watch
that one
um
yeah i think it looks like they did a
good job you know whatever you want to
say about tom cruise
if you don't like his scientology or
whatever it is you don't like about him
uh he does make good movies
he consistently at least the action
movies i like better than the other
stuff but tom cruise's action movies
consistently excellent
in my opinion they're just consistently
well done
so
you know i'm happy to give him my money
um
he proves scientology works
you know that's one thing you don't hear
about scientology a lot
you're the critics
right you always hear about the critics
but here's the thing nobody ever says
does it
work because i'll bet it does
but it does
in terms of
making you feel like you've cleared out
whatever is holding you back
now i don't know that there's any
science to it but there doesn't need to
be because the placebo effect alone and
just persuasion would allow you to
reprogram your brain to be more
effective so
on the surface it looks like it would
work
maybe not for any scientific reason that
they say but i'll bet you that auditing
thing that the
that they do in scientology where you an
auditor a person works with you asks you
a bunch of questions and finds where
your hidden trauma is allegedly and then
gets rid of it allegedly and then you're
more
effective
and somebody says scott stop
now i'm talking strictly from my
hypnosis background
my understanding is that scientology
was sort of built on a hypnosis basis
and
what i've seen
would suggest it probably works
now i'm not suggesting you should be a
scientologist because there's a lot that
comes with that
right like buying into the lifestyle of
all that i don't know about that
that's you know you can figure that out
on your own
but if you ask the simple question
does their little you know you could
call it brainwashing you could call it
auditing you could call it persuasion
you could call it therapy
you could call it any one of those
things but does it work
i'll bet it does
i'll bet it does
because you know if you took it out of
that context and just use that technique
i'll bet you would get a lot of people
said it worked not for everybody
but i bet it does
tell you why it works well the simple
process of convincing yourself that you
found what your limitations were
and remove them
should make you perform better
so let's say
you go through this auditing process
and they ask you a bunch of questions
and they say okay
you've got this hidden trauma you didn't
know you had
and now we're going to do this thing to
deal with it and that was cleared
so you were being held back by this
trauma now it's cleared
so now go forth and do those successful
things you wanted to do would that work
it probably would
not for everybody but for a lot of
people they'd say oh
the thing that was holding me back is
now gone
so i'll put my efforts into it because
now it'll work
if the only thing it does is make people
try harder
because now they think it'll work
something's been fixed that wasn't fixed
before you should get better results
i just cured you
yeah the whole thing about you know
they're not free to leave or they'll be
punished for talking about it i'm not
defending any of that
i'm i'm not saying anything about the
organization
right you can make your own
determinations i'm just saying that that
technique
even the critics
don't criticize that
have you noticed that
look at how many critics there are of
scientology
have they ever said that the auditing
doesn't work that's the process where
they talk to you and clear out your
your uh past traumas you don't ever hear
that that would be the most obvious
thing to say
the most obvious thing to say is they
have this technique
it's the basis for the entire
system
and the technique doesn't work
if if they believed it didn't work
wouldn't they say that
wouldn't that be where you start
oh this is a scan this technique does
not work
they don't say that
they say stuff about the organization
they don't say stuff about the technique
yeah if it sounds like hypnosis it's
because it is
i think it came directly from
the field of hypnosis i'm not positive
about that but the the similarities are
striking
well let me ask you this
i'll bet there are some other hypnotists
who are watching live right now
if you are a hypnotist
and you also know about auditing and
scientology
can you confirm here that that process
seems to have borrowed from hypnosis
anybody can you give me a confirmation
some say that hubbard did based on
hypnosis yes so that's that's a rumor
um
right so those who are hypnotists can
confirm it and it's a weird thing
because
uh if he had not built all the
you know organization around it and
simply introduced the technique
you might be using it today
and i'm not even sure that it's based on
science it could be just based on
well everything's based on science i
guess
more based on a placebo effect
based on the fact that if you think you
solved your problem you did
here's the analogy from hypnosis
in hypnosis
one of the ways to treat people from a
problem
is you have them
imagine their prior life
and then you imagine they had some
trauma and a prior life
and then you have them face their trauma
while under hypnosis
they deal with their trauma under
hypnosis in their prior life not even
their current life a memory of a prior
life
they deal with the trauma
then they wake up
and then they're better
now not all the time right this stuff
doesn't work every time every person
but there are plenty of stories of
people who anecdotally
went through that process and then the
problem was solved now here's the
problem
there's no such thing as prior lives
so how do you solve a problem by
pretending there is
and pretending you took something away
from that prior life a trauma
it turns out that if you talk yourself
into you've solved your problem
you've kind of solved your problem
talking yourself into believing that you
solved it
is the solution
for mental problems it wouldn't help you
with a physical problem but for a mental
problem if you believe you've solved it
you solve it
because mental problems are about
beliefs
so uh how to write hypnotically
i don't know if i could put that in a
short lesson
that would be hard
because that that really would take a
lot of development to do that
right yeah so
it's a way to put the blame on something
else a prior life a bad experience and
once you put that blame somewhere and
you think you've dealt with it it makes
it makes you imagine that you solved
your problem even if you didn't
so scientology has a similar kind of
technique there
so
my experience would suggest that it
would work for a lot of people
and that they would feel that their
their lives have been greatly improved
by it could be
all right um
i believe i've done everything i need to
do is there anything else i haven't
talked about
that you want to hear about
uh
bb formula scandal
yeah i don't know what the situation is
with abbott and the baby formula
um
yeah so joe biden's only message to
north korea was hello
period
so biden was asked what what message
does he have for north korea
he just said hello period
okay
we do not have the right guy on that job
i think the other guy would be shaking
hands with kim jong-un right now and
working out the problems
um
sacrifice makes you double down on
belief i think so
that is true
yeah we talked about ukraine
uh do i think the dnc is removing biden
it looks like it
it looks like the dnc is trying to
figure out
you know i think that we'll see who
they've selected because there'll be
stories about this
politician you haven't seen in a while
so i think there's so watch for this i
think there'll be the beginning of
democrat
media like cnn for example doing a
profile on a politician
and it'll be some young democrat
and
that's how you'll know that that's who
they chose it was like obama remember
when obama just got chosen by the media
and they decided he'd be president
someday and he was
why can't the simulation program in past
lives well the past is only designed as
needed in the simulation
the simulation would not create a real
past it would just
make you think you saw one as you needed
it
who benefits from the baby formula
crisis nobody as far as i can tell
that's why trump could fix it there was
nobody on the other side you just had to
fix it
all right laws of power
um
i guess we could talk about those
someday all right that's all for now and
i guess i will talk to you
tomorrow
