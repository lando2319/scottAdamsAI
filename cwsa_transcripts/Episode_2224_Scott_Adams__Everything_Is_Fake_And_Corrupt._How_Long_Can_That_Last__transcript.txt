good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams I don't
think you could ever have a good time
this good time anywhere anywhere in the
universe but if you'd like this to go up
to levels that only aliens have ever
seen before all you need is a copper mug
or a glass of tanker Chelsea's Diana
campaign jug of flask of vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dope
immediately the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip go
Ah that's good stuff for good stuff
well the theme for today
is everything is fake
except for the things that are real that
are corrupt
so you've got things that don't exist
and also things that do exist that are
totally corrupt and fake
and that's all there is
that's it
so that's going to be the theme for
today
see if you can find anything that's real
in any of this
number one a new video
of an alien shaky hands with a man
yeah it's one of the Grays they say
and the fact that it looks insanely fake
should not should not influence you at
all
I my favorite part is where it shakes
hands with the human
that's right
there are people who think that the
Grays shake hands
okay okay
um
so uh do you remember
I told you all I was all happy yesterday
because Amazon finally fixed the the
link to the hardcover of my book
because I had a fake link that was a
link to the old Publishers listing that
was not a real one so if you tried to
buy my book
you would hit the fake link and you'd
think it wasn't available in hardcover
so I finally got that taken down
yesterday
it's back up fake link is back up
yep um I believe that Amazon says they
have an automated process of some sort
that they can remove it but the
automated process
will run and put it back
so that only the publisher can take it
away and they don't respond to me
this is not like a perfect a perfect
story
Amazon can't give a correct link the one
they know is correct
so it's not a question of whether they
know there's one that's fake they know
it's fake
they can't remove it because they say
only the publisher who put it there can
do it and they don't return my messages
so I'm the only person in the world who
has to hire a lawyer
to sue somebody just to get listed on
Amazon correctly
like so so today it's lawyer time so
portfolio penguin is going to hear from
my lawyers today now they probably just
ignoring me it's you know it's like they
got better things to do but I've tried
to launch a book
and Amazon can't figure out how to put
the right light there even when they
know the right link they can't put it
there
incompetence corruption
and
we're we're in a incompetent cycle like
I've never seen and it's hard to know
exactly what's going on here but nothing
works nothing works
all right
um
you know I'm still amazed that the media
is ignoring the story about President
Joe Biden calling those Nazis in Florida
very fine people
I mean can you believe he did that
the president of the United States Joe
Biden calling Nazis people identify as
Nazis as very fine people
it's just it's mind-boggling and the
media is totally ignoring it
all right
um
[Music]
this is my favorite nickname for a
public figure uh you know I like my own
nickname pretty well claw Adams but this
is this was pretty good
uh glitch McConnell
instead of Mitch McConnell he's glitch
McConnell
yes
um
as I wrote in my
in my robots read news comic that you
can generally only see if it's if you're
a subscriber on locals
that scientists have found the missing
link
you know they're always looking for that
missing evolutionary link between apes
and humans but they they now have the
missing link uh it was Turtles it was
Turtles
all the time
so because science is totally legit and
if the scientists say it's true
well who am I the question is it's not
like I'm a scientist so if the missing
link between apes and people is Turtles
sounds reasonable to me like why would
they lie
now but the funny name is the funny
thing is the name of the turtle
it's called Uh
mcconnellus speakers
mcconnellus speakers is the name of the
turtle they found
you should just assume that nothing I
say today is true
all right uh Thomas Massey is getting
ready to
Sue uh
sue somebody if he's going to file a
lawsuit if buying Biden reinstates the
federal mask mandate on airplanes
Sue exactly the government
can you sue the federal government
because of mass mandates
I don't know who you would sue but he's
going to sue somebody so good for him at
least there's somebody showing some
backbone and some pushback
but you know the
it's easy If you're sort of in one news
bubble to imagine that the rest of the
public feels the same way
but at least half of the public thinks
that a mass is going to save their lives
I don't want to report this to you
because I know how you're going to feel
about it
but where I live
masks have come out
and specifically they're out for people
who are walking alone and riding
bicycles by themselves
no joke
it's the people walking alone
literally
Outdoors
and on bicycles Outdoors alone
fully masked
now
what what do I do about that
you know the the only Solace I can take
is that there was recently a study that
uh backed masks for one purpose I don't
know if you saw it but it was a study
that said uh that they studied mask
usage and masks are 50 effective
in uh curing ugliness
I'll wait I'll wait let that sink in a
little bit
okay
you know I actually have a theory that
some people like masks
because they don't like how they look
the the people who are alone and wearing
a mask I don't really think that's about
covid
I feel like they're they're taking the
opportunity to cover their faces because
they want to cover their faces that's
what it feels like it doesn't feel like
they're actually afraid of the virus I
mean not riding a bicycle
it feels like they prefer having a mask
on for whatever reason
but anyway uh glitch McConnell as
Emerald Robinson called them in a tweet
she tweeted that glitch McConnell
temporarily unfreezes
this is the way we're talking about our
leaders
temporarily he temporarily temporarily
can talk uh it temporarily unfreezes
dispute CIA talking points before
returning to a meat locker somewhere
inside the capitol
the GOP is a joke all right
you know you can take sides all you want
right but the Republicans are a
disaster
there's no way around it the Republican
party is just a disaster at this point
yeah there are there are certainly
individuals who are stars I you know I
love my Thomas Masseys and Tom Cotton
and a lot of the people running for
president
but
really do you do you want any
credibility at all
basically leaving McConnell in office
takes all the credibility from the
Republican Party
the Democrats quite legitimately can
ignore everything they say I mean it's
very much like the you know Judge
Jeanine thing where if somebody lies to
you about one thing
you're certainly within your logical and
within your rights to imagine that
everything else they say is non-credible
as well
and the Republicans are trying to look
credible
while keeping McConnell in place now you
might say but but what can they do about
it probably everything
probably everything you don't think that
they can get rid of them if they were
Unified
I don't know I mean I don't know what
the problem is my guess is he's got too
much blackmail on people
can you do you think it could be
anything else it's got to be either
blackmail
or he's the one who Doles out the
rewards
so basically the people who need him to
give them rewards you know some kind of
I don't know assignments to committees
or whatever the hell he does but
this could not be a more broken
government to say that we have a
function in government would just be a
joke we don't have a government nor do
we have an opposition we don't have
anything
you know at least if your opposition was
healthy and functioning you could say
well even if something happens to the
government the opposition is good
uh yeah I think JD Vance was pushing for
some legislation to ban masks right
and I doubt it would be passed I doubt
it would be asked
doesn't matter what people want
because the government doesn't work
um
so I thought this was funny as you know
the ADL there's a pitched battle with
Elon Musk
so the ADL tried to destroy Twitter when
musk bought it and they're making claims
which of course sound
don't sound like they're factually true
but about things got much worse on
Twitter as soon as musk took over but
they said it before he took over
I mean they're making the claims before
he'd made any changes and before the
transaction was done so you can see that
the claims about Elon Musk were
unrelated to anything that was actually
happening factually
so
the ADL tries to destroy
Twitter now X
by punishing its uh advertisers and
saying you know basically they'll
they'll have a big reputational problem
if they if they keep going with
advertising so the x-platform Lost 60 of
its advertisers making a 22 billion
dollar investment
nearly worthless you know unless he does
something extraordinary to to increase
its value
so how are you suing
and of course because Elon Musk is the
whale in the fight you know he's he's
the big one that's hard to kill it
allows other people like me
to be full-throated in our
um talking out against the ADL which is
a terrible organization terrible for the
country
just imagine how terrible this is
if the X platform goes out of business
in my opinion that's the end of free
speech in the United States would you is
that too far
now it's not as if smaller Publications
couldn't publish you know Breitbart
could still publish right
so if Breitbart can still publish you'd
say well that's free speech except you
know Breitbart is hidden or at least it
used to be I think it still is by Google
search
if you if you try to look for a
Breitbart it's just hidden by the search
engines and the social media companies
so is that free how about Fox News well
Fox News still that's they're free right
Fox News was was taking advertisement
from tick tock
do I need to connect the dots
that's not exactly a free publication if
they're taking taking advertising from a
Chinese organ
that's not it's not even close to being
credible unfortunately I hate to say it
but I mean that's sort of a line too far
and so if the in my opinion if the X
platform goes down
that's the end of free speech
and would you agree that free speech
is the only thing that holds you know
the Republic together
and if America falls apart that could
have a ripple effect
of a proportion we can't even imagine
so the ADL and one person in particular
that Jonathan and Greenblatt who's a bad
bad human being let me tell you he's a
bad person oh my God he's just evil to
the core because what he does is smear
people like me he speared me in public
to to basically ruin your life and your
career
for purely political gain
now the cover the cover is that they're
trying to get rid of defamation they're
trying to get rid of discrimination and
help people but none of that's real it
probably was real when it was founded
you know I I think I believe the ADL has
a history of doing some good things I
wouldn't want to ignore that but at the
moment their leader is pure evil and
he's he's ruined the reputation forever
I mean you could never think of the ADL
as anything going forward except you
know an anti-American racist
organization
if I were a Jewish American
I would be really mad that the ADL was
looking making me look so bad because I
don't think you need any more problems
right so in my opinion the single thing
that makes the um the Jewish community
in most danger is somebody representing
them
who's representing them as basically the
most awful creature you could possibly
be I mean just a horrible horrible human
being
and
so they tried so there was so much
pressure you know you could see Glenn
Greenwald and Michael schellenberger and
you know me and a bunch of other people
were sort of piling on the ADL because
it's a little bit safer to do you have
somebody like me took the money
individually I would just be you know
creamed and wiped off the map in about a
minute but because there's enough
Firepower there's a little bit of
resistance now what what do the people
a lot of the people were pushing back
what do they have in common they're
already canceled
right like people like me are already
canceled
the the ADL uh the head of the ADL
labeled me in public this year a
holocaust denier
which I'm not even going to talk to
obviously I don't deny the Holocaust so
you know it's ridiculous
and that's something they said in public
about me
right now what what problems were I
causing
like what what was the evil that they
needed to kill is it is it because I'm
working on a student guide to help them
be successful specifically would help
the lower income people
that's what I'm working on
I'm working on fixing
systemic racism
every day
literally every day it's like the main
thing I'm doing so my books are for the
adults and now we're turning into a
student guide you know Joshua lisac and
I and
I've only tried to make things better
like I don't have I don't have any
business model in which I make money by
making things worse like that that's not
even on the plate right
but they're trying to take it take away
free speech they're trying to take away
whatever benefit I could give to the
world
and they're doing it specifically
because uh anybody that the Democrats
don't like
the ADL attacks because they're sort of
like the pit bulls for the Democrats so
they're completely partisan organization
completely disgraced so if you were
completely disgraced and uh probably a
existential threat to humanity itself
through the suppression of free speech
and the ripple effect that would have
where would they go to rehabilitate
themselves
so that they could you know fight back
and and show that they were serious and
good people
well they would go on CNN
because at least half of the country
doesn't know that CNN is not a credible
news organization and I say that not as
a partisan it's just a fact that they're
not even close to being like a real news
organization but once again they used to
be
right CNN used to be credible under Ted
Turner I thought that they actually
covered the news that was my impression
but at the moment it's just propaganda
so who do they bring on to talk to
Jonathan greenblatt
uh Abby Hoffman I think I have the right
name
one of the Prime pushers of the fine
people hoax on CNN
one of the people most notably
a pusher of fake news is obvious fake
news every and CNN knows his fake news
so it's basically a racist attack on
essentially Republicans
so they bring on the least credible
hoax pushing racist
so that the head of the ADL the worst
person in the world
can be redeemed
and here's the the messed up part
if you were just a casual viewer of CNN
and you thought that they were still a
news organization
and you thought the ADL was a legitimate
defender of people
because that's what both of them used to
be
what you saw would be so confusing
because you would think why is why is
Elon Musk turned into this terrible
person according to them why is he
trying to stop you know this good work
of the ADL
you wouldn't know anything that's going
on you would be completely lost
because the the layers of are
so thick that there's an entire segment
of the the world that just doesn't know
none of it's real
so
anyway it's going to be part of my
mission to make sure the ADL has the
worst reputation they could possibly
have because they are an existential
threat to the United States
all right
there's a big story about the Liberty
Safe Company
who under uh
with what would you call it a legal
cover were asked by the FBI to give up
their secret code that would open a
customer safe there was a warrant yeah
there was a warrant let me use the legal
word so the FBI had a warrant it was all
very illegal
I don't even remember what the case was
whose safe was it
can you remind me who's safe they got
into which turned out to be less
important than the safe story
oh is one of the January Sixers okay so
one of the January Sixers had a Liberty
Safe by the Liberty company and uh
so the FBI wanted to get in it so they
just took a warrant to the safe company
and they got the secret code and went
and opened the safe
now what did all the
Republicans say about that conservatives
they said my God what's the point of
having a safe
if if law enforcement can open it
anytime they want
do you know how dumb that argument is I
had to say all right so here here I'm
going to offend most of you because you
because most of you are on the side of
how could they have a back door to the
safe and give it to law enforcement
right and you're all like oh that's
terrible okay that's the worst argument
let me wake you up for a little bit
there's no such thing as a safely FBI
can't get into
that they were going to get into the
safe
do you think that the code
the code was the only way they were
going to get into the safe
of course not
so does it matter that the company had
the code now the reason the company
keeps the code is for the benefit of the
customers
right it's the benefit of the customers
that's the only reason
so if you lose your I don't know if you
can't get into your own safe we get the
combo or something then you can call the
company and they'll give you your secret
code once they determine it's really you
can get it
now
the company is going to probably going
to get boycotted by conservatives
because they don't understand anything
about how anything works
let me ask you this
did you not already know that the safe
companies have a secret code
you didn't already know that
really
of course
of course they do right
and are you also worried about digital
money
is anybody worried about the government
having you know digital money
like a digital currency because then
they can turn off your services making
up buy things right
yeah how much cash do you keep in your
wallet versus your credit card purchases
and your ATM per your debit card when
was the last time you paid cash or
anything
do some of you still use cash
I literally don't know the last oh I can
think of one I guess
now almost all of your purchases are
with digital money
they can turn off your credit card
anytime they want
they can turn off your bank tomorrow
they don't need any digital currency to
turn off your ability to buy stuff
yeah now in the short run you could
maybe figure out how to be a you know
live off the grid and have cash but how
long is that going to last
that's not exactly a lasting you know
you're going to pay your mortgage with
cash
I mean not the the government can turn
off your spending anytime they want and
always good well always since there were
credit cards and Banks and stuff
yeah so a lot of what people are worried
will happen happened a long time ago
it's the same with privacy
you're worried that uh that they might
get into your stuff
where have you been the government could
get into anything they're interested in
anything
they just need a reason
do you think that they care about what
you're doing if you're not you know
interesting in other words if you
haven't done something political or done
something illegal
they don't care so you have you have
privacy only because nobody cares but
that's it and it's been that way for
years
for years we've had no privacy
we've only had the privacy of not being
interesting so nobody looked
the moment the government is interested
in you but here's the trick
as a criminal that would be one reason
they're interested in you because
there's evidence of a crime what's the
other reason
for political reasons yeah there's
literally nothing to stop the government
from making up a reason to
study you know maybe they're looking
they can find a warrant against somebody
you're talking to and then that gets
some records you know your records
you never had any privacy
never had it now I suppose if you're
worried that the NSA will like pick up
your language that you're using and you
know they'll automatically flag you in a
way that they don't now maybe but is
that a privacy problem
or is that
just they're really good at violating it
but no you never have any privacy your
safe was never secure not from the
government
your safe is always secure from your
stupid neighbor's kid who broke into
your garage you don't want him to get
your guns but you're never safe from the
government
so all of those complaints are I think
looking to bankrupt a company that was
just doing what a Safe Company should
probably do which is serve its customers
uh well Jacob you're coming in late
because I just explained how my book
listing has been removed once again by
Amazon so somebody here is like but at
least Scott can sell books
no not very easily turns out I can't
I'm the most canceled person in the
country somebody says well at least
please consult some books try finding
any of the 45 books they canceled
good luck with that
all right
um
so are you following this 14th Amendment
uh coup
as Joel Pollock points out
so a number of the states are looking to
deny Trump the ability to run in their
state
by pushing this 14th Amendment which
would call him an insurrectionist
basically basically and say you can't
run for president in our state
or at least we won't put you on the
ballot because you're an insurrectionist
now apparently there's a lot of energy
behind this like it's not just a fluky
thing there are a number of states that
are looking at it very seriously and
pursuing it
now as Joel points out
the Democrats are operating like the
Iranian regime
does that sound too far
is that too much of a too much of an
exaggeration
well he backs it up here's the next part
of the sentence trying to disqualify the
opposition and that claiming that what's
left is the democratic election
that's exactly the Iranian system
the Iranian system is of course it's
democracy once we decide who's on the
ballot
oh you want this guy in the ballot well
he's disqualified
but of the people that we approve of
totally democratic
it's literally
no there's no exaggeration this is
literally the Iranian system that the
people in charge
the people running the elections decide
who gets gets to run as opposed to the
people design that is the Iranian system
you know normally I I would mock
you know any kind of analogy in this in
this you know usually because analogies
are imperfect but in the central point
of the analogy it's right up it's exact
if you if you can't run because the
people in charge say you won't be on the
ballot
that's the Iranian system that's the
exact Iranian system
and the Democrats are plotting this and
how do you not call it an Insurrection
that they're doing this
isn't what they're doing right now and
active Insurrection they're involved in
it at the moment but do you know why
that nobody would call it that
it's because they're following a legal
process
an illegal process can be resolved by
working it up through the court system
maybe you get to the Supreme Court and
then it gets resolved
so that's not really it's not really an
Insurrection if the court system can
resolve it right wouldn't you agree
if there's something going on that the
courts can resolve in the normal the
normal manner that they do nothing
special that's not really an
insurrection
that's people using the law and then the
law decides what uses were appropriate
exactly like January 6.
alternate electors maybe they were no
bueno
maybe they weren't I don't know but I
know the court could work it out
that's it
so it's exactly January 6. it's a legal
process that maybe the courts would
throw away just as I imagine they might
throw away this
14th Amendment thing
at the same time
that one group is being put in jail for
22 years for minor crimes related to
what they call an Insurrection the
reason the minor crimes are getting the
long sentences is
because it's in the context of
an insurrection
that that would be the argument it's way
worse because the context is
insurrection
but they're actually doing the same kind
of insurrection meaning using the law as
it exists until some larger Court some
higher Court
says it's either a acceptable user is it
isn't
same process
and one of them is putting people in
jail for 22 years for shaking offense
and breaking a window
and one of them is uh being applauded
and probably re-elected
yeah nothing in the country
is working it's all corrupt
it's all it's all corrupt every
 thing
want to see another one
and do you remember the sanctuary cities
hey you immigrants you can all come here
because you know we don't care about the
inconvenience
or the expense or maybe any added crime
or any of that what we care about is
that if you come here you're safe
so the southern states Texas and Florida
said well let's see if you've been that
so they started shipping people the
immigrants to their states
as of today
the mayor mayor Adams of New York City
says that basically New York City is
done
they're cooked that the city is dead or
it's on its way to being dead for sure
because the number of immigrants coming
in 10 000 per month are completely
unsustainable and is turning the city
into a hellscape there are 12 billion in
deficit and they're going to have to cut
budgets you know way down to be able to
afford all the immigrants and he's
saying out loud basically didn't work
this whole you know he's not saying
those words but he's saying clearly the
system doesn't work and that you have to
treat it
some other way
um
yeah so
this is a perfect example of how this is
Amplified Embrace and amplify
so that's what the uh the governors were
doing so DeSantis and Abbott were
embracing the idea that these are
Sanctuary cities and they're saying
great then take all the all the people
who want Sanctuary they're all yours so
all they did is follow the rules the way
they were presented and they found that
nobody liked it
because you know why
the rules were never real
they were always there wasn't
any possibility that that set of rules
could create a a stable situation it
could only create exactly what we're
seeing there was no other way it could
go and I think everybody knew it but it
took two smart governors
to you know push the case because if the
only thing that happened is uh
Florida and Texas became more Democrat
you know that that's what the the free
immigration people would imagine would
happen if that's all that would happen I
don't think anybody would care outside
of those States but those two states
cleverly made other states care
and pushed pushed it just right
so our immigration is completely broken
the whole Sanctuary City thing was a
joke from the start I mean it had some
good purpose the purpose is that the
Immigrant Community could talk to the
police without worrying about getting
deported so I mean you can make an
argument for that
maybe not a convincing one but at least
there is an argument for that right so
here it is again everything about this
is broken
um
how about uh
there's a CNN poll on
what things about Biden Democrats
themselves are worried about
so it's a really long list of things
that they've been worried about
including his age that was the number
one answer 49 but also had a whole list
of other things that people could be
worried about such as his policies
right but the interesting thing is that
how many of the things on the list
also got to his incompetence
for example
these are separate categories you could
be worried that he's too old you could
be worried separately that he's mentally
incompetent
what does too old mean
they worry separately it's a different
category about his health
which is totally different than being
worried about it being too old or
mentally incompetent
health is a whole different category a
separate category is ability to handle
the job
ability to handle the job what would be
the reason they would even think of that
huh the other one is a separate category
is stamina
totally different from his age
is stamina
um and then the another one is
misspeaking and blunders
misspeaking in blunders
one two three four five six different
categories
that were all the same thing
that he is his brain is gone that's it
they had to break it into six categories
so that you couldn't see how many
Democrats agree his brain is gone
oh I don't know if his brain is gone but
I'd be a little worried about his
stamina
or oh no I don't know about his if he's
too old but I'm worried a little bit
about his health
come on
come on this even the pole is complete
misleading you know and I know
some people say well look CNN did a poll
to make Biden look bad because half of
the Democrats say he's too old
no they didn't
they they made a poll that cleverly
disguised how badly he's doing even
comparing you know even his own party
all right here's a story I don't know if
this is true
saw this on
on x
um
and here's the here's the claim
so you know that Larry Sinclair guy
who's claiming he had
some oral sex with Obama did some coke
back when Obama was you know
pre-pre-famous
and or I guess he was just just starting
out or something now I think we all
agree we don't care
right so none of us care what Obama did
in his private life before he was a
public figure I don't really care now
you could you could argue the hypocrisy
and how did the how did the news cover
it versus how do they cover other things
so you could extend that the thing you
don't care about
to maybe some things you do care about
but I don't know that feels just cheap
to me to me I just can't care but that's
not where I'm going on this so part of
the claim and I I don't know if this is
true
all right we're coming from a
you know a source that would require
some backup uh some backup I would think
but the claim is that uh after Larry
Sinclair went public with his claims
about Obama first in 2008
that Beau Biden
put out an arrest warrant from him from
Delaware
Beau Biden so Beau Biden tried to have
him arrested immediately after he went
public about Obama
but now there the arrest was valid right
he was arrested for a real crime
apparently not
because he didn't get convicted of any
real crimes
barely not but what did happen is that
Joe Biden became the vice president soon
after Beau Biden did a favor for Obama
that's right so Beau Biden does a favor
for Obama by taking out his credit
and then then the father is picked as a
vice president
soon after huh
so
[Music]
Can it can you see all the gears of the
machine
were you were you ever
um wondering why Obama who's obviously
smart
obviously knows that Joe Biden is a
disaster
why would he pick him
what possible reason would somebody as
smart as Obama
pick somebody as crooked and incapable
as Biden
I can only think of one reason
Biden was his tool
and he knew he could control Biden
because Biden was crooked
so what he needed was the most crooked
guy he could to do all this that he
didn't want to do himself
give him a level of deniability well I
don't know Biden did that
yeah so to me it looks like the Obama
Administration was a criminal Enterprise
is that too strong
I think it was a criminal Enterprise
yeah all the indications are that
all right
um
pretty sure there was something else I
was going to talk about here
oh Microsoft is uh going to try to meet
their climate goals
by storing CO2 in rocks
now
uh isn't there also a story about a 1600
scientists saying climate alarm is not
warranted the climate's changing they
say but uh but don't be alarmed the
alarm part is what's a question again I
say and I think they were questioning
the models
it is amazing to me that
the news convinced the public that the
models that predicted the climate that
that's science
that to me that's one of the greatest
you know accomplishments of fake news
convincing people that prediction models
are part of science
it's really the opposite
do you know what predictions models are
made to do because I used to make them
that used to be my job when I was a
working in the bank and then the phone
company is I would predict you know what
the budget would do in a year I'd
predict how a new project would turn out
well we'd spend some money but we'll
make that back in five years or whatever
how accurate were my predictions
foreign
do you know why we did these predictions
that we couldn't imagine were accurate
or not and we had no idea there was just
no way to know
because we didn't use them to find out
what was true
that's not what they were for do you
know what they were for
prediction models are for persuasion
that's it
they're just for persuasion
now it might be persuasion in the
service of getting funding it might be
persuasion because you believe something
is is a legitimate Danger
and it's hard to convince people so you
use these models models are not science
they are propaganda
and persuasion
by their nature I'm not saying that
somebody took a good tool and they you
know they corrupted it no the tool is
corrupt by its nature it can only be
corrupt it doesn't have a legitimate use
well okay I'll give them I'll give you
this
your models if you have enough models
and you play with it long enough you
could create a cone of probability
but even that would be pretty suspicious
right yeah the best you can do is say
well we don't know but probably within
this range it'll turn out it's not going
to be way up here it's not going to be
way down here it's you know worst cases
here best case here so somewhere in this
range that's the best case
do you think models have done a good job
historically of even predicting the
range
no
no
there's no science no logic that would
say they ever could they're not even for
that they are for persuasion
because if the scientists told you in
words I got some words for you
I studied some things
humans are creating greenhouse gases
it's making things warmer I predict
it'll be way warmer and then things will
fall apart
and then people say ah I've got a lot of
things to worry about today
so they go back and they go okay
nobody's persuaded by our facts we need
something visual
so then suddenly you've got a hockey
stick prediction you know the famous one
that things will be getting warmer
gradually than out of control
now you've got something to look at and
you can say whoa that's a scary shape
look at that shape
the shape scares me
because we're visual creatures you have
to turn it visual so the only reason for
models
is that it's hard to get people worked
up
legitimately or illegitimately
with just straight facts you got to turn
it into a picture you got to show a
dying polar bear
so it's got to be visual so every time
you see anything visual
whether it's a picture of a graph or a
or a hurricane or a dying thing those
are all in the field of persuasion
none of that science
nor does it confirm any science right if
they did separately a test that
confirmed it you could maybe
maybe probably not
but you have to understand all of that
is not science and the fact that CNN and
MSNBC and all the illegitimate
entities are trying to convince you that
it is
and that if you don't believe the
persuasion part you don't believe
science
as if
now
here's why here's why I will never be
asked by MSNBC or CNN to give my opinion
on climate
because
except for Vivek
I have the best opinion well best
explained opinion
because most people can't explain what's
wrong with models
you would have to have actually that
experience to know that you can tweak a
variable and get anything you want
because I did
it was my job tweaking variables to get
what my boss wanted the answer to be
that was my job
do you think if I had a prediction that
said that the thing that they wanted to
do was uneconomical do you think I was
going to bring that to my boss
why would I I would just have to go back
and change it
that's how the real world works the real
world doesn't use projections as
information it's just propaganda
persuasion and it's it's an icky part of
the process it's basically marketing is
marketing for scientists that's what it
is and people are judging the marketing
and acting like the marketing is the
science
that's one of those things that I can
say that regular people can't say
because I'm a little more freedom
all right
was there a story I missed
your eyes look high
my eyes look bloodshocks I'm tired I've
been working too hard
working way too hard no I'm not high
but thanks for asking
Don Steele says
nobody gives a about Scott's
position on anything and he's butt hurt
Don you're on my live stream
did you look at all the things you could
do today in your life
and you said you know what I can do I'd
like to be on the worthless guys live
stream today that was your decision Don
so if I'm worthless
that would make you like the dingleberry
on the worthless guy's ass
right so at least the worthless guy
was important enough for you to be my
dingleberry
so
digital Berry Dan
dingleberry Dawn
has decided that that was how the value
he would add to the world today
so the value you added was Adam
all right I have one more story to blow
your minds you ready
so this is a true story that I can
confirm
and you can confirm it too actually it's
easy to confirm
um RFK Jr has this problem with his
voice called spasmodic dysphonia most of
you know I had exactly the same disorder
and you don't hear it
you can you can confirm with your own
ears that I do not sound like RFK Jr and
I was cured by surgery
the the reason I got cured by surgery is
that I found a doctor who knew a doctor
who was doing a surgery so I didn't use
any public sources you know I didn't use
Google Google didn't turn it up couldn't
find it in any search but a doctor knew
a doctor who knew a doctor
that got me to Dr Gerald Burke
at uh
the U.S let's see what is it
Southern there's a Southern California
entity a big important one with the long
name
anyway so I talked to other people who
had done the surgery
and they all they were all perfect they
were cured they all had perfect voices
so I knew it was real because I talked
to people who did it real people so I
did the surgery and it's a long recovery
but now I'm recovered and my voice is
you know at least you can understand it
now if you were to do a Google search
which by the way I would invite you to
do right now if you have a second screen
type in the cure for spasmodic dysphonia
and what should pop up
The Cure right I have the Cure it's a
it's a known surgery by a very
respectable top surgeons you know it's
not it's not I'm not talking about
randos I'm talking about one of the top
surgeons in this field
invented the Cure
but now instead of saying that there's a
cure it'll say there's no cure but it
can be treated by Botox injections
through the front of your throat
to your your vocal cords that will stun
the vocal cords with a little bit of
poison
so that they don't spasm as hard but you
talk like you did helium
you could talk about no matter what your
voice sounded like before have it sound
like this so sometimes for like a week
your voice would be okay but uh several
weeks later after it got worse it was
worse
then you would get another shot
and it would still be worse because you
just kept shot
but then after a week or so you'd be
able to talk like this for a little
while
and remember the the injection
goes through the front of your throat
to reach the interior back of your
throat where your vocal cords are
and they're just sort of guessing
they're guessing if the needle's hitting
the right place because they can't see
it
and they use a little uh sound thing
where the where you go I think you hum
or something you go huh and then they
see if they can pick up the sound but
they're basically kind of guessing I had
this treatment this is the most horrid
medical procedure I've ever had because
you're awake when they stick a needle
through the front of your throat
the first needle is just to dead your
throat because the second needle is the
big one
it's literally the worst thing I've ever
done
so I stopped doing it because I had to
stop doing it to find out if any other
thing worked because if you were doing
the Botox injections
you couldn't really test anything else
because they would be you know ruining
the experiment
so I let mine wear off so that I
couldn't speak pretty much at all
for I don't know a year or so until I
found the surgery and there's a long
recovery so it takes a long time to
recover but it works
so now so some of you have done your
Google search right
and you searched a cure for a spasmodic
dysphonia and what did you discover
that the surgery is not listed
it says there's no cure
but the but you can treat it with botox
you know which they use the technical
name for
and that you'll you'll have to keep
doing it for the rest of your life I
think the last time I priced it was nine
hundred dollars of Botox
per treatment and I'd have to go back
once a month
times I don't know 50 000 people
so 50 000 people 900 a month
and
for that kind of money
what happens when you do a Google search
it only says Botox
that's right so right now there are I
would guess something like 30 000 people
in the country
who have the problem and if they're
lucky enough to know the name of the
problem which is actually hard to get
because you you just if you think it
could be one of 50 different things
and you've never heard of spasmodic
dysphonia so you don't even know what to
look for but if you're lucky enough to
find the name you'll search for the Cure
and it won't be there
and then your doctor will say well let
me look
the doctor can't find it either
with different sources
think about that the doctor can't find
out they're secure
now most doctors don't deal with many of
these because it's sufficiently rare
that most doctors will never see one
case
right so it's spreader you know it's
spread around everywhere
so
probably 30 000 people are have a voice
disorder which is very highly correlated
with suicide
do you know why this voice disorder is
correlated with suicide or at least
suicide ideation
because you want to kill yourself the
whole time
your your life is so bad when you can't
talk you can't have conversations you
can't get into relationships like if
you're not already married good luck and
if you are married you're going to get
divorced because you can't talk
the phone rings and you can't answer it
it's actually not worth living
I'll say it directly what I didn't think
there was a cure
I did have a second option
now I wouldn't have done it because I
was married and you know had
responsibilities and stuff so it wasn't
an option for me
because I had you know real world things
to take care of
but I wanted to
I wanted to
every day I wanted to I woke up every
day and wanted to take my own life and
if you talk to other people who have
this disorder they're going to tell you
the same thing
they may not admit it to the people in
their life because you know the same
reason they need to stay alive they may
have people who depend on them
but they want to kill themselves it's
that bad so
how bad is this situation
do you believe that RFK Jr is correct
when he says generally speaking that the
big Pharma industry is not on your side
because in this situation that's 30 000
people who wake up every day don't know
that they could be cured and want to
kill themselves
now if I were not talking to you live
so you can actually hear my keyword
voice see my this is my scar if you're
watching it on live stream that's the
surgery scar right there
right this is real
and you can also check for yourself that
the surgical cure does not show up on
Google search
you can see for yourself you can hear me
you could talk to other people
you could talk to Dr Gerald Burke
b-e-r-k-e
he'll pop up in the search you could ask
him is there really a cure
yes have you cured many people yes
has Scott done a publicity campaign so
that people would know this cure is
available I have in fact there was a
people feature story about me just to
highlight that there's a cure
do you think that comes up if you do a
search
nope
nope I don't even know if you could ever
find it but it wouldn't be anywhere near
the top
so I did a whole publicity like you know
I spent a lot of time talking to news
people and outlets and magazines so that
other people could do a Google search
this is exactly why I did it I did it
for the SEO I did it so it would show up
on a Google search
didn't work it worked for a little while
for a little while you could find it but
it eventually got pushed down
so that's the that's the world you live
in
you've got a Mitch McConnell who I have
to assume is corrupt
because otherwise he would have retired
I see no other explanation except
corruption
you've got a corrupt Joe Biden
with a corrupt family situation
whatever happened with this Obama story
and Beau Biden if it's true it looks
corrupt to me
you've got the ADL which is pretending
to be you know defending the people who
need to be defended but it's a joke it's
a corrupt organization just an organ of
the corrupt Democrat Party
we've got a coup in progress
that's you know massed by the the legal
system but the the 14th Amendment stuff
is just a coup
I don't know what else to call it
and yeah I mean if January 6 was okay
this was a coup so
is there anything that's not corrupt
you know and we're talking about
bringing masks back
we're talking about requiring
vaccinations
after hearing my Botox story
would you get a vaccination
now I realize they're different
companies
but but it does tell you what an
environment you're in you're in an
environment of zero trust
and the reason there's a zero trust
environment
is that everybody's corrupt every
organization is corrupt all of them
you trust Alex Berenson
good luck
yeah I mean I get that I get that the
critics got some stuff right but
there's nobody you can trust
yeah I wouldn't confuse somebody who
agrees with you with somebody who's
credible that's those are not the same
things because you know
I believe he questioned everything about
the pandemic and got three quarters of
him right is that about right
he basically said everything was
 no matter what they said and he
was probably right 75 percent of the
time which is impressive
it's pretty impressive actually
um
but somebody was going to be right and
that's the part the public doesn't see
for any question this binary it's either
true or it's not true won't there always
be people on both sides
so you can guarantee that somebody's
gonna be right but not because they're
smart
there just had to be somebody right
because there were only two choices and
there were people on both sides
so of course somebody was going to be
right
um Dr Peter McCullough says the house of
medicine is on fire true and Dr Jordan
Peterson just called out Dr McCullough
for not understanding
a study
yeah and like a really basic way
so if if Dr McCullough is your standard
he also I think was right about a lot of
stuff
right wasn't he right about a lot of
stuff
and it is in his skepticism I think his
skepticism was more right than wrong
but it's also true that the examples he
used were embarrassingly misinterpreted
both things can be true
so the the the
medical community seems completely
fraudulent
oh somebody found the uh how hard did
you have to look for it before you found
my surgical cure
uh uh success rates ratio of 50 to 80
percent with surgery
is not for every patient well that's
true
but Mount Sinai is also not the experts
at that surgery
if you talk to the person who invented
it
it's closer to a 75 percent
Improvement but you do have to pick you
have to pick your patients that is
correct if you if you don't if you don't
uh have some selectivity about the
patients it'll be lower of course
uh
you were maybe Rupert maybe the vax data
was done by age and by comorbidity
do you think it was
maybe I'll get I'll give you the maybe
on that but uh Dr Peterson asked the
question and I would have asked the same
one
75 is not a complete cure no 75 percent
are people who are happy that they had
functional voices
so do I sound cured
does it does it sound like
you can't understand what I say
that's a complete cure
so but not for every person that's true
people had very various forms of success
uh we don't judge you for getting vaxed
well most of you do actually
yeah most of you who are mad at my
vaccination status are comparing it to
your own choices
for a different body
now I don't know how many times I have
to say that stupid
but I'm just giving up on it for now I'm
just going to give up on it because I I
don't know how you can
I don't know how many times a 25 year
old healthy person can say that I should
have made the same choice no doubt about
it
maybe I should have maybe I should have
but if you're not me stay the out
of it
all right
um
my reason was weak
you don't know my reason if you think my
reason was weak you don't know my reason
so let let's understand that you don't
know what my internal thought process
was
would you agree with that would you
agree that none of you know my internal
thought process
so therefore you don't know anything
because you're judging my thought
process you're not judging the
vaccination you're judging me
so you actually think you're a mind
reader of some kind
because you think I should have made the
same Choice as you even though I was in
a completely different and unique
situation
um
what about Phil bump
you need to learn how to research from
Phil bump does everybody seen Phil bump
go back it's another you know that the
Washington Post is not real news
and hasn't been for a long time you know
it's a CIA organ or I don't know FBI or
whoever it is yeah but you know our news
is not real
the political stuff is all CIA driven
how do you feel about that Ukraine war
do you think we do you think there would
be a war in Ukraine if our government
were not corrupt
I don't think so
I don't think so I mean maybe Putin
would have taken over Ukraine that's
possible but I don't think there would
be a war without corruption
I believe the entire war is is a cover
for
or an opportunity for or maybe both
corruption
so to me it's not a war it's a bunch of
corruption that has violence associated
with it it's more like more like the
mafia than a war
and by the way do you know why we don't
need to worry about Putin using nukes
do you know why we don't have to worry
about Putin using nukes
he doesn't need them
that
to me that's the whole story
because he has more bodies than the
ukrainians and apparently the Russians
don't have any political pushback
now it might be hard to get information
out of Russia that's accurate but is
there any evidence whatsoever
that the Russian people are too
concerned about how many prisoners and
young men they send to die
it doesn't appear that there's any
political pushback whatsoever in Russia
am I wrong I mean I haven't seen
evidence of it not that we would
necessarily know but as long as there's
no public pushback to the number of
young men who are being killed
as long as they can pay their bills
basically as long as Moscow is fine
they can just keep running it and the
ukrainians are going to run out of human
beings
so why would you nuke when you could
just keep doing what you're doing and be
patient
so we have basically
zero nuclear risk because the whole
thing is a corrupt ridiculous charade I
like to say charade not charade
um it's obvious it's obvious that we
know that Russia is going to grind down
the ukrainians
now
that could be the the end of the story
it could be Ukraine runs out of people
I was talking about this on podcast with
uh Colonel Manus and
he was saying that the big variable is
going to be you know Ukrainian soldiers
they'll just run out of soldiers but I
said
um being no military mind myself
can somebody give me a fact check how
long has the actual Invasion the
original invasion was when how long ago
when Russia moved in
because I'm losing my sense
uh you're having the same problem you're
losing your sense of time
well let's not count 2014. I know I know
where you're going with that but if you
count the more modern move February 22.
all right so a year and a half or a year
and eight months or whatever it is
so here's the question do you think that
in a year and eight months or whatever
the United States
working with Ukraine do you think that
they haven't built an enormous uh drone
Army
that's waiting to be launched
now maybe not I have no information no
inside information but if I were running
a major war and I knew that drones were
going to be and things that fly were
going to be the major determinant of
outcomes I would immediately spin up a
wartime secret facility it'd have to be
sacred so we wouldn't know about it and
I would start making a programmable
drones that could fly in waves
so here's what I think I'll give you a
let's say a half prediction
it's a half prediction because maybe a
50 chance
that when the ukrainians are
legitimately running out of bodies like
actually don't have any you know to run
the big machines and it looks like
Russia could just you know walk over
them that there has to be another
response which is not going to be just
quit and give up I think that you're
going to see the sky blackened
with drones
I feel like there might be an enormous
um
let's say a wave of drones that nobody's
ever seen in Warfare before
that would only be Unleashed
if it's necessary
the other otherwise maybe we'd keep this
in our back pocket but I feel like the
ukrainians would not be managing the
drones if you know what I mean
so if you have one let's say master
control
to to handle an army of drones that are
operating in unison and just blocking
the sky over the enemy
you would need somebody who's like the
the central operator of that
and there's no way that's going to be a
Ukrainian
am I wrong
it's it's going to be an American
because or maybe NATO but I I don't I
don't see anybody but America making
that many drones that fast now as
Colonel Mana said we may not have the
manufacturing ability anymore it's
possible we don't know how to do it
you know maybe there's some parts we
can't get
maybe we would need China to do it and
you know that would be awkward
um but here's my best guess
there is an enormous secret just a guess
enormous secret
drone Fleet
that's being prepared it might be you
know a few few months away from being
ready or something but if you could just
send over a wave
of killer drones
that changes the war doesn't it I don't
know how you would defend against it
there would just be too many
so
yeah I I think the thing that would keep
us from doing it is that it would be too
obvious that Americans were operating
them
but that we would drop our worry that
it's too obvious Americans are in the
war directly I think we would drop that
objection the same way we dropped the
what f-16s
oh we'll never give you these these
really good ones okay you can have them
well we're never going to give you any
of these high Mars
okay you're gonna need some high Mars
right so we don't give them anything
until there's no choice
and we're we're running up against the
point where there will be no choice
but to introduce a wave of drones that
are operated by Americans who we will
try to tell the Russians are
non-americans
but there's no way in hell a Ukrainian
is going to be sitting at the control
panel for you know 10 000 American
drones is you know operating as one
there's no way that's going to happen
so
anyway so war is unpredictable
no
did you hear Tucker is doing a story on
Keith olberman cocking Phil bump
uh
uh I don't know is that real
it's coming from NPC court jester
that doesn't sound real
oh a lucky Palmer or I'm sorry uh Palmer
lucky
wait is it lucky Palmer or Palmer lucky
he's got two first names and two last
names
I I've actually talked to him and I'm
forgetting which which it is
um but Andrew is his uh
who's telling me this
uh well I've got a feeling of somebody
who knows his proper name all right
so
one Kook attacking
uh they're already sitting in control of
thousands of drones drones even in the
paper
yeah so Andrew is a American drone
maker
now they've been around for five years
or so
um how
you know how many uh
how many drones can you make in five
years I've Got a Feeling we have a lot
of them
or we could by now all right
um that's all I got for today
YouTube thanks for joining
I hope I was not too depressive
depressing talking about everything's
broken and corrupt but maybe you know
more than you did and I will talk to you
tomorrow bye for now
