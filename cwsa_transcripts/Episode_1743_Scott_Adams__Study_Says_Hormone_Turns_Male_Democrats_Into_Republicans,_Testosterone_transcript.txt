while i'm so late
and
i think it's time for the simultaneous
sip which will be coming to you from a
paper cup from a remote location
it won't be
exactly
exactly the same
but it will be good it will be so good
and if you'd like to join me all you
need is a
paper cup
and those other vessels
fill it with your favorite liquid
and join me now for the simultaneous
slip are you ready
go
um
did you say you can't see me
i'm locals i think he can
all right ladies and gentlemen
let me tell you the interesting news of
the day
uh let's see jeff bezos is mad at biden
for his disinformation about inflation
he thinks his disinformation board want
to look into it
okay
all right
here are the shocking stories of the day
now i have to tell you this is my
personal journey
but uh
i never called myself mega
i don't know if anybody knows that but a
lot of people associated me with it but
i never called myself becca
because i didn't like the name
it sounds too much like a maggot and
um i don't like i'm not a joiner in that
sense i just don't like to be that team
but
now that they have this new thing have
you heard of the new thing it's called
ultra maga
and i thought to myself
mega sounds sort of ordinary and i don't
like it but
ultra vaga
you have my attention now
and so i thought
i'm going to look into this ultra mega
situation because it sounds kind of sexy
and strong and
i don't know it makes me think of beer
and condoms and
all kinds of good stuff and
um i i just wonder if they're still
accepting members do you know if there's
any kind of hazing
does it cost a lot of money to join
are any of you and have you any of you
gotten into ultra magnet yet
how is it do they have secret meetings
i'm just wondering
all right here's the most provocative
thing i've done today
but the day is young
yesterday i was sitting there and i just
had this thought i said to myself
i wonder if anybody's ever checked
the testosterone difference
between men who are democrats and men
who are republicans
do you ever wonder about that
do you ever wonder if they had the same
amount of testosterone
well of course you'd have to adjust for
age and you know obesity and
demographics and all that
but uh the other thing you could do is
just take a bunch of people who are
democrats and then give them
testosterone and see what happens
somebody did that in 2021
there was actually a study
in 2021 so this is fairly fresh now
again
don't believe studies
if you see there is a study that said
anything don't believe it but some of
them are more fun than others so i'm
going to talk about them like they're
true
who knows maybe it is
and they said they they tested the
fixity
don't you love that word the fixity
in other words how stable is it are
things fixed or or do they move we
tested the fixity of political
preferences of 136 healthy males
during the 2011 us presidential election
season
and
um
the the people who identified
as uh strong identifiers as democrats
versus ones who are a democrat but sort
of weakly favor them
they found that the more democrat you
were the more strongly democrat you were
the lower your testosterone levels
but then they gave testosterone to
volunteers
so
so they took some democrats some males
and they gave them testosterone and it
caused what they called a redshift
among weakly affiliated democrats
this effect was associated with improved
mood
no effects
uh
and it would turn and strongly turn them
into uh republicans
percentage-wise so if you take somebody
who's uh you know mildly democrat and
you give them testosterone they become
republicans
now
do you do you know why i googled that
guess why i googled it
why would i do that
because it seemed obvious
[Music]
i i thought you know
i can't be the only one who's noticing
this
it's just really obvious
and so i thought i wonder if anybody's
ever studied it
sure enough somebody studied it
so
i would not uh necessarily tell you that
this study will hold up
most i don't think most studies do
but
but this one matches my uh
my opinion already
so therefore i give it much more
credibility
so actually that's a part of my bs
filter so one of the ways that i look
for is if what you observe
does or does not match what the science
says
in this case it's not proof of course
but in this case my observation
over years
matches perfectly with the science so
i'm more likely to believe it but that's
also
that's a trap for confirmation bias
so watch out
tom cotton had a tweet in which he
uh the senator tom cotton and he gave a
partial list of biden's prior
explanations for inflation
because the important thing is it's not
joe biden's fault
here are the things that biden has said
about inflation number one there's no
inflation two it's transitory
three it's a high class problem
then he said it's just a delayed
treadmill
then he said it's something about
chicken farmers something about coved
something about big oil something about
corporate greed and now it's putin's
price hike
so
i'm glad we finally got a president who
was a straight shooter
remember when we had that guy who would
say things that were crazy and he
thought well that didn't pass the fact
checking
well
finally we've got ourselves a no
malarkey president
because you know what would be a lot of
malarkey would be
one two three four five six
nine different positions on inflation in
two months
that would be a malarkey
well glenn greenwald continues to make
good observations about politics and
here's one
um
he talked about
so there's a house majority leader
steny hoyer he's 82 years old
and in the
chambers of congress
he said there were a war with russia
which was a big surprise to the rest of
the country who was not so sure
that they were
at war with russia but he seemed to
think so
and he's in his 20th term
and he's 82 years old he says we're at
war with russia
um
and
and as greenwald says in a tweet if
there's a bigger story than an 82 year
old senior house democrat now in his
20th term in congress today announcing
that the us is at war with russia i like
to know what it is
and then greenwald speculated that maybe
we shouldn't have people that old be
president
but
that he said that said it remains an
indisputable fact no matter how much you
wish it weren't true that donald trump
remains the only u.s president in
decades not to involve the u.s in a new
war
he was no pacifist he radically
escalated extent
bombing campaigns but is still a fact
is that a fact
is trump the only recent president to
not involve us in a new war
it looks like a fact although i would
argue that biden hasn't
uh employed troops and he's reduced
troops so i'll give him that you know if
greenwald is going to be
fair about trump i'm going to be fair
about biden
while we don't love what he may be doing
with ukraine and we don't love many
things he's doing maybe
uh he did he did pull us out of
afghanistan against him sloppily
anybody probably everybody would have
done it at some point
but he didn't do that and he hasn't
committed new troops
that that what you what you think is the
baby sound is
birds outside my window that sound like
screaming babies every morning
so what do you think of this 40 billion
dollars or whatever it is 44 billion
dollars for ukraine
the united states now is saying directly
that we're trying to degrade the russian
army and that that's
now that's a new goal
and to me that 44 million says
we're trying to put russia just
completely out of business
now
if somebody said to you
it will cost you 44 billion
and more let's say 100 billion by the
time you're done
but you can put your biggest
um let's say military
or second biggest military
adversary and a business would you do it
what are the times can we think of
situations where
we degraded but did not completely take
over a country
and that worked out really well for us
when was the last time we really hurt
another country badly
and then
we just walked away and oh so good now
we yeah we did a number on iraq didn't
we
here's the thing
is russia the same
there are some countries that just
wanted to be left alone i think vietnam
would be one of those
but uh i don't know
is this a strategy that would work
now germany and japan were different
because they surrendered
so we don't we're not going to have a
situation about russia surrendering
that's not going to happen
the ussr fell after reagan's star wars i
think reagan got too much credit for
that but
the ruble is stronger than before the
invasion
yeah that feels
like a weird situation
all right well
um
here's what i think
number one remember when we thought that
there we have some kind of source in the
kremlin
because our intelligence people got one
right for a change when they said that
uh putin was going to attack
and so the thinking was that there was
some putin insider that gave us
information but now suppose that putin
insider is still there
because we haven't heard of anybody
being taken out that would have been the
insider
uh
do you think that we would be doing what
we're doing
if the insider had not already told us
that nuclear war wasn't going to happen
what do you think
because if if we if we're just guessing
about pushing putin into a nuclear
confrontation
then
we're pretty reckless aren't we
but what if
what if
hypothetically
what if somebody on the inside said look
if you can get rid of putin for us the
thing i can guarantee is we're not gonna
launch any nukes
because you know the generals just won't
do it or something like that you know
maybe it's the number two guy
the number two guy says all right i'm
just not gonna give the command if you
can get rid of putin for us
i'll be president maybe
but i'm not going to give the command to
launch a nuke
i feel as if we must have some inside
information just what do you think about
that
question do you think yes or no
we have inside information that we trust
about putin's ability or willingness to
launch a nuke
don't you think we have to know that
because we're acting as if we know it
aren't we
i haven't seen anybody say that but the
way we're acting is if we have the
answer to the question already we're not
acting like we're
we're tentative or we're worried about a
nuclear strike we're acting like we know
it's not gonna come
why is that
i got questions you know
all right
um here was a surprise story
new york post had this
there are two people who apparently
stepped down from or are no longer on
however they left
uh the national board of black lives
matter
now that by itself is not a story except
who these two people are
one of them is mark elias
uh
and the other was something i'd never
heard of but mark elias was uh and the
elias
law group they're strongly associated
with
getting democrats elected that's hillary
clinton's
peeps
now these are these are as democrat as
you can get
and mark elias was one of the people who
caused the rule changes that
some people say is the reason that uh by
no one in the election
and you're telling me
that these two people were on the black
lives matter national border
doesn't that tell you that black lives
matter was just a democrat political act
organization
that kind of tells you that doesn't it
at this point and there's some
speculation that the reason that are no
longer on the board
is because the national organization is
just going to fall apart entirely which
i thought it sort of had
but at this point
everything you suspected about black
lives matter not being a an organic
organization
appears to be true
wouldn't you say
yeah it appears to be true that black
lives matter was never a legitimate
organization
there were you know plenty of legitimate
people who had legitimate concerns but
the organization itself appears to be
completely
completely just a democrat organ
um
did you say the story about the
ukrainian soldiers are using facial
recognition
to send photos to the families and
friends of dead russian soldiers
imagine getting that photo
that would not be a good thing
um
but you know the thing they don't say is
that they're doing it for war propaganda
although they say it in an indirect way
they're trying to let the russian public
know that there are real russians dying
the war because the russians don't
necessarily know how bad it is
but apparently there's also some rule
that says you have to try to give back
your soldiers to the other side sort of
a geneva convention thing
so ukraine is hiding behind that geneva
convention thing to say oh no we're just
sending
facial recognition
we're using facial recognition to
uh tell people where the where the
bodies are in case they want to come get
them
now who's going to go to ukraine right
now to go get a body
so to me it just looks like a horrible
horrible war propaganda technique
which is probably entirely legitimate in
the context of war
now here's a question for you
um
so we have this you know war crimes
standards
and if you kill a civilian for example
that would be a war crime
if you if you do it intentionally and if
you were to torture a captured soldier
that would be a war crime
but
why do we treat
the war crimes the same
if there's an invading army versus a
defending army now if somebody's a
defending army and they're captured and
tortured
i would say that's a war crime no doubt
about it
but what if you're part of the attacking
army
is it the same standard
because let me let me be clear about
this
if a military attacked the united states
and i got a hold of one of the soldiers
seriously
yeah if i watched people i know being
killed by another military and i got
control of one of their soldiers
i don't know what i'd do
but i wouldn't be worried about war
crimes
i mean that wouldn't be at the top of my
mind let me tell you
i think i would be completely savage
but i also think that shouldn't be a war
crime
because if you attack my family or my
country
i'm gonna you up in every way i can
there's not going to be a limit
well let me be as clear as possible if
your soldiers are coming in to conquer
and kill me i'm not going to put a limit
on what i do to your soldiers
but it should be a limit the other way
i mean it should be certainly a war
crime if the attacking
army
does does stuff but if you're defending
yourself and you're losing especially if
you're defending and losing yeah you can
do anything you want
that's my standard my standard is no
limits for the defending army
what would you say
anybody agree no no no military limits
for the defending army because it's not
their fault
if you're defending you can use anything
you want anything
and it doesn't matter if somebody's
already captured
if that's part of making you feel good
or
you know maybe it's discouraging the
other soldiers there shouldn't be any
limit for the
torturing the
the attacking army
now i'm talking about actually invading
your country not not just
attack on some foreign battlefield i'm
talking about their they're coming into
your home
they're shooting your dog they're
stealing your food you're they're raping
your wife
are you telling me i'm not going to
kill every one of them i can get my
hands on in the worst possible way
of course i am
there wouldn't be any limit there's
nothing i wouldn't do nothing
so i just don't like that standard
um
so california's got this gigantic
drought problem you probably know about
and california just turned down a uh a
water desalinization plant in huntington
beach
i think for environmental reasons
do we have the dumbest state
israeli state dumber than california
where we have gigantic problems and
we're working as hard as we can to make
them worse
we have the dumbest state
by far the dumbest day and
you know a drought is one of those
things that's sort of like a slow-motion
disaster
and i'm never worried about those
because when something's a slow motion
disaster i think oh they'll build the
desalinization plants when they have to
you know they'll make another dam if
they really have to
it's just you know you'll have to get
more dire before people make drastic
decisions
but i'm not sure that's going to work in
california
california looks like the anti-human
part of the population
is perfectly happy to let humans go down
because they're not smart enough to see
the bigger repercussions i think and i
think that's obviously the problem
there are some problems that you can say
well there's a genuine difference of
opinion
but there are other problems and this is
clearly one of them the water shortage
in california this is clearly a case of
people being bad at math having too much
control
i say bad at math meaning bad at
analysis
because if there's anybody thinks that
the world or californians or even the
protected species
are going to be better off if there's
not enough water in california
for the humans
who thinks that's going to be better off
like i don't know how much the
environmental impact would have been
but it's not going to be as bad as
running out of water
that's not really
this isn't this shouldn't even be a hard
decision
now we're actually going to find out how
stupid we are in my state
usually you don't get to find out in a
really defined way
but in the governor race it's going to
be more governor newsom which means more
of this i guess
or
some republican that nobody's going to
vote for
or
independent michael sheldenberger now
schallenberger does deep dives on all of
these topics he's written books on
several of the biggest problems in
california he has specific solutions
that all make sense and the numbers work
in this rational
if he doesn't get elected
we just deserve what we get
honestly
at that point i i don't know if an
entire state wants to commit
some kind of weird you know state
suicide i guess they have that right
i i guess we'll do it
but we do have a clean option to to
elect somebody who could
you know put a big dent in all these
problems
will we do it i don't know because
remember schallenberger doesn't have any
any uh objectionable policies
for a californian
everything that he's proposing
you can see from the data the science
the people have tried it before
that it makes things better
for everybody
the disadvantage the poor the homeless
the drug addicted his policies are
directly better for everybody it's not
like somebody's winning somebody's
losing it's just better for everybody
how do you turn down the guy who's got
policies that are better for everybody
and nobody even would argue well
nobody who's good at math would argue
with much of what he's saying
because he just takes the most rational
position
he puts together a bunch of rational
positions and now he's running
and he
and unfortunately he's not leading by 40
points
in the polls he should be because
there's not really a rational choice
there's one choice that makes sense
and then everything else is literally
just state suicide
it's not even close
but yet the vote will probably be you
know completely unpredictable
all right elections are real
true
uh why vote when it doesn't get counted
somebody says
never trust a guy with good hair
all right
um
i got up a little bit early to or late
today i guess
and i did not see all of the stories so
i'm going to look at cnn for you and
give you my first reaction to their
headlines
this is this is basically how i prepare
stuff
so
how many of you are willing to give me
credit yet
for predicting that ukraine would
surprise russia with their military
capability
and it would be because of high-tech
weaponry
am i not exactly right
what
now and would you not say that that was
did anybody else say that
did was there anybody else who said what
i said which is the ukrainians will
surprise with high-tech weaponry that
comes from
nato and the u.s
i i don't i don't think i saw one other
person who said that
you're way off well so here's but let me
uh let me be specific about my
prediction i'm not saying that we know
that's what's happening are you okay
with that
so i'm not going to say that i can
confirm as of today that ukraine is
actually beating russia on the
battlefield i don't think we can confirm
that because there's too much
disinformation coming out of there but
the part that i will confirm
is that the way we're talking about it
has gone from i'm the only one saying
this to it's now more a common opinion
right
would you say it's a common opinion that
ukraine
has at least
taken russia to some kind of a stalemate
at least
yeah
well so i'll only say that the
conversation has gone my way the reality
we still don't know
um so here there's a lot of stuff on cnn
that i only read the headline because
it's a video
if i click on it to get the story i'm
gonna have to wait for the commercial
and i'm never gonna do that sometimes
the only way i can consume cnn is with
multiple browsers
so i'll click on a story
and then i'll wait i'll turn off the
sound and have another window open
and wait for the wait for the commercial
to go away so you have to have like four
windows open to read cnn because you
have to like wait for the ads and i just
don't have that kind of time
so
um the way cnn is spinning it so you've
got one story about russian journalists
defying putin here's their message to
the russian people i don't know what the
story is because i'm not gonna wait for
the advertisements but
um i'm more interested in the way cnn is
covering it
uh dude use an ad blocker an ad blocker
isn't gonna stop a video ad
catch up catch up with me
guess you can't stop a video ad on
on cnn with an ad blocker you just sit
there waiting for it
and then another headline on cnn
russia's retreat reveals new evidence of
horrors so one story on cnn is about uh
russian journalists are turning against
putin another were about russia's
retreat
another about zelinski welcoming the
senate um mitch mcconnell and other
people from the senate
uh photos that have defined the war
which would no doubt be um be
horrors against ukraine people
and
what you need to know about finland and
sweden which is also you know they're
joining or want to join nato so that's
also negative against russia
and yeah russia forces retreat so every
story on cnn is a story about russia
losing
every story is a story about russia
losing
now that doesn't mean russia is losing
right just to be clear
because cnn's a propaganda outlet
essentially um
but this seems to be i think you can
interpret
that the biden administration wants this
to be the spin
would you say that's true
do you think the cnn's connection with
the democrats at the moment you're so
strong
you can't tell what the democrats want
you to know or hear or think
based on how their coverage shifts i
think so i think that's a fair
assessment
now that doesn't mean that there are
meetings it could be just that they
watch each other the democrats in the
news
you know they sort of
watch where things are going and follow
along quickly so it might be just that
you know everybody knows what team
they're on
certainly that's true i'd say of the
right
uh you see the right
you know the people on the right sort of
moving in lock steps sometimes
but i don't think there are meetings
necessarily where somebody says hey you
do this i'll do that just sort of
everybody knows what to do because
they've done it enough they've danced
enough
um
[Music]
all right
uh nato troops reveal how putin's
invasion is changing their training
so it's going to be about us getting
stronger against them
uh ukraine says sends images of dead
russians we just talked about that so
basically it's all about the russians
are dead the ukrainians are taking their
it's basically complete wall wall
coverage that ukraine is winning
ish
or at least doing well
all right let's let's get fox news
and see how their headlines now this
would just be the headlines because the
headlines really tell you what they're
they're thinking overall
um
[Music]
finland's president says direct message
about nato on putin call
so that's sort of an anti-russia thing
um and uh
let's see
um
and that's about it
so fox news is actually acting like the
ukrainian war is
a third level headline
what's that tell you
unfortunately it tells you that biden is
winning doesn't it
i feel like
watching fox news ignore the story
is sort of
more evidence that maybe
the biden strategy of degrading russia
is working
and looks like it will work
is that why fox news is
is this kind of staying off it because
it looks like biden's actually succeeded
and
would the
with the people on the right be happy or
not happy
if we'd found a cheap i'll say 44
billion dollars is cheap
in this context to essentially take one
of our biggest competitors in the world
and degrade them to you know 20 of their
prior effectiveness would that be worth
uh 40 200 billion dollars
would the republicans have voted
4 200 bill billion if they knew that no
american would die on the battlefield
and they knew it would take russia just
completely off the battlefield basically
republicans have supported that
for a hundred billion
maybe
some i don't know now republicans don't
like intervention right
mostly
they don't like to attack somebody that
doesn't need to get attacked but they
certainly like to have military
superiority
don't they
so i would think that if you said we can
give you military superiority
for who knows a hundred years over
russia
and and we'll do that for a hundred
billion dollars would that be a good
good use of money i think it would be
if
um let's say under the assumption
that taking russia off the battlefield
in the future
is a good idea i don't know if it is
but if it's a good idea it looks like
they're going to pull it off
or they could
so
um
all right
uh judge thomas opens up on the impact
of the tremendously bad
abortion draft
why did he say it's tremendously bad
uh he says it's tremendously bad
uh
you lose the trust always about that
loss of trust he's not talking about the
he's not talking about the
draft itself
um
okay well he didn't have much to say all
right it doesn't look like there's much
to say
when did russia attack us
they attack the election
don't you watch cnn
what does russia's strength currently
hold at bay
nothing
nothing
you know
to me it seems like we should have
always been making a deal with russia
maybe this will get us closer to doing
that someday
but
um
yeah so it could turn out that russia
just turns toward china but i think that
would be the worst case scenario for
russia wouldn't it
russia doesn't really want to be
beholden to china and china doesn't want
to have much of its
economy depending on russia
so
i think that situation probably will
stay stable where it is which is russia
and china don't want to have a military
conflict and that's about it
um
how much to buy greenland yeah
and it could be that our biggest play
has to do with the arctic
do you think we were heading toward a
war in the arctic
because it's you know climate change is
melting things and there's lots of
resources and military use up there i
mean maybe maybe everything we're doing
with ukraine is a long-term arctic play
because if we don't own the arctic it's
sort of like losing in space it's such a
such a strategically important area
that you wouldn't want russia to you
know kind of move in and dominate it
before you do
is that
is it is it that strategically important
because remember we've been talking for
a long time
that the arctic is the next battlefield
so did we just take out russia
from the next battlefield before the
battle
because it looks like that's what's
happening
it looks exactly like that's what's
happened
um
putin wants some northwest passage
yet
ukraine is not in the arctic but if we
take out the russian military
the russian military won't be anywhere
oh you love me way too much
china is building icebreakers
well there's a limit to how much ice you
can break
[Music]
as long as russia has people they can
fight we need to stop all war
you know there's nobody really on the
other side of that argument
i've never heard anybody in favor of war
everybody always thinks there's a reason
there's an exception well i hate war but
we got to do this one
do you wonder if russia's nukes would
actually work
they did they do they didn't pull off
the hypersonic missile so that looked
pretty impressive and they have put
stuff in space that's impressive
but
i don't know
i i wonder if the nukes are as degraded
as their tanks
the northwest passage is doable now and
has been for years somebody says
doable but can it be defended they're
separate questions
um
well people are saying they love me
today i don't know why
does anybody else love me i need some
love today can anybody give me some love
i mean i love all of you that's why i do
this
you know i don't know if how many of you
ever heard this story
but uh um for those of you who don't
know the
uh architecture of my personal life
um i'm working on my second divorce now
but the first divorce
uh when i when i ended my first marriage
i found myself rather lost
meaning you know as soon as you lose a
relationship and you know there's a
family structure and you lose all of it
basically 100 of what your
your base assumption of who you are
and how you connect to the world just
goes away
you find yourself just sort of floating
and you don't really have a reason
yeah and you think to yourself
okay i don't feel suicidal but i also
have any reason to be alive
like what to chase pleasure
is that the only reason to be alive to
go chase some more pleasure because i'm
not sure i want to do that
just jason pleasure pleasure
so
when i realized that i wasn't you know
connected to a family structure in the
same way before
i explicitly donated my body
and i donated my body to
the world basically
and i just thought well you know what
maybe i'll find some meaning by being
useful
it's useful to the world
which is about when i started uh you
know blogging and being more more active
in politics and stuff like that so what
i was writing it's also why i wrote
certain kinds of books that were meant
to directly help somebody's life so
my
my shift
because i've largely taken care of my
own needs
has been to try to figure out how to
how to help everybody else in the best
possible way now
well thank you
so that's what i've been doing
and
the reason i'm so committed to these
these live streams is that this is the
most let's say vital part
that connects me to the process
and it also changes how i respond so
you've sort of become
a
meta brain for my own usefulness
in other words my my own thinking is
completely
completely determined by the interaction
right how many of you have seen me
change my opinion
based on comments in real time
you've seen that right i'll be talking
along and i'll be watching the comments
at the same time and i'm like okay
stop everything i now change my opinion
completely to your european you've seen
that
it's happened a number of times
and so
we operate collectively as as almost an
entity
or almost a creature
so we're almost a creature that's like a
collective brain
in which i have some you know i have a
special role
but i'm not in charge
you know what i mean
if i were in charge
then your opinions might not have much
impact on me but i'm more like a filter
or an editor so i have some
let's say power
but it's not the power of being in
charge
like who's in charge is sort of the
world
and i work for the world
and you and i work collectively to be
more effective so that's how i think of
it
um
and i wish someday i could write a book
about all the things i've been involved
in
because you have no idea
you have no idea
what kinds of people contact you
if they believe that they've seen you
move a national event
and there are a lot of people who
believe and i don't even know i mean
it's hard to know who influences what
what's a coincidence what was going to
happen anyway you don't really know that
stuff
but there are lots of people who believe
i have influenced
national events
and if they believe it then other people
believe then they contact you so i've
been involved in a lot of interesting
stuff
someday maybe i could tell you but
probably not i mean a lot of people
would have to be dead first and i think
they're gonna outlive me
because i'm not the youngest person in
any of the stories
so
so probably you'll never know
but uh believe me when i tell you
it's uh it's been a satisfying
last uh 10 years or so
all right that's all for now i'm gonna
go do some other things i get a book
direct
and uh there's not much other news
that's worth talking about
um
uh i just got a good idea of the locals
uh the birds are making so much noise
out there somebody suggested that i eat
some breakfast and regurgitate it into
the mouths of the little birds
so they will stop screaming
um i'm gonna say that's not the worst
idea i've had today it's not the worst
not at all
but uh probably be doing something else
instead of that
all right
and now
and now
and now
we're gonna go do some other stuff
today's gonna be amazing
and
tomorrow might be too
youtube
bye for now
