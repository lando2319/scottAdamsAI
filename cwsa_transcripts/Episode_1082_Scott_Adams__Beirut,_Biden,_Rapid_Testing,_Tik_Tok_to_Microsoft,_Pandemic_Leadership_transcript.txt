you're probably thinking to yourself
hey where is he he's late
well it's because i'm trying to solve
the world's problems here and
sometimes that takes more than three
minutes
so if you don't mind i'm going to print
out my show notes
while we get ready and everybody's
pouring in for
the best part of the day yeah
best part of the day it's coming up and
it doesn't
take much does it it doesn't take much
all you need is the copper marker glass
of tanker chelsea stein the canteen
junior flask a
vessel of any kind
sorry i made you wait were you worried
so i like coffee
join me now for the dope media of the
day
the thing makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous sip and it
happens
now go
so good stay right there hold on hold on
don't go anywhere here i am
all right there we go
so the biggest news i would have to
think is that explosion
in beirut you've all seen the video by
now
holy whatever
that is some scary stuff um
i've never seen anything quite like it
and
i'll bet all of you have the same
feeling i did which is
you're trying to decide if you're a good
person
because you can't stop watching that
explosion because it's really quite a
spectacle
at the same time you know that people
are dying at that moment
and you're thinking to yourself how many
times can i watch this video for
entertainment
before i'm actually the devil you know
it's a sensitive situation
so what are we going to learn about this
the first thing i will tell you
is that whatever we eventually learn
about this is probably wrong
it's probably just fake i feel as though
this is
this is in the class of stories that
you're just never going to know what
happened
there might be an official story there
might be one that even all the
governments agree
but i feel like we're not really going
to know the story here
sort of ever but here are some things we
do know
the it's almost certainly that this
was the chemical uh what it was ammonium
nitrate
which i believe is the same stuff that
uh tim mcphee used and it's
it's a known amateur bomb material
now if a an area that's uh
hezbollah is a hezbollah controlled or
just hezbollah heavy
if they've got enough of this sitting in
a warehouse
to destroy much of much of the city of
beirut
and apparently one of the customs people
was aware of it
and a customs person you may not have
heard this yet i just saw it a moment
ago
apparently he had in the past sent six
different memos to the judiciary
officials warning that there was a
dangerous substance that could explode
so the government had been warned at
least six
times by somebody who knew what he was
talking about and knew it was there
and they decided not to act does that
tell you anything
not necessarily because it could be just
a bureaucratic thing
it could have been they didn't know what
to do with it it could have been they
had plans to do with it something with
it later
i think he was a he was recommending
that they export it
in other words basically sell it because
it probably had some value
but you don't want to keep that much in
one place
now in a related story
the jerusalem post is saying that
hezbollah
kept it there so they're saying that it
was hezbollah who was in charge of that
ammonium nitrate but did you know
that in a storehouse in london until mi5
found it they also had a bunch of
ammonium nitrate and did you know
that the hezbollah also stored hundreds
of kilograms of it
in southern germany until that was
uncovered
now what does it mean to you that the
massive amounts of this material which
is
i think in this context you know given
the context was used for bombs
is is massively deployed all over the
place
is there any doubt that they were trying
to blow up a lot of stuff that maybe you
didn't want to get blown up
so i ask you this
what are the odds that that blew up on
its own
do you think that israel
for example do you think that israel was
aware
that these chemicals were there remember
mi5 found him in england
germany found him in germany so we know
that
you know intelligence agencies can find
this stuff
and we know that uh apparently wasn't
the biggest kept secret in the world
because this
customs guy in lebanon was asking them
to get rid of it
so what are the odds that israel was
aware
that there was a gigantic facility of
bomb-making material
what were the odds that they knew that
not
zero right we don't know but
not zero there was certainly a good
chance they knew about it
now what would be the chances that
israel
would act on it and let's say do
something to sabotage it or blow it up
just to remove that future risk from
you know ending up in israel because i
don't know how hard it would be to ship
this stuff into israel
you know if they wanted to a little bit
a little bit at a time but you know
where was it destined for
and i asked you this
would it be justified for
israel to take it out if they knew that
it was going to be a big explosion
and the collateral damage would be
extensive would it be justified
it's a tough one isn't it kind of
justified
i'm not saying they did it because
there's some story about somebody
welding a door shut
and you know that seems at least
reasonably possible that
that was part of the problem uh yeah i
wouldn't rule that out i wouldn't rule
out accident of course but
would israel have a moral ability to
take that out
because here's my take on this this is
way bigger
than just removing some potential bomb
material from
from potential terrorist acts
it's way bigger than that you're given
the scope of it
and i wonder what this does to the
psychology of the middle east
if you wanted hezbollah to have a
a bloody nose forever in its own
backyard
so that it didn't look so good the best
thing you could do
is have hezbollah responsible for
destroying the entire city
of beirut or much of it in the act of
getting ready to do a terrorist attack
on some other city
now if if this story remains
a hezbollah error
it doesn't matter who blew it up in a
sense
you know i'm not saying israel did or
did not
do anything i'm just saying that we'll
probably never know
and it may actually change how people
feel about hezbollah
so it might be one of these events that
even though it's a
anecdote it's a one-off it's not really
related to
any larger issue it seems like just you
know a tragedy in one place
but the way we think about this you know
anecdotes are
and stories are really persuasive and
i've got a feeling that the
the uh let's say support for hezbollah
may take a permanent hit
so we'll keep an eye on that the death
toll they say is a hundred
but lots of people missing and you're
probably having the same reason
reaction i did which is uh that's a lot
more than 100 i mean if you saw that
if you saw the damage um i can't imagine
it's not in the thousands can you
i mean how could such an area have so
few people
who would die it's got to be in the
thousands
let's talk about something else uh
did you all see the video on twitter
of the portland protesters trying to
stop a pickup truck
and it didn't go well so far
of the genre of protest things that
didn't go well for protesters you know
it's sort of a growing body of work
this might be my favorite might be my
favorite if you haven't seen it
there's several angles to it and only
one of the angles is fun
the other angles don't quite tell you
what's going on but
essentially there's a pickup truck that
somehow
didn't look like a good idea to me ended
up in the middle of the protest
the protesters tried to stop it
and one of the protesters who was
especially
bold shall we say bold we'll keep our
insults for later
let's call him bold he he comes up with
some kind of a motorcycle
scooter kind of a thing it was a
motorcycle and
and he pulls it in front of the truck
and then he just like
like he's a badass he just pulls in
front of the truck and he drops it on
the ground
to block the truck and then he gets up
and he's going to walk over to the
driver
he's like man i just pulled a batman
move
i mean i'm feeling like some kind of a
superhero
i mean i i had my my vehicle my bat
motorcycle
cut him off cleverly put my my vehicle
in front of his truck
to block his response and then i'm going
to swag her over to that
there he goes dragging my motorcycle
under his truck
one of the funniest things you'll ever
see so i don't know who's
who gets to talk to the insurance
company
for that motorcycle vehicle
but he's got some explaining to do can
you explain
the nature of the accident sir um
can you talk to my mom hands bomb the
phone
that's what i think will happen all
right
does anybody care about portland anymore
um my empathy for portland is now
basically zero i'd say zero
i can't care about portland it's
interesting i like seeing the videos
like seeing what's happening
but don't ask me to care don't ask me to
help
don't ask me to you know mourn if
something bad happens to somebody
during the protest don't care
now i do think that the portland ears
said word who who say well it's been
limited to these certain areas
that's probably true so there may be a
reason that the portland people don't
care too much maybe it doesn't have much
effect on their lives
and if they don't care i certainly don't
care
speaking of stuff like that uh oprah
came out as a racist
yesterday sort of surprised me a little
bit
um you can read about it i i tweeted it
but apparently she's just an open racist
now
um i'm not even gonna give you the
details
right you know i was i was going to tell
you what she said and
why that's racist i don't even need to
it was so racist
no i'm gonna i'm gonna do anyway i their
basic message was that
having white skin is a life advantage
just period
that's all you need you got white skin
it's a life advantage
i feel like that's a little
oversimplifying
and racist it's just racist
because it certainly isn't true in
employment
certainly isn't true in education
certainly isn't true in socially i can't
think of
too many places as true now it would be
true let's
let me give you some examples where it
would be true would it be true
in um if you go to a store and you're
black and you're just shopping
and maybe people keep an eye on you it's
like they think you're a shoplifter just
because you're black
yeah that i would say that's bad and i
would say that's real
but it's not it's not high on the list
compared to getting a job
or going to college or you know those
things
so as annoying as that must be one has
to ask this question
is that because of white people or is it
because of the statistical reality
which causes everybody to be a little
bit wary
because we're not good at pattern
recognition well let me say this
we use pattern recognition as our
primary mode of understanding our world
but we're not good at it
we we get false patterns as easily as
correct patterns
so if there's a high rate of crime in
one community
is it really reasonable to expect
that people outside that community and
even within the community
probably doesn't make any sense if
you're black yourself if you're seeing
somebody come in who's a member of a
community with high crime are you
expected to act exactly the same
well you should right if you're a good
person
and you're you're trying to overcome
your biases
you should but we're also human beings
who operate on pattern recognition and
that's a big ask
that's why i always say that black lives
matter is
completely discredited in terms of their
slogan
of thinking that black lives matter
because obviously they don't
if they did they'd work on the highest
priority not the lowest priority
the lowest priority is the number of
people who get killed by police
it's a small number compare that to the
number of people who get a bad education
that's a big number and it affects
everything including
the odds of you being stopped by the
police including
the odds of the shopkeeper giving you a
little extra attention
if you fix education a lot of things get
fixed
and right now it's the racist
teachers union that keeps black people
from getting a good education i mean i
think that's just a fact
you know because they they limit
competition
they limit charter schools and basically
all the solutions that would
make a difference to black students
are are stopped by the teachers units so
the teachers unions are clearly racist
it's in the worst possible way
but that's what i got to say about that
i'm very disappointed in oprah coming
out
as being a racist all right
cnn has some fake news about marijuana
their headline says
we can be bad for your heart but the
article doesn't
the usual the you know the headline
doesn't match the article
but in any event here's the question you
should ask yourself
every time you see any article it
doesn't have to be in cnn
any article that says marijuana is
bad for you in a way that'll kill you
it's obviously is bad for
people in terms of lifestyle depending
on who you are and how you're using it
and by the way i would never argue that
point marijuana is one of those weird
drugs
that well i suppose any drug has this
quality
that it could be good for some people
harmless for other people
and it could just ruin other people's
lives that is the nature of the drug
and you should not you should not
downplay the fact that it could ruin
your life
i've i've seen that um
but here's a question you should always
ask
what is the total mortality rate in
other words
how soon are people dying if they are
chronic users of marijuana versus
never used it in their life and turns
out it's
basically the same somebody says pot
saved my life
i would say the same thing actually i
would say that marijuana
probably has kept me alive
that's a longer story but that that is
my
sincere belief is that it is a
life-saving drug
in my particular case literally
and specifically a life-saving drug
other people have had that experience
but don't
and if you're wondering how i can say it
can be bad for some people and good for
others
it's not just that there's a different
chemical
response which i just assume for any
drug
but also the nature of marijuana
is that it tends to make you more of
what you already were
uh so let me just digress a bit uh if
you haven't heard this before
it's a good filter on marijuana
if you are ambitious by nature
and creative by nature you already were
those things you are already ambitious
and creative
marijuana can make you more ambitious
and more creative
that's my experience but if you are lazy
and unmotivated by nature
it might make you lazier and more
unmotivated so when i say it can kill
you or it can help you
that's you know a small part of what i
mean by that and
that's independent of the mental health
independent of the physical health part
of it
it just makes you more of what you're
inclined to be
naturally and for some of you you might
not want that
you know if you're having trouble with
motivation i don't know that i would
recommend marijuana
but if you're terribly motivated
in my case i have a i have a problem
with over motivation sometimes
so yeah i can cut it back a little bit
anyway so that's enough on that
uh andres back house um was tweeting
some
german statistics showing the germany's
uh
death curve and stuff seems to be moving
in in the right direction
but as andreas pointed out in a
follow-up tweet on the same topic
he said it was quite fascinating how
many people immediately seem to know
whether the german statistics is good
news or bad news
and whether the us is looking better or
worse compared to them
none of that can be said to a certainty
so that's your
that's your data analysis lesson for the
day so the fact that germany
appears with this data it appears to
have a better grip on it than the united
states
can you therefore conclude that that's
true
nope and if you think you can you don't
understand
enough about how to compare things
enough about the complexity of it
you don't understand how many variables
are different we'll talk about that in a
minute
and you don't understand how unreliable
data is and you don't understand that
we're only at
half time and that there's a lot more to
play
and there's no reason to think that
germany or any other country
that gets a really good grip on it will
keep it
what would keep it what would keep your
country
that gets a really good grip on it and
really drives those
let's say it drives the deaths down to
zero
let's say germany drives the deaths down
to zero
keeps it there for two weeks impressive
right
i don't know if that'll ever happen but
let's say they do but the rest of the
world is raging
did germany win no
no because hey
carpe duncan his carpenter isn't back is
he
i need to check into that um
so anyway don't trust any data about
anything that's the general thing you
should learn in 2020
my new exciting topic which i'm trying
to understand
and then having a hard time of it is the
the idea
of the rapid but less sensitive testing
um so carpe duncan is
back on periscope can you be banned on
twitter but not on periscope
so i don't know what that means all
right we'll look into that
so anyway about the so there's there's a
concept out there that i'm trying to
understand its
practicality and the idea is that for a
dollar
maybe five dollars you can make these
easy spit tests
where you could just test yourself by
spitting in something and seeing if it
changes color in a few minutes
now the downside and here's a correction
to what i told you yesterday
i think i referred to them as being less
accurate
that's not the best way to look at it
the best way to look at
is less sensitive meaning that it's not
going to get somebody who has a little
bit of virus
that they just picked up but if you but
if you get a
you know a good viral load
it will pick it up fairly reliably
so and the thinking is that even if you
missed
some people who just coincidentally were
in that little zone of not much
virus yet you could miss you can miss
all of them
and you would still have something that
would be so powerful if it caught the
people who were really the the big
shedders who had
presumably you would shed more if you
had more viral load but i think that
that's subject to verification
and so the question is this what is the
regulatory
uh barrier to that because there's some
kind of fda emergency room
approval that's hard to get or
they don't want it or something so there
are a bunch of unknowns i'm trying to
suss out of this but the basic
idea of could there be a test
that is accurate uh sensitive enough
i'll stop using the word accurate so you
should do that too
stop about if we're talking about these
cheap spit
tests you should talk to them in terms
of sensitivity
meaning they're not going to get the the
small cases
not accuracy per se but of course
accuracy is part of the
part of the story so here's my question
is it possible
for a private company in the united
states
to produce this test in large quantities
and also do their own internal testing
to find out that it's sensitive enough
so oh somebody says carpe duncan has
at 2 pm eastern time as greg got held on
so you should watch that um
so i'm still looking into this uh i know
that the uh
i know that the task force has probably
looked into this
by now or at least they're looking into
it but i got some real questions
because if a private company can make
this thing
the demand would here the demand would
be off the chart
let me ask you this if you could buy a
say a one to five dollar test that would
be
sensitive enough to know if you had a
bad case but
maybe not that first day or so
would you buy it i would i'd buy a whole
bunch of them
i'd be testing away every few days just
in my own house
if i had them but here's here's the
money shot are you ready
when masks first became recommended
maybe you didn't see this but it's
something i saw
which is that private companies really
needed to get masks
and they were scrambling to get them for
their employees
because if you're a private company and
there's something out there that can
protect
your employees let's say masks
you have to get it all right if you
think it's
optional that a big private a big let's
say a fortune 500 company
if you think it's optional for them not
to make sure that their
employees have the right safety
equipment which in this case would
include masks
if you think that's optional you've
never had any experience with corporate
america
the moment something is known to be
safer in other words will
protect the employees the moment that's
true
or looks like it's true they have to get
it
they just have to because otherwise
you're explaining later
you know why did you let this outbreak
rage through your meat packing plant or
your
call center when this cheap test was
available
you know how can you this is a
hypothetical of the future you can
imagine this conversation
how could you facebook let your
employees
get this infection x of them died how
could you let that happen when you knew
there was this cheap test
that probably would have prevented it
right it's a big liability
it's a it's something they need to
explain and and honestly
you know corporations are not the devil
they're they're staffed by human beings
and the human beings even in human
resources
who are barely human sorry i i create a
character named cat bert so i can say
that
but it's not personal there's there's
probably no human
who wouldn't want to protect the their
co-workers as well
so forget about the corporate forget
about the liability forget about
you know how it looks for their brand
corporations are people
they're going to protect each other so
the demand
for such a test if it could be created
if it could be sensitive enough and
accurate enough
at the same time the demand would be
unbelievable there's no way we can make
enough
so um you don't even need to you don't
even need the government
to lay down any rules if you simply said
let's open up you know just open up the
businesses do what you can
but at the same time tests were widely
available
if you were a bar would you open up or
would you say look it's only five
minutes to get into the bar
you just stand in the line outside the
bar
spit in the thing it won't get all of
you
but at least we're doing what we can do
all right
i think even a bar uses it because you
know a dollar per
customer might be worth it if you could
get it down to that
anyway david boxenhorn horn
has been helpful in collecting a lot of
these
tweets and ideas and and uh talking
about this
so if you want to follow him you'll see
him in my in some of my tweets at
david boxenhorn b-o-x-e-n-h-o-r-n
um i should say that adam townsend
on twitter uh if you've if you follow
him you know that he
uh he probably has the widest talent
stack you'll ever see in your life
it's like ridiculous the number of
things he knows in different areas
everything he speaks fluent mandarin
apparently
and he is not sold on this idea of the
cheap tests
but his explanation for why he's now
sold on it
i don't understand so that's where i am
at the moment
so there is an argument by somebody who
knows a lot more than i do
but i don't understand the argument
that's where that's at just be aware
that there's a counter argument
um george takai you may know him from
playing sulu in the original star trek
series uh but also at the moment he's a
big anti-trumper and he's very funny on
twitter
uh he's come after me at least once on
twitter
but i like him i cannot like him because
he's so damn entertaining
and and i and i think it's hard for me
to dislike anybody
who clearly has good intentions i mean
you could disagree with him on
everything
but i can't dislike him first of all you
know i liked him
as an actor i like him even better on
twitter because he's hilarious
uh and he has good intentions i believe
i mean that's what i what i see from him
so somehow he doesn't bother me at all
whereas other people might because i
feel like their intentions are not pure
you know they just want to win or
something i don't think that's the case
with george zakai i think he's a good
guy
he just has a different view of you know
what's what a better world looks like
but he uh tweeted this uh
and i'm paraphrasing because i don't
have it in front of me but basically he
asked
you know he was trying to imagine how
hard it would be to be the white house
staffer who has asked
to make a chart showing that trump had
done a good job
on the coronavirus in other words
compared to other countries or anything
else
and and i saw that and i thought if i
were that a staffer
i could do that it wouldn't be hard how
hard would it be
to come up with some graphs that show
that the united states is doing a good
job on the coronavirus
compared to other countries it wouldn't
even be a little bit hard
now if you think it would be hard you've
never done this for a living
i've done this for a living so in my
corporate days
this is exactly what i do i would
present information
to management and i would have control
of what i showed them and what i didn't
do you know how easy it was for me to
make something to look good
or to look bad with the same data it's
easy
you just make some assumptions slap it
together and suddenly good becomes bad
or bad becomes good
so regardless of how the president is
actually doing
so that there's two parts here is he
actually doing well but
independent of whether he's doing well
or not i could totally put those charts
together
are you kidding me lying with data is
the easiest thing in the world wouldn't
even be a challenge
i was going to tweet back at him but you
know i got i got bored with my own tweet
because it was going to be too long but
here's what i was going to say
well let me show you my no cuomo slide
you know the slide where we show how the
president did
if he had no cuomo so i'd call that the
no cuomo slide
the united states death rate without
cuomo
now you know again none of these
individually are going to tell the case
how about comparing the president only
to the other countries that have
similar strong states rights with
governors
how would that look i don't even know
who that is
can anybody tell me who would be our
comparables
in terms of having 50 or or a lot of
states
that individual power
is there any comparable because if
you're not comparing us to
countries that have that same state
situation
is that a is that an accurate comparison
i would think not
uh how about comparing us to countries
with the same average
age who's doing that
let me ask you this you know you keep
hearing that
africa doesn't seem to be having the
calamity that you thought it would
because you know they have less health
care we assume
here's here's a reason why maybe
the average age in the united states not
average the median
so half of the people are below it half
of the people are above it
in the united states the median age for
all of our residents is 39.
i didn't know what it was until i looked
it up very similar to china
so the median age in china is 38. italy
older 46 and sure enough they had they
had a bad
outcome and they have one of the oldest
countries
but what do you think is the average not
average the median
age in africa what would you guess
in the comments before i tell you the
answer
guess the median age in africa the age
upon which half of the country is below
it and half of the country is above it
what would you guess if the united
states is 39
italy is 46. what do you think africa is
it's between 16 and 18.
that's right the median age in trick in
africa
is between 16 and 18 for a number of the
countries i didn't look at every country
but a lot of the countries in africa
yeah
it's teenage teenage is the median
so is there a reason that uh africa is
doing fairly well
probably that i mean it's got to be some
of that
so where are the charts that uh where
are the charts that only compare us to
countries that have the same median age
haven't seen that yet where's the
country that shows the vitamin d
levels in each country where's the chart
that shows the
quality of the data so the only
countries we're compared to are the ones
where we trust
the data do you trust china's data i
don't how about turkey
turkey's doing a great job huh
don't know do you believe any data
coming out of turkey
so the first thing i would do is do a
slide of countries that we could trust
the data or we think we can
how do we look if we're only compared to
the countries
that have reasonably good data do we
still look bad
i don't know i'd have to see how about
countries with different quality of
healthcare that's got to be a factor
about different weather different styles
of outdoor living
and then hydroxychloroquine
i hypothesized that if it turns out the
hydroxychloroquine
works that we should see a cnn
effect meaning that the more penetration
cnn has on the consciousness of the
country
in other countries the less likely they
would use hydroxychloroquine because
cnn's been saying it's poison
so the hypothesis is that if you just
took it all the
cnn countries and compared them to all
the non-cnn countries
that the countries who did not watch cnn
as much
because i think it has penetration
everywhere but the ones who didn't watch
it
as much or wait for it
didn't watch it in english
because if you don't watch the the main
let's say
american news people in english
i don't know if you're watching them at
all
so at the same time that i asked this
question
and i've i'm keeping my my estimate of
whether hydroxychloroquine works at 50
so later if it turns out it doesn't work
do not come to me
and say scott you said it would work no
never never said that
i said looks like about a 50 50 chance
to me
based on the unreliable information
we're getting but
but turns out there's a little kicker
today
um not only did the swiss decide that
they're going to use hydroxychloroquine
and
by can somebody remind me does
switzerland also have doctors
and scientists in switzerland because i
was pretty sure that doctors and
scientists and experts don't think
hydroxychloroquine works
and yet and yet suspiciously
the swiss who i think have doctors
i think they have experts they've
decided they've looked at all the
information
and while the rpt gold standard kind of
test
does not exist for the early use they've
decided that
it's worth using huh
oh that's just an appetizer are you
ready are you ready for the main course
here it comes the next thing i tell you
i don't know
how much credibility to put on it
i really don't but i'll report it
i tweeted it you can see for yourself so
uh twitter user gummy bear
and if you're not following gummy bear
just look for my tweet and you should
follow gummy bear is that alias
obviously of somebody who
knows what they're talking about but
does not want to be public
and a point alerted me to a test
or an analysis by at covet analysis
another one you should follow
and they're talking about a test a trial
a pretty big trial is it a trial
or a study i guess it would be a study
so what they did is they looked at all
the countries where
you were pretty sure you know they could
verify with experts
the hydroxychloroquine was being used
early and often
and then they compared it to the basket
of countries
that were not using it or were using it
sparingly
sparsely i guess what do you think was
the difference between the countries
that used hydroxychloroquine
and the ones that did not well according
to the study and again
remember the context this is 2020.
the most important thing you should keep
in your mind whenever you hear data
is that it's wrong because that is wrong
all data is wrong in 2020
all data is unreliable it's just i'm
sorry
i want this to be true but they say
there was a 79
lower death rate in the countries using
hydroxychloroquine early
79
is that true well all data is wrong
so i'm still at 50 50. now the fact that
they looked at all those countries
it feels like it's something that
somebody else could check right
doesn't it feel like somebody could say
all right show me your work
uh you for this country you got wrong
take that one out or something
so i feel as though in the next week or
so
people are going to pick it apart and
they'll either confirm it
or they will exclude it and by the way
this study also
made some adjustments for some of the
other factors
some of the other factors such as age
disease etc
now i don't think they probably looked
at every factor you could look at
but they did take out you know some of
the major ones like agent disease
79 lower death rate what if that's
true seriously
what if that's true do you know how many
people cnn killed if that's true
and i mean that i mean cnn
killed if this is true because i do
think there's a cnn effect now i use
them as a
stand-in for the the anti-trump media
but
they might have some explaining to do i
think
um
i heard that turkey has a good result
because partly they're using
hydroxychloroquine
and partly they say that they have an
extensive testing and tracing system
that's right turkey
reports that they have an extensive
testing and tracing system
so you say to yourself what if turkey
can have an extensive testing
and tracing system why can't we have
that in the united states
the united states has mostly testing for
people who have some symptoms
which is different from testing and
tracing in a way that you can actually
you know tamp down the virus ours is
more
a medical diagnosis testing to see if
you have it
so that they can treat you and by the
way keep away from other people for a
while
but we don't test in the way that we're
trying to use testing
to suppress the virus we don't have that
that's what the chief tests
could do if they work now
do you believe that turkey
really has an extensive testing and
chasing system let me say this having
worked with many large
organizations and in my capacity not as
mind reader
but as the dilbert creator
who knows a thing about bureaucracy
here's my belief there is no country
that's doing testing and contact tracing
in any real
you know useful way oh there are
countries that say they are
oh yeah yeah there are countries that
say they're doing it
but it is my belief there's no country
doing it
i don't believe it for a second and
remember
all data is wrong don't tell me data is
plural i'm not hearing any of it data is
wrong and i'm going to make that common
usage if it's the last thing i do
yeah so don't believe anything about
another country
doing all this great testing that's bs
all right have you seen today's latest
biden's brain is not working
video i i don't know if they're getting
sadder
as we go but it's
i want to have fun you know with
politics because i use it as my
entertainment as many of you do i want
to enjoy
you know the the horse race of it i want
to enjoy the election
the back and forth the tweets i want to
enjoy it
but when i watch biden struggle
to form sentences i don't have enjoyment
from that
i really that kind of brings me down
because whoever
whoever is letting him do this is just
unkind
it's beyond unkind it's it's just
they're just jerks at this point i mean
the democrats are just jerks
for letting this go on now one assumes
they have some kind of
plan or backup plan they're working on
but
at this point if you can't manage this
if you can't manage this it's just one
guy who's got a medical problem
obvious one if you can't manage this
oh don't give me stutters come on
we're way past that we're way past it's
a stutter
i'm not even close to that
but i hear what you're saying
i my personal opinion is there isn't the
slightest chance that joe biden
can win the presidency i think all the
polls will just continue
narrowing
and they'll just narrow until the
president has a solid lead
or or at least maybe look at it close
actually some of the polls
i assume are fake so there should be
some polls that show it's close
on election day because they'll be
trying to get their people out to vote
but i think the ones that are accurate
if i had to guess
i'll bet on election day rasmussen is
going to say that trump is ahead
so that's my prediction my prediction is
that on election day
rasmussen may be standing alone
or possibly with a few credible uh
polls saying that trump is going to win
and maybe the others will not
if they're maybe not as not as accurate
or not as honest if you will
so
yeah the the biden situation uh
i'd love to tell you that it's
stuttering because
most of you know i had a voice problem
for several years
you know 10 years ago and
i tried to form sentences that i could
say like a stutterer does
as opposed to sentences that were the
right words
so you end up saying all these weird
awkward
stilted sentences because it's what you
think you can get out
as opposed to what you think would be
the best choice of words
so i get that but that's not what i'm
seeing
that's not what i'm seeing at all and
you know as a fellow sufferer
of exactly that not a stutter but a
voice problem that caused me to do
workarounds the same way
i think i'd know what it'll look like
um somebody's asking about kamala well i
think she's still
top choice um i don't see any of the
other
candidates that have been mentioned as
even being in the top tier
i can't even imagine at this point but
you know the vice president pick is
the hardest to predict you know all
all of the smartest political people
will tell you the same thing
that if there's one thing hard to
predict it's it's who the vice president
pick will be
because lots of times they just come out
of left field you know mike pence was
not on my radar
you know so when i was guessing who
trump would pick i just
guessed from that small pool of people
that i heard of
and seemed like they fit and you know so
i missed that one by a mile
and i wouldn't be surprised if i'm wrong
with the kamala
situation but let me ask you this
so and i'd like to remind you of this
because if i get this right
this will be my greatest prediction and
the prediction was
from 2018 i said it was kamal harris
would be the head of the ticket
you know the the nominee when she
dropped out
i doubled down and said she's going to
be the the nominee
after she dropped out can you can you
sit for a moment and register that in
your mind
that i predicted in public that she
would be the nominee
after she dropped out do you realize how
how how big of a reach that was
now here we are if i had to ask you is
it more likely that biden will continue
through the
nomination process become the nominee
and go on to
you know finish finish as the nominee on
election day
after you saw this video today if you
saw it
watch this video today and tell me you
think that the democrats are going to go
ahead and nominate him for the top of
the ticket
and if he's not at the top of the ticket
who is now
i ask you this if if kabul harris
does not get selected as the vice
president
is it because they're holding out that
she might be the top of the ticket
i'm just putting it out there we've you
know
i don't think you can guarantee at this
point that kamala will be the choice
because like i said the vice president's
just too hard to pick
you know no matter how smart you are no
matter how good you are
it's just hard to pick so i'd probably
bet against myself
if i had to place a bet but i'm going to
stick with it and you'll stick with it
and i'm going to say
we've never been so close
to kamala harris being the nominee
we've never been that close so if it
doesn't happen it doesn't happen but
workloads all right
um was i using daily affirmations for
that prediction
i was not um you know i was trying to
figure out why
what it was that made me think
kamal harris was the one and
some of it was you know she's senator
and she's she she was good in at least
the committee hearing she wasn't so good
as a campaigner
but you know she's she's a woman of
color
i mean all of that seemed good but i was
looking at it the other day and
she has a she has predator eyes
and i asked myself i wonder if that's
predictive
predator eyes meaning that you look at
her and you say
oh yeah she could kill somebody right
you want your president to be able to
kill somebody
i want a president that i know if there
was a home invasion let's say they
weren't
actually the president with secret
service i want to know that if my
president
the person whose personality i'm
trusting to defend the country
i want to know if they were the victim
of a home invasion
and they got the upper hand on the
invader that they would finish him off
that they would actually kill them that
they could take a life
in person could kamala harris just look
at her
and ask me this does she look like she
could take a life
in person i think yes
right look at hillary clinton okay i
don't even have to finish the question
right
you look at hillary and you say could
she take somebody's life
in person probably so
probably so could trump take somebody's
life
you know if there was a reason in person
yeah yeah i think he could think he
could
so and even obama i would say was a
a predator meaning that you look at him
and you say
does he have what it takes like if he
had to
shoot bin laden himself maybe that's too
easy everybody would shoot him
but could obama kill somebody in person
if he had to i think so i think so
so um has nothing to do with
has nothing to do with being white or
black so whoever said that
you're you're on the wrong planet i
think that we may pick our presidents
based on uh just a feeling
that they look more like predators than
prey
let's take jimmy carter did jimmy carter
strike you as someone who could kill
somebody
if he had to nope
he only served one term how about
george bush senior
that's that's sort of a harder one um
but
but does he seem like he could kill
somebody in person
well he could george soon you're good
i was going to say he was a one-term
president but
yeah both of the bushes could kill
somebody in person they both look like
predators
to me all right
uh that's just a theory that we want
predators
as presidents because they in effect
there being a predator on our behalf
that's all i got for you today and i
will talk to you tomorrow
