good morning everybody
it's time for coffee with scott adams
the best time of the whole day
every single time and all you need to
make this special
like really special
better than usual
is a copper margaret glasses tanker
chalice or stein a canteen jugger flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dope being here today i
think it makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous sip
oh my troll is here
dr johnson
we don't know your first name but there
is speculation that it's richard
so richard is here
we're going to call you dick even if
you're not
so
tales from the simulation are you ready
one of the ways you know that this
reality is a simulation and not a real
one is all the coincidences
as twitter user donald donald luskin
pointed out
we've already got a
military general named millie
he's the military guy named milly
and then we have a chief negotiator of
the state department named blinken
he's negotiating for us and he's
blinking
but it gets worse as i pointed out
when you've got a place keeper president
who's just there until harris takes over
he's kind of
biden his time
yeah yeah the president is
biden his time until harris takes over
so that's how you know you live in a
simulation
all right
fake news of the day fake news of the
day this is a special category
in which you could argue it's not fake
news
or it's 50 fake news
uh it's actually a two movies on one
screen situation where at least one of
those movies is wrong
the other one might be right but it's
two movies and here it goes
uh emerald robinson tweeted this
noted that cdc director walinsky
just told the world in a recent
interview that quote
there's an increased risk of severe div
disease amongst those who are vaccinated
early
uh-oh
that sounds pretty bad
the people who got vaccinated early had
this
increased
risk of severe disease
which movie are you seeing now
how do you interpret that
people who got
vaccinated early
according to the cdc director have an
increased risk of severe disease
do you see the two movies
two movies
one movie says that what that means is
that the vaccinations themselves
make you sicker
that's one interpretation do you think
the cdc was saying
that the people who got the vaccination
early
are getting sicker than if they hadn't
gotten vaccinated at all
is that what they're saying
because that's how it's being
interpreted
but i don't think they're saying that i
think though i think what they're saying
is that the increased risk of severe
disease is compared to when they first
got vaccinated
in other words prior to vaccination they
had a high risk of disease the
vaccination lowered it substantially but
now they're watching that risk increase
as the vaccinations wear off and you
need a booster
is that a problem
well i mean if the booster itself is
dangerous it's a problem
but it's not being interpreted quite
exactly right so it's
percent fake news
except you don't know which is the fifty
percent
i'm pretty sure the fifty percent that's
fake is the idea that the vaccination
somehow makes you sicker
now
how bad is the communication from our
government
when the director of the cdc says
something
you don't know if it means
vaccinations kill you
or vaccinations save you
because that just happened
the director of the cdc said something
so ambiguous just the way she worded it
that you can't tell if she's saying the
vaccination will kill you or save you
how could it be worse
there are legitimate
people who watch the news
you know well-informed news watching
people
who believe this director of the cdc
just told you the vaccinations will kill
you
that didn't happen
i'm pretty sure that didn't happen
but they're so bad at communicating that
people think it happened
all right i blame the cdc for that
that's a little unclear but some of it
might be just taken out of context stuff
so um i think i said this yesterday i
had an idea for
dealing with the fentanyl coming in from
china
it's killing tens of thousands of people
in this country every year and china
doesn't want to do anything about it
even though they could easily shut it
down they know exactly who's sending it
to us i know we know that
china knows who's sending it to the
united states because we know
it's public
we know the names of the people in china
who are sending the fentanyl can you
believe that that we actually know the
name
and address presumably of the the head
drug dealer in in china who's sending
the fentanyl there's probably more than
one but there's one big one
and he's still alive
what
why didn't we kill that guy yet are you
telling me that our intelligence people
can't get to one guy
in china
he should be dead
he should be very very dead by now but
as far as i know he's not i mean i
suppose he could be and i wouldn't know
it
but what's up with that isn't that a
gigantic failure of our
of our intelligence agencies that we
haven't assassinated this guy yet it's
obvious he's obvious you kill that guy
and then you worry about china later
do you think that we would care
if china got really really mad that we
killed one of their nationals
yeah they would get really really mad
and then we would say well we gave you a
chance to kill him
this is how i'd do it if i were trump
because biden's not going to do it right
but let's say it's trump second term
i would say this i'll give you 60 days
to kill that guy and if you don't we're
going to go kill him on your territory
one way or another we're going to drop a
drone on him we're going to poison him
we're going to do something
but we're going to kill that guy in 60
days on your territory
unless you do
now it would be one thing
to kill a guy in chinese territory
without telling them in advance
that would be pretty effed up and then
they might they would probably retaliate
and kill some american that they've got
a beef with
on our territory you don't want that
that's why you tell them in advance
you do it overtly
you don't do it secretly
you say this guy's going to be dead in
60 days here's why he's killed uh 200
000 americans
he got 60 days
we're going to kill him in country
one way or another you know you you'll
figure it out one way or another we're
going to get him but you've got to kill
him in 60 days or we will
what we're trying to do then
well they probably pretend they put him
in jail or something i suppose they'd
have some kind of clever trick but i
think we have to say
it's not an option that he's still alive
in 60 days that's just not an option
we can't be that country
so let's get a little tougher on that um
here's the interesting thing when i
suggested that we have legislation to
deport one chinese college student for
every fentanyl death
i got zero pushback on this that i saw
maybe i missed something
but have you ever seen anybody make a
recommendation for anything you know
substantial
that nobody disagreed with
this is the one case
that this is the most bipartisan thing
in the country
seriously
name one thing that's more bipartisan
than making china stop sending us
fentanyl
there's nobody on the other side of that
nobody
so i mean some people are saying well
it's our own damn fault and stuff but
we'd still prefer they didn't send it to
us
right
so
what the interesting thing about this is
that now this idea is out there
and you know i included tom cotton on
the tweet i hope he's seen it by now but
once the idea is out there and zero
people think it's a bad idea
what would stop it from becoming
legislation
maybe there's some legal reason i don't
know
but let's see if anything happens with
that
um you may have already heard that the
pfizer vaccination is going to get full
fda approval every every smart person
says
maybe as soon as today but probably this
week
and so i asked a little highly
unscientific poll on twitter
for the unvaccinated to see if that
would
change their minds
now the people who did not get
vaccinated what is the number one thing
that they say
when they discuss their hesitancy to get
vaccinated what's the number one thing
they say
is not approved by the fda right
now i'm not imagining that right if
you've had enough conversations it's the
number one reason is it's not approved
by the fda so the fda is going to fix
that by approving it
so what percentage of all the
unvaccinated people
will change their mind because the data
changed
make a prediction
predict how many people will change
their minds
because there was one thing that was
holding them back
and then the data says oh it's okay now
because the fda approved it
close to zero yeah close to zero i got
four four point three percent said they
would likely
get the vaccination now that it's
approved
four point three percent
now this is of only the unvaccinated
people it's not vaccinated plus i'm
vaccinated four percent of the
unvaccinated people that's it
who were persuaded by the new data
presumably
new data
so
who could have predicted this
right
if you studied persuasion
you should have predicted this
tell me why
what what is the persuasion term
that predicts that people won't change
their mind when the data changes even
when
they said that's what would change their
mind
uh the the fake because i see why you're
saying that
confirmation bias
no not confirmation bias
consistency there you go yeah the
consistency bias people don't like to
change their minds
but
don't they like to change their minds
when the data changes
nope
here's the problem
people who got vaccinated are going to
be able to claim
that they were right
right so people went early and said yeah
i got the pfizer it wasn't fda approved
but i was pretty sure they saw enough
data that if there was a problem
probably would have known it early so i
took a calculated risk before the fda
approved it and now the fda has approved
it so it seems that my calculated risk
was correct so that would make me the
smart one and if you didn't get it
yeah i see why you were afraid but i
guess you made the wrong decision
right nobody wants to be on the other
end of what i just handed you
nobody wants to be told
they made the wrong decision before
because the change in the data
makes it appear
that you made the wrong decision
nobody can accept that
nobody believes they've made the wrong
decision when i say nobody well maybe
four percent can
but basically people aren't gonna i'm
gonna say i was wrong all along now
let me defend the people
who did not get vaccinated let me defend
them
just because things didn't go the way
they could have in other words just
because the people who did get
vaccinated early
their decision appears to be validated
by the fda now does that mean they were
the smart ones
if the fda
let's say you know enough years go by
that the people who got vaccinated early
clearly appear to be
the ones who made the right decision
could you go back in time and say yes
they made the right decision
no
because it was statistical
there was no right or wrong it was an
unknown
if you look into the unknown and you
make a choice
and it doesn't go well did you make the
wrong decision
no
probably not you might have made the
right
decision because you didn't have any
information that could help you so you
might have done the best you could
decision making it just didn't work out
for you
so one of the problems we have is that
people will look correct or look
incorrect
even as data is changing right so nobody
wants to look like they were wrong all
along
so i think that's why people dig in they
want to be consistent and right and it
doesn't let them do that
michael schellenberger
tweeted today and by the way you should
all be following michael schellenberger
if you're if you're not following him on
twitter
um he's one of them i would say
one of the top 10 most productive
useful tweeters
in the united states i would say
on a variety of topics green energy and
homelessness and fentanyl
being among them so those would be areas
of expertise and i'm hoping that larry
elder
is already talking to michael
but
here's what
michael tweeted this morning
he said that
germany
that is at risk of black outs from lack
of reliable energy so here here are some
germany stats the prices of energy in
germany rose 60 percent in 2021.
what
the energy price went up
60
in one year well they're doing something
wrong and i guess that's all the green
energy stuff that's not working out
their supply margin of energy is
shrinking from 26 percent to 3 percent
by 2023 so they won't have any margin
and
i guess angela merkel admits her
government got it wrong
so that germany is actually saying yeah
we effed up
and we screwed up our whole uh
you know supply chain situation
now
and they still and despite that
as michael points out they're still
planning to close their last nuclear
plant in 2022
completely and unscientific
you know way to go so germany is being
completely unscientific at least in
terms of their nuclear energy stuff
now
who could have predicted
that germany's plans would not work out
and what would you use to predict it
we're all geniuses in hindsight right
so it seems pretty smart for anybody who
said hey this green energy stuff isn't
going to work out the way you hope
it's got a lot of got a lot of downsides
and reliability etc
so i think a lot of people could have
predicted this wouldn't you say
because we didn't really see
even when they had the plan you couldn't
write you couldn't even see how it would
work exactly
because you're saying wait you're going
to get rid of all your reliable energy
replace it with unreliable energy
and that'll work out like even when you
hear it it doesn't make sense that it
possibly could have worked out it was
sounded like wishful thinking more than
a plan
but what would be another way you could
predict the things work out
economics i tell you many times that
people who study economics can see
around corners
because if things don't work out
economically they're not going to happen
in the long run right in the short run
anything can happen in the long run
things that are economical happen
things that are uneconomical
end up dying
so here's what you could have predicted
if you understood economics
that whatever was best for the economics
of the energy industry
would get them to lowest
risk in every way
let me say that again
whatever was the best economic plan for
energy
would also
necessarily
be the best for reducing energy
consumption in the long run
now if you don't understand that
i'm seeing people understand economics
exactly right everybody who understands
economics knows exactly what i just said
and here's the reason
we have tons of history
in which getting the economy right fixes
everything
right
why is it we have good health care in
the united states
it's because the economy's good that's
it why do we have a good military in the
united states
the economy is good
that's it
right you you get the economy good and
then everything works
why is it that the united states uh
surpassed its uh
what was it the paris climate accord
numbers without trying
without trying we had withdrawn from the
the paris agreement and we still beat
our numbers
why because we pursued economics
and i think it was natural gas that made
the difference why did we protrude why
did we pursue natural gas
it was economical
right
and you will find
consistently that if you predict in the
long term doesn't work in the short term
but if you're predicting the long term
the economics always gets you to the
best place now who knew this better than
any leader
trump
right trump is the one president who
knew this
more than any other leader get the
economics right
everything else works out
you get the economics right your army is
so big nobody will attack you you get
the economics right you've got more
energy than you can handle and then
you've got enough money to figure out
how to clean things and invest in green
energy and you know mitigate climate
change problems etc
it's the economy i mean basically it's
the bill clinton it's the economy stupid
you got to get the economy right and
then everything else will work out but
if you do it in the other order you've
got the afghanistan withdrawal
germany's
energy policy
is biden's
afghanistan withdrawal
they withdrew from nuclear before they
had a plan
same thing right same problem
they just did things in the wrong order
get the economy right and then you can
work on that other stuff
well apparently biden's even looking
crazy to the brits so the
the ministers over in london are saying
uh basically they're saying out loud now
they don't seem to even be embarrassed
that the president looks uh gaga or
dulali
so apparently if you're
looking crazy
over in great britain somebody's gonna
say you look gaga or possibly dulali
so biden's looking kind of doolally
lately and i think it has everything to
do with afghanistan
it finally reached a point where
you just couldn't ignore it anymore
it was kind of funny watching the world
try to ignore
the obvious decline in biden's
capabilities and they were doing such a
good job i mean they were literally
ignoring the hell out of it but
this made it impossible to ignore
afghanistan did
well it looks to me like the backdoor
plan to make kamala harris president
early
is not working out
meaning that
joe biden is declining faster his mental
state is declining faster than
any of our intel sources warned us
yeah the intel told us that
biden's mental faculties would last
another six months at least before they
failed and that would be plenty of time
to get harris up to speed get her some
wins and put her in position to be
the next president
but
it turns out that biden is
declining faster than any of our intel
told us was going to happen didn't see
it coming
uh and then the taliban is still oh i'm
sorry i'm in the wrong story i just i i
just mixed stories there for a minute i
forgot where i was
um
so yeah biden's declined faster than he
could but at the same time
harris's reputation is as bad as it
could possibly be i mean she's looking
totally incompetent on a number of
issues
so
as i tweeted um
cleverly
um i said it's uh it's time is it time
for a prominent democrat
to confess that the
the plan to back door kamala harrison to
the presidency has uh
 the bed so hard to damage the box
springs
um i think that's their problem isn't it
and i haven't i haven't seen anybody say
it yet out loud
i think the problem the the plan was
always to
you know get kamala harris in the
backyard back door
but
that plan just fell apart faster than
afghanistan's military you know what i
mean
so now they have
no first choice because biden has fallen
apart
and they don't really have a second
choice
right certainly for the presidency but
who the hell are they even going to run
for president in the next election i
mean it's not going to be biden can we
all agree
there's nobody here who thinks biden's
going to run for a second term i don't
think
um
who is it
yeah it's not going to be gavin newsom
right i don't think
he's got some problems
so name one person who could get elected
president as a democrat
yeah mark cuban maybe because it you
know and cuban could get elected as a
democrat because he he's not identified
as one
yeah you don't naturally just think he's
a democrat you just think he's you know
an entrepreneur who may lean one
direction or another depending on the
topic
but i think you need somebody who's
almost not a democrat to run as a
democrat the same way trump was sort of
not a republican
really who ran as a republican and then
made republicans like him you know
similar to him i mean
well you know you heard this story the
other day
that the fbi was finding little evidence
meaning no evidence that the january 6
attack was coordinated by supporters of
trump
or right-wing groups
have you heard the word insurrection
lately
huh
it seems to be that that word
insurrection is only used a little bit
less
now that the fbi has found out there was
nothing to it
so
at what point does see
the cnn say oh now that the fbi has
confirmed there was no insurrection
we'd like to correct all of our
reporting and punditry
for the past
many months
it was all fake there was no
insurrection it was a protest got in
hand there was violence but no nope nope
there was no insurrection and we got it
wrong
have you seen that story yet
nope nope
um former cia director
general michael hayden
he decided uh unwisely to tweet pictures
of the taliban uh juxtaposed with
trump supporting pickup trucks with
american flags
and said trump 2020 on it and uh
and and he captioned that uh our taliban
this was this guy was the head of the
cia the propaganda unit if you will
among other things
and he's telling you in pictures and
images and scary persuasion
that trump supporters are similar to the
taliban
it's weird that that's not illegal
of course freedom of speech so he can
say that if he wants
but
you know we always say things are
everything's hitler and nazi and it just
sounds crazy because you know it's
always hyperbole it's so
so over the top and i realize this is
just a meme and a joke and you know i
can easily say imagine if it's going the
other way somebody's saying it about the
other team as well
but
he was the head of the cia
he was the head of the cia
he shouldn't be calling american
citizens taliban
like
identifiable groups
this is this is nazi
am i wrong to say that's a nazi
thing to do
is that hyperbole
calling out a specific member of the
public
for essentially death
because if the taliban really were in
the united states we'd be advocating
killing them
so if it's somebody that you advocate
killing and you're saying that some
group of americans with a political
preference
are
similar to a group that you would kill
if they got in this country that feels
like nazi propaganda
doesn't it
i mean
i probably have argued more hours
than just about anybody about the nazi
and healer and algaes being always
inappropriate
and
this one just sort of
tickles that area a little too hard for
me
i'm wondering where's the where's carl
bernstein lately because cnn usually
calls them on whenever there's a big
problem to say that this problem is
worse than watergate and now we're
watching the afghanistan
withdrawal
and i'm saying to myself
if ever there was something that was
going to be worse than watergate
hmm
what would it be
it might be this
but
is carl bernstein on
summer vacation
where is he
so anyway we need the worse and more the
gay guy
there's at least some people who think
that biden's withdrawal from afghanistan
might end up not being a political
problem
think about that
how could it be
like what what argument could you make
that biden's withdrawal from afghanistan
is not going to hurt him politically
it turns out there is an argument and
the argument goes like this
turns out nobody cares about afghanistan
nobody cares the only thing anybody
cares about is that we get out
that's it meaning the military
i don't think americans care about
americans who chose to live in
afghanistan and didn't get out when it
was obvious you should get out months
ago
i have a little bit of problem
feeling empathy for people who knew what
they should have done and then didn't do
it
right
now you can you can have human empathy
but how much is your responsibility
to help people who won't help themselves
what the hell are these people still
doing in afghanistan
right
why are they there and why should that
be my problem why should i pay for it
yeah
yeah we can care because they're
americans so you know let me let me uh
not say that's my opinion
but rather i would say that there could
be plenty of americans who say i don't
care about afghanistan i don't care that
you messed it up
because i just don't care i just don't
care at all
so
i might be able to skate on that weirdly
enough
the only problem is it makes him look
like he has dementia
here's another fake news thing so you
know how our military told us that there
was no intel
that the afghan army would fall so fast
so no intelligence said that
that
is fake news
now
i'm not saying that the intelligence
people did tell them that
what's the fake news part
so here's the part that you have to
understand we built this afghan military
into a service that requires air support
to work
and then we disabled all their air
support before we left
do you need
an intelligence agency to tell you
that if you disable the most important
part of the military the military will
collapse
did you need intel
did you
because if you knew that you know if you
were the the head general
over there and you knew that you had
disabled the most critical part of the
afghan army's ability to defend itself
air support
you knew it was going to collapse
you knew it because you engineered it
you don't need intelligence
to tell you you're going to get
what you engineer
they engineered the failure
by taking a variable out of it that was
necessary to success
that wasn't done accidentally
that was done intentionally
right if you intentionally
destroy the army
how much intelligence do you need like
intel
to tell you it's not going to work out
and it'll probably collapse faster than
you wanted
i mean really when when these
tell us that they didn't have intel
well maybe that's technically
true
you should be fired for saying that
both these you know uh austin and millie
should be fired
for telling us this that they
didn't have intel yeah that's
technically true you
you didn't have intel because you didn't
need it
you degraded the afghan army before you
left and you did that first
you so stop telling us
that there was no intel
yeah you're lying pieces of there
is no intel we didn't need any
that's what it looks like
so
i'll tell you missus i'm going to make
okay still got time
uh the taliban says they will not accept
an extension of our august 31st deadline
for getting the
the westerners out
to which i say
why is it up to them
why are we letting the taliban give us
yet another humiliation
now i suppose biden wants to not piss
them off more than we need to while
we're trying to get people out that
makes sense
but talk about a humiliation
they're holding us to an arbitrary
deadline
it's arbitrary
there's nothing about that deadline that
has any
you know
physical part to it
you would think even the taliban would
want us to get people out even if it
took a few extra weeks
so that's just with us right at
this point they're just they're just
messing with us to humiliate us
but this is what uh trump would say if
he were president
we're going to get all our people out
that's it
taliban says the deadline is august 31st
and our president says the deadline is
when we get our people out
no negotiating no comment no pushback
no nothing
it's not a negotiation
acting like this is a negotiation would
be crazy
we're gonna
put as much strength as it takes
to get those people out period i mean
that's got to be the position
i asked people to explain to me why the
vaccinations
might make more variants
and i've not seen that explanation
i have seen people explain to me by
forwarding an article that doesn't
explain it
but people think they've seen the
explanations
and when they try to explain it watch
how it falls apart
selective pressure
so let me let me give let me walk you
through it
let's say you've got
a vaccinated person
who that vaccination will stop some of
the virus
but not the variance let's say that's
the situation
how does that keep create more variance
because the variant was there the the
vaccine didn't create the variant the
variant was going to be there
and the vaccine didn't stop it
but whether or not you got vaccinated or
not vaccinated
that variant was still going to get out
wasn't it
now you might say to yourself
well yes the variant would have gotten
out but so would the
the regular covet
is it the regular covid that's getting
out
to make you more resistant against the
variant
is that what's happening
and if you don't let enough of the real
covenant out the variant will run wild
i don't believe there's any mechanism
for
the argument that
fewer infections which is what you get
when you have more vaccinations i don't
see how fewer infections in the country
creates more variants
and watch that watch what happens when
you try to explain it
i saw
uh i think all variants spread equally
but the vaccine suppresses the old
strains
and
but you see what's missing right
every time somebody tries to explain it
it's like walking over a bridge and they
get halfway and there's no more bridge
and then they they say there you go
and i say oh
there's nothing happened you didn't
actually explain anything
just
take this basic assumption i'm seeing a
lot of people say ade like that means
something to me
try to put that in the sentence because
i think you're i think it's useful i
just don't know what ad is
um
smells like bs yeah
um
we know the vaccines work on the
variants as well at least so far
the vaccine does not suppress the virus
it suppresses the symptoms
but suppressing the symptoms
reduces the number of people who will
get it because if you don't have
symptoms you're less likely to spread it
so
let me here's my bottom line
bottom line is i think that uh the more
very the more
the more infections there are the more
variants
periods
so that's my idiot view
my non-expert idiot view
is that the more the more virus there is
in the world the more variance you're
gonna get
period
now if somebody can tell me why that's
wrong
without using words like well it filters
and
that doesn't mean anything
that just means there's less of it than
there would have been but it's less of
everything
than there would have been it's not just
less of one thing
so i feel as though
the argument that the vaccination causes
things to get worse is either completely
false
or it's weird that people can't explain
it
um
but but look at people trying to explain
it in the comments and failing
and i'm not making fun of you i'm saying
i don't think it can be explained
variants happen due to error correction
at the rna level okay what's that mean
right and how does that address my
question
let's see anybody try to explain in the
comments
um
don't think it's true to spread the
virus
okay uh variance will be ineffective
usually yeah
um
if you don't know what ada is
stop talking and go learn
bob you
i asked you what it is we're not all
born with full knowledge go do your own
research you
goodbye
um
all right so
you can only catch it from a sick person
uh what's this uh the spike protein
yeah so i see a number of people trying
to explain it with like little technical
terms but they don't actually make sense
as sentences
so
here's something i believe
i believe that our cdc
has two
gigantic
communication problems number one i
talked about which is they're acting as
though they communicate so poorly
they're making it sound like getting
vaccinated makes you sicker
you gotta fix that
that's just wrong
and the second thing is
people believe that the vaccinations are
causing variance
and i'm pretty sure that's not true but
i'm not convinced
pretty sure the vaccinations are not
making more variants
but
most of you believe it right wouldn't
you say most of you believe that the
vaccinations do
cause variance you believe that right
i i need to see any explanation of how
that could possibly be true in a in a
mathematical way
all right all you here we go
we'll look it up while you're here
it's like
this is why you shouldn't do your own
research everybody's saying look up ade
if you look up ade you'll know
everything all right so let me look it
up and watch how this doesn't make any
 difference all right
antibody dependent enhancements and
vaccines let's let's read what this is
all right immune responses to pathogens
involve many cells and blah blah blah
early during an infection those
responses are non-specific
meaning that although they are directed
to the passage passengers they're not
specific to it okay
what is ade 80 acres when the antibodies
generated during an immune response
recognize and bind to a pathogen okay is
there anything that's going to be
telling me anything useful here no
matter how far i read
but they are unable to prevent
infections blah blah blah trojan horrors
allowing the person to get into cells
blah blah is it caused by disease most
diseases do not cause it is it caused by
vaccines okay
on a few occasions ade has resulted from
vaccines
uh and this has nothing to do with my
question i was talking about variance
so
so here
you know as i predicted
looking at ade
would have nothing to do with the
question and apparently it doesn't has
nothing to do with the question of the
variance
so i didn't have to look that up to know
that that was
all right
um all right somebody's sending me this
okay i see you over locals are sending
me an article
uh
oh
um
and i don't know what that article is
supposed to be telling me
ade causes variance
so
why couldn't you explain that
it took like half an hour for somebody
to say
that there that the vaccinations in some
cases
could cause a
this ada response that triggers variants
what took you so long to say that
now
um
presumably
the experts don't think that's happening
right
is that right
um mike says scott is getting nervous
lol
we'll get rid of you mike for being an
 reading my mind
all right
um
let me inform you again
that being shown wrong on this podcast
is good news not bad news
if i could be completely turned around
on something i was pretty sure was true
and did it live
that would be cool
right because what we do here is talk
about blind spots and persuasion and how
people don't use you know data to make
decisions so this is the only place that
i'm free to make a complete
180.
other people paint themselves in a
corner
by trying to be right all the time
i wrote a book about how wrong i am
and i tell you when i'm wrong as much as
possible because being wrong is pretty
useful part of the process if you
understand why you were wrong in the
past
so i'm the only person who would love to
tell you i was wrong you just have to
give me a little bit better so i'll tell
you what i'll do
the
the people who think they can do their
own research and they learned all about
ade
you can't do your own research you will
never get up to speed
enough to know enough context to really
do that at least not better than the
experts you know maybe the experts can
do that
so
anyway so that's that's your argument is
that the vaccinations cause that effect
which produces variants
can anybody tell me if the cdc believes
that's happening
does does the cdc
believe that that is happening that the
ade is causing variance because i
haven't heard it
so so i think that that's a theoretical
risk not one that we observe is that
true
so find out if that's true for me get
back to me
so cnn's going after larry elder and
it's kind of hilarious uh watching them
so jim acosta was interviewing
daryl issa or isa from california and
asked about larry elder's quote
disparaging comments about women
and and jim acosta quoted one of
larry elder's quote disparaging comments
about women
and it was i guess i had something to do
with the women's march whenever that was
and uh larry said
uh wittily
that trump got more obese women
exercising in that march than michelle
obama ever did
now
is that
is that a comment about women
it's not even a comment about women
is it
it's a comment about obesity
now you could argue
that a comment about obesity is
inappropriate
i know you can make that argument
but
there's no way that isn't funny
but here's the best part the way uh
daryl isa handled it
perfectly
you want to see how to handle something
perfectly remember i've told you that if
you can disable somebody's best argument
you should you don't need to talk about
the rest of them
just say what's your best argument and
then i'll dismiss it
and then we'll be done because because
if that's your best argument and i can
dismiss it
i don't really need to listen to the
rest of them that was your best argument
so here's what daryl isis says he says
after he hears this joke he says you
know that was in the context of
entertainment and he says basically if
that's the best you have
that's it
the best you have against uh
against
larry elder the best you have
is that he made a joke about the women's
march you got obese women marching
that's it that's the best you have
that's perfect
if you ever get a chance to take to
dismantle somebody's best argument
by sweeping it away as just ridiculous
do it all right so daryl isa handled it
as well as you can handle that and then
jim acosta said oh but oh but we have
lots more oh yeah this isn't it i mean
i'm not saying this is our best stuff
no no oh we got we got wheel barrels
full of them binders
i've got a warehouse full of this stuff
why'd you start with that one
if you've got so much material
why'd you start with that one
it's because it was the best one
that's why
daryl lisa
totally dismissed this this this guy
by just basically laughing it off and
making him look like an idiot for his
best evidence was nothing
so
i don't know if that's all they've got
against larry elder is that he he
noticed a lot of the people marching
were overweight
that's what we all noticed
right
it's just america america looks like a
big overweight
parade
it has nothing to do with women in that
case
and then oh then there's new news
california officials open investigation
into whether larry elder
failed to disclose income sources well
isn't that
convenient that they opened an
investigation on a vague thing that they
don't even have a specific allegation
for
right before the election
do you think any democrats
are involved in this open investigation
yeah
i don't think you have to read the
details to know there might be a
democrat or two involved in this
investigation
and it doesn't even make a claim
it just asks a question
like well i know diddy
i'm did you
i'd like to open an investigation into
any of you whether you
claimed all your income
because i don't have any evidence that
any of you are hiding income but i think
we need to do an investigation
just to find out just to find out
all right well
those are the topics i needed to cover
today i think you feel smarter for it
and
uh the whiteboard actually i'm preparing
for a micro lesson on how to
how to create something from nothing
so that'll be on the subscription
service locals for people who want to
get smarter and
better uh
let's say better
skilled
um so the micro lessons are to give you
in just a few minutes just you know two
to four minutes usually uh some kind of
a life skill that
oh this is the best advice thank you
i got five dollars of advice
to remember that
weinstein rhymes with
einstein
so it's weinstein
is that right well i don't believe
that's right
is it
it's not weinstein
it's weinstein
no
that can't be right
anyway but but thank you for making that
suggestion but i'm not sure i believe it
um
scott why are you calling these
therapeutic vaccines it's called common
usage
common usage
uh common usage in the sense that that's
what everybody's calling them not that
it's accurate i i have said a number of
times
that
i didn't think vaccinations were even
possible
for a coronavirus
turns out they're not
it really is a therapeutic that's
delivered in a
like a vaccine
all right
colloquially yes that would be the good
word it is a colloquially colloquial use
of the word
um
scott can you ask either these experts
blah blah blah about the variant issue
um no
no i can't
here's my problem with stuff like that
if it can't be explained easily it's not
real
right if you have to go to the expert to
explain it to you
it's probably not real
there's a rule of
you know determining that if
somebody can't explain it easily
they don't understand it or it's not
real
so you should be able to say to me
there are three examples of vaccines
like this
that cause more variance
this is one of those
and so we expect it to go the way the
other ones went
now with that would that not be a simple
explanation that a lay person could
understand
and why is the cdc not telling mass why
is it not on the news why is it only the
rogue doctor who's who's saying it
so let me say this i don't believe any
of the rogue doctors
doesn't matter who it is doesn't matter
if they're pushing ivermectin or
hydroxychloroquine or variants or
anything else
some of them are probably going to be
right right statistically speaking
there's going to be a rogue doctor
somewhere who's right
but usually
not
if i had to put a number on it
95
of the time the rogue doctor is wrong
so if you saw the rogue doctor the only
one speaking out against the system
might be right but only five percent
chance
so just keep it in context now someday
if the dr malone or other rogue doctors
if they turn out to be right are you
going to come to me and say scott
it was obvious i told you
well you're still wrong
because statistically
it's not a good bet
but they could be right five percent
maybe you get one maybe get this one
right
uh cdc is compromised yeah maybe so all
right i gotta run and i will talk to you
all later
