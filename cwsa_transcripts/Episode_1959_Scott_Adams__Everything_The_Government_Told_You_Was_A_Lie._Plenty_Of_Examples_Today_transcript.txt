tube can you see me
they tried to keep me out but it didn't
work
all right I think we're in good shape
did you miss the simultaneous hit no I'm
just kidding I haven't done it yet
Avondale yet no I'm not late YouTube was
dysfunctional for a minute there
now if you'd like to take your
experience up a level and I think you do
let's see if I can get my together
here
thank you Paul
how's that
better right
well we're off to a rocky start
but can I redeem it can I pull it out
from this bad start yes
behind me
if you think there's just gonna be one
white board today no no two
two white boards that's the kind of day
we're looking at we're going to be going
into the weekend on a high point and if
you'd like to join us on this amazing
journey all you need is a cover of
mugger a glass of tanker Chelsea tonight
I can't even flaska vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now on this
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
hit the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens now go
yeah that's good stuff it's good stuff
foreign
well
here's something I I learned today
um
did you know this I don't know if you
knew this
there are no high quality studies
in the entire field of science there's
not a single high quality study
that disagrees with me
did you know that
I was a little shocked to find that out
today but it turns out it's true not a
single high quality study
disagrees with my personal opinion you
know what's even better
same with you
same with you
yeah
um
yeah it turns out that
if there's a study that disagrees with
you do you know what those are called
what are those called
low quality studies low quality studies
they don't have enough people there's
you know problem with them
but if there's one thing that all of us
can say for sure
just for us I can't speak for anybody
who's not watching right now
but all of us are compatible with all of
the high quality studies but not the low
quality ones the locality ones are the
ones that disagree with you
so just keep that in mind
um did you hear about Paul Pelosi's
attacker's son
so you you want to know how you know you
did a bad job of parenting
now here's a little tip sometimes you
wonder did I do a good job of parenting
gosh you know I tried my best I I wonder
well every now and then there's a
there's a way you can tell for sure
okay so the 19 year old son of Paul
Pelosi's attacker
when he was asked about it
he said
well maybe my father was a sex slave
laughs
baby baby busk was right because I guess
musk said something about that jokingly
or something he goes yeah maybe my for
all I know maybe he was a sex slave
[Laughter]
well that that and there's a kid who's
not entirely happy with the parenting he
received
the the kid is not not Hispanic
but his last name is Gonzalez
because the mother uh just liked the
there was a family that helped him out
named Gonzalez so he says you should
name your kids after a Hispanic family
[Laughter]
yeah if if your kid speculates on in the
national press
that their parents might be a sex slave
oh
uh that's the best story today
well let's see uh
uh there's no Tucker
talk about timing you know timing is
everything
imagine
three years ago
you know pre-pandemic
imagine if a major
news Outlet told you that there's new
information
that suggests that Kennedy was killed by
the CIA
is assassinated by the CIA what would
you thought what would you have thought
three years ago
it was like new information
would you have said oh yeah that
definitely happened three years ago
or would you say Ah that's another
conspiracy theory
well I guess it was last night
Tucker Carlson apparently has some
anonymous source familiar with the you
know the the documents that we haven't
seen publicly
who pretty much says oh yeah it looks
like a CIA kill
now
in 2022
December 22.
do you have any doubt that the CIA
killed Kennedy
so somehow it went from well I doubt it
you know it's conspiracy theory I mean
there might have been extra people
involved as possible but you know am I
going to believe that the CIA put out a
hit on the president of the United
States three years ago
I would have said well I suppose
anything's possible
but but I wouldn't have assumed that
there was any evidence for it
yeah
so I would say I'm going to accept that
tentatively as my working assumption
you know everything you read in the
history books
is sketchy
you know that right I mean probably the
names and dates are approximately right
but you know why somebody did something
and what was the real motivation and
what was really achieved and you know
all the interpretation stuff that's all
 that's all just made up so
history is basically whatever you want
to decide is true
that's the best you can do and I've
decided I'd like just to assume that's
true
so there's still people here saying that
I pushed covet passports would you like
to go to the white board now
so there's an here on um YouTube
who's just begging me
to take it to the next topic
shall we let's do that
let's give you a little lesson about how
things work in the real world here
step one
what happens when you look at a topic as
an engineer might
and you look at both sides of a topic
do you know what happens to you if you
publicly
consider the argument of both sides of a
topic
do you know what happens yeah that's
that's called entertaining both sides
so I would think I think of it as
considering all variables
but I've learned that if you consider
all variables that's really the same as
entertaining both sides
if you entertain both sides
that's the same as saying you
entertained one side
and then you also entertain the other
side
so if you entertain both sides could it
be said
that you enter to entertain one side
well yes
because you entertain both sides
and if you entertained the side that was
wrong
according to you would it be true to say
that I've sort of supported it
by entertaining it
right so if you consider it you're
really entertaining it if you entertain
it you support it if you support it you
promote it and if you promote it you're
healer you
 you
 you
 you for for for doing that to me
 you completely every one of you
who is doing this you're a idiot
and you don't belong in police Society
I'm going to talk about what is or is
not true on both sides of every
toxic and you're going to do this
because you're an you're an
unproductive
that's all I want to say
what about the back
[Music]
here's what I thought I was doing
during the pandemic and other times as
well
I thought it was a fog of War
I thought I was waiting for better data
and I thought that once I got that
better data
I could form tentative opinions
which as time went by I could either you
know modify or change I thought that's
what I was doing I thought I was waiting
for information
and that I would solidify my opinion
also be willing to modify it because you
know you never completely certain but it
turns out this is what I was doing I was
fencing and then I was a flip-flopping
and then I'm trying to walk it back
you
 you
 you
that's all I have to say
um
Ukraine says they shut down
37 out of 40 incoming drones and
missiles
do you believe that
do you believe
do you believe that Ukraine shot down 37
of 40 Russian drones at missiles
I feel like our I feel like the
technology wouldn't be that good
all right so you know how big Ukraine is
right
you know how big rush is
that's a lot of territory
are you telling me that 40 missiles were
shot into various targets and you know
all around Ukraine
and that we had enough
high quality
anti-anti-missile anti-drone stuff that
we shot down
almost all of it
or did they only aim their drones where
we had or not we where the ukrainians
had good air defense
I feel like this can't be true
what do you think doesn't it seem like
fake news
now don't and give me a history lesson
certainly
certainly it's true that the technology
of shooting down missiles has improved
that's fair to say right since Reagan's
you know Star Wars I'm sure we're a lot
better at it now than we ever were
but are we that good
now can somebody give me a history
lesson I need a fact check on the
following
like I have a sketchy memory of this
true or false
uh Israel's Iron Dome system
they in the earlier days of it they
massively exaggerated how effective it
was is that true or am I thinking of
Iraq
am I thinking of Iraq can somebody give
me a fact check on that
people are saying it's true
I think in both cases right
now is that typically what people who
have air defense say
is it just normal in the war that you
always say you're shooting everything
down when you're not
so
you think it's real
it could be real based on the fact that
we're sending them good stuff and things
have developed to that point
it feels to be like we ought to be able
to shoot down a drone because they're
they're moving slow right
don't drones move kind of slowly
so I'm not surprised you get a drone
but I'm a little bit surprised you could
get a missile
at least reliably I don't just I'm gonna
say I'm skeptical
I could be convinced
but I'm skeptical
all right um
it also makes me wonder if Russia is
going to run out of missiles and drones
like there's got to be some uh collapse
point right
and then I saw somebody else saying that
Russia is claiming victory
for I guess they recaptured
a totally non-strategic
part you know it was like something that
nobody should brag about but it's all
they had
which indicates they have no good news
the the only good news was something
they basically made up
like
uh
so Rise Against disciple says Claude
Adams why did you recommend covet
passports should I answer that question
why did I recommend covert passports
sure I'll answer that question
ah
why did I recommend it
what did I recommend it
recommend it
um
let me explain this to you
because I'm a smart person I consider
both sides which you call entertaining
both sides which you call entertaining
the one you don't like which you call
supporting the bad side which you call
promoting the bad side which you're a
 because you're calling
it recommending which never
happened you stupid
any other questions
anything else have I answered your
question
is that confusing
all right let's talk about Trump so
Trump said he had this big old
announcement
big old announcement and I was like ah
this is going to be good
can't wait fresh meat
and that he announced you is uh making
uh nfts digital trading cards where he's
represented as a superhero
and then everybody said
including me well that's a little
disappointing is that all you got
because if that's all you got
you don't look like a threat to win the
presidency
and then we learned more
interestingly
uh
he sold out all of his nfds
they all sold out
he made over four million dollars
one of the most successful fundraisers
of all time
and I don't think he's done
can't he just make more of them and I
also don't know if people can resell
them
and he gets a does anybody know if he
gets a cut anytime somebody trades one
can you trade them or you just own them
I don't even know if you can trade them
can you trade them you can trade them
and does he get a cut every time you
train him
10 for sure or you just think so no cut
all right
uh I I think we'll need to fact check on
this some people are confidently saying
10 but but I think you might be saying
that because that's a standard
it doesn't mean he did it though but
that is a standard
no wonder Christina left him
well look you
do you think you know anything about my
personal life
really do you think you know anything
about my personal life like anything
so just a Cindy Smith will remove you
goodbye
you know I was thinking of buying one I
I almost bought one of those nfts
because I thought yeah you never know 99
someday it might be worth a thousand you
never know you never know but
all right the second part of that is
then the Trump uh followed up not too
long after with what appears to be it
will be a series of little video
messages on certain topics the first
topic he picked
was a winner
I was a winner among other things it was
about Free Speech but sort of the
Applause line part was first within
hours of my inauguration I will sign an
executive order Banning any federal
department or agency from colluding with
any organization business or person to
sense or limit categorize or impede the
lawful speech of Americans
so he would be our our Free Speech
Defender
that's pretty strong that's pretty
strong
yeah
I don't I don't support Trump for
president because of age and just the
the provocation level is so high it's
just a different it's a different
proposition today
but I'm going to say when he does things
well
anybody have a problem with that if he
does something poorly I'll call it out
if he says something good I'll call it
out
now there's a risk there's a risk if I
say what he does well and
what he doesn't do well do you know what
the risk is
if I if I'm just sort of objective about
what he does well and what he doesn't
let me describe the risk
I think I'm going to be considering both
sides you're going to call it
entertaining both sides which you're
going to call entertaining the wrong
side which you're going to call
supporting the bad side which you'll say
means I'm promoting it which says I
recommended it you
let's just get that out of the way now
all right I would say that uh Trump's
strategy of doing not big rallies
because I understand they're really
expensive
the big rallies make sense when you get
toward the you know the final months so
you're probably doing that
but I do like this strategy
right
um
do you remember when Trump ran the first
time
and he was he was fundraising and
campaigning in a totally non-standard
way and what did everybody say
at first
hey you're campaigning in a non-standard
way that can't work
and then he became president
so how does he launch his 2024
by campaigning in a non-standard way
which which I was one of the many people
who immediately said oh the nft thing
that's what you've been saving you know
you're saving that like that's that's a
big announcement that's pathetic
and then immediately follows up with the
strongest
campaign promise
probably I've ever seen
that was a that was like a really strong
definitive first day and it's something
he could do right it wasn't something he
could maybe do well lost the connection
it was something you actually do I liked
it a lot it was it was right on the
Zeitgeist it was right it was right on
the news it was what we're talking about
it's what we're caring about at the
moment he hit he hit the mark
said it set it in a strong capable way
it was very good
it was very good
um
so
so far
so far Trump has innovated uh
fundraising successfully I'm gonna I'm
gonna call that uh
a solid success
fundraising wise anybody would anybody
disagree
solid success
there's nothing bad to say about that
because he did it tongue-in-cheek you
know he did it with a sense of humor he
wasn't calling himself superbrand
people bought it
how do you judge the quality of
something in the art world
if I ever told you how to judge art
does somebody buy it
that's it it's good if somebody buys it
and it is good the art is actually good
you know for its genre
all right
um
so that's interesting he may the the
thing that Trump does
is he surprises you and I was worried
that he was out of surprises like a sign
of age like he was just maybe running
the best of or just playing the hits you
know like a band that used to be famous
but now he's just playing the hits I was
worried he wouldn't have anything new
but this was new
yeah he introduced two completely new
things you know a new proposal that we
hadn't heard
as well as a new fundraising method that
completely worked
that's a pretty strong day
based on being you know and he was
insulted you know in the beginning
somebody says Scott is admiring Trump of
being a scammer is it a scammer if it's
um
transparent
what would be the scam part is there any
surprise to it is there any hidden
hidden trick
well what makes that a scam as opposed
to just a really good
um money raising thing
all right
well I was listening to a little bit of
Carrie Lake's lawsuit against uh I don't
know is it against just Maricopa or is
against Arizona in general but she is
so among her complaints
are there 60 of the uh machines
malfunctioned in Maricopa on Election
Day and everyone in the world knows that
Republicans wait to vote on election day
uh I don't think there's any question
that people were discouraged and left
the line
do you think there's any question about
that
do you think there's any question
that it reduced the amount of voting it
had to right all friction right how many
times have I told you
friction always makes a difference
it doesn't make a giant difference all
the time but it always makes a
difference this would be no exception
so and then there's a chain of custody
question where a bunch of ballots that
have a sketchy chain of custody there's
some issue about the ink wasn't
um dark enough on some some things were
maybe miscounted Etc
now
I'm no court
so I can't anticipate the outcome of it
but if we judge from what we've seen
before
on Election claims
I don't think she has a case do you
now that doesn't mean she's not right
all of her claims might be accurate
right I believe I believe the claims are
accurate what I'm asking is
what could be there's there's no way to
reverse it is there
do you think the court would take the
position of actually removing the
person's office
has that ever happened
and and could a court order a runoff
they could couldn't they they could
order a runoff couldn't they
it would have to be that wouldn't it
because I I can't imagine the court
would determine the election
am I right
the court the court would be super elect
reluctant
to decide who won based on just the
court
that would be their last preference
first preference would be return it to
the people
and redo it right so that so there is
some possibility that wouldn't you say
and and it's still kind of fresh I don't
know how long it takes to adjudicate
that
what do you think
do you think she has a chance
because the argument that uh Republicans
were unfairly
um affected because they vote on
Election Day
part of that's their own damn fault
it's not like you didn't know it's not
like you didn't know there would be some
advantage of doing it in advance
but
it was definitely the also the election
system failed
so you can't put all of that on the
voters
I don't know what do you think but if
you had to handicap it and you're going
to predict will there be a re-election
based on the strength of this claim or
the claims
I don't see it happening
like it feels like the real world is too
sticky
like in my hypothetical world you could
imagine her prevailing
but in the real world of real people I I
can't even imagine it
can you
oh somebody says there's a precedent a
precedent in Arizona
was it a precedent long enough ago
that it was not our hyper partisan times
because I think the hyper partisanship
that we're experiencing makes it
basically impossible
makes it impossible
all right well I'm gonna let's see let
just for fun I'm gonna make a prediction
right
now I should tell you
that I predict well
when I have any special insight
so let's say it's a persuasion related
thing or a dilberty bureaucracy kind of
thing I do pretty well in those
the or uh Mass hysteria I do pretty well
in those because I have some special you
know Advantage where I don't do well
is guessing who's going to get picked as
a vice president would you agree I have
no special
you know Insight on that and uh this one
uh not being a lawyer I have no special
insight
about how this will go would you agree
that I bring absolutely nothing to this
question because you know I haven't
looked at the details of the claims I'm
not a judge
but I'm still going to give a prediction
because it's fun all right my prediction
is that the election will not be
reversed
and the reasoning is that the inertia
and the desire to not upset things is
just going to be too big
just too big people will find a reason
not to reverse it because reversing it
would be just too much of a
too much of a disruption
now let me give you some context
um you may remember that I immediately
congratulated Biden when his election
was announced
did that mean that I trusted that the
vote was completely Fair
I treat them as separate things
so separately I want the best answer
but if I can't get the best answer in a
practical way then the next thing I want
is for the country to go on
as you know as strongly as it can and
that means just sort of
you know sucking it up and moving on so
I'm usually in favor of sucking it up
and moving on if the alternative is too
disruptive but that doesn't mean I trust
the result
that's a separate question
um here's some good news along the lines
of the Adam's law of slow-moving
disasters which as you know predicts
that if we see a problem far enough in
advance we're really really good
at solving it and turns out that France
has been working hard on their energy
issue because of the Russia disruption
stuff and uh
they had a number of reactors they had
taken offline for maintenance
to get them ready for the winter because
they knew they couldn't have them
offline in the winter
so I guess they've done a really good
from the outside I mean I can't judge
the real details from the outside
I I have to give France an A-Plus
because not only did they have a robust
nuclear energy
situation so they did better than the
United States just just say it right
just say it the France absolutely beat
the United States to death
in better energy policy because they
have you know widespread nuclear and
they haven't had a meltdown
and they were doing some maintenance on
the number they've got out of 45 of them
or something but there were a number
that were down for maintenance until
recently and they fired them back up and
the current thinking is that they
already
have enough
capacity to get through the winter
congratulations France
right you know what I I don't give
enough credit to France
you know it was fun to France is like
his sibling
like that's how I feel about France like
if there was ever real trouble we're
going to be on the same team
right you're like we're there for your
friends just friends with to be there
for us but we you know we like to argue
like siblings and stuff but in this in
this one instance not only did France
totally lap us
in the energy question but they just did
it again
they actually
acted so quickly and capably that they
saved France
from what would be a big big problem
potentially they did it I think I mean
it's a little early
but it looks like they did it so big
props to France
all right
let's see
um
so we got to talk about Musk
so yesterday and maybe it's been
reversed already
tell me if this has been reversed I
haven't checked the Twitter in an hour
but uh musk banned Aaron rupar Keith
olberman and a number of journalists for
what he said
there's some question about the facts
but what musk said is that they they
were involved with publishing his
location information
now I don't think they did it directly
some of them might have referred to
somebody who did have the information
and that might have been enough
um
so that they reported on it yeah so I
think they reported on on it in a way
that would tell other people where to go
find the information
what do you think do you think that musk
was violating his own
Rules by by Banning them because free
speech is His Highest principle or was
this
um
personal was was this just him being
personal
and it was just about him and his family
uh or was it was he reducing incitement
of violence
what do you think how do you feel about
it
foreign
let me give you my opinions
he is a father
his son was threatened by somebody who
knew his who knew his location
he's acting like a father
if you have a problem with that
too bad
too bad
how about your opinion of how he's
fathering
don't care
don't care how about if he was
inconsistent with his principles of free
speech
 you
that totally doesn't matter completely
irrelevant
what was musk doing something to protect
his family
yes
does it have some impact on us
yes
do you think that the impact on you
is so great
that a father should not protect his
children
course not now Elon you can do anything
you want to protect your children I mean
within reason of course
oh five I don't care if he broke the law
I mean he certainly he certainly you
know was close to the gray area on free
speech and some people have said he was
being inconsistent I don't care I don't
care
I don't care if he murdered somebody
if it was somebody who had it coming and
he was saving his family right no I
don't care what he did if if he was
protecting his family in the in the
midst of a uh a very direct
risk
that's the end of the that's the end of
the conversation if there's anything
else you want to talk about that I don't
want to hear it
dad mode beats every mode dad mode beats
the law dad mode beats the science dad
mode beats your doctor dad mode beats
your free speech
there's no conversation to be out here
and and if you don't think he did the
right thing to protect his kids well
 you too because it's not your kid
it's his kid
he did something clearly intended to
protect them
end of story
end of story you can talk about what was
legal or illegal or you know uh
consistent or inconsistent don't care
don't care why can't we just be humans
why can't we just treat it like human
beings for just a minute right how about
he's a human
is a human with a family he protected
him good for you good for you now what's
happened since then he sees he ran a
poll asking if they should be uh
unsuspended and I don't know if he means
all of them because I thought that some
of them were permanent
but he's he's talking about unsuspending
him and he's asking whether you should
do it right away or in seven days
so he's making you think past the sale
so he's already suggested he's going to
unsuspend him
and that's his decision right and I have
no problem with this decision on that
again
it's it's just so personal I I'm going
to stay out of it
uh that end of story shut down line is
Unbecoming
um let me say it a different way
I wouldn't have interest in any other
argument
but of course you have the right
you know the privilege of arguing
anything you want I'm just saying I
wouldn't have any interest personally in
listening to it because it's not going
to affect me
all right uh what do you think do you
think uh what about the concept
so I'm going to agree with him on just
being a good dad in this instance
but what do you think about the concept
of people
publishing his data now some people said
that the data that was being used was
already public do you think that matters
the data was already public
does that matter no that doesn't matter
now if you make it easier for somebody
to stalk him foreign
again
that's kind of all you need to know
right it doesn't matter there's
available somewhere where nobody's
looking
your average stalker is not going to be
that clever I mean if it's presented to
them they might act but they probably
don't know how to go get it
probably would have been thought of it
may have any stalkers would have thought
if I can if I can find that obscure
source and track is playing like who was
even thinking that until it was public
and then you think about it of course
all right so it looks like musk probably
saw that he was getting a lot of heat
and we'll look to soften that position
and that's again that's his decision
uh Elon is saying it was not publicly
accessible Let's either way
I mean that that that's a good fact
check if that's right so I would
appreciate I appreciate the fact check
well I don't think it changed anything
um all right
so
um
some of you may not want to hang around
for this topic
here's what we're not going to do
we're not going to talk about whether
masks are a good idea
because there's nobody nobody's Pro mask
here right
there's no Pro Mass person here
I mean you're welcome if you are but I
just expect there aren't any
and why I say Pro bask I mean in terms
of a mandate right and mandate
okay
um
but can I tell you can I tell you an
interesting story
that's in the domain of masks without
getting into a conversation about
whether they work
okay is that possible
because you know we're all just getting
mad at each other if we have that
conversation right let's just not do it
we're all on the same side no masks okay
but something interesting happened this
morning
it really interesting
and I've told you that I like to show
you examples of people triggered into
cognitive dissonance
right because the more you see the more
you can recognize it on your own
sometimes you just think people are
acting dumb or maybe they were unclear
but cognitive dissonance is really its
own thing and once you can recognize it
it really makes your life better because
when you see it you know that arguing
the facts is useless
all right
so I won't name names but there's a a
woman on Twitter who's an expert on a
mask Effectiveness and I think even more
of an expert since covert
so subject matter expert and somebody
who's looked at a lot of the science and
the and the stuff to find out what works
and what doesn't
and her conclusion was and again we're
not going to argue this okay
so this is not about Mass Effectiveness
we will not be talking about that
um
so she she said essentially your search
her research shows that masks are
ineffective
you all good so far there's an expert
that agrees with all of you looked at
all the details said masks don't seem to
be effective right
now
I intentionally triggered her into a
cognitive distance
meaning I said oh if I say this she's
going to be triggered into cognitive
dissonance
and here's what I said
are you saying now I'm paraphrasing
everything so these are not exact words
so I said
um do you buy into the viral load idea
that if you were talking directly into
somebody's mouth
and nobody had a mask
with those people who got infected have
the same outcome and live as long as
someone who is on the other side of the
room
and let's say you were both masked
and they still got infected
because there's you know there's a virus
in the air so let's say in both cases
they got infected one got like a huge
dose of virus right in the face
the other one got a little Trace
but they both got infected so my
question is do they they both have the
same outcome do they both die
does one of them get sicker
right
so that was my question do you
understand why that would trigger
cognitive dissonance do you see it
do you see how that's a guarantee of
trigger
yeah you can see it right because you
can't answer the question without
debunking your own position
you can't
and and so that that causes you to be
spun into a cognitive distance now what
are the Tells for cognitive dissonance
that I've taught you what would you
expect would be the outcome of that
word salad word salad so I'm going to
read the response
and I want you to see if this sounds
like a good response that for some
reason I don't understand
or does it seem like word salad and
maybe intentionally not
uh answering okay so here's the exact
answer now keep in mind that the other
communication from the same person was
very clear
so this is a person who writes and
speaks clearly
and I can see it you know plainly in the
other responses but as soon as I said oh
my God I'm going to trigger you into
cognitive dissonance this was the exact
response
aerosol Dynamics and plumes created by
different apparatuses as the main thing
that was sold that is false is the
concept of masks as Source control for
aerosols
I'm going to read it again
aerosol Dynamics and plumes created by
different apparatuses as the main thing
that was sold that is false is the
concept of mass as Source control for
aerosols
now
that's word salad right
now if if she were someone who was If
This Were a bad communicator
what would you say you say oh that's
just another bad Communicator right
but I asked a really simple question
that has a yes no answer
the two people in the room do they get
just the sick or not yes no
yes no
this is cognitive dissonance now is this
helpful
because I'm I'm trying not to uh the
reason I'm not using a name is I don't
want to throw somebody on the bus
because cognitive dissonance is not
something anybody controls
you don't choose to have it
you're a victim of it
right so she's having in my opinion my
semi-qualified professional opinion is
that this is the most classic case
of word salad and cognitive dissonance
you'll ever see
now what would you predict
if I followed up with clarifications oh
that doesn't answer my question
can you put it in a yes no
yes no
these two situations do they have the
same outcome
how did she answer
what would you predict
she interpreted my word outcome to mean
do they both get infected
and then she said they both can get
infected
does that tell you that masks work or
don't work
that both you can with the trace amount
you can get infected
but also if it got blown directly in
your face you could also get infected so
does that tell you masks work or they
don't work
it it tells you what we know that the
mass don't stop all infections right so
everybody agrees with that
but what did she leave out
is there something obviously left out
she said both can get infected
but do they
just as often
just as often now they might
that and by the way I would completely
believe that
I wouldn't disbelieve that because the
the virus is so viral that I can believe
that getting a little bit of it
guarantees you get infected just as much
as if you got a lot of it now I don't
know that that's true
but if I learned that it was true I'd
say okay that's a really infectious
infection there which we knew
all right
so so then do you imagine that I
clarified no you're you're thinking of
outcomes
in terms of infection that's not the
question I'm speaking of outcomes
specifically about do you live or die
what do you think happened then
what's the net what would somebody in
cognitive dissonance do if you continue
to narrow down
word salad again
and what else what else would anger
there you go yeah then it starts getting
emotional right now she did a good job
let me get let me get a compliment I
thought she did an unusually good job of
not making her personal
but you could you could see it come up
right I mean it was definitely there but
she did a good job
do you think that she ever answered my
direct question
of course not she continued to say I
keep answering your question
I kept saying no you're answering a
different question here's what you
answered here's what I asked what would
she say that
I keep answering your question
and she would answer the wrong question
again
yeah that's cognitive distance now do
you think if it sounds like I want to be
very clear if it sounds like I'm
describing somebody who's not smart
no very smart looking apparently has a
lot of capabilities
but
I entered her area of expertise
and completely unmaster in public no pun
intended
and that triggers cognitive distance
right now because the problem here was
that it wasn't a scientific or data or
um it wasn't a scientific or data
problem
there was a logic problem
you know the logic is does everybody
have the same outcome
if it's not being studied you don't know
if Mass make a difference
now let me ask you this
um
I think everyone said that they don't
want mandatory masks
second question
how many think
that even though you don't want them
that there might be some situation where
they might work a little bit like you
know with your 85 year old
grandmother who's almost dead
is there any situation in which you
think well
maybe that makes sense
so when you wear them around your 100
year old grandmother
I mean I think you would just for the
placebo effect you know if it only made
Grandma feel better but
I I here's what I think I feel like
we have conflated whether they make any
difference
with the fact that we don't want them
because nobody wants to to admit that
well there might be a little benefit in
some cases
because as soon as you admit it then you
got to wear masks right the the moment
you allow there might be it might be a
little bit of benefit than a semantic
right so we we act like no it couldn't
possibly work in any case but when you
go to visit Grandma well suddenly you're
a hypocrite aren't you no these masks
are terrible they don't work
but you visit your grandmother
you're going to put on a mask because
you don't believe your own opinions
[Laughter]
now that's not everybody right so maybe
you're just doing it as to so Grandma
will feel better
but I suspect most people are
inconsistent
saying that masks totally don't work but
at the same time if it's your own
grandmother you're going to put out a
mask
because yeah you never know
but again I don't know if masks work or
don't work but I don't see it in the big
pictures
and certainly certainly you don't see
masks working at the country level would
you agree
you don't see any Mass working at at the
level of the country like if you look
when they're instituted you don't see
the signal
so uh so it can't be working that much
all right ladies and gentlemen that
wasn't better than I thought
I I think it helps I think it helps that
we all don't want masks so we don't have
to argue about that
um remember I told you that uh there
would be a hip piece about me coming out
pretty soon
have you seen it
apparently somebody named
I don't know if I have the name right
Jordan schechtel or something
is that a real person
uh wrote some kind of a sub stack
um targeting me
and and some other people I think and
the the essence of it was that we found
out who these people really were
and then he spread some fake news about
me by misinterpreting a tweet
and decided that I'm on the side of evil
for being so wrong and I must be
ostracized from all Society
now he's a conservative
so I didn't expect that it would be
coming from that side
now here's some background when you read
something like that
would you know that I had blocked him on
Twitter long ago
and how do you think you felt about it
it's always personal yeah there's a lot
of stuff you see that you think is just
somebody analyzing something it turns
out it's just personal
that was just personal so he made up
some fake because he's a piece of
Jordan lying stupid piece of
but
because not everybody knows he's a lying
stupid angry piece of
a lot of people thought it was true
and so I spent all of yesterday uh
charging up
you know getting more energy
oh by the way I was watching edutate
just totally plagiarized me in a video
yesterday
somebody asked them what's the worst
advice
he goes ah Follow Your Passion that's
the worst advice follow your passion and
you just basically plagiarizes
plagiarizes me and he plagiarizes me a
lot
which is interesting because you know
he's he got mad when I criticize him
once so he's my
my enemy forever I guess
but but for what it's worth
I have to say he puts on a good show
puts out a good show he's accomplishing
exactly what he's trying to accomplish
he's doing it in public everybody's
watching
it's a good show it's a good show
um
then I saw somebody else getting on uh
James Clear who wrote the huge
bestseller
I think it might be one of the biggest
or the biggest
uh best-selling Business book of all
time I mean it's just a monster book
called Atomic habits
and somebody accused him of
borrowing my systems versus goals
concept and he slapped them down on
Twitter and he said quite clearly that
he credits me for that idea and the book
which he does I mean it's very clear
it's transparent so I I've never I've
never criticized him for that he always
gives a big credit and he does it very
aggressively too he does it in public he
does it on Twitter he does it in the
book
that's full credit
um and then what what else he did is he
packaged that with with other ideas and
did it really well
so when you you write a book it's not
all about brand new ideas sometimes it's
how you package them and he must have
done that extraordinarily well
um
the biosphere yeah
what about coveted passports are are
there let me ask are there still some
idiots on YouTube who think I was uh
promoting covet passports can you show
yourselves I want to see how many idiots
came over here actually believe that
hideous raise your hands how many
believe that I supported and promoted
uh passports Joe Joe's raising his hands
as an idiot thank you
any other idiots who would like to show
themselves
go on come on
you come on show yourselves come on
don't be shy
you know there's a lot of you here
there we go Philip is volunteering to
say he's an idiot Thank You Phillip
uh
go come on anybody else
all right
now some people say Scott why do you not
just let it go
like it's it's just people talking and
why do you argue with them online
do you know why
do you not know why
do I have to tell you why I do it
number one I'm an energy monster
so I I gain energy
every time I fight online
you don't want to fight with somebody
who gains energy from it
like like it's crazy I don't know if
they gained any energy but it's all good
for me
secondly if somebody says that
something's so destructive to your your
reputation
you have to put down a um at least make
a good try of correcting the record
in roughly the same area that somebody's
going to find it right if somebody finds
the false claim you want to make sure
that you've you know laid down a good
saturation of the correct information
just so his historians could find it
so so part of it is just making sure the
record is correct but it's also
necessary to what I do
because if I if people start rumors that
I got stuff wrong that I didn't get
wrong
it detracts from my credibility
and that's the only thing I offer
that's it
the only thing I'm offering to you is my
credibility
the fact that I'm not paid
to say what I say
that I have a little bit of analytical
abilities
and you can trust that if I disagree
with you I'm going to tell you
I'm not going to agree with you to be
your friend right so if I lose any of
that because some idiot troll didn't
understand a tweet
and as a you know personal problem with
me
well then I try to correct it
because there's no downside to me I had
a good day yesterday
if you think I didn't then you don't
understand how any of this works
you are paid in appreciation
well thank you
um
kind of I don't know immature though
Scott doesn't make you look like a calm
reasonable intellect
um
so Michael has a good point he says that
the way I do it
doesn't make me look like a calm
what was the word
I'm agreeing with you here
uh doesn't make me look mature
or calm or reasonable intellect
so why why do I act that way is it
because I don't know how not to
anybody want to answer this question why
do I act in a way that can be accurately
construed as looking immature and
it's part of the show yeah I'm doing it
to rile people up
because it makes their uh their their
logic fall apart faster this is part of
the process
if somebody is irrational and you can
get them angry then their irrationality
just multiplies so everybody can see it
it's just part of the process just enjoy
the enjoy the show
anything I say on Twitter
you know it might be like exactly how
I'm feeling and I might say it exactly
the same in person
but Twitter is a performance it's a
performance uh platform
would you agree it's a performance
platform so some of it's performance
and if I can get you to be a little bit
mad at me does that make you less likely
to look or more likely
so that's the energy monster thing
uh
and wicked Lefty says I thought you were
authentic that is authentic
do you not understand what authentic is
authentic is I modify my Approach for
every situation
like all real people do
that's what a real person does you talk
to a child like a parent you talk to a
cop
a different way you talk to your boss a
different way when you're on the stage
you talk differently than you do to one
person when I do a live stream
yeah it's a different persona
but they're all real
how is does that seem confusing to you
in any way is there anybody who doesn't
understand
that I modify for the platform
should I not
you treat everyone basically the same
well you probably don't live stream
Miss America is a nuclear engineering
student well there's an interesting
factoid
a goatee would make me look more
intellectual
I've resisted the facial hair
did I misinterpret that your passport
tweet suggested they were harmless yes
you did you did because I didn't make
that statement did I
you you ran into it something I didn't
say
I never gave you an opinion of whether
they're harmless or not harmless
I did tell you that they can already
track you and turn off your
uh turn off your bank
so I I did I did offer uh contrast right
and context
um
usually the boulder that the bigger the
beard
well it makes sense right because the
the beard is also the way that you
detract from the top of your head so I
understand why people do it I just like
the shape of my head
maybe maybe that's the difference have
you ever noticed that there's a big
difference
with you know bald people
they don't all have the ideal head shape
but I like my head shape
I'm not really trying to detract from it
that's where I'm wrong
uh a black sticks
Styx doesn't care
Styx has Benedict to me in the past
so it's not his first offense
and by the way why why should I expose
myself to people who are not nice to me
if I don't need to well what would be
the purpose of that for me
like what what's in that for me
yeah it doesn't matter that doesn't
matter if he has a good feeling about me
that's that's not relevant I care about
how he treats me
I care about how he treats me that's all
right
um
all right let's uh
let's call this Good
and YouTube
I love you I'll talk to you tomorrow
