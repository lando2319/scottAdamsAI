hey everybody
sorry i'm a little bit late there was
some breaking news i just had to
catch up on i don't know if you caught
it but
you knew that this last month or so
before the election
you knew it was going to get good
and we have some stuff coming uh
but before we get to that let us do the
most important part of the day it's
called the simultaneous sip and all you
need is
a couple of mugger glass attacker cells
to sign the canteen flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine hit
of the day
the thing that makes everything except
the news better
it's called the simultaneous hip and it
happens now go
good stuff so the news that i
just saw before i logged on here was
that
there's a another accusation against
president trump
that in 1997 a woman went to the u.s
open with her boyfriend
and with trump as guests and that he
quote
he uh according to her this is
these are his these are her words
that she uh she put his tongue
she she put his tongue down her throat
and it felt like tentacles
now you can't write any better than that
and all i can see is all i can see is
that you know
it turns out that the trump is actually
a lizard person from another planet he's
actually got like a tentacle tongue
and you know i heard somebody say the
other day that i think michael cohen
said he never laughs
and i thought well maybe he doesn't want
to laugh because if he opens his mouth
that tongue will come out the tentacle
uh so well we hope this didn't really
happen
uh her boyfriend says he doesn't have
any memory of it
she apparently told him about it and he
says he doesn't remember it i think
so i don't think this is going to move
the dial
it's not going to move the dial so
and of course there's nothing funny
about
sexual assault i'm just saying we don't
believe
every story we hear in the election
season
all right so last night there was a
glitch in the simulation
and i'm going to tell you the story and
then you can interpret it any way you
want
so it was a day before yesterday i woke
up in the morning
and i couldn't read
for about an hour or so now when i say i
couldn't read
i mean i could look at words and i i
knew what each word meant
but i couldn't read them and i thought
to myself
what's going on here and i thought oh
it's just because i'm looking at
somebody's tweet that's confusing
and it's so poorly written that i just
don't even know what it says
so i went to a simpler tweet that was
you know just one sentence
and i couldn't read it i knew what the
words were
i knew i could sound out every word i
could sound them out in order
but i couldn't read it i didn't know
what it meant
i still had language skills and
everything else then it got weirder
things started disappearing
just like just like a simulation i was
looking at a tennis ball that was
sitting on the floor
and i watched it disappear completely
i'm just looking at the floor and the
floor is now
empty and as i watched it
the ball reappeared and i re i
reproduced it several times with other
objects
etc so things started glitching
so as you might imagine no actually i
wasn't
i was not even a little bit high
so if you're waiting for the part where
i was on some kind of drug or something
sorry so
and then i had a splitting headache
which was weird anyway
i ended up at the emergency room last
night having my
literally having my head scanned to see
what was in there
turns out there was nothing in there i
know that's an old joke
but i didn't have any kind of brain or
abnormality
and you know a day later it has
worked itself out i had high blood
pressure and some other stuff i'm
working on
but here's something you should never
say to your
medical professional are you ready no it
wasn't a stroke they checked for that
so they checked all the obvious stuff so
if you're
if you're going to try to guess what it
is you're not going to succeed because
we already went to the list
doesn't look like it's any of those
doesn't look like it's serious but we'll
see anyway
here's something you don't want to tell
your health care professional
when i was first talking on the phone
the other day about
about the high blood pressure i don't
remember why
oh i remember why it was because uh the
the nurse was trying to figure out if i
had some
trauma that was causing my blood
pressure to go high
and so one of the standard questions
they ask is have you
thought about taking your own life
now here's a question you should not ask
a literal person because
it's one of those questions that you
know what the right answer is
but i didn't give the right answer if
if she had asked are you planning to
kill yourself
i would have said no no not even close
had she said are you seriously
considering it
i always said no no i'm not considering
it
but she didn't say those words she said
have you thought about it to which i
said
because apparently i have a little bit
too much asperger's from my own
good i said of course
who hasn't thought about it
and she said well i haven't and i said
what what how could you not
think about it i'm not saying i want to
do it i have no
interest no inclination no
you know nothing's nudging me in that
direction but as an intellectual thought
of course i've thought about it how do
you not think about it
it's just one of those things that's in
the atmosphere and i said
indeed i've probably thought about it
every day since i was 12 years old
i don't think i ever go a day without
thinking about it
but i don't plan it i just
think about it so it turns out that if
you've ever said that once
if you've ever said that once you will
get quizzed on that every time you go in
because once that's on your record
so don't make that mistake i made unless
you're actually
you know serious about it um so i don't
know what that was all about but i'll
tell you the funniest part is they were
testing my vision so you know i'm
standing in front of the
the vision chart and i'm wearing my mask
of course
but i also have my glasses on so i'm
trying to read the vision chart as i'm
breathing
and my mask is fogging up and i'm trying
to explain
to the woman that my glasses are fogging
and that's the reason i can't read the
the smaller type and i'm trying
desperately to convince her
not only that i'm not trying to take my
own life
but i could probably see the chart
if my glasses were not fogged up like no
seriously seriously
i would be able to see that that my
brain it's not my brain
no no there's nothing wrong with my
brain i think my eyes are okay
i would be able to see that if my
glasses were not fog please
please don't put me in a machine
anyway so here's the good news uh i went
to the emergency room and
it was almost empty
it was almost empty and so i got the
best
medical service you've ever seen i mean
i got really really good medical service
just i got lucky it was a day they
didn't have many emergencies
so enough about me why is it the
democrats are so bad at predicting
things
have you ever noticed that there's a
very funny uh john
kerry video going around and he was
talking somewhere in public
and he you know how carrie puts his
glasses down like this
so that he can talk to you like he is
much more
haughty and uh arrogant and uh he knows
a lot more than you do
because he's literally looking down his
nose at you down his glasses
and in the video he was saying there's
one thing i'm gonna tell you i'm
paraphrasing
there's one thing you have to know there
will never
ever be peace in the middle east unless
the palestinian situation
is first i have talked to all the
leaders in the in the middle east
they're all my best friends we hang out
together
i just talked to them this morning and
if there's one thing i can tell you for
sure
take it to the bank there will never
listen to me
listen to me and read my lips that will
never
never never never you idiots
never be any kind of a deal in the
middle east until the palestinian
situation is fixed
first i can watch that video all day
long
because not only is he spectacularly
wrong
as we can see by recent events but
he was really sure about it he was
really really sure about it
uh i'm saying you're still making
medical uh
medical advice i did have a cat scan so
everything's fine with my brain
here are some suggestions for why
democrats are
unusually bad at predicting
and this is just sort of a working
hypothesis i have so i'm gonna
i'm gonna be monitoring this to see if
there's a pattern here
the first one is that i believe
democrats have
social priorities that might bias them
so they they might have a preferred way
they would like things to turn out
that is just a little disconnected from
reality so that's the first thing
you know a preference for how the world
should be
which is maybe maybe biasing them
i can imagine that conservatives would
have a different
kind of bias the other way i think the
democrats are
far more susceptible to fake news i'll
tell you in a bit about my
smart smartest liberal friend
democrat friend i'll give you an update
on him in a minute
but he falls for every fake news
all of them every fake news i'll give
you an update now
so i always talk about my smartest
democrat friend
and what he will believe which is just
amazing
the things he believes so every time
there'll be a debunk
of something i know he believes i send
it over to him and it's starting to make
a difference
so i've debunked just about everything
he believed
but he still fights against the debunks
it's like well
you know i'm not sure that's quite a
debunk or he changes the subject
but this one was pretty clean i sent him
the report over that said
there is no validation for the idea
that russians were offering a bounty for
american soldiers
that was one of his biggest complaints
so i sent it over it came from
the military it was official very
reliable report that says no we've
looked into it for
however many weeks we can't find any
credible
allegation there it's not credible so my
friend
actually i was surprised he said well
you know
it's good that information is updated
and he accepted it
i don't know if i've ever seen this
before have you
and i when i say i've never seen it
before i actually mean that literally
i don't think i've ever seen anybody a
democrat
who you give them information and then
they read it and they go oh that's new
information i will
revise my opinion of this thing i've
never seen it but it happened
it actually happened yesterday and i was
amazed
and as soon as that happened he moved to
a new hoax which is the
hydroxychloroquine is dangerous
and i was like i have to start all over
again
hydroxychloroquine is only dangerous
in the hoax scenario where there was one
study where they overdosed
senior citizens but if you used it in
the way it's supposed to be used
no danger so there was no limit to how
many new hoaxes he would be willing to
take on as long as he had lots of them
and it is my belief
that there is a greater propensity to
believe fake news on the left if only
because there's more of it
that could reverse if we had uh if we
had a democrat as president i think
i think the right is a little bit more
fake newsie
it's just whoever's at a power tends to
be the fake news one
so that is the democrats at the moment
here's the other thing they get wrong
democrats
seem to ignore human incentives
republicans only they only design two
incentives
capitalism you're gonna have to work or
you'll starve
the legal system you'd better obey the
law
or you'll go to jail so the entire
idea of republicans is that there are
these things called human
beings and you need to design a system
to control their worst impulses
democracy
you know you get a lot of dumb people
but maybe on average they can get the
right answer etc
i think that democrats have some weird
opinion that people can just
be good if you if you browbeat them
enough
you know if i remind you enough to be a
good person
in the way that i want you to be you'll
do it i'm just gonna have to keep on you
just keep reminding you what's what you
should be and what you should not be
have i shamed you enough can i shame you
enough
so there's a difference there they don't
understand
that you can always predict that humans
will be humans
today and tomorrow so you can know what
they'll do tomorrow
just because they're still human of
course they'll do that tomorrow
and then of course you've got the trump
derangement syndrome
which blinds them a little bit or a lot
and then
in many cases there's a lack of a talent
stack as i say
so if it's just a journalist for example
or an artist
they just might not have the skills to
understand their world
but i believe that this is a real thing
and i'll bet oh here oh this is good are
you ready for this
i'll bet you you could do a study
in which you looked at the the predicted
bets
of democrats and the predictive bets
of republicans i'll bet there'd be a
difference
and i don't think they ask you that when
when you sign up for predicted they
don't ask you
what your inclinations are they they
just take your bets
but i bet you could do a poll i'll bet
you could say you know do you use a
betting service
what's your you know what's your party
affiliation and then
you know show us your results probably
or you could do a study where you just
randomly pick
a bunch of democrats and randomly pick
republicans and say
we're going to give you all a thousand
dollars use them in the
the betting markets and then we'll get
back to you in six months
you can bet on anything you want there's
no limit to what you can bet on
just any topic you want just see if
democrats or republicans are better at
betting would you would you make a bet
on how that went
i feel like that i feel like republicans
would win that
but i'm not positive it'd be fun to be
fun to test
all right bill barr is making news again
he's always fun to watch he's one of my
favorite
people just to to hear him talk but
i feel like he made one persuasion
error that didn't need to be made which
is unusual
you know there are some people who make
lots of them but when bill barr makes
what in my opinion maybe maybe he's just
smarter than me
which i can't rule out but in my opinion
this is a big
persuasion error and it goes like this
barr said that he defined systemic
racism
and the systemic part to mean that it's
built into the
government institutions i think he
mostly means government
institutions but he said institutions
now first of all that's the wrong
definition
so if you're trying to convince somebody
else as opposed to just talking to
republicans
which has its value but in an election
season
or if you're trying to make the country
let's say more relaxed about
potential violence or any of that you're
really talking to everybody
so he should have been talking to
everybody
and then he very very unusually
defined systemic racism completely wrong
because it's not about just the
government institutions
and i would agree with barr that the
government institutions aren't too bad
you know everything could be fixed but
you know they're i think the government
institutions are
well into the 95 percent
pretty fair you know you always got to
work on that last five percent
so here's what he could have done better
here's what i would have done i would
have agreed and amplified
and every time that i have an
opportunity to show you how to do this
i like to call it out because it's so
powerful i would
agree and amplify so i would say
yes there is systemic racism
it's a big problem all right so imagine
me being bill barr and i'm saying this
yeah systemic racism is a big big
problem now all the people on the left
just said what what
did you just agree that systemic racism
is a gigantic problem
what you have my attention now all right
so that's the first part
first part of persuasion is you got to
get their attention
so you agree that's also persuasion
pacing
systemic racism big problem let me tell
you where it's
not a big problem is in the government
we do that pretty well
could do it better certainly could fix
some things about the police we'd like
to do that
but mostly the government has done quite
a good job over the years
let me tell you where there's systemic
racism man
it's bad and if there's any way we could
help we'd sure like to
it has to do with the teachers unions
if you fix the teachers unions you get
yourself better schools better choice
and then everybody's in better shape to
cut through
whatever discrimination there still is
you
can't get rid of it all we're just not
that kind of species
we can try we can have it as a goal we
can fight like heck
to get rid of racism everywhere we find
it and i'm dedicated to doing that
but let's be honest sometimes you have
to cut through it
and a good education will let you slice
through it
in a way that maybe if you didn't have
an education you just walk into the wall
so that's what i would do i would agree
that that
systemic racism exists i would amplify
it
i would move it over to the teachers
union and say how can i help
that's how i do it all right
um but barr does say about black lives
matter
he says that they're they're not
interested in black lives they're
interested in props
that's pretty direct i don't know that
i'm trying to remember when the switch
came
wasn't there a point when no republican
would have said out loud
that black lives matter the organization
is
bad or a problem wouldn't you say i i
feel as if you didn't see
you know major political figures
of any kind going against black lives
matter the organization now of course
everybody agrees with
the concept of black lives matter and
i've i've literally
never had anybody argue that but
it's interesting that he can go right at
it now and i think that's a result
of the protest etc i think black lives
matter has completely destroyed its
um its brand its reputation and its
its good will so the point where people
like me can just say
no it's a it's not even helping black
people
in fact i would say that black lives
matter is one of the
biggest problems for black america
because they're doing the wrong things
and just making people mad
when they could have easily done the
right things and made people happy
all people not just sometimes people
all right um and then bar was also
pointing out that
increasingly the message of the
democrats is that
uh no biden no peace he said biden or no
peace but i like
using it as a slogan no biden no peace
it's pretty obvious that it's it's
turned into a black male situation
no biden no peace now interestingly
president trump has said that he was
going to quote
put down any riots after the election
how do you like that phrase put down
trump said he would put down any riots
put down is a is an interesting choice
of words
because it sounds like kill you know if
you put down your dog
you're killing it so he's going to put
down the protests
that's a pretty aggressive word without
being an aggressive word
there's a report today that i guess
some officials around the white house
were asking about getting a
a heat ray that makes uh i guess it
makes protesters skin the heat up
so you can you can keep protesters at
bay
with this heat gun and i guess it exists
and some of the law enforcement people
were looking for them
and trying to find if there were any
available for the the protests
but i think there's a bigger there's a
bigger question here
i feel like we need a lot of different
non-lethal force situations
it just feels like shooting people isn't
just going to work anymore
we just need something that knocks
somebody out immediately
is there no such thing as a
spray you can put on somebody that just
knocks them out
we don't have anything like that i feel
like we should do a lot more work on
non-lethal
stuff so the
the retailer h m decided to
cut ties with chinese suppliers the ones
that come from the province where the
uyghurs are in the prison camps so
one by one you're seeing american and
other companies
pull away from china because the
the trump administration is putting a
lot of pressure on the uyghur situation
and that's pretty pretty darn
effective um it looks like it's going to
be death by a thousand cuts for china as
company after company after company just
sort of slowly pulls out or decouples
china's got some big problems coming i
don't know if they know it
um i feel as though
there there is a creeping change
happening
that because it's not sudden doesn't
become news
something becomes news if there's a
sudden change and it's
noteworthy but if something just
gradually
one percent a year goes up eventually it
could be a big change but it takes so
long it never becomes
news it's just what's happening and
i think that's happening with the
protests meaning that i think
law enforcement is increasing
at this point in most places they're
starting to increase the penalties
and increasing the law enforcement let's
say
how much energy they're putting into it
but because they didn't ramp it up all
at once they're just sort of
turning it up a little bit it's like hey
yesterday we
we arrested nine people today
11 people tomorrow 14 people
eventually you're going to get most of
the dangerous people
and if you don't let them out which has
been the big problem you actually keep
them in and charge them with serious
stuff
and i think bar was talking about
actually sedition
you know actually sedition that's pretty
serious
so i think that's happening except maybe
in minneapolis where the police have
decided that they don't want to be
police anymore
you know if you were the police in
minneapolis would you risk your life
for the city that just screwed you
you'd like to think they would just
because they're good people
but again human motivation
how did the democrats in minneapolis
what did they think would happen when
they took a gigantic dump on the heads
of their own police force
what what possibly could they have
predicted
that might have happened by having fewer
police doing their job
and getting crapped on by their own
people instead of helping to do what
they were meant to do which is to stop
crime
who could ever predict where that would
go
it's very consistent right democrats
don't seem to be able to predict
all right i would there's
some guy who got picked up arrested for
being one of the
laser pointer people who tried to blind
a police officer
i think he did actually blind a police
officer
and i'd like to i've said this a number
of times but i'm just going to keep
saying it until it sinks in
the penalty for blinding a police
officer intentionally
premeditated you know you bring the
thing to an event
for the express purpose of blinding a
police officer
that should be the death penalty does
anybody disagree
now you can disagree maybe if you just
have a an opinion
that there should never be a death
penalty but if anything can be a death
penalty
that needs to be one because
it's too easy to get away with
apparently i mean they've caught some of
them but
it must be easy to get away with and if
something's easy to get away with and is
that dangerous
and that destabilizing to the system
because we do need police
i feel like i feel as though the death
penalty would be appropriate
anybody else do you think that death
penalty would be appropriate for
laser pointer people blinding police
officers remember this is permanent
blindness
permanent blindness and it could be in
both eyes
yeah anyway i'll keep pushing on that
um cnn
um had an article that was unusually
good
i know you don't expect me to say this
but
ross garber who has several
descriptors he's i guess he's
investigative
legal writer person so he knows what
he's talking about i don't know if he's
a lawyer
but he's an investigative legal
person and he wrote a very
helpful article about what will happen
if
uh the election is not settled in the
time that it should be settled
in other words if we don't have a vote
that the public and all of our
all of our officials agree is the result
what do you do now do you know
do you know what happens if we don't get
a result
because i feel like we need to be taught
that and it's really important
because just in terms of the psychology
of the country
if you had a month to prepare for what
it's going to look like
then when it looks like that or even if
it looks like some form of that
you're going to say okay that's what i
expected and this is the way it will go
and this is the way it will be decided
that is very
stabilizing but if we just hit
hit a brick wall of uh oh we didn't get
a result and we're not sure when we'll
have a result
and the country doesn't quite know what
what to do with that
the public is going to think well i
guess we have to have a riot or
something
because they wouldn't know what the
process is it is
critically important critically
important
to the point of preventing a violent
revolution in the country or at least
lots of bloodshed
to inform the public what is the process
and hopefully and on cnn i'll give them
credit for this
ross garber did a very clear
unbiased just you know description of
what the process would be
i don't think i understand it totally
but let me give you some highlights
if if a number of things happen that the
delegates cannot decide the electoral
college folks
if they can't decide who their vote
should go to
let's say the situation is one candidate
won on by the deadline but there were
extra votes coming in
so people said hey i think we're going
to still give it to the person who got
the most
votes even if they came on came in after
the deadline
and then other people would say hey you
can't do that it's after the deadline
so you'd have this situation where you
couldn't trust
the electoral votes because they
wouldn't even be playing the same game
you wouldn't have a system so what do
you do at some point it goes to congress
and here's where it gets weird so
congress would pick the pres
the house would pick the president and
then it's really weird
the senate would pick the vice president
but they don't vote the way they
normally vote which would be a democrat
majority in house rather i think they
get one vote for state
or it's based on the legislators in the
state or something
but the current situation is that if
votes went along party lines
even though the house is controlled by
the democrats the weird way that the law
is written
there would be more republican votes
so trump would get elected by the house
even though it's democrat the house
would have to elect him because the
there would be so many uh so many
republicans who would vote for him
but here it gets weird the senate
could pick kamala harris you could
actually end up with president trump
vice president kamala harris
that's real and
not entirely unlikely
is that crazy how many of you knew
that we could end up like actually end
up
with a president trump and a vice
president kamala harris
did you think that was even a thing i
didn't know that was a thing until
literally this morning
so thank you ross garber i tweeted
his article if you want to see that it's
worth looking at
here's what we need we need a one-page
tweet
that has if this happens we do this
but if then this happens we do this and
if this happens we do this
we need an if then so it's a one-pager
that anybody can look at go okay okay
all right it's election night all right
we're here
all right if we don't have a result okay
i followed it over and now we're here
all right we don't have a result
we wait till this deadline okay if this
deadline passes
then we go to this body so we should be
able to follow it just like we're
following a
subway map so there's just no
doubt that the process is working that's
very important
you have to you have to convince the
public that there is a process
it's a process that's working it does
have an end
it will get a result might not be the
one you want but that's
how every election works very important
all right um let's see what else we got
going on here uh
the academy of country music awards
they decided that they would have two
winners for their
uh i guess what entertainer of the year
or something
and they picked uh carrie underwood and
thomas rhett for entertainer of the year
co-co
winners any problem with that do you see
any problem with that
they couldn't decide or i guess the vote
was tie
so they just picked two winners that's
okay right
i mean who could complain about that
really
two excellent entertainers very
successful
very popular they took the vote it was a
tie who could possibly complain about a
tie
women because as you saw in the tweets
or you haven't seen but you could see
women said oh you can't give the woman
a prize by herself she has to share it
with a man
why can't the woman have her own prize
is there some reason a woman can't have
her own prize
has to be shared with a man now
here's what i say i've never heard of
thomas rhett
i'm not a music guy so i've never even
heard of this guy
but carrie underwood correct me if i'm
wrong
but she isn't just a good performer but
one of the best performers of
all time and it seems to me
that she has gotten quite a few
accolades in her life
all well deserved because if i did
mention it she's one of the best
performers
of all time so
i don't think she has anything to worry
about
i feel as though we have lost our
sense of balance in this country and
that artificial intelligence
is the reason in the old days it seemed
that
the way i thought of the democrats and
the republicans
and see if you agree with this is that
it was good that they were different
because you would have one side fighting
for one side the other side fighting to
the other side
but they they could be a little extreme
and so the sensible middle
was just a good place to be it's like
all right it's not perfectly left or
perfectly right
but we found something that works in the
middle and everybody have that same
model
oh yeah you know we'll we'll meet in the
middle
but i think ai
and the algorithms and the business
models
have of course made that no longer a
thing
that you don't even hold that in your
mind as
one of the options when was the last
time you thought in terms of a
compromise
or something in the middle it feels like
it's not a thing anymore
you either do the executive order or you
control both sides of the house and
the senate or it doesn't get done
you know the the few exceptions are some
things that you know
that nobody can disagree with but for
the big stuff
we don't have this sense of meaning in
the middle anymore it's not a thing
and i would argue that artificial
intelligence
has effectively uh weaponized us against
each other
and it is already a life force it is
alive
it reproduces it uses humans to create
more of itself
it has a mission which is to create more
of itself
and the best way the ai creates more of
itself
is how does ai reproduce
it reproduce it reproduces by
getting people to fight each other
the more humans are fighting each other
the more they're going to build more ai
let's say you were afraid of china
and what they would do with artificial
intelligence if you're afraid of what
china will do
in the future with artificial
intelligence what would you do
you would build more artificial
intelligence
so artificial intelligence has found a
way
to reproduce by scaring the pants out of
us
and just permanently so we'll be you
know forever scared
um here's let me let me give you a uh
a prediction if it's true
that what i'm saying is true that we're
already past the point of no return
and i believe that by the way that we're
past the point of no return
the machines already run civilization
not they're not sentient but they have
that
effect if that's true
you would see a point where humans don't
kill each other as much
or if they did they don't destroy entire
countries
in other words they might kill some poor
people in poor countries
but the only countries that would have
wars going forward
if ai is running everything is the only
way to be a war is if it's a country
that didn't have any ai and wasn't going
to get any
because it doesn't have any impact on
their reproduction
but if ai wants to reproduce it wants to
keep
china intact it wants russia intact the
united states intact
it doesn't want us destroying one
country or the other
because then it will be less ai it won't
reproduce as well
so that's a prediction if ai has already
taken over
and it has you won't see major countries
destroy each other
because it would destroy the ai but you
will see
you know maybe some smaller countries
destroyed
all right you won't know about that for
10 years
there was a great article in the new
york times
looking at what it is that makes one
country more successful than another in
coronavirus
that's kind of what you're waiting for
right
somebody says you're talking crazy again
back to the er
well here's the thing this isn't crazy
the ai has already taken over that's
real
and by the way have you ever heard me
say something that you didn't think was
true when you first heard it and then
later you
said oh damn it that is true
this is one of those it won't be long
before everybody's saying what i just
said
that the ai literally
no no joke already took over we don't
have to worry about it in the future
it already happened and here and here's
the result
um what was i going to say oh yeah new
york times is talking about
what makes coronavirus uh response
effective and not
and here was their bottom line they said
that uh masks are good
so massive good social distancing
closing businesses they're all okay
but the one that mattered is closing
borders
had you ever heard that before the
closing borders seem to be
quite reliably the one thing that really
really mattered
and if you could have um and i know this
is impossible but if you imagine
if if the world had said here's the deal
for three weeks nobody leaves their
county or zip code or
whatever country you're in whatever
group you just can't leave your little
area
for three weeks that's it but
you can do anything else you want you
can go to the store
you can do whatever you want you want
you just can't leave your area for three
weeks
now what would happen is that some areas
that had infection in it
would get pretty infected but it would
be a small area
because you have these you know states
or counties or whatever the
the grouping was and you'd say all right
but
we can do some contact tracing in this
little area just make sure you don't
leave
and then you could stamp out the areas
where it flared up until they got down
to zero
you can imagine that you would say all
right we found out that this county and
this county that are next to each other
they don't have any crohn virus so now
you can travel
between these two but this other one
it still still got a few so you can't do
any
so as soon as this one gets down to zero
then you open up that and then the three
of them can travel but not
not the other state so there's there's
an argument that you know maybe you
could have squashed this thing in
six weeks or something if you had done
that now of course the problem is you
can't
it's just too difficult to do but here's
the larger point
every time you think that uh
every time you think that you know what
leader did a good or bad job
you really don't you don't because we
can't even sort out what was the mask
what was the social distancing why is it
that the
the bars in what was it nashville or
something
the bars didn't seem to get as many
infections as people assumed they would
when they reopened
everything's just confusing
so to imagine that we know who could
have done a good job
is a mistake but i would say that
if you looked at the amount of travel
especially from outside the country
it's probably the number one thing do
you remember when singapore
was being held out as the model
everybody said hey
look at singapore singapore is doing it
right
they they got their infections down to
nothing
look at that singapore and then you know
what they did they opened their border
what happened when singapore opened
their border they got infected
it didn't do singapore any good to well
i suppose they kept their
hospitalizations down
but it didn't help them defeat the virus
because eventually they had to open
their border and other people
were infected so
um so the point is the
if if you had a way to study it how hard
was it to close the border
like how practical was it maybe for
singapore it was kind of practical
for the united states maybe not so
practical
we'll see all right
i i made a mistake yesterday of
listening to uh msnbc for a few minutes
now i usually watch cnn when i want to
get my anti-fox news you know
full picture and i usually don't watch
msnbc
because cnn captures all of the let's
say the
left-leaning perspective but msnbc
goes to a level that is just literally
crazy or stupid and i can't tell and
what it is is their entire act
the the entire time you're watching it's
people looking into the camera
and with complete seriousness telling
you they know the inner thoughts of
strangers
and it goes like this president trump
has never uh never laughed at a joke he
has no sense of humor
and first of all i'm thinking um he's
actually the funniest
president we've ever had baby abe
lincoln was pretty good
uh he does a stand-up comedy routine
at least once a week he's literally a
stand-up comedian
and and michael cohen's like he has no
sense of humor
i'm thinking uh are you seeing inside
his head somehow
i mean how does that work or uh they say
that he
doesn't care about something he doesn't
care about something
what how do you know what he doesn't
care about
these are just crazy you know
mind-reading
things so look for that it's fun
i think i was going to do a kind of an
event
where i just turn on msnbc or cnn but i
think msnbc is funnier
and i just do a a spotting thing
where i go mind reading okay that's
mind reading and that's mind reading
because there's nothing else there
all right um
what else we got did you see the weird
video of
newt gingrich appearing on harris
faulkner's show
on fox news yeah you're
you're asking for it so so newt gingrich
goes on
and he's being interviewed remotely by
harris faulkner
and somebody else was on
megan mccain or somebody it doesn't
matter to the story
and newt gingrich says that
basically george soros is funding
funding a lot of the trouble
specifically i think he mentioned
the funding of liberal prosecutors
and harris faulkner got really
awkward about it and kind of ended it
and said she didn't want to talk about
it and knew it was like
uh okay because i knew couldn't even
figure out what was going on
like he didn't he couldn't believe
that it was even happening and he didn't
know what was happening and i still
don't know what's happening
so i don't know what harris wagner was
thinking
i don't know if there are any network
instructions about what they can and
cannot say about george
soros but i will go back to my original
question
for how many years have i been doing
this
and saying can somebody give me some
evidence
of this george and soros accusation i'm
not saying it's
false i'm not saying it's true i'm
saying
why can't i see the evidence of this so
it could be that the reason that fox
doesn't want to put that accusation on
there
is that they can't find evidence of it
so it wouldn't be news perhaps and it
might look anti-semitic or something
because it's not news it would look
anti-semitic so i think that's what's
going on
i think that they don't have a direct
smoking gun
here's what does seem to be the case
it does seem to be the case that i don't
think anybody argues this
the soros funds a lot of progressive
entities
some of those entities take their total
budget and use
some portion of it who knows at what
portion
to do things that that
republicans don't like
that part's true right but
i don't know that george soros knows
what all these people he funds
are specifically doing i just don't know
that he knows
so it feels like there's
something sort of almost there but
i'm telling you i want to see it
there's there's no part of me who
doesn't want to see this
and i know you all see it right i'll bet
just about every one of the people
watching this is saying
you're pulling your hair out and you're
saying scott it's so obvious
it's the most well-known thing in the
world look at all my evidence
i haven't seen it i want to believe it
i'd be happy to believe it i mean i want
to in the sense that
if it's true i want to believe it but it
just feels
a little indirect that's all i'm saying
and i don't know if indirect should be
treated the same way
just don't know but if anybody wants to
educate me apparently this education
will not happen
on fox news um somebody says
dan bongino but does dan bongino have
original sources that he points to or is
he
talking at a high level i'll go look at
that he's a good source
that's just where i'm at at the moment
it doesn't mean i'm right
so i guess dr robert redfield
at the cdc got in a little disagreement
with the president
because redfield had said that
quote that masks are better than
vaccines
now when you say something like masks
are better than vaccines
that's a pretty loose statement it's
something you could disagree with
but you could also agree with it with
the same set of information
let me show you how here's how you can
disagree with it
are you freaking kidding me a vaccine
pretty much would end the problem
a mask as we've completely noticed
is not ending the problem how can you
say that the thing that would totally
end the problem
is not as good as the thing that we know
won't end the problem how in the world
could you say masks are better than
vaccines
so that's one way to look at it here's
the other way
where's your vaccine yeah
do your vaccine right now what's the
matter what's the matter why aren't you
doing your vaccine
vaccines are great right put it in your
arm oh oh
i get it it doesn't exist
so is a mask better than a vaccine that
doesn't exist
yeah yeah yeah it is and
did did redfield to say that the vaccine
doesn't exist
pretty much pretty much because he said
that
in his opinion it would be second or
third quarter before the general public
was protected by the vaccine
now if you had to wait to the second or
third quarter
that's a lot of pandemic between now and
the second and third quarter
so it does i i would
support what he said in the sense that
if all you have is a mask
between september and let's say june
all you have is a mask that's it you
don't have a vaccine
if all you have is a mask it's better
than the vaccine you don't have
so in a sense if he was right about how
long it would take to get the vaccine
then he's right now the other thing is
this whole question about
who gets the vaccine and how fast and i
think trump was
doing his usual optimism thing so i
think his
his uh let's say his
scientific accuracy may have
uh given way to his optimism and how
he'd like to
manage not only the election if we're
being honest
you know he wants the election to go his
way but also
to manage the attitude of the people and
and to get us in the right frame of mind
to
you know open the country and get on
with work
i i think that the president has a a
reasonable argument
that he could get something done way
faster than
everybody else says now here's the
here's the thing
if you had not watched trump
do things that you knew and all the
experts said were impossible
one after another if you had not watched
four years of him doing impossible
things
and then he said i'm going to get you
this vaccine before election day and you
know we'll have a lot of them by the end
of the year
well that wouldn't sound real would it
wouldn't that sound just
ridiculous wouldn't you take the head of
the cdc
over trump who can be you know
can be a little optimistic bit of a
cheerleader
whereas the cdc guy is just trying to
give you the best information he can
wouldn't you take the cdc over trump
except except
trump continues to do things that are
not possible
this is a special case isn't it so when
i watched
trump make that claim i saw somebody who
was actually
in the drug trial so there's somebody
who's actually taking the vaccine
already but in
a trial sense and says that according to
their own schedule
the president has no chance of getting
this done because she knows what the
schedule is
internally and she goes now that it's
not possible to have a vaccine
for months and months but is she right
is she right i don't know i would keep
an open mind it's possible that the
president could pull this off
but i wouldn't guarantee it i think
maybe that's a little more
optimism but the other thing is
let's say you've got let's just think
about the math list let's say the whole
country was
just a hundred people all right we'll
just simplify it there's only 100 people
in the whole country
and you can only get a few vaccines so
you give them to
the top two percent of people who would
be at risk
because that's all you have it takes you
a while to make the vaccine if you could
get the top two percent
the ones that were most most at risk
maybe the ones who are in areas
that you know you knew there would be
exposure etc
that two percent would have a much
bigger impact
than two percent so it might be two
percent of the vaccine gets you
i don't know 40 of the benefit 20
i don't know what it is but that last
you know the last bit isn't going to be
as important as the first bit
so it's really hard to know exactly how
quickly this would roll out but there's
room for optimism especially if the
death rate keeps coming down while we're
waiting for that
scientific america the scientific
american the magazine
has decided for the first time in 175
years to endorse a presidential
candidate
and they're going to endorse or they
have endorsed biden
because they think that trump is
anti-science
now here's what's funny about this
scientific american
apparently doesn't know science
because you know what else is science
confirmation bias
psychology cognitive dissonance
that's science too so how do the
scientists know they're doing science
and they're not doing confirmation bias
did they do science to find out that
their opinion is
objective or did they
do you think the scientific americans
said hey
we we all agree and apparently it was
unanimous they said we all agree
that trump would be the unscientific
president so we're gonna we're gonna do
that
do you think when they agreed that they
said but wait
we're scientists and since we're
scientists we also know
that we could be susceptible to
confirmation bias without knowing it
and cognitive dissonance without knowing
it because that's what it is
it's the very fact that you don't know
it
is what gives it its name so
did they then say we better we better do
a scientific test
to find out if we're biased if we can
or to find out if we're actually just
you know scientifically
smart i don't think they did that do you
no so they used a completely
non-scientific
method i mean deeply non-scientific
because if you and i looked at them you
would say to yourself
it just looks like democrats to me it
just looks like democrats
that's it do you think there are many
republicans in the group
did anybody ask did anybody ask
if the board of the scientific american
magazine
had any republicans on the board no
nobody asked that nobody asked that
question
and do you think that that would have
mattered yes
yes that would have mattered do you know
why
because science is now subjective
now not completely if you're building a
rocket ship if you're elon musk
science is very objective you know you
got to get it right or you're not going
to end up on mars
but for most of this is social stuff and
even
climate change and you know energy and
you know forest fires and all of this
stuff none of this is science
none of this is science because the
scientific
loop has been corrupted here's the loop
science makes a study they put it on
cnn cnn interprets it a certain way and
they say
that's a good study that's good and
anybody who disagrees with this is a bad
person
okay so now cnn has told the public what
to think
they've they've programmed their minds
some of the public are scientists
so the scientists are watching the news
too they watch the news and the news
says okay cnn says
that all the good people the people who
are worthwhile
they all agree with the same scientific
view
so now i'm going to go do i'm going to
go get a grant
and go work on something am i going to
work on something that cnn says
is only bad people work on or am i going
to work on something that only good
people work on
so you see where i'm going here as long
as the fake news is in the middle of the
loop
well you can't be in the middle of a
loop yeah you can be in the middle of
shut up scott
stop talking i might have had some brain
damage after all
but because there's this feedback loop
between
science and the fake news the fake news
is destroying science science doesn't
have a freaking chance
science is a victim to the fake news
because once the fake news has primed
them with enough
they don't have an option of doing real
science because if they did they'd get
fired
so does scientific american know
that real science doesn't exist if it's
also something in the public
if it's just sciencey and nobody's
looking at it but scientists
that probably works out pretty well but
as soon as the public gets in there
hey what about our forest fires in
california
sorry goodbye science now we're going to
say it's climate change
that's not science i mean there might be
some climate change that has an impact
but by far the forest management is the
the bigger issue
etc and obviously nuclear energy would
be the
the only thing you would do if you were
trying to
fix climate change and you were serious
about it you really meant it
there's only one solution that we know
of it's
it's nuclear energy so the the people
who
purport to be the keepers of science
scientific american
they could not have been less scientific
about this
until to the point where parity and
reality
have have merged
all right um
oh man the the harris biden campaign is
just making me
uh laugh every day the
the fact um
somebody's telling me that i had
migraine not brain damage
i'm hoping that's the case i think it
was a migraine that would be my guess as
well
um i've never had a migraine though if
that matters that would have been my
first one if it was
so the fact that that on two occasions
uh first kamala harris and then joe
biden
referred to the campaign as the harris
biden campaign
that is just so obviously telling us
what's happening here
that it's funny to watch democrats
pretend it's not the case
i guess i didn't have much more to say
about that
[Applause]
real scientists are skeptical about
everything somebody says
uh i'm just looking at your comments now
and then i'll
go back to what i was doing
hydro is good hydro is kind of difficult
because you can't build a hydro plant
wherever you want to
um press f if you round on the vax
so my here's my take on the vaccination
so it's going to be
it'll be really interesting my take is i
will not make the decision
until right right at the last moment
so i'll probably have months and months
you know before i'm
eligible for the shot and i'll
collect as much information as i can it
would be it would be foolish to decide
today whether you'll take the
vaccination
later you should decide that day
that's the day you should decide is the
day you take it if you take it
um
somebody said walk it off that's funny
because that's
exactly what i'm going to do i'm going
to take long walks and walk it off
an ocular migraine i knew that somebody
here would be better than my doctor
there's something called an ocular
migraine i'll bet if i look that up
that's exactly what i had
i'm gonna write that down ocular
migraine all right thank you i think
you've solved all my medical problems
that's all for now
i will talk to you oh yes somebody
just prompted me here before i go
dershowitz is suing cnn
for taking him out of context suing him
for 300 million dollars
now if you were cnn would you like to
see
alan dershowitz coming at you with a 300
million
lawsuit that apparently is
moronically easy to prove because it's
all public
you know cnn their news
is there for everybody to see so all all
alan dershowitz
has to do is say all right ladies and
gentlemen of the jury
could you read this okay just read that
and then here's what i actually said
okay now read that are these the same
and you can see how this one makes me
look like a jerk
whereas the thing i actually said just
have to smart you see that right
that should be the end of the the whole
trial so i would not want to be on the
other side of alan dershowitz in the
court
that's all for now i'll talk to you
tomorrow
