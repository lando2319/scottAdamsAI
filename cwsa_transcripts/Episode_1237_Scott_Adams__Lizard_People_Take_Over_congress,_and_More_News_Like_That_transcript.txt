oh
hey i didn't see you there
happy new year it's time
it's time for the final coffee with
scott adams of 2020 the worst year in
the history of years
how about a little 2021 as i saw on a
humorous
sign you think 2020 was bad
wait till 2020 becomes 20 21 and they
can drink
yeah i didn't make that up but it's
funny oh i'm a little bit late
just a little bit well if you'd like to
enjoy this episode of coffee with scott
adams the thing
you need the most is a copper mugger
glass a tanker shells or steiner candy
jogger flask
a vessel of any kind filling with your
favorite liquid i like
coffee join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine hit of the day
a toast to the worst year
of all years 2020. are we ready for this
one to be done
yeah we are let's drink to that go
ah well new year's eve is a terrific
uh terrific holiday
for people who like alcohol and like
gathering in
large groups during a pandemic i don't
like either of those things
so it won't be a big night for me i'll
probably go to bed at 8 30.
[Laughter]
so you want to talk about the news okay
let's talk about illeria baldwin
alec baldwin's wife now
i want to tell you if you want to know
what bad
luck looks like bad luck
is when you have a personal scandal if
you can call it a scandal it's more like
a curiosity
during a slow news period oh
my god poor baldwins
uh the the story itself if you know is
that uh
allie baldwin's wife the yoga teacher
illeria baldwin was
actually born her name was hillary and
apparently she'd been telling people
that she was
born grew up in spain and she was
spanish but
turns out that's not quite it she was
born and born in massachusetts
and grew up there but her parents have
some travel
and you know they have some connection
to spain
and i think she's probably bilingual so
that counts
but here's the thing in terms of how
much
you and i should care about this story
the answer is
zero right zero it doesn't have any
effect on you
now of course uh alec baldwin was quite
public in his political opinions about
the president
so it feels like it feels like it's fair
to say things about alec baldwin
but it's not really fair to say things
about alec baldwin's
wife because correct me if i'm wrong but
i don't remember her
becoming a political figure i mean she's
a public figure
because she does some things on
instagram etc but she's not a political
figure
i say leave her alone that's my take
i'm no fan of alec baldwin's political
stuff
but i'm a huge fan of his work you know
his actual talent as an actor
especially a comedic actor it's sort of
unparalleled he's he's a tremendous
talent
but of course he's he was obnoxious to
many of us during the political
uh thing i i feel sorry for him and i
don't have any problem
really i mean it's not my problem it's
not even a problem at all
if uh if eleria wanted to
reinvent herself i don't really have a
problem with that at all
now i have a little history with that
myself
i have on occasion
maybe reinvented myself i'm not going to
say that's never
happened and did it hurt me
no did it hurt anybody else if i
reinvented myself
no not really now in my case
it was more of a minor case i used to
work in
in a resort a summer resort near where i
lived
and so during the the school year i
would be one person
basically a nerd so
who i would be in terms of
reputationally
would be the guy who got good grades and
so i'd be sort of a nerd
you know that kind of a character so
that's who i would be all during the
school year and then the summer would
come
and i would go to work with a bunch of
people who didn't know me at all
it was a bunch of strangers from other
towns who came in and we all worked at
this resort
and so i would be a brand new person
every summer
and in the summer i would be an athlete
so i would just be a different person so
i'd play four or five sports a day
usually at the resort during breaks and
lunch and after work
and nobody would be aware that i had
any academic qualifications because i
was not
using them in any way but they'd be very
aware that i was the one saying hey
let's start a
soccer game or you know let's let's do
pick up size and play some softball or
something
so i would basically and quite
intentionally
reinvent myself every summer as not
being a nerd for a few months
and then i'd go back to being a nerd and
did i break any laws not really
it's not exactly the same situation of
course but i'm just saying that
i don't mind people reinventing
themselves even if they put a little
artifice on it you know a little bit of
a little bit of a shine you know
just buff it up a little bit remove the
scratches
it's okay with me so she got caught
that's the problem but that's the only
problem it doesn't bother us in any way
so i wish them well actually i don't
have any bad feelings about the baldwins
i hope that they get through it but what
bad luck to have this happen during the
slowest
the slowest news cycle of the entire
year and then ah
timing there was a i tweeted a
little piece about a 3d printed
e-assist bike now
the big part of the story is not that
you can 3d print
an object we know that and it's not even
that you could 3d print
a bicycle which is actually kind of
impressive
but at least what i could tell is that
they 3d printed
a better bicycle than regular bicycles
because it was a solid frame and really
super light with some materials
etc then they put an e-assist in it they
they put the batteries in the frame of
the bike
so you can you get the assist of the uh
the battery
and i'll tell you i keep saying this but
if you haven't tried one
you need to try one because if you're
thinking hey i don't want an e-bike
because i'm not going to get enough
exercise you just go further and you go
up
bigger hills it doesn't take away the
effort it just reduces
this was more fun so you go up bigger
hills you go faster or go longer
you'll all have one eventually so antifa
according to andy now
reporting antifa held a uh
soccer tournament
and they and their signs they said no
cleats
so i'm glad they're opposed to violence
no cleats
but when you see antifa forming a soccer
league
right right so as soon as as soon as
trump is out of office
anti-fog goes from a revolutionary force
to
hey did anybody bring a soccer ball
kind of a sudden transition apparently a
bunch of them
checked into the same hotel and then
when they went to check out they decided
that
all in mass they weren't going to pay so
they would just
use the hotel's services but not pay and
they said the
hotels should be paid by money that
comes from defunding the police
now they've obviously just turned into a
complete
joke from whatever they used to be which
was part joke
part political movement but if you just
based it on these two stories
they've devolved into a complete joke
and i think the problem is they don't
have anything to push against
because protesting against biden
just won't look the same it just won't
look the same
so we've got an organization
but we can't really do what we were
meant to do which is protest because
it's biden
how about soccer why not
um this would be another example
of why i say you should not be sad if
uh you replace one kind of president
that you really liked
with an entirely different kind of
person for a while
right we get to choose again later but
i feel as though you can't get
everything done with one president
there are some things that only a trump
can do
but then there are other things that
only a trump can't do
and getting rid of antifa might be one
of those things
don't know for sure but it feels like
one of those things
that trump would be the only person who
couldn't make it go away
because it was really in many ways it
was about him or
he gave the energy to it you might say
so sometimes you just need a biden
to you know sweep up clean up the broken
glass from the
private previous administration and
stuff and then you go back to a trump
or something like it or a different kind
of president but
i believe you should get rid of the myth
that having your preferred president
for you know 20 years in a row would be
a good thing
it never would be it never would be good
to have one president for a long time
no matter how good they were because you
just need that other personality to get
some kinds of stuff done
all right um
i was asking about vitamin d and whether
people
get their vitamin d levels checked when
they have a covid
uh diagnosis now outside of the study
you know doing a study but just as is it
is it routine
to check your vitamin d levels if you
have a positive coronavirus
uh diagnosis the answer is no
apparently that doesn't happen so
does this seem weird to you now it may
be that it's just a practical thing
it could be that you wouldn't do
anything differently because
i'm getting mixed messages about whether
giving people vitamin d once they've
been diagnosed
with covit works or it doesn't i've
heard both things
that it works or it doesn't it's
standard procedure or it isn't
can anybody confirm that because i've
heard confidently both
both things confidently that they always
use it because it works
and confidently that they don't use it
because it doesn't work
which one of those is true and why don't
i know that now
i mean it's a long time to be in this
pandemic for me not to know such a basic
thing about it
and i don't know why that's not obvious
to me
somebody says post hoc working not
really
yeah so here's the thing it can be true
that people who are low on vitamin d
have the worst outcomes
while it could also be true that if you
check into the hospital with covid
and they give you a bunch of vitamin d
it might not make that much difference
now that's the question maybe it does
maybe it doesn't i'm looking for a fact
check
but it wouldn't be inconsistent
necessarily
because it might be too late by that
point right just
the timing doesn't work so that could be
one thing um
but i got a big question about that just
because your vitamin d levels are low
that doesn't mean vitamin d is the
problem
it could be just an indicator of bad
health in general
it could be just a correlation yeah
so we got big questions on that but the
main thing is that we don't check
vitamin d
automatically somebody named
curt eichenwald who is a name
that i'm positive i should know who he
is but i don't
it's a name i've heard before and i know
that i feel as though
conservatives don't like him but i don't
know why so i don't know who he is
basically he's a
semi-famous person in the world of
politics but i have nothing i have
no information about him however he did
a tweet in which
he was saying that i guess some members
of his family have died from covid
and when he thinks about paraphrasing
here but when he thinks about the people
having a new year's eve party
which he believes would put people at
greater risk
he says that he confesses um that he has
thoughts of wishing they died a horrible
death
from covet the people who go to these
parties
with with the with the assumption
that they would be spreading it by going
to these parties
now there was a lot of pushback on him
saying he's a terrible person
and you know why can't people just live
their lives and
if you're afraid of the coronavirus you
can hide
while everybody else lives their lives
and i've heard the argument
and i don't disagree with it so i'm
seeing people
on social media imagine i have an
opinion i don't about lockdowns or no
lockdowns or whatever
um my opinion just so you've heard it
for the first time
is that of course we should have tried
it
if you're asking me should we have tried
lockdowns
yeah yeah because we didn't know
we thought it might save millions of
people maybe so
of course it was worth trying do we know
now
how well they work
not exactly but do you still think
as of today would you say that lockdowns
wouldn't at least
slow the number of people going into the
icus
i feel as if it would be hard to imagine
that social distancing doesn't work
at some level if all you're trying to do
is keep the icus from being
overwhelmed so my opinion is common
sense tells me it probably makes a big
difference
to the icu levels which is important
but that's different from saying we
should therefore necessarily
throw people's rights to be human beings
living in the world
away all right so there's a balance you
got to make some balance
so i think people you know need to do
what they can do etc but here's my take
if kurt eichenwald has had deaths in the
family
and he believes that other people acting
in what would
do some people look selfish and it might
kill other people
i don't have any problem with kurt
eichenwald using his other freedom
of speech he has the freedom of speech
and so he has every right to say that he
believes that people who do this
are worthy of a horrible death
i don't have any problem with that
opinion now
i'm not saying it's my opinion i'm just
saying it's a completely reasonable
opinion
expressed through his freedom of speech
so
i have no push back on this at all but i
also
i'm not telling you how to live your
life or lock down or not lock down
you'll figure that out i'm more of a
fatalist about this
you could tell people to lock down all
day long
but at some point it's just not going to
happen and we're we're probably at that
point right
so does it matter to argue
that people should or should not cheat
on the lockdown
it's a it's a useless argument people
will cheat on
the lockdown people will it's a hundred
percent guaranteed
now you've also not seen me doing the
old simple story about governor newsom
said we should stay home but then he
went to the french laundry an expensive
restaurant
do you know why i don't make fun of
politicians for
being hypocrites because we all are
they're just being exactly like you and
me
if the french laundry was open
then not only did governor newsom have
every right to go there but so did
everybody else who could afford it
anyway
pretty expensive but
newsom was just doing what everybody was
doing talking
talking good in public privately
cheating like crazy
right so when you say that the
politicians are all hypocrites
is true it's also not saying anything
because it's just saying they're people
did we have an option
of electing a non-person no
no now if if gavin newsom had
forced a restaurant to open during the
coronavirus so he could go to a
restaurant i'd say whoa
you're not playing by the same rules but
if he
literally played by the same rules a
restaurant is open
you can go to it you know why you can go
to it
because it's open the government said
you could
so if the government said he could go to
that restaurant and he went to that
restaurant
i don't care that he told other people
to stay home because it's what
everybody's doing
they're all cheating like crazy i don't
know anybody who's not cheating
honestly i don't so
i'm not going to go hard on those guys
for having an opinion and doing what
everybody's doing
um here's some brainwashing
i was listening to somebody on twitter
saying that trump didn't get
re-elected because of his bad handling
of the coronavirus and then i asked for
examples
what would be an example of trump's
bad handling of the coronavirus now what
the interesting thing here
is that most people who believe
um somebody says restaurants were open
to others
are you telling me that the french
laundry was illegally opened
i don't think that was that was not the
case
nobody saying the french laundry was
illegally opened
um here's a brainwashing name one thing
that trump did wrong
on the coronavirus because the the fake
news
has gotten away with a great
brainwashing
framing they basically framed it in a
way that you're believing
which is that the problem was trump not
the way they reported on trump
for example did the public trust
trump after the news inaccurately said
he had
thought about drinking bleach for the
coronavirus
now that never happened it was fake news
but what did the public think of
trump and his scientific opinions after
that
okay how about trump wanted to open the
schools
uh earlier than a lot of the experts was
he right or wrong
i think time has shown that he was right
the one
so so the times that trump disagreed
with the experts
are on opening schools and he was right
because the experts have now come to his
opinion
he wanted to close the uh the borders to
travel from china
now you could argue that he didn't close
enough or fast enough
whatever but it's true that the experts
were still staying don't do that
so the two times we'd know he disagreed
with the experts
he was right um
the question was has trump ever
corrected his statement on the bleach
no he said he was joking because he just
wanted it to go away
um which was the wrong way to play it
was a big mistake in his part i would
say that was a huge mistake
persuasion-wise and every otherwise um
but now so what is it what is it that
trump did
a specific thing that his experts told
him not to do
that caused the problem now some say he
underplayed
the the the virus
but what did you do differently because
of that what happened
differently because he underplayed the
virus
can you think of anything was there
somebody who would have worn a mask and
didn't
i doubt it probably not do you believe
that if obama had been president will
just
pick him for as a as a democrat do you
believe if obama had told them
had told republicans to give up some of
their freedom
and wear a mask because it's good for
the collective
do you think the republicans would have
said oh okay
yeah that democrat president obama
wants to take our rights away and make
us wear mass
so yeah i'm okay with that if you think
about it
trump probably got more cooperation from
conservatives
simply be by being closer to their
starting point of view
which is a little skepticism right so by
being closer to the point of view of the
people who needed to be persuaded he
probably did the best job anybody could
have done
of persuading republicans to at least
wear masks in public
right now you could argue whether the
mask work or not
i take it still as a risk management
decision
which is there's good enough reason to
think it might that you still ought to
put a lot of effort into it all right
so so give me one example that's not a
problem that the press
created that was something trump did
and it has to have this quality has to
be disagreed with the experts
and also was wrong because we have two
two situations where he disagreed with
the experts
and he was right and the experts were
wrong give me one example
where trump disagreed with the experts
and then was wrong
i don't know of any do you and yet
half of the country maybe more maybe 60
percent of the country 70 percent of the
country maybe more
has been convinced by the press that
trump not only did a bad job but it was
a total disaster
somebody's saying masks but there's no
mask
in consistency with trump because trump
has always said
when when the expert said no masks he
agreed with him
and you can't you can't fault him for
agreeing with the experts right
even if he's wrong agreeing with the
experts isn't
a mistake then when it
when the experts changed and said yeah
those masks are actually important wear
some masks
trump what did trump say
he said yeah listen to the experts wear
your masks
when they tell you to wear a mask i
don't feel like he caused anybody to not
wear a mask
at all now i see in the comments i'm
being prompted for
the rapid testing thing i personally
have a gigantic gigantic criticism
with the trump administration's handling
of testing
not talking about the contact
testing tracing i think that got away
from us too fast
once it becomes too big he can't do the
contact tracing
so i don't have a i don't have enough
knowledge to criticize about whether we
could have done that i just think
not i think the united states was going
to get infected no matter what probably
wouldn't have mattered
but when it comes to the rapid testing
and getting them
approved faster i feel as if that
problem is almost entirely
in the fda but since the boss is the
boss
that's trump has to take that criticism
if it turns out that the reason we
didn't get those rapid tests
are what it looks like it looks like
incompetence by the
somebody incompetence or somebody was
bought off in
the government so to if you're asking me
my criticism
it would be mostly about that with the
caveat
that my criticism could completely go
away if the government had ever simply
addressed it they just had to talk about
it in public
if even once president trump had shown
an understanding of the rapid testing
concept which is different than testing
if you think it's like testing but fast
you don't understand what it is
it's about cheap little tests that
aren't as accurate but if you do enough
of them you get a better result
so if trump had ever said look there's
this concept of rapid testing
we are looking into it but there's a
reason we can't do it and here's the
reason
i might agree my disagree might
understand it might not understand it
but i wouldn't feel like it was a
mistake
per se but the fact it wasn't addressed
and it was such a big issue in the
public at least on social media
that was a mistake that was a clear
mistake but here's my point if you ask
a democrat to list trump's mistakes
they'll say wow there's so many of them
but that one won't be on the list
the only one that i would consider a
very reasonable criticism
won't even be on the democrats radar
because why because the news didn't
cover the issue the issue
i think you know ended up being in
conservative
twitter and kind of just died there
right
so i don't even think they've ever heard
of that issue so
they are brainwashed to believe that
trump did a bad job and the one thing he
actually
might have done a bad job and even
that's a question mark
they don't even know about it so there's
your situation
uh it looks like there'll be 30
there seven hundred was forty
coveted fatalities yesterday
uh we'll probably hit the five thousand
mark in a few weeks i
guess five thousand per day
and even today somebody said it's an
ordinary illness and we should not be
concerned about it
does that is there anybody in the
comments are any of you still saying
that covent is just like the flu
anybody does anybody still think that
let me just see in the the comments
so so yeah so i'm seeing lots of people
who are saying
uh it's an ordinary illness
it's amazing you know there was a time
when i think that was a
reasonable skepticism it's not one i
ever bought into
so i've never been on the on the side
that hey it's just the regular flu
but there was a time when a reasonable
person could have thought that
this is not that time we are
so far past that time it is so
unambiguously obvious that this is
way bigger than a normal illness and
it's what's different about it is it
looks like you could do something about
it
that you know that would be keep it to a
short-term situation
and people will make bad analogies
they'll say but scott
people drop people die from driving cars
right now the difference is that there
are situations that can't be
fixed in any way that we know about it
at least not
fully fixed so
driving cars is just dangerous
we don't know how to fix that and still
have a civilization
so anything that's sort of a permanent
situation
you can't compare to something that we
hoped we could you know knock it out in
six months it might take a year
but you can't compare any permanent
situation to a temporary situation you
should not
treat them the same all right
so on cnn they said election officials
from both parties have said that the
2020 election was one of the most
secure ever that's cnn
cnn is reporting that the 2020 election
was one of the most
secure ever do you accept that
does that sound like effect to you
i think so i i actually accept that fact
i believe that this that the 2020
election was
one of the most secure elections we've
ever had
any pushback on that does anybody
disagree
that 2020 was as far as we can tell
one of the most secure elections we've
ever had
i just want to see how badly you're
reacting to that
well here's the trick i assume that
they've all been corrupt
why wouldn't they be it's it's entirely
there's no conflict
there's no conflict at all in saying it
was the most secure election we've ever
had
and also it was nearly completely
unsecured
both could be true the most secure we've
election we've ever had might be 10
secure maybe it was you know maybe
that's the best we've ever done
but it wasn't secure it was just
no worse than we've ever done i would i
don't see any reason to believe that it
hasn't always been this way
you know maybe there's a little extra
cheating but there wasn't any extra lack
of security
um let's see this uh here's somebody
i just saw a random tweet somebody went
to a specific hospital last night
to see how busy it was and it was empty
again
hospital was empty i personally know
somebody locally
who works in a hospital that is not busy
in northern california so is a big old
uh there's a big old fraud that
coronavirus
is impacting the hospitals because i
told you there was this one guy who went
to one hospital that one time
right so that's pretty conclusive proof
and what about that other guy who went
to another hospital that one time and it
wasn't busy
well there's some solid evidence for you
and then i personally know
i personally know somebody who works at
a hospital and says it's not busy
in fact it's extremely not busy
so it's all a big lie about hospitals
being impacted right
no that's not how it works
it doesn't work that way nobody is
saying
all the hospitals are all busy nobody's
saying that
people are saying specifically that in
hot spots
the icus and the places that are you
know equipped to handle
covent patients that those are over
capacity
nobody's saying that in the town where
the the cove
infections are not that bad that those
hospitals are impacted
my my area has you know it's it's sort
of bad ish at the moment
but it's not the worst part of
california so if you're a regular
hospital
people do fewer elective surgeries of
course it's not busy
it's supposed to look like that and
don't wouldn't you assume by now also
that the cova patients are treated in
specific places at this point you know
and that those would have the capacity
problem
so i've heard that southern california
at least some
counties is at zero icu
excess capacity they're already at full
capacity so
that's the problem the problem is not
that there are a few maybe there are
even more hospitals that are
empty now you might say to yourself but
why can't you use those empty hospitals
and increase your capacity well
it's icus that matter and that's not so
easy
all right
um random twitter user justin bradshaw
was tweeting about
trump's narcissism and gave these
examples he said
in a tweet yeah remember trump getting
upset about not winning the nobel prize
or getting on the cover of time or more
recently melania not getting on the
cover of fashion magazines
all evidence of that exact narcissistic
trait is it
is it is this would you say that
trump creating peace in the middle east
and then not getting not winning the
nobel prize
do you think that's unfair i feel as
though the real issue here is how trump
is treated by the fake press and by the
fake award companies and everything else
isn't the issue more about how he's
treated
because i'm not trump
and i think he deserves the nobel peace
prize
can i be a narcissist on his behalf it
would be one thing if trump were the
only person in the world
who thought he should get a nobel peace
prize
that you could argue would be kind of
narcissistic
if nobody else thought he deserved a
nobel peace prize
but there are probably somewhere in the
neighborhood of a
billion or so people if you count other
countries
maybe a billion people think trump
should have won the nobel peace prize
let me say that again maybe a billion
a billion i don't think that's probably
an exaggeration right
in this country which is probably half
the country thinks he deserved a nobel
peace prize
so if you just take that into other
populations who are aware enough of
american politics
you might find a billion people who
agreed with them
now if a billion people agree with you
and you know you could
soften that too oh it's only 100 million
whatever it is
but if they agree with you i don't know
that that's a mental problem
because i see it too it's not he's not
imagining it
i see it um then the other example was
he wasn't didn't get the cover of time
basically it's exactly the same issue
and the other thing that people don't
quite realize about trump
is that before he was president he was a
branding
genius the the trump brand
became what it is not because he's rich
there are tons of billionaires you've
never heard of
his brand became what it is because he's
a brand
managing expert part of managing his
brand
is stuff such as getting on magazine
covers winning awards etc
it's just part of managing his brand of
course
he thinks he should have been on the
magazine uh most important person on
time magazine how many other people
think that too
millions millions and millions of people
think
he should have been time person of the
year millions
so i don't know how that can be a mental
problem on trump
when so many millions of people are
looking at the same stuff
and have the same opinion about him
all right
minneapolis police department shot a man
tonight
during a traffic stop so there's uh
he's alleged that he opened fire first
and then the minnesota police
killed him so that's the story they shot
a man
quote he was a man that's all you need
to know
is there anything else you need to know
about the the man
is there anything relevant to the story
and relevant to the national
conversation
that you'd sort of expect
out of a story about a place
that still stinging from a
george floyd situation i feel as if
there's one
extra piece of data that we would need
to know
but i can't think of it yeah his eye
color exactly how do we know his eye
color
i'm moving on so
the greatest failure of government in my
lifetime we just saw this week with the
the the covid stimulus bill
and i'm not even going to get into the
awkward
stupid details of what congress did and
who was on what side
and you know who used what trick to stop
this
or postpone that vote or whatever none
of it matters too much
i've never seen more incredible
incompetence
than congress this year i've never seen
anything like it
i was trying to think lots of times
people have made mistakes but i've never
seen
incompetence like this
i mean this is some serious incompetence
and you know i i tweeted uh
uh i tweeted that uh watching them work
is
uh watching congress work is like
watching a a bunch of
uh no i won't even say it on the live
stream you can read the tweet
it's x-rated
and when i look at this
i have i have just hatred for them
but here's a little uh thing that'll
ruin you forever have you ever noticed
that uh i don't know maybe this is only
me but have you ever known somebody for
a while
and then suddenly one day you saw their
animal
now here's what i mean by that i once
dated a woman a thousand years ago
who i once saw
just a fleeting moment i looked at her
face
and i saw another animal now
i don't mean she looked like that animal
i mean it reminded me in a way
that i could never unsee and from that
moment on
she looked more like that animal than
like a person to me
once it was in my head so once you see
the animal
you can't unsee it and the democrats
have
two politicians that strike me as
lizards
schumer is one somebody needs to tell
schumer to stop doing this with his
glasses
can somebody please talk to him and
maybe not talk
exactly like a lizard because when i see
him talk
this is what i see um president trump
he's a bad person
that's all i say i just see a lizard
person and it's even worse there's
another senator ron wyden
have you ever seen ron wyden he's a he's
quite an anti-trumper
when he talks i only see a giant lizard
like it's almost like his he's replaced
with a lizard
yep president trump
right you can see it as soon as i
mention it you can't see it any other
way right
so in my mind congress has just devolved
into
not even a human kind of a thing they
just look like monsters at this point
they don't look human because you'd
expect a human to give you a hand right
hey hey i'm starving to death the
coronavirus has
destroyed everything i have please
please
send me a check to help me
and what do the lizard people say
that's it that's it
so thanks a lot congress for being the
most worthless group of people i've ever
seen in my life um
there's a video going around i think
jack possabic was
tweeting it of jake tapper talking about
the president after one of the debates
and saying that the president was just
lying to the people
about a vaccine coming before the end of
the year
and jake was quite disturbed
by the president just lying
to the people you should have seen
jake's face he was upset
about this disgusting despicable
lie that a vaccine could be available by
the end of the year
disgusting now i wonder
what would happen if kennedy had been
doing his moonshot
speech during the
fake news era and let's say kennedy had
been a republican
how would jake tapper handle that news
when kennedy said he was going to put a
man on the moon
would jake tap or say he's just
lying to the people
he's just straight out lying there's not
going to be any
man on the moon
how do the people put up with this lying
disgusting all right
josh hawley senator hawley uh he's going
to join with representative mo brooks
and they're going to
uh they're going to force a debate
on the electoral college electors from
at least
one state so will that change the
result of the election the smart people
are saying no
it won't change the election because
it'll just be a delay
and a debate and then they'll just go
back to doing what they're going to do
and some people have said that josh
hawley is
just positioning himself to run for
president
to which i say it's a pretty good job
if he's positioning himself to run for
president
and he's the only one who picked up the
free money
this is free money do you think that
josh
holy will pay any political price
for objecting to the the vote and he's
objecting based on
constitutional grounds you know
pennsylvania
uh ignored their own constitution when
they
changed the rules and so he's at least
using something that's not in dispute
it's not in dispute that they did what
they did
and it would be fair to say that that
shouldn't have happened right so it's a
at least he's sticking with observable
you know straight news he's not going
into the fraud allegations where it
would be a little dicier
so he gets for free he gets all the
support of the
trump loving people who say finally
finally we've got a you know a senator
who will back us
now by the way he's not the only
politician you've got you know your
matt gates you know some other notable
people are on the same side
and i'm saying that they're all doing
the same smart thing
so if you want to run for president and
you want trump supporters to
transfer their support to you this would
be the time to do it
so politically i would say
completely smart uh will it make any
difference probably not
but here's the question i have when they
go and debate
do they get to see evidence will the
public
get to see anything like a evidence
presented and then that evidence
challenged or does it happen behind
closed doors and there's no evidence
they just
they just talk to each other for two
hours and come back and vote is that all
so i'm not sure we're really going to
see
something like a unofficial trial in
public for the evidence i don't think
that's going to happen is it
because they only have two hours what
can you do in two hours anyway
it's not enough to really air out the
evidence
so i would say that holly
howly i forget how to pronounce his name
he made a good move
as as did matt gates and anybody who
wants to run for president
they'd be smart to do this as well as a
republican
um so
i also saw on cnn that trump and his
team have lost
um or actually this is from the new york
times they've lost
59 of the 60 election cases they have
brought
how many of the 59 or well how many of
these 60 election cases they brought
uh got evaluated by a court based on the
evidence
is it still zero it's zero right
imagine if this news had been reported
oh let's say
i don't know let's pick a word
accurately
let's say it had been reported
accurately what would it sound like
here's the same news reported accurately
the courts have not heard a single case
in which the evidence for fraud has been
presented
isn't that true now if it's not true
it's only i blame the media for not
informing me because i watch a lot of
news
i don't know i've never heard of it so
is it true to say that they've lost 60
cases or would be true to say
that no case has been heard
no case has been heard on the evidence
uh so that's your fake news story of the
day i i had this amusing thought about
joe biden who apparently is lagging a
little bit in picking an attorney
general and i thought to myself
how does that conversation go if you're
a candidate for attorney general in a
biden administration
you probably have to meet with him i
assume he's not going to pick an
attorney general without actually
talking to the person first
how does that conversation go because
you know the only thing that matters to
biden is that
hunter gets off right because although
he's the president of the united states
he's also a human being
and a father and i do not fault him
the slightest if he puts his family
above me right only because it's
natural and it's biological and you know
you don't
you don't want it to happen but you
understand it right people put their
family first
you don't want to live in a country
where that doesn't happen
do you do you want to live in the
country where people don't put their
family first
not so much right that wouldn't be a
good place to live so
you i think biden can be forgiven
under the understanding that a father
asked to act like a father
can't turn it off right but what does
that do to the conversation when
a candidate comes into his office and
they're sitting in the oval office
and i'm imagining biden trying to ask
the question without asking the question
because it's the only thing he cares
about is what are you going to do about
hunter
and i imagine how he would ask that it's
like so
let me give you a hypothetical suppose
there was a crime or lots of them
and it was your job to let's say you
were in charge of
prosecuting that crime but let's say
and i'm just spitballing here this is
just a hypothetical
let's say if in the process of pursuing
that crime it caused other problems
we don't need to be specific but other
other related
problems and maybe that they were bigger
than whatever you were trying to solve
by this
let's say illegality that you're going
after how would you handle that
if doing your job caused a
really big problem in a unspecified
other way
what would you do about that
you you biden almost has to figure out a
way to ask the question without asking
the question
but maybe it's just understood and you
know if if his aides talk to the person
maybe he doesn't have to say anything
himself
all right i told you yesterday there was
a study that said that
the leadership variable didn't make much
difference in the coronavirus
outcome the study seemed
to indicate and here i'll tell you i'm
going to tell you in a moment it might
not be that credible
seemed to indicate that it didn't matter
what you did that your results were
going to be some
some mix of other factors and that the
lockdown no lockdown how fast you did it
that sort of thing maybe they were not
the big variables
but it took about two minutes for
andre's backhouse
who i always go to as my my go-to for
looking at
you know data statistics things and he
sort of
dismissed it out of hand as being
amateurishly
uh this is my words not his but
apparently they missed some big
concepts in statistics so
so you shouldn't make too much out of
that but
i asked the reverse question has there
been
any study that showed that
leadership did matter so we don't have a
study that shows leadership
uh was irrelevant so that we have a
study but it may not be that credible so
don't take it too seriously
but what we don't have is a credible
study that says oh yeah
the leadership decisions really made the
difference
it's kind of missing isn't it don't you
think by now
by now wouldn't you have seems kind of
obvious
wouldn't there be studies that say yeah
we've looked at all the variables and
there are a lot of variables that's the
problem too many variables
we've looked at all the variables and
yeah we can isolate
that 40 percent of your outcome was
because of leadership decisions
don't you think we should have that bad
now because we have enough
data all the data in the world exists i
don't know how you could not
determine that by now so the fact that
it doesn't exist
is uh is making me think that my
idea that you won't find a correlation
stronger and stronger because you see a
really strong correlation with the
islands
right so you got your hawaii's doing
better than a lot of the states you've
got new zealand's doing better than
you know places with similar cultures
you've got south korea doing better
effectively in ireland because of the
dmz et cetera
now i don't know if that correlation
will really hold it's just one that you
know the human mind
sees that pattern whether it's real or
not and
um oh somebody says but the the uk is
not
would the uk uh count
as an island
i don't know because the the the uk is
so connected to great britain
maybe more so uh the the island
analogy probably has more to do with the
uh
consistency of international travel and
and great britain is sort of a
a hub of international travel so
have they shut down travel faster maybe
so here's here's what i would say
when you have an outlier
we probably don't know why it's like it
is
and if we did we would be surprised i
think
so don't assume that leadership is the
thing but we also can't rule it out as
being the thing
um and that
is what i wanted to trump should
possibly
posthumously pardon john mccain that
would be
a good troll um
all right i'm just looking at your
comments for a moment uh are you all
going to
celebrate new year's eve today
great britain is calling now great
britain
you would have to say that might be one
case where
yeah i would say let me let me say this
you probably could distinguish
between the people who said let's go for
herd immunity
as great britain famously did versus
those who said let's
not run toward herd immunity so that
might be one that you could distinguish
but short of that i don't know that the
details about mass and lockdowns and
stuff are going to be the big difference
um
um you'll be celebrating dominion oh yes
so yesterday there was a video of some
expert
who was testifying about the security of
the dominion
voting machines and said that while he
was talking they were already in them
that was the greatest that was the
greatest subtle
thing i've ever heard it's like uh yes
not only
are these machines or at least some of
them connected to the internet and then
from there they're connected to the
other machines so not only is it
possible to hack these machines but
while i'm talking we're in them
i no i don't you didn't quite say it
exactly like that but that's what it
sounded like right
it sounded like you don't have to ask if
it's possible
i'm in it right now now if that's what
he said
because that's sort of how i heard it
but i feel like i could have
misinterpreted that
but if that is what he meant and what he
said that is so awesome
that's like that's like a moment for a
nerd
no nerd ever had a better moment than
i'd like to tell you that not only is it
possible to get into them
i'm in them right now i mean that's just
so cool
in a bad way i suppose he's in them now
do we live in a world in which an expert
can say
not only can i get in them but i am in
them
and i would have the power to change
votes with the access i already have
and he's an expert do you think that
that story
then becomes a national story which
changes everything
nope nope because i don't know if this
story
is true right you have to you have to
assume that any story like this
you got to put your skeptical hat and a
hat on and say
all right two days from now is this
still going to be true
it looked pretty credible when he said
it you know if you saw it it looked real
but that doesn't mean it's real
covington kids will
teach you that just because you saw it
just because he said it just because
he's an expert doesn't make any of it
true
you have to hear the other side before
you know anything
but suppose suppose it's true let's just
speculate what would happen suppose it
was just true
how would the news handle it
they will ignore it you know fox news
will run a couple stories and then
they'll ignore it too
and then the mainstream media will just
say look over here
and it won't make any difference so
we're we're way past
the point where discovering a crime
makes much difference
because the the gatekeepers of our
reality which is you know the news and
the politicians
will just act like it didn't happen
and they can simply act like it didn't
happen and just make that fact disappear
that's that's that's the reality we're
in right now that they have that power
and know they have the power they know
they can make
any story disappear so that one if it's
true
and i would i wouldn't give it more than
a 50 50 for being true
but if it's true it won't matter at all
they'll just make it disappear
all right is it worth voting
well if you don't vote then the cheating
competition which is really the basis of
our
system it's who can cheat the best
then it will make it easier for the
other side to cheat and win
so if you want to make it harder to
cheat voting makes a difference yes
so you have to you have to get it at
least close so that your side can
cheat enough to get over the edge
because the other side is trying to
cheat enough to get over the edge
um you'll never know
that's true will you unblock
timpool on twitter he's not blocked on
twitter i don't block him
um you don't vote
scott okay what's your point
not worth voting did you see pit on no i
did not i don't know what that is
pittan is that something i should see
but you don't vote why does that matter
i often see a lot of people just uh say
a fact
but a fact isn't an argument that's just
a fact
all right um no georgia prediction yeah
i'll make a georgia prediction
uh the democrats will steal that
election
that will be my prediction now if i had
to put odds on it
i wouldn't put it at a hundred percent
i'd say
let's say 70 chance
democrats will still steal it
uh and you know
70 chance that if it were not stolen
the republicans would win but
70 chance they will steal it and get
away with it
and get away with it 70
um january 6 prediction i don't know
that
fate will be changed on january 6. i
have do have a big question
as i said earlier about whether the
actual fraud evidence will be
presented in any form to the american
public
and by the way why doesn't trump just
set up some kind of a media event
where the strongest fraud evidence is
brought in and then a non-core setting
just present it all now ideally
you would want people representing the
opposite side to be there too
and just have like a little court-like
debate situation in which
you could see both sides uh
i'd like to see it you really are a
bitter man
says this person who will never have to
see me again
i now solved your problem boom
i'm like a doctor i'm like a doctor
um
[Music]
georgia prediction yeah
wrong wrong wrong
december 23rd white house staff were
told to stop packing up to leave
i doubt that that sounds like fake news
is linwood trustworthy is he a lawyer
he's a lawyer lawyers are advocates
advocates are not intended to
be credible advocates are meant to
get their side you know they want their
client to win they want
they want to have victory no you
shouldn't
uh if the democrats steal the election
they'll have enough power to avoid
consequences that's right
so if the democrats do steal the
election they can get away with it
because then they'll have all the power
there would be no
no counter to it at that point so the if
you if you use my theory
that you always have corruption under
these circumstances
which is that the upside potential is
really high
you're pretty sure you can get away with
it and you got a lot of people involved
so there's always somebody willing to
take that risk
that all exists beyond that
it's the biggest stakes that have ever
existed
because it would be full control of one
party
right now if that were to happen
they would be invulnerable from any kind
of prosecution they would just have too
much power
so uh they should under this condition
they should do everything they can to
steal this election
all of the the set up is such that it
would almost be irrational not to steal
it
wouldn't you say what would be the
reasoning not to steal it
okay let's say you're you're in charge
in some way
and you're some democratic operative
who's in charge
and your minions let's say
hypothetically
have brought to you a proposal of how
they can steal the election
and they say look we know we can win
this thing
we'll do fraud a fraud b fraud c
it'll be packetized so even if they
catch one of it it won't be enough
so here's our plan we can definitely
steal it
the odds of getting caught and going to
jail are
i hate to say it but as high as maybe 25
what does the democratic operative say
to that proposition
here's what he says clarify for me who
is it who goes to jail in this scenario
and the person said oh i didn't mean you
you wouldn't go to jail
because nobody knows we had this
conversation and you're not going to do
any of the fraud
you're just sort of approving it and you
know you'll deny it so there's no
evidence that
the only person would go to jail is the
actual person doing the fraud
the person double counting votes or
something like that
and then the top democratic operative
says i don't even know those people
are you telling me that i could have
total power
probably 75 chance
and i don't personally have any risk
because i'm not going to go to jail
and i'll just say i didn't know these
guys were frauding
so i have no risk but i could have total
power if this works out
25 chance it won't what do i say
go i say go because those are good odds
now what about the person who's actually
doing the crime
would you do a crime where you had a 25
chance of getting caught how many of you
would do a crime
where the beneficiary is mostly other
people
because you're not president you're just
the person messing with some ballots
maybe you get paid right but you're just
a person messing with ballots you don't
have a giant
upside to your life you've got a 25
chance of getting caught and going to
jail do you do the crime
well it doesn't matter how many of you
say no
it only matters there's one person who
says yes
for each individual fraud thing that
could happen
right you only need some people to say
yes you don't think you could get people
to do crime
when they have a 75 chance of getting
away with it
yeah a 75 chance of getting away with
crime
you would get massive numbers of people
who would agree to that
you wouldn't i wouldn't
probably almost nobody on this periscope
would
but there are a lot of them oh yeah it
wouldn't be hard at all
and part of it is they just would think
well that's
25 chance but not my specific situation
my specific situation i'm pretty sure
i'll get away with this
so yeah people would think they could
get away with it
the incentive is sky high
how could there not be massive attempt
at fraud
it doesn't even seem possible that it
could be an
honest election i don't see any
possibility to you
with that setup it just can't happen
so that's my prediction it will be
massive fraud it has to be really
um somebody said bomber pilots had a 25
loss rate but went anyway
all right there you go you can get
people to do things at those odds and
it's not that hard
would you tell us if you made a
political deal
i love that question i don't know
exactly what that means but do you mean
a political deal
as in somebody in politics would pay me
to say something
is that what you're talking about or are
you talking about somebody else making a
political deal
but to answer your question if i made a
secret political deal
i wouldn't tell you because it would be
a secret but i wouldn't make a political
deal like that because i don't need to
there's no upside for me if if i were to
double
my net worth
just wouldn't make much difference yeah
i'd still be sitting here at this time
of day
still be doing this still be wearing
this crappy t-shirt to bed
still be doing this in my pajamas it
wouldn't make much difference
so they could try to bribe me but i
don't i don't know why i would take that
it wouldn't feel right all right that's
all i got
and i will talk to you tomorrow
bye for now
