good morning everybody
wow
i don't know have you been getting extra
sleep or working out
why do you all look so good today
incredible
i know you get better looking dare i say
sexier every single time i see you
and that's no lie
if you'd like to get even sexier the
only thing you need is a copper mug or
glass a tanker chelsea's dying a canteen
jug or flask a vessel of any
that's right
kind fill it with your favorite liquid i
like
coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
it's the dope meaning of the day
it sounds like i'm talking dirty but i'm
talking about coffee
join me now for the
simultaneous go
oh shudder
i feel a quiver coming does anybody else
feel it it's coming on it's going to be
like a shiver
there it was
all right well i once again tried to
watch this tv show called star trek
discovery
a new series
and uh
i told you before this is an update on
what i've told you already
that a lot of the sci-fi has gone
extra woke
which is fine
because star trek was always uh the most
woke of the early sci-fi's it's one of
the things that made it
you know so big and so popular
everywhere basically every every every
person likes star trek you know every
demographic not every person
but with within every demographic you've
got star trek fans so they did a good
job with the whole inclusiveness before
that was a big deal
but
like any good idea
sometimes you can take it too far
yeah like the state farm commercials
so i watched the third episode and i
swear to god
i'm simply going to describe this
i'm going to describe this
oops
not now
alex not now
i'm going to describe it the way i saw
it but i'm going to describe the
characters in terms of their demographic
groups
so i'm just going to tell you the story
the way it unfolded
but instead of naming the characters by
their names i'll refer to them by the
demographic group they're in
so
the two the number one and number two
stars of the show
are adult white men
adult adult white men
which is weird because it's such a awoke
kind of thing
but the episode involved the
the adult white men uh being trapped in
a storm on a planet
uh
until they were rescued by some um
some entities
but the two white men who are the stars
of the show didn't have anything to do
with the show except they were trapped
on the planet
meanwhile
meanwhile
the women who were in charge of the
enterprise
of of various species
some were some were
well i don't know actually i'm not sure
if any were
meant to be earthlings but there there
were various creatures that were female
and look
and
they saved the day
they saved the day and it turns out that
when they figured out
once the women had saved the day
while the two men were huddled together
on the ground
on the planet
literally huddled together on the ground
on the planet not part of the plot at
all
and they discovered that there was
a tragic
dare i say mistake
you know there was
somebody on the crew who made a terrible
mistake and they'd identify it they
narrowed it down to the one black guy
so
so the one black guy made a mistake that
almost cost the entire crew
their lives
but uh he was he was spared
by the two women who were in charge
uh
because
because it was an honest mistake i guess
so
it must be torturous to try to write
plots
in 2022 or whenever they wrote it
because you really have to you have to
juggle all of these uh these things
so you're not accidentally insulting
some group
and how do you really do that
well part of this i'm responding to it
as a
writer as a creator
it is so hard
to write any kind of a story that people
want to hear
like you know there's a reason that
people who can do it well
are highly compensated it's rare it's
hard to do
but if you add on top of the burden of
writing a good story that you've got to
handle all of the characters with their
you know demographic sensitivities and
the audiences and you know please
everybody it almost eliminates
all of the space you can move
so it just makes your your art gets
smaller and smaller
and
uh and let me say again
uh i'll say this
a hundred times
i like all the woke stuff
right it's it's it's entirely the right
impulse
let everybody live their best life
you know
it's not my business what anybody does
and certainly you know i don't see any
any kind of pattern that would tell me
that any individual must conform to any
specific stereotype
so my personal feeling is that woke is
great and if somebody wants to be
referred to in some specific way
i just think that's good manners
i would want people to refer to me in
whatever way i felt most comfortable and
they already do
i mean except online
where everybody's awful
but but in person people generally refer
to being whatever i would be most
comfortable with so i i gladly returned
the favor the only thing i ever ask in
return
is if i get it wrong
just don't be an about it
that's all
like i i want to be polite i'll try my
best but if i get it wrong like you know
if i dead name somebody accidentally or
something just don't be an about
it
that's all i'm asking i'm asking what
you're asking of me i'll give back what
you what you're asking of me
that seems fair well here's an update on
my keith tactic
um some of you know i've been using this
tactic on my trolls online where when
they attacked me personally as opposed
to anything about what i said my
argument
i respond with
okay keith
now
my internal thought about why i'm saying
this is that i'm just mocking keith
olbermann
who
who for years has been coming after me
personally basically just personal
attacks on me and doesn't really have
much to do with anything i'm saying it
doesn't seem like it seems like it's
more personal
so
here's why this works
people don't know what to do with it
nobody has a mental model
for what happens when they attack you
personally and you call them by the
wrong name
they don't know what to do with it
it completely so far
i think it has defused a hundred percent
of what was about to become a troll
fight
you know because i i like getting sucked
into troll fights because it's just good
sparring
yeah i just like it so i do it more than
i should because i sort of enjoy it it's
part of the public spectacle of twitter
so yeah i'm all in on public spectacle
so
it's good eden
so just think about this from the
persuasion perspective there's there's
actually a basis for why this should
work exactly the way it's working
it should work because it takes people
out of their frame
when somebody insults you publicly on
twitter
they've entered a frame
in which they think you should feel
insulted and either ignore them or block
them or fight back with some you know
equally
toxic words
so so they get into this frame and then
you say
okay keith
and it's not even their name and they
don't know what the reference is or why
or where you're coming from
and they can't stay in their frame
because there's nothing in there that
tells you what to do with
uh thanks keith
now i suppose at some point it would be
like karen if it became big i don't
think it will but if it did
then people would recognize oh that's
karen but it would still work
until they had some way to bring it back
into their frame because it just doesn't
fit there
so try it try it at home just say okay
keith or you could throw in any other
name of somebody that you think is funny
but there's something about the word
keith
especially because it's so white
it's so white guy it's like one of the
whitest names you could ever have keith
why scottish i suppose scott is the
whitest name you could have look
let me let me confess that
yeah i don't think you can be
scott for a wider name
am i right
has anybody ever met anybody black named
scott is there a famous one
is there like a famous black man whose
first name is scott
that i'm not thinking of
scottie pippen thank you scottie pippen
scottie pippen
one of the all-time great basketball
players
all right um will smith
this is the weirdest story you thought
the will smith slapping chris rock story
lasted too long
but finally it was cut scott joplin
scott joplin is that uh
musician
okay so lots of lots of black people
named scott
apparently it's a very black name
and since i identify as a black woman
i believe that's at least one more
example
all right so you're right
so this will smith story
just released was an interview that
will smith did before he slapped chris
rock at the oscars and it was with david
letterman on his interview show there
and
will smith was talking about
an experience with
ayahuasca a psychedelic
in which he hallucinated that he
lost all of his money in his career his
career and his money just went away
and it was a nightmare and he panicked
but that the learning he got from it
was that there was anything he could
withstand
because he learned to be calm
while his career and even somebody he
loved was in danger his daughter willow
was screaming and he he managed in his
ayahuasca hallucination
to find calm
despite the worst possible things he's
imagining happening around him and then
he thought that his permanent learning
from that is that he could handle
anything
you know nothing would destroy him
now he had this vision of losing all of
that
right before
he slapped chris rock on stage and lost
all of that
now he's still going to be rich one
assumes
but you know for a while his career has
taken a pounding like few people have
ever taken a pounding
and
here is my first question number one
did he
in fact
survive this so far
in exactly the way he said he could
in other words did the ios ios actually
do what he imagined had done at that
point
did he carry that ability through
and weather this latest thing because
even though he's the one to blame
i think we all agree right he's the one
to blame and he would know that
one assumes
do you think that he
is okay with it do you think he just
took it like a you know zen buddhist
monk and just said well
you know clearly it was my mistake
i'm now dealing with it
and i accept this i'm dealing with it
i don't know
i'm gonna surprise you
i'm gonna surprise you
i'll bet he's handling this better than
99
of you could have
just it's just a feeling there's no way
to know right
but that ayahuasca experience i think
that's real
i think that's real
i believe that he actually did learn
that he could handle anything
that didn't make his mistake any less of
a mistake
but he certainly found himself in a
situation where he had to handle
something pretty pretty bad i mean
really bad
and i think he handled it
probably better than you could have
just to guess
i think it's probably real but what is
the the coincidence that he would have
this just before it mattered and again
this makes you wonder about the nature
of reality doesn't it
did he predict it
or did he cause it
did he predict it
did he cause it
or is it just a coincidence
because you know coincidences happen
that's why we talk about them they
happen all the time
rare things happen all the time it's
just you can't predict which rare thing
is going to happen when
but rare things happen all the time so
if this is just another rare thing
you'd say well
i wouldn't have predicted this specific
one
but rare things happen all the time this
is just another one
and we notice them because they're
special
i don't know
it certainly it certainly makes you at
least
say what the hell's going on here is
doesn't it
well ricky gervais has a netflix special
in which in his ricky gervais way he's
he's going after whatever would cause
the most uh
the most provocation
so apparently his jokes uh target i'm
going to say target but then i'm going
to argue that's the wrong word
let's say involve yeah i'm not going to
say target i'm going to say his jokes
involve the trans community now ricky is
a fairly brutal in his comedy
and the trans community is
you know some of it anyway is up in arms
and one assumes that some of the trans
community thinks it's funny
is that fair do do you think that the
trans community uh acts as one
and they all have the same opinion at
the same time no of course not but one
assumes
that some percentage of the trans
community will watch ricky gervais
special and say that's hilarious
i would have made that same joke that's
pretty funny same thing we say privately
i assume
but then i think you know some
percentage and i don't even know if it's
80 20 in which direction
i have no
i have no sense for which way that goes
but
um one could see why these others would
be offended
now here's the thing i'm going to say
that
uh ricky gervais doesn't ask for and
doesn't need and probably doesn't want
me defending him
because part of the beauty of what he
does like the thing that makes it art is
that he doesn't apologize for it
and so i don't want to ruin his art
by apologizing for him but there is some
context here
that's not an apology there is some
context here that's very important
and it's the personal perspective
context
of who has the power
i'm going to prime you for this with the
following example
let's say there are two people you're
considering one is a boss
and one is a really high-end engineer
who works for the boss
who has the power
in the comments that's all you know
really high-end engineer and a boss
who has the power
the boss or the engineer
sort of depends on the point of view
doesn't it
well
uh
the if you're saying engineer you you
sort of uh guessed where i was leading
you
uh depends there we go that is the
correct answer the correct answer is it
depends if the engineer
wants to take the power
that engineer has the power
if the engineer chooses not to take the
power
then the boss has the power
now in some specific instances the boss
would have all the power
in other specific instances i would
argue that the engineer would
effectively have all the power
and so we often so here's the priming
for my next point
who has the power is always an opinion
well that's too strong who has the power
is often an opinion and it could go
either way
will you
will you go with me that far so far
that who has the power in any given
situation is somewhat ambiguous
often
and it depends on the specifics right
um
so given that
wouldn't we all
and agree
course that's not true but
uh wouldn't many of you agree
that it's uh unseemly to punch down
meaning make jokes at people who are
below you in the power scale
but that it's routine and actually maybe
even good
to punch up
to make fun of the people in power
would we largely would you agree that
that's a good standard
it keeps comedy in its proper place
to maybe take the powerful down a notch
without hurting hurting the disadvantage
right
so if you saw somebody punching down
your your natural instinct would be oh
stop that punching down
if you saw somebody punching up you'd
say yay
cheer for them
so here's the here's the controversial
question
is ricky gervais punching up
or punching down
when he talks about trans
here's what makes it art
you can't tell
[Laughter]
that's why he's wrecking your face
and you're not
he can do that that's art
that's art
you can't tell
if he's punching up or punching down
because
because much of what the trans community
has managed to pull off
is it is increasing their power
around certain issues
that you know they have the most at
stake
so when ricky gervais is uh let's say
involving the trans community i'm not
going to say targeting i'm going to say
involving them
is he punching up
from the perspective of a
let's say a generic white male in 2022
do you think that a generic white man in
2022
feels that his power
is above that of the trans community in
society right now
no
no i'm not saying what's true
i'm saying what does a generic white man
feel is true and i'm not even saying
what ricky gervais feels is true because
remember he's he's producing art
he's not telling you his inner feelings
that's not what he does
so
i i think the
the genius of what uh
gervais does
is that you can't fully sort out if he's
punching up or down
and to pull that off
that is that's like chappelle level
cleverness in my opinion like there are
only a few people who are operating at
that level
and he's one of them
so
i like the fact that netflix is going to
back him on this and i hope people can
see this for what it is and he's
actually said
uh so this is an actual gervase quote
he said i don't know if he said this on
stage or an interview he said okay full
disclosure in real life of course i
support trans rights your face says i
support all human rights and trans
rights are human rights live your best
life use your preferred pronouns right
exactly in my opinion
so
is he punching up or is he punching down
here's the other thing that people don't
understand
when i misuse a word because i'm
using the the way people commonly misuse
a word
i get to do that
because i'm a professional writer
and professional writers as a class
get to decide what is common usage
i know you don't like it
i didn't sign up for it but it's just
one of the duties that come along with
being a
professional writer
that you know anybody's listening to
we get to decide not me personally but
like as a group
the people who write stuff
the people who write stuff for a living
get to decide what moves from bad
grammar into good grammar because people
use it a lot
it's just the way it works
and people like ricky gervais
get to decide
when somebody's moving from a powerless
situation into a powerful situation
now he didn't sign up for that
probably he never thought about it
it's not in his job description
but it is his job
comedians do that
part of what they do is decide who they
can punch at and they tell you okay
these they took power
now they can take a punch
so it's sort of like getting promoted
if you're in the trans community and
you're wondering you know how are you
being viewed by the world
ricky your vase just gave you a
promotion
and if you don't see that
that is sort of a little bit of a
tragedy because if it makes you feel bad
or makes you feel diminished
it should feel the opposite
now and i'm going to make a a real
important distinction
ricky gervais or
dave chappelle
including you in their humor
is not diminishing you
not the way they do it right if it's a
bad comedian
somebody who's not operating at their
level of subtlety then yeah they're just
being right they're just
picking on somebody because they can get
a cheap laugh right that's not what's
happening this is a promotion
all right there are two groups you can
uh
insult people who are more powerful than
you and people who
are not organized
so you can still make fun of dumb people
because dumb people don't have much
power
but they also are really bad at
organizing
guess why
it's because they're dumb people
it's the only group you can punch down
at because they can't organize
all right
um the world economic forum is happening
and uh the president of uh
alibaba group this michael evans
he was talking about the uh development
of you know noodling about this is a
possibility of individual carbon
footprint trackers
so you can monitor what a an individual
buys eats and where and how they travel
now of course this i think he's
describing it as something you would use
for yourself
so that you can monitor your own carbon
use
 went there on a private
plane
is there anything else to say about this
well that's the whole conversation right
he he's talking about wouldn't it be
great for everybody to be able to track
their own carbon footprint
 went there in a private
plane
that's there's nothing else to say
dismissed
[Laughter]
dismissed
all right are you watching this
pennsylvania race with
dr oz and
mccormick i guess they're down to within
a thousand votes
that are being disputed so they you know
we don't have a final answer and if that
thousand gets a little bit
fewer
um that apparently there's a forced
runoff or something
so they're really fighting for every
vote
and mccormick's filed a lawsuit
uh challenging um
ballots that don't have
uh that were returned on time but they
don't have a date on them so it
shouldn't matter
it shouldn't matter that they don't have
a date on them
because they were returned on time and
that i guess they can verify that
so you they don't have to wonder if they
were late because they have them and
they had them on time
so what do you think of that
do you think that would be a reasonable
if the court were to agree oh
since we can confirm the dates
were sufficient
we don't have to see the dates what do
you think
i'm actually really curious about your
opinions on this
opens the door yeah you're a little
cautious on this one aren't you
see the problem is it makes perfect
sense
that's the problem
the problem is the argument is perfectly
good
and in any other context
you'd say okay that makes sense that is
fair
but
it opens the door
as soon as you say that any rule can be
broken
because you've got a good reason why you
should you know why you can make an
exception
i why wouldn't i wouldn't call that a
slippery slope that's more direct
if you can break a rule you can break a
rule it's pretty much
i mean that's that's the beginning of
the end of the slope right
so it's not too slippery it's just yes
or no
so as soon as you break that rule
as soon as you break that rule
everything falls apart does it
now i suppose if you took it through the
court system maybe if it went to the
supreme court that could launder it into
credibility well you know i would accept
that actually if that's what happened i
would take the
the answer
anyway
what if this changes the outcome
what if what if the uh the counting
uh
reverses the current vote
is anybody gonna chan
and nobody's gonna trust any election
ever again if if they do i don't know
but this could be devastating i mean
it's not that big a deal if they
if they simply delay
the result and it goes the way the the
vote has gone so far if it doesn't
change the direction
we're going to forget about it pretty
quickly
but if it changes the direction of this
thing
like reverses it
i don't know
people are going to be talking about
that for a long time
all right here's a question that uh
i'm people are debating with me
did putin
want all of ukraine
or is he getting the parts he wants and
therefore
assuming that he consolidates control
did he win
so what do you think did putin want all
of ukraine
or was it always a fake out
so that he could
pin down the ukraine military around the
capital and then take his time
consolidating forces where he really
wanted to
control things where the separatists are
what do you think
i'll give you the correct answer
the answer is why would he have either
opinion
both
sort of both
here's how a good decision maker would
approach this now let's let's assume
he's a
a good decision maker
um
let's assume putin's a good decision
maker
and let's assume that he's at least as
good a decision maker as i am
right
and
because here's how i would play it
i always say to myself well i want all
of ukraine
i want it
and there's there's at least a non-zero
chance i could get it for cheap
the whole the whole country because who
knows
maybe you start the war and you're so
devastatingly effective in the first few
days
maybe ukraine folds
maybe they
maybe they say oh we'll we'll put your
puppet in if you stop bombing us
maybe
you know what were the odds i don't know
low
but still some chance
so here's how you would approach it if
you said to yourself what i really want
is those separatist areas because it
gives me a land bridge and then blah
blah blah and
economic whatever
if you said to yourself what you really
want is just that part of ukraine
but you would love to take the whole
country
i mean that would be ideal
you would make a play for the whole
country
but you wouldn't care that much if it
worked
because what if it didn't work it would
pin down the ukraine military and the
rest of the country
and give you time to build up your
forces where they were
if it did work if it did work well then
you conquered the whole country and it
was cheap
so anybody who's looking at this and
says that poor that putin did not want
all of ukraine
or
did want all of ukraine
they're completely wrong
i i'm sure
i'm sure that what he wanted
was separate from what he knew the
cost-benefit risk analysis was
and he wasn't dealing with what he
wanted he was dealing with what's
possible
somebody says sorry scott
now what's that mean
i beg to differ
does anybody have a counter argument
general's dead on purpose
no i'm not saying that
russia
did a good job in the invasion i'm not
saying that they
didn't take larger losses than they
expected
i do think the ukrainian military was
more effective than most people except
me predicted
but i feel like a putin would know that
he has two ways to win
get the whole country or get part of the
country
but then he'd be happy with either one
why why isn't that obviously true
when when you say there's no argument to
be made here that is sort of obviously
true
that if he would be happy with just the
separatist parts because it's such a big
win he should be happy with that
um
and and he could spin it as a victory at
home
i know his his losing only has to do
with what happens with his economy after
that i guess
i asked this question for which i was
pilloried
online i said how could russia hold
territory in the age of drones
let's say russia
consolidates control over these um
separatist regions they call them
and what happens if ukraine wants it
back and they're willing to
fight to get them back
wouldn't the ukrainians just put endless
drones into into there until the
russians just can't hold it anymore
maybe nobody can you know maybe maybe
they would return the favor if the
ukrainians did it
but here's the feedback i got
scott scott scott
if the ukrainians could reconquer
territory with drones
scott you idiot
they would have already done it with
crimea
so
what do you think of that if the
ukrainians
could conquer
these or get back these territories in
the future
why didn't they do it in the past before
drones were available and good
so is there any reason that before
drones were available
and worked well is there a reason they
didn't use them to to get a victory
before they existed
anybody
that that's the quality of argument i'm
getting online right now
is that why didn't they do it in 2014
well the drones were a little bit
different in 2014
as in a lot
as in a lot
they're they're different than they were
a year ago
in fact they're way different than they
were a year ago and certainly the
availability the militarization of them
how much payload they could take how
their the distance they can travel
all of it it's like completely different
than it was you know even a year ago
so everybody who says to me
drones can't work because they haven't
worked so far
and then a number of people said scott
you're ignoring all the reports
of the ukrainian drones that have been
shot down by the russians
to which i say
you mean in the past
as in last week
because last week's the past
i'm not talking about what is going to
happen in the past
that's not my prediction i'm not
predicting the past i'm predicting the
drones will continue to get better
really quickly
and that ukraine will have unlimited
access to them because of nato etc
and that if they decided to use them
that's a big if that part i don't know
but if they decided to use them in a
continuous stream of swarm attacks
eventually
you don't think that they could make it
unoccupiable
because i i would assume they would
always have spotters right the occupied
territories would be full of spies
look check that assumption
could we assume that the occupied
territories if russia takes takes that
don bass area etc
that they would have plenty of ukrainian
spies
that would say okay here's the barracks
this is where the russian soldiers come
out of every day
and you know here's the thing that's
going to blow up over there
so i think they'd have spotting
exact spawning
and they would have unlimited drones to
send over to blow up wherever there's a
human being outside
yeah now they might not be able to blow
up a tank
and i'm not talking about the big like
turkish drones i'm talking about the you
know the hobby size ones that can travel
two miles or whatever it is i think they
can do a couple miles now
and that i would expect that with
correct me if i'm wrong
but does the
distance a drone can travel change with
starlink
if you add starlink
to hobby drones
at the moment you can't do a hand off
like forever
but if you had a continuous starlink
connection
could you control your drone with very
small lag
to anywhere as long as the drone had
power
is that right
they don't use internet but they could
right no i i realize they don't use
internet that's why they have a distance
problem but they could right
the only thing that they couldn't do is
uh necessarily have the the right time
lag
to be just a little bit more of a time
lag
but if they're targeting something
stationary or it can track something
that's moving and
fire on its own they wouldn't need that
they
they could be a second or two late and
it would still work right
you need large equipment to receive
starlink
really
so you don't think you could put a
starlink receiver on a drone
yet
okay well that's a good question it's an
open question so anyway my point is
i'm talking about ukraine in the next
one to three years what kind of drone
power they could they could put together
do you think that russia has the
technology to stop a drone swarm
i don't think so
i don't think anybody has that there
seems to be that some numbers of drones
will will beat some number of anti-drone
defense
but yeah and even if it's a cat and
mouse game
you know both are going to win for a
long time
all right
so that's a interesting question
corey deangelis reports that 23 states
have now decided to cut ties with the
national school board association
because they
the pressure that they were putting on
parents
so it turns out that parents are rising
in power and
half of the country
has now at least in terms of number of
states
decided to cut ties with the national
school board people are finally
realizing that the biggest problem in
the world is
teachers unions and school boards
because their their power distorts you
know what society needs all right uh
provocatively i tweeted the other day
that trump would have solved the baby
formula problem in 10 minutes
oh boy did that
boy that
stir up a hornet's nest of turds wow
by the way i saw a great meme yesterday
it was amber heard
a picture of her and the meme said i
think he said
that she was the only one in the
relationship that gave a
i'll just let that sink in
all right um
so
when i said that trump would have solved
the baby formula problem in 10 minutes
what i meant was
my understanding was
that it was only red tape
you know or agreements with other
countries etc that
was preventing it
now is that true
because i know we didn't have a domestic
supply
but
was there more to it than just the
availability of getting it from other
countries
all right so i think there's
there was definitely a shortage in this
country but was there a shortage in
other countries
did other countries have enough
that if we had
rapidly purchased it it would have made
a difference does anybody know that i'm
seeing a lot of people say no
it wouldn't have made a difference
if there's no shortage in other
countries and trucks exist
would our supply chain problem have
caused us not to be able to get it in an
emergency situation because we would
have airlifted it as we did
i don't know
um
so my assumption was that anybody who
said all right break all the rules and
feed our babies would have gotten
something done faster
i don't think that's a bad assumption
but then i learned
that democrats have been taught that
trump caused the problem
did you have you heard that narrative
that the baby formula shortage was
caused by trump is sort of popular on
twitter
has anybody heard that
and uh had something to do with the
nafta or something
i don't know
maybe
but i treat them as separate problems
even if it's true and i doubt it is but
even if it's true that something he did
caused the problem
it was obviously something that
you know smart people thought was the
right course just didn't work out
so
that's different from codia fixed it i
think the fixing he's better better at
than the predicting weird things in the
future
which nobody's good at
there's a great article on china
dominating rare earth materials which
sounds like the most boring topic
but i've been waiting to see somebody
just summarize it
so i i could get a sense of
you know is there any other source for
rare earth materials and stuff like that
so this appears to be a big big deal
because of all your technology
requires these uh you know 11 or so
heavy earth
rare materials
here are some things i didn't know
one source for some of these is
greenland
which
might suggest why trump wanted to buy
greenland and uh there's something
discovered near japan's uh near japan
and the ocean
it looks like it's got tons of rare
earth in there it's hard to get out of
the ocean but
um
you should read the article it's uh
written by uh
in insightful geopolitics but just look
in my twitter feed and you can see it
just
it's the only time i've seen somebody
explain it in simple terms
now it turns out that we are we the
united states is doing a lot
to try to get our own you know friendly
sources of rare earth so there's a lot
going on but china has
so far dominated the known sources
but here's the big
wild card
we keep discovering new sources
so
it could be the kind of thing yeah maybe
it's maybe it's an asteroid
could be space
but we keep discovering new ones so
you know if we keep discovering new ones
could there be i guess there's a recent
one in far west texas
a mountain called round top
round top is known
uh
that it might make america greatly
self-sufficient in rare earth materials
it discovers five out of six of the
light rare earth and ten out of 11 the
hebrew so there's basically one place in
texas one mountain
that might have enough of these rare
earth
materials
that would make the united states
self-sufficient
and
now do you think there's not even one
other mountain in the united states that
has any rare earth materials there's
this one mountain
that's got
five out of six of one type and 10 out
of 11 of the other type
and and all five permanent magnet
materials that's just a one mountain in
texas
you don't think we're gonna find some
more mountains
somebody says a pebble mine in alaska
right
well isn't the problem just finding it
i i feel like the problem is not getting
it
the problem is just knowing where it is
i feel like this is one of those
gigantic problems that will be solved
one day
like maybe this is it maybe this far
west
tall mountain
maybe it solves everything i don't know
once they start digging
they're going to find out how much is in
there they don't know how much is in
there what if it's 10 times as much as
they think is in there
problems already solved
i mean you know given some time
i think the adams law of slow-moving
disasters
applies here better than in most places
and it works pretty well everywhere
and that goes like this that before we
would run out or have some world war
three with china over rare earth
materials or
or that we'd have a war and you know
they'd make them unavailable to us
probably far before that's going to
happen
we'll just discover a few more mountains
and we'll have all the rare earth
materials we want we'll just look harder
for them
or we'll learn how to get them out of
the ocean
more reasonably uh rasmussen had a poll
and they asked
is it possible to completely prevent
mass shootings like the ones in buffalo
completely
is it possible to completely prevent
mass shootings like the one in buffalo
24
percent of the people said yes
24
think that you could completely prevent
mass shootings
24 it's a roughly yeah it's it's a
neighborhood of a it's about a quarter
quarter 25
25
25
all right the next question was uh
would stricter gun control help prevent
mass shootings like buffalo
40 said yes
but in this case it was help prevent
you know i think you could answer that
one either way
you know stricter gun control even if
you didn't like it
it might
it might help
it might
there might be one fewer
and that would help
i mean help a lot if you were one of the
victims of that one fewer the one that
didn't happen so yeah i suppose this has
more to do with how you
you define the question or understand
the question i guess
all right here's the big payoff for
today
i developed a quiz a
10-point quiz
of news hoaxes
and i propose that you should not talk
to me about world events
unless
you can pass this test would you like to
now participate in the 10 questions that
will determine if you
are one who is duped by hoaxes
uh i will tell you in advance that
everything on this list is a hoax a
known hoax a really well-known hoax if
your news source
believes that these are true
you need to change your new source all
right
number one russia collusion hoax
number two the steele dossier hooker
story
three
russians paying bounties on u.s soldiers
in afghanistan number four
trump calling neo-nazis fine people in
charlottesville number five trump
suggested drinking or ingesting bleached
david six trump overfed koi fish in
japan
uh with the
prime minister i guess
and
seven trump cleared protesters with tear
gas for a bible photo op number eight
hunter's laptop was russian
disinformation number nine elections
were fair because no court found major
fraud and number 10 january 6 was a
quote insurrection to overthrow the
government
now
how many of you think one of these
hoaxes is true
ten for ten
all right well that has as much to do
with uh who my audience is as as the
hoaxes themselves
but
uh what do you think of this as a
starting point
uh here's a rule of persuasion
that is one of the best
rules you will ever learn
and i learned this when it was my job in
corporate america
to write up business cases or write up
what our strategy was or generally to
put into words
what it is we wanted or planned to do
and what i learned was that the person
who puts it into words
is actually sort of in control
because the way you word things
decides whether it's going to happen if
you word it right it happens if we're
wrong it doesn't
and so the the person putting things
into words can also insert a little bit
that maybe the boss hadn't intended
maybe subtract something the boss would
have put there but you don't think
belongs there
so the the person who controls the
speech the speech writer
has a lot of control
over the country the business whatever
so if you're ever in a position to be
the one who writes it down
take that job
take that job immediately because the
one who writes it down is a charge
so what i did was i wrote down these
this quiz and this gives me sort of a
power position
because since i created it
it makes something that somebody has to
respond to
and it makes them respond within my
frame
so i'm creating a frame
and then i'm inviting victims in to
respond to it but i've rigged the game
right so it's already rigged so it gives
me power to be the first one to write it
down
so that's your persuasion lesson
be the one to write it down
be the one to write it down first
it gives you tremendous power
um
and i noticed that when i would mention
any of these hoaxes individually
people would just fight them to death
but i'm using list persuasion here
where if somebody looks at this list and
they say yeah okay i admit that half of
these are definitely hoaxes
what are they going to think of the
other half
because i put it in the context in which
they could say okay
even i know at this point i know
that the hunter laptop was not russian
disinformation
right so i know that one's true
so
if that was true oh wait i know
okay i do know that trump didn't
overfeed the koi fish i saw the full
video
to know what that was about okay so two
of these i know they were real hoaxes
and they were on tv oh okay
yeah that third one
yeah they never proved that there was
any bounties paid on u.s soldiers okay
i'll give you three
so don't you think that people who were
inclined to believe at least one thing
on the list
would look at the list and sort of talk
themselves into thinking
that the list maker
knew a few things
because when you agree with somebody you
think they're smart
so if i put something on the list that
they're going to agree with
they'll think well you're really smart
about that one
so i'm drawing them in
so persuasion-wise why is this list
persuasion which i hate it when it's
used against me but it's a powerful
technique if you're going to be the one
who makes the list
it's powerful
so imagine the same technique if you had
made a list of
mistakes that biden made or mistakes
that trump made
a list of 10 of them is going to be more
persuasive as long as somebody believes
a few of them
if the whole list is then it
doesn't work at all
but if a few of those on the list you
say to yourself okay those
i see your point on a few of those
then you're more inclined to think that
the larger list has some weight
um
oh i miss i forgot an e on steele
dossier
thank you i'll fix that
all right
um
i would invite you actually i think i'll
probably uh
i might correct that typo and then
repost it but feel free to use that
to use my list of ten you don't need to
give me credit or anything
but if it's useful
you have my
full permission as if you needed it you
didn't really need it
um
can we move charlottesville higher on
the list no
because i didn't want people to get
there until they had seen a few that
they agreed with
so erica asks
should we could we put the
charlottesville neo-nazi one higher on
the list if it were a list of
how bad they were
i'd put it toward the top but remember
it's the the point of it is persuasion
so
putting it uh
forth is about exactly what you want to
do
all right
uh that's all i got for today i think i
think you would agree
this was just about the best thing
you've ever seen in your life
am i right yeah of course i am
and once again your dopamine levels are
higher than they would have been
i think your oxytocin is
starting to peak
and
a little bit of
caffeine too for some of you yes you're
feeling good you're feeling better
things are going great and by the way
uh if you want to look forward to a
dilbert series that's coming up dilbers
company is entering the big pharma space
and they're producing a pill
and there will be some controversy about
whether the data is accurate or not
so if i'm still around a month from now
i'll be surprised
see you see you tomorrow
