good morning everybody
and i was checking the news to see if
anything big has happened lately and
[Applause]
i don't know
anything is there anything on your mind
are there any any topics
of great interest to you
is there anything that everybody's
talking about
well we might get to that too
uh but first
do you feel it yet
is it starting to tingle
that incredible feeling you get
when you're here live
and even when you're watching it
recorded
and you're imagining what it would have
been like if you were watching this live
right now
it starts as a small little good feeling
and you might feel it in your arms first
like a little tingle
on your arms
that's the beginning of an incredible
day
because people who watch this live
stream you're not like regular people
you're sexier you're smarter
you're you're learning machines
my god you're getting better every day
your skill stacks are growing your
systems are working
i admire you
congratulations to you for being awesome
now
because you were so awesome
today will not just be
i mean normally it's the best day you've
ever had when you come here but
i think we can take it up a level
i think we can and it's going to happen
in a moment and all you need is a copper
mug or a glass a tanker tells a steiner
canteen jugger flask a vessel of any
card
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's the dopamine of the day
the thing that makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
it happens now go
that was so good that even though i
noted
a little pushback from what i would call
an anti-sipper
yet don't don't grab the pitchforks no
let them go let them go that's not the
kind of people we are
people can be pro-sip
they could be anticip
we're we're a big tent kind of a thing
so really you should not be bigoted
against the anti-sippers even though we
like sipping
we like it we're we're sort of on team
sip
the anti-sippers
we shouldn't hate them because they're
they're worth less than us
i'm not saying that and i'm not saying
that you should
feel any
enemies toward them at all
the anti-slippers i hate the
anti-subverse i hate them
i'm gonna tweet about those idiots
antisippers
khan
all right
rasmussen has a poll
says that 66 percent of likely u.s
voters believe america is now more
divided
than it was before the 2020 election
so good job joe biden
i believe there was
one thing that joe biden promised us
above all other things what was that
what was that one thing he said
he said
man
you know there's one thing i'm going to
give you let me tell you let me tell you
there's one thing you're definitely
going to get
the one thing you're absolutely going to
get
we're not going to be so divided
not with a joe biden president
nope
only to discover that it doesn't really
matter who the president is
the country will get more divided
because
why
because it's probably not anything to do
with the president
i don't think he had anything to do with
trump
not really and i don't think has
anything to do with biden either i think
that the
you know the the media
is such
that all presidents will look worse and
worse until we immediately elect them
and then execute them
without any gap in between
because
you know everybody just looks like
a worse and worse version of
it looks like a photocopy of a photocopy
like every new president seems worse
than the last in ways that we can't even
imagine it's like oh my god this one was
so bad well
you know not as bad as that last one but
when do you see the next one
so if the trend continues
and each president is
devalued by social media eventually
you'll get
to a point
where the only person who could be
elected president
is so bad
that they just have to be immediately
executed
so
would that might
make the primary uh season shorter fewer
people
so there could be some good good
elements of that
um
we're going to get to elon musk of
course we are
of course we are i'm just waiting for
some more people to get out here
um
what do you think about governments
picking winners and losers
this whole disney desantis thing was
about that but i'll just ask this one
question
then i'll just i'll just leave it this
just a general question
and this this has more to do with disney
having a special status that they had in
florida
um because they'd made a deal to have
this special status
so
uh
what do you think should governments
pick winners and losers go
in the in the comments
should governments be in the business of
choosing winners and losers
solid knows i'm saying no no no no no
no no no
somebody says i love it but i think
you're kidding
some a few few people say yes
i'm sort of surprised
sort of surprised
now let me alright second question
second question
um so i'll let some of your answers you
know run through here so they're not
overlapping
because there's a little lag on the
comments all right second question
are you aware
that the current government is almost
entirely
designed to pick winners and losers like
it
it's like its main function
his primary function is to pick winners
and losers are you aware that that is
what the government does
okay most of you are okay
so
if you were to do away with that
what would be left
[Laughter]
there wouldn't be anything left
that's all governments do
that's literally all they do you know
they do it in a variety of ways that
some of it involves
taxes
some of it involves the legal system
which literally picks winners and losers
and you know the irs literally decides
who gets benefits and what types of
things they want to promote what they
want to discourage literally
about the the military
well if you don't join if there are not
enough people who join the military the
government will just decide to
enlist you without your
without your permission
so they literally get to pick who wins
and loses and then you go on the
battlefield and
you know somebody who works for the
government you know your commanding
officer says all right you know you you
lock you're going to run after that tank
literally picking winners and losers
that's all they do
like that the laws like every law makes
somebody a winner and somebody a loser
with the exception of maybe
you know some that are just so obvious
that they should be a law
but largely
some industry loses
but maybe they should have
maybe they should have lost i'm not
saying that they're picking the wrong
winners or losers
i'm just saying that if your objection
to the disney
florida thing is on principle
and the principle is
the government should not be picking
like a specific company to win
i would say
well that's all they do that's all they
do that's everything they do and
everything we want them to do
like that's that's peak performance for
a government is picking winners and
losers they just have to do it well
now the secret is
did did florida make a deal which was
also good for florida
if they did
then
everybody want and of course people say
but they can they have the power to
change that deal yeah they do
they do have the power to change that
deal looks like they did
so but i just want to make that minor
point that that's all governments do is
pick winners and losers
all right let's talk about twitter
um as you know
twitter has accepted elon musk's bid
so elon will when i don't know how long
it takes this to the deal to close
but he will uh he'll be owning
he'll be owned on twitter
and so you might ask yourself what did
jack dorsey say about all of this and
jack tweeted tweeted i think it was was
yesterday after the news
jack dorsey said i love twitter twitter
is the closest thing we have to a global
consciousness
now i'm not sure you saw that coming
a global consciousness
and then he followed up with that he
said
in principle i don't believe anyone
should own or run twitter
it wants to be a public good at a
protocol level not a company
solving for the problem of it being a
company however elon is the singular
solution i trust
i trust his mission to extend the light
of consciousness
now was that the take you were expecting
it's not exactly the take you were
expecting is it
but
um
it's it's exactly my take
so i i would say that my take is exactly
like this and if you would like to see
more about what global consciousness
means in this context i would recommend
you to my book
written in 2001.
now uh i'm not going to say anything
else about it
but i'm going to let the people in the
comments who have read it
just say in the comments if you've read
it would you think that this is the
right book at the right time
because of the news
just in the comments
to just tell the other people if you
think oh my god
the timing of this is exactly right so
watch as the comments go by
on locals it's solid yeses they've all
read the book
and there are fewer people on youtube as
a percentage who've read it but they all
say yes right so i'm not going to tell
you anything else
because i don't want to be a spoiler
but just know that if you're following
the story
and you wonder what it means if someone
refers to
twitter
as forming a global consciousness
and what it means to extend the light of
consciousness that those are not crazy
ideas
they're not even slightly crazy
because twitter is indeed
that
but it gets lost in the fact that it's a
bunch of other things whiteboard time
whiteboard
we got the whiteboard that needs some
kind of a drum intro doesn't it
i'm gonna have to record a drum in show
for
whiteboard
all right
so
when we're looking at twitter it's all
of these different things it's like a
cesspool of hate and fake news
true
uh it's a job for some of us such as
myself
you know i for me twitter is a career
you know it's it's how you reach people
it's how you build an audience yeah it's
basically
uh just how you connect so if you have a
certain kind of job
it's just it's part of your job
it's also an addiction for other people
a little dopamine hit every time you
get one on the other team
and
as uh
jack has noted
you could think of it as a global
consciousness now the shortcut of that
is that twitter
is like a
meta brain
or let's say
let's say that twitter has a mind of its
own
that looks like something like the
majority opinion but there's always a
minority opinion
if you were to say to yourself but scott
how can it be like a global
consciousness
at the same time it's like a cesspool of
hate and fake news
well let me ask you this
what do you think your brain is
your brain is a cesspool of hate and
fake news it just says other stuff too
it's got some love in there i hope some
empathy you know it's got some charity
and some
some industry and some good intentions
it's got a lot of stuff in there but
your brain is a hot mess
do you have one clean thought every day
no
it's like this boiling cesspool soup of
awesomeness sometimes and and you have
such dark thoughts that you can't even
express them to another human because
you think you'll be burned as a monster
that's where your brain is that's what
your consciousness is
so if your consciousness is a is a you
know roiled cesspool of badness
but weirdly
but weirdly you put all of that
awfulness together
and it can produce a human who does some
good stuff
you know who
who contributes to the economy
takes care of a family
you know does all kinds of good stuff
so
twitter's like that
it's like this
insane extreme of everything
that you can barely
you know you can barely tolerate
sometimes
do you know what else is like that
do you know what else is like an extreme
like
your thoughts in every direction and you
can barely tolerate it your own mind
you most of us can barely tolerate our
own minds half the time
right because
because it's just a mess in there
now any and by the way this is part of
what i call the basket case theory
if you're not old enough to have learned
this yet i can i can save you some time
everybody's a basket case
once you get to know them
until you do
and you don't know much about their
inner thoughts or their actual life you
think
there's somebody who's got it together
if only i could have the clarity of
thought
and the happiness that i'm observing in
this complete stranger if only i could
have that
and then you
live a lit a little bit
and you start noticing this pattern
you're thinking i've met a lot of people
why are all the people that i've met
really
messed up on the inside
because once they get to know you they
really ha
you know they'll vomit out their inner
thoughts and you're like whoa that's as
bad as my inner thoughts i thought i
thought i was the only one who had
thoughts like that
so anyway
i wouldn't
i wouldn't worry about the fact
that there's a lot of awfulness within
the twitter global consciousness because
that's just like you and you have some
good points too
and
if you want to know more about
that on the concept level
god's debris is the book you want to you
want to read
it takes only takes about an hour a half
and it's written
with hypnosis technique
which i disclose in the beginning of the
book so
if that makes you uncomfortable
you should not read it but the technique
is used to give you a
let's say an experience when you read
the book
that goes beyond the story
so it's how to make it an experience and
not just a
story
all right um
so here are all the the angles that
people are taking on elon musk
buying uh twitter
uh one angle is that elon has uh where
tesla has too many connections to china
so they got a china factory and
want to sell cars in china and it's the
biggest market
and would that not would that not
cause elon musk to be biased
and would it not
cause him to do
things that are a little bit approach
either
because he might have a trillion dollars
writing on it what do you think
remember i said follow the money
so if you follow the money
and he might have a trillion dollars
you know writing on making china happy
would you expect the trillion dollars
would influence him
well uh on
if if anybody
if anybody were not to be influenced by
a trillion dollars it might be him but
you have to you have to start with the
baseline assumption that all humans are
influenced
by a trillion dollars
like like you even if you ranked who
could who could resist it the most
you know and even if you said all right
of all the people in the world he could
resist it the most because he's already
the richest person
i mean you'd imagine that would be the
person who could resist it best
but even if he were the best at it
it's a trillion dollars
right nobody's gonna be
no one is immune to a trillion dollars
i can't it's not imaginable
even even if you justified it as
um
you know i'll use it to feed the poor or
something like you would always have a
reason why that trillion dollars
should actually make a difference to you
but
that said
what has
both
jack dorsey and elon musk said about
what should be done with twitter
well it turns out that it looks like
they're on exactly the same page
that as long as the algorithm is
transparent
what can china do
to which i think oh yeah what can they
do
the entire point is to make it
transparent
that's that's the entire point
if you if elon musk doesn't make it
transparent
well then the whole thing's a waste of
money
and
you know it's a it's a step backwards
probably
but it's everything he says he's gonna
do
he you know when was the last time he
said he was gonna do something and then
it turned out
that he was kidding like not not
something on this scale right he's very
clear what he's going to do
jack dorsey is very clear that it should
be done
and i think he even mentioned that the
current ceo
of twitter
is also on that same page
so
one wonders
who was not on that page
well
the hints that we have
are possibly the board
and possibly other owners of twitter
who had corporate
interests so if you read
what jack dorsey is tweeting
it would seem that there's some kind of
wall street corporate influence that was
on twitter
that might have even been more than the
influence
of jack dorsey
like that's the only way i could read it
is that if jack dorsey wanted things to
be one way
he couldn't get it done
so he couldn't get the very thing he
kept saying in public a lot
right because it's not like this is a
new thing
jack dorsey has been saying this for a
long time
ever since it became an issue he's been
saying it should be you should have a
choice of algorithms and should be you
know transparent and stuff and shouldn't
have corporate ownership he said for a
long time these sort of regrets not sort
of
that he regrets
the business model that twitter became
he says it directly so
all the people who seem to be um
having the biggest influence on where
elon musk would go with this
seem to think that he could get to
transparency
and that it's doable
what do you think
doable or not
because otherwise the china thing is
completely valid
if it's not completely transparent
that trillion dollars is certainly going
to make a difference
i would say
here's what uh
here's what elon musk
is good at he's a product guy
now when you look at twitter isn't the
thing that just screams
it needs a feature
right
like why can't i have the feature of the
edits or why can't i have the feature
that
um
you know maybe gives me more information
about if i'm shadow banned or i can't
have a feature that
gives me everything unfiltered you know
so so you think of twitter you get you
say give me a bunch of features
and then i'll be happy
and who's better at that
like elon musk is like sort of the
ultimate
figure out what features make sense and
build it and give it to you kind of a
guy
so that all looks good
um
who should be the most worried people in
the universe right now
um crystal ball i'm gonna go with the
marketing department at twitter
i feel like the marketing department at
twitter
probably putting their resumes together
because famously
elon musk does not elon musk doesn't
need marketing for tesla
because he just tweets
what do you think
do you think he needs a marketing
department for twitter
because he's literally doing that while
he does his other job
you know i joked and i i think he liked
that tweet that i joked that he he does
the entire marketing department
for tesla while he's on the toilet
you know because i think i think there
might have been a joke about him
tweeting from the toilet or something
and
and now he could do he could add the uh
running twitter's marketing
to it too
i mean he could just do both of them
before he's done with his business there
now
literally i'm not joking
what possible good does the twitter
marketing department
do to anybody
you know if you know that elon musk is
just going to be doing what what they do
times a thousand with just a few tweets
can elon make the business model
profitable
well it's already profitable right
wait
are you are you suggesting that
twitter's not profitable
i think the question is how profitable
right
all right
now here's a question
have you seen a bunch of people say
that their number of followers is way up
and that it's people who are they'll say
conservative leaning
and their number is up
well i'll tell you that my number of
people who follow me on twitter is
typically
on average and this is just really gross
numbers on average
300 a day
so i would get
and you could look back pretty far and
you see i get 300 today
uh yesterday
when twitter was sold to elon musk
i got 10 times that
i got over 3 000.
so so i went from 300 to 3 000.
but
but
if you think that's because
you know twitter is
you know burning
burning the old algorithms and
you know hiding the shadow banning so
they can't get caught or anything like
that
maybe
maybe i don't know what's going on but i
think it's equally likely that um i hear
a lot of people are just coming back to
twitter
so a lot of conservatives who might have
followed me in the past
but had had to stop following me may
just be coming back to see what's going
on something like that
so
so
um i would say it's too early to know
that this is because twitter changed
anything as opposed to
musk changing how people thought of
twitter which might have just brought
people back or maybe just to see what's
going on because it's the biggest story
but some people are like i think mike
cernovich just went through the roof his
numbers
like
just some crazy number of people
followed him in one day
uh and the funny thing is that ivor
mexton is trending now
so everybody's tried to say all the
things that got them banned before and
indeed they're not getting banned but
it's so obvious that they're saying it
for
for humor purposes that i'm not sure
that they would get banned from that
anyway um
so
i don't know
i'm not going to talk about ivermectin
it's just funny that it it's trending
um
there's a clip of ari melber on msnbc
who's talking about musk buying twitter
and
uh he's concerned about it and he's
concerned that that musk could have too
much influence on something like an
election so here's what he said
he said quote
you could secretly ban one party's
candidate
secretly turn down the reach of their
stuff and turn up the reach of something
else and and the rest of us might not
even find out about it until after the
election
uh well
yes ari melber
that is a risk
it's only the thing we've been talking
about for five years
like obsessing about it like the number
one thing that that uh something like 50
percent of the country has been you know
just frantically uh you know flailing
about and suddenly he's like hey hey
what what if what if somebody used
twitter to like affect an election
what would happen then
oh my god
and i i think tucker carlson is already
back on twitter
i don't know if that was because he was
unbanned or he just wanted to get back
on
um
i swear i think brian stelter only
exists
for our entertainment and not in the way
that he's hoping
uh
you know i don't have any i don't have a
bad feeling about him personally
but
from the perspective of someone who
watches not just cnn
he is a
he's a wonderfully
uh
i don't know
what is it that makes him so interesting
is it because you can't tell if he
believes what he's saying
is that what it is it might be that that
you're not entirely sure
if he believes it or he knows he's
supposed to be saying it right is that
it
you know you're well some of you are
making unkind
comments about his physicality but i
don't think it's that
because he he could look like anything
if you agreed with him and suddenly he'd
be he'd be handsome to you
i don't know
but uh here's what he said
uh talking about elon musk buying
twitter he said
if you get invited to something where
there are no rules
where there is total freedom for
everybody do you actually want to go to
that party or are you going to decide to
stay home
to which many people
said before i could cleverly chime in
and they'd taken all the good jokes so i
believe i didn't
but
uh
yeah yeah that's the party we do want to
go to
um
um yeah
yeah
you mean the good party
yeah we want to go to the good party
definitely definitely take me to the
good party
so
uh but it's just hilarious to
have him use this
explanation especially when you talk
about freedom of speech
you know yeah i do want to go to the
place where they have freedom of speech
as a matter of fact i do
i wouldn't mind that at all now i
wouldn't mind also
having better tools for filtering out
people who whose opinions aren't adding
value to me for whatever reason
so
um
but it is hilarious to see people let's
say associated with the
the
the propaganda on the left
how concerned they are that their main
propaganda lever just
disappeared
can you imagine
because you know i've been saying for a
while that twitter isn't like other
media properties it's the lever that
moves the other properties
so whoever controls twitter
and
ideally having a transparent system
means that the public controls it
um just by having you know a lot of
sunlight on it ideally
um
[Music]
i don't know how you can get away with
fake news as easily
i mean it seems like to be much better
check and balance on that stuff both
ways like not just the left but the
right of course
all right
you know i was uh
i was actually
thinking i should be more of an activist
on this whole thing
and
i wanted to protest
all the billionaire ownership of social
media you know you got facebook
billionaires washington post new york
times billionaires you know all the
media
seems owned by billionaires and then
you've got another billionaire buying
twitter
so all these billionaires
and uh
i thought i'm gonna quit i'm just gonna
quit all of social media
um
you know i'm just going to quit all
social media
sort of as a protest
against the billionaire ownership
but then
i didn't know how to tell anybody
so i got kind of stymy there it's like
well i want to protest
and what i want to quit all that stuff
and kind of make a statement
who am i going to tell
how would i tell them
so i was thinking i might write letters
um possibly
sort of a letter writing campaign
something like that
um
now let's do my new segment called
people who are
bad at economics people who are bad at
economics bad economics
and today's candidate will be a
representative of pramila jayapal
i believe one of the squad
is she one of the squad
or
she is right
nowhere yes
i can't remember if she's in the squad
or she's like squatted jason
okay she's close enough she's squat
adjacent
anyway so
she tweeted this because the news she
said just a reminder that from 2014 to
2018 elon musk paid an effective tax
rate of 3.27
whereas the average working family pays
an average tax rate of 13 percent
and she says it's time for a wealth tax
in this country
new representative
j pal it's time for an economics lesson
for representatives
people who are elected to represent this
country
should know a little bit more about
economics
because do you know why
tax
rules are the way that they are
it's because the government
picks winners and losers and the
government wants people who invest in
things that create jobs and make the
climate better in their view
they want those people to get big tax
breaks
to
to allow a an elon musk
to survive and thrive
it's exactly what the government wants
do you know why the government
wants people like
well entrepreneurs in general but do you
know why the government wants
entrepreneurs to
pay low taxes
it's so that they'll build
trillion dollar companies
[Laughter]
did i have to explain that like it's not
random
does she think that these things are
randomly handed out
they're not random
it's because
people do things for their own benefit
if the government decided that somebody
should have a tax benefit it's because
the government said that's probably good
for the government too it's good for
everybody
you know there's a reason for every tax
rate every
you know everybody who gets a break
it's not random
it's based on economics and
if you found something
that was clearly just bad economics
like it didn't it didn't create the
right incentives well then yeah you
should change that and we do
you know when we discover that that's
the case
but to imagine there's something that is
designed and working exactly like you
wanted it to
creating incentives for exactly the
right people
i don't know
i feel as if we deserve better
representatives
and you know we always talk about how
the the low-income people in this
country should get
something like financial investment
advice you know how to manage money
basic lessons on money management which
i think would be an amazing
addition to school
but seriously
we should not have people in congress
whose understanding of
economics is so low
that they don't understand
that you know the the tax system is set
up for a reason
that that's not random
all right
uh i saw a little thing going around the
internet
uh
said there was some study who knows how
reliable studies are but
it was funny so i said that men who
helped the most with housework
so that where wherever the man is most
close to
doing an equal amount of housework to
the woman
they also have the highest likelihood of
divorce
and
and people were expressing some
confusion and surprise
that that would be the case
so uh
i tweeted that of course i know the
answer to this but i'm certainly not
going to say it in public
but
i'll give you
some things that people are saying about
it
number one
there are lots of other correlations are
there not
that where you have a situation where
two people are doing nearly the same
amount of housework
there are probably other things going on
or they're not
like um
one of them is not
a billionaire working 14 hours a day
and
well that's a bad example because in
that case they'd have housekeepers
but clearly there are a lot of other
things going on
and
i i would like to offer absolutely no
opinion whatsoever
about why this is sort of obvious what's
going on here
but i'm not going to say it out loud
you can
you all risk takers you
just just
[Laughter]
i'm not even going to read your comments
because they're so inappropriate the
anti-wokeness or the wokeness that oh
yeah anti-walk this i'm saying
is
disgusting
all right so you can fill in your own
jokes on that one
um former dni john ratcliffe
i guess he was on um
uh charlie kirk's show and he's he said
that to expect more indictments coming
from the durham thing and the whole
fake
russian collusion thing
now apparently ratcliffe must have seen
documents that the rest of us have not
because he says that when more
classified documents come out
uh we're going to be
kind of shocked
he said it will appall the public if if
they're declassified
so how much do you want to see the
things that would appall us
i'd really like to see those
and i don't imagine there's any reason
they couldn't be
declassified
so
i feel like one of the strategies that
bad people use in politics is to just
make sure that the investigation lasts
long enough
that we don't care about the issue
anymore
because imagine how hot the issue was at
one point but every year that goes by
you know even i who talked about it a
lot
you know i start to lose interest in it
over time it's like russia collusion how
many more times we're going to mention
that
so by the time you find out exactly what
the plot was and exactly who was behind
it
you've already moved on to a new outrage
so your attention doesn't get the same
you know the same hit
here is the weirdest
thing that's happening
now if you
if you study cognitive dissonance and
confirmation bias and all that
um
you know what they mean
but when you see an example that's like
really clear it's still shocking
because cognitive dissonance is one of
those things that
you can see if you don't have it
but the person who's in it can't see it
and and you think my god how do you not
see this so here's an example
i tweeted this if you want to go look
for yourself but there's a yahoo.com
article
it's a recent one which is interesting
which they're talking to dr burks
one of trump's
pandemic experts
and they talked about uh how she felt
when trump allegedly
suggested uh drinking bleach
now here's the weird part
you've seen lots and lots of reports
about this story that's not true
trump never suggested
drinking or injecting bleach or any kind
of liquid
disinfectant he did talk about shooting
light uv light into the lungs
which was being tested at that time as
cedar sinai
and uh and he was very careful to say it
was uv light
both before he talked about it and then
after he was done talking about it he
you know bookended it by saying yeah but
uv light so he made sure that you knew
uv light is what he was talking about as
a disinfectant
injected into the body
so
here's what's weird about the yahoo
article
they showed his actual quote including
the part about the light
which completely debunks the hoax
i mean just clearly there's the quote
there's him talking about light as the
disinfectant
so you can see exactly what he meant
and then the rest of the article
acts as if that didn't happen
it's so weird
it just goes on as if they hadn't just
debunked
one of the biggest
hoaxes
in the nation
just acted like it didn't happen
they just printed it and then just went
on
like
sorry this lady had to endure this
horrible hoax or this horrible thing
that they just said didn't happen
i
i don't know i don't know what to think
about it it's just like so mind-blowing
now i can explain it
it's easily explained it's cognitive
distance
i mean it's easy but to watch an example
that that's that is that clean
is just weird
now
i think i've delivered
on
the best live stream
you've ever seen in your life
we are in fact forming a global
consciousness
with twitter
and with what we're doing here which is
sort of an adjunct to all that stuff
as i've said before
i believe that there's an emerging thing
called the internet dads
meaning people who
generally have
figured out how to meet their own needs
and are just trying to be useful
and i try to be one of those
like
i'm very intentionally trying to be
useful because i'm at that stage of life
a number of other people just like it uh
mike cernovich
probably the best example of someone
who's literally just wakes up every day
and is just trying to be useful on on
twitter
you know 25 tweets a day that are pretty
much all great
and
the number of other people
one of those people
i think is elon musk
i see elon musk as
you know he's sort of the the super dad
but i see him as an internet dad
like i don't even see him
it doesn't feel exactly like you know a
patriot
it doesn't sound exactly like politics
does it it's not like politics
it's not exactly just you know rah-rah
america first
it's literally just dad
am i wrong
now again of course i'm being sexist
here so you know let me acknowledge that
in this context dad means men or women
who have a certain sensibility and
they're at a certain place in life you
know i could have called it mom
you know in a different context but it
just feels that like that dad vibe it's
like okay okay
i'm just gonna buy the company
if you if you kids won't stop arguing
i'm just gonna buy the company
doesn't that sound like dad
it doesn't sound like mom
does it
because mom doesn't buy the company to
make you start to stop arguing that's
just dad
just dad
and and who makes a bunch of off-color
jokes while he's doing it
mom
does mom make a bunch of off-color
sexual
eschatological jokes
when he's when he's buying a major
company that's the lever of
civilization
no
dad does
oh yeah dad does
that's why they're called
that's why they're called
dad jokes exactly
so
now
how many you you could mention probably
another dozen or so dads could you
but
i'm quite serious in saying
that this phenomenon of
internet dads who only get involved when
dad has to get involved
is probably a really good thing
like it just creates this one extra
positive force because i don't think
that the dads get involved
unless there's a sort of a log jam you
know what i mean
because dad's gonna let you fight
that's like the cool thing about the dad
vibe mom is gonna try to stop you from
fighting right away and dad might let
you duke it down a little bit
lets you fight a little bit
but you know when it's time
when it's dad time
well then you get involved and again
not trying to be sexist so you can you
can switch the genders and
any gender preference you want to put on
that would be
lgbtq
find with me
it's just an easy way to explain it in
in classic sexist terms
all right
so it could be
uh
ashley says can hypnosis increase sex
drive
would you like me to answer that
question anybody else
can hypnosis increase sex drive well let
me ask you this have you noticed that
your sex drive seems to be a mental
process
and that
if you let's say
spend some time in the same room with or
you're exposed to someone who's
unusually
sexy
that your brain says oh there's
something unusually sexy and then your
body just responds
so
can you imagine that hypnosis would not
help
it seems almost impossible it wouldn't
am i right
and the answer is yes
you know yes definitely
now i'm not talking about somebody who's
got like an actual medical problem right
so if you have an actual medical problem
no it's not going to help that but
if if the problem is entirely about how
you think about yourself
or it's entirely how you think about the
topic
uh let's say it's because you're shy
let's say it's because
you haven't found that one thought that
really
you know lights up your brain
yeah there are a whole bunch of ways
they're simply re-engineering your
thought process which hypnosis is good
at doing
if you wanted to right so it's the it's
the willingness to participate in it
that makes it work if short of that
no
but if you're willing to participate
a
a hypnotist who knew what they were
doing
and be careful about unscrupulous
hypnotists
because i'm not even sure how you'd
protect against that honestly
so it's it's a risky business but in
theory
in theory um it's not only doable but
it's actually among the easiest things
to do
so it's one thing that you could be
quite reliably sure you could do whereas
quitting cigarettes for example you
would not
you wouldn't bet the hypnosis could do
it
it works about one time out of three
same with losing weight if you use
hypnosis to lose weight or quit smoking
it works about one time out of three
so does
every other method
in other words hypnosis doesn't add
something
what really happens is people decide to
quit those things
so somebody decides to quit smoking and
then they pick a method
and it almost doesn't matter what method
they pick because they decide it
they don't want to smoke that i'm sorry
they don't want to quit they decided so
about one in three people literally just
decide
and then it doesn't matter what method
they use including hypnosis same with
eating
that about one in three people just
are just gonna have that ability to just
stop and eat and eat differently for the
rest of their lives
the rest can't
so did the hypnosis help well it didn't
matter what method they used
as long as they had decided
the method became somewhat irrelevant it
it probably helped to have a method
because it gave them something that they
thought was working and made them feel
more confident that they could get
through it you know so maybe it
helps them psychologically in some way
but so would it anything else
all right
that
can hypnosis cure disease such as mental
illness
oh here's something that could get me
kicked off of social uh
off of youtube that's a dangerous
question that's a dangerous question so
naturally i'm going to answer it
so could hypnosis cure mental illness
number one
it depends
how you define mental illness
because there there might be some
categories of things that sort of a gray
area
that hypnosis would help in but maybe i
would say it's mental illness but you
might say well that's more of a
personality or a situational thing you
know that doesn't count
it definitely can't cure schizophrenia
it definitely can't cure anything that's
like a physical brain damage
so there's there are lots of things you
can be sure it doesn't help with
so i would say if you took the basket of
all mental illness
the odds that it would cure any one
thing in there would be low
but
is there anything in the basket
that it could cure
and the answer is
yes with a caveat
yes with a caveat
that reframing itself
can be enough to help some people like
simply thinking of something in a new
way
and then
you know practicing the thinking in a
way the practice is important too
that feels like hypnosis
and can work without hypnosis
i mean it's literally just something
somebody can suggest to you and then you
just practice it and it can make a big
difference in your mood for example
i mentioned it too often but it just
fits every situation it seems like the
dale carnegie course
teaches you to be have less social
anxiety
and i would argue that it's a form of
persuasion brainwashing hypnosis
that they don't brand that way
and they don't use any of those specific
tools but
their method is so persuasive
that the design of the class ends up
being almost like you've been hypnotized
or rewired
it's such a strong
thing and most most of the technique is
just giving you compliments instead of
any criticism they just make it safe to
basically rewire your own brain so that
that's and so there's nothing that looks
even slightly dangerous about it and yet
your brain is literally rewired
but in such a positive way that all you
end up just recommending it
like you don't worry about you're like
oh that was good you should rewire your
brain too
so
the answer is if the hypnotist knew how
to re how to reframe
and then use the hypnosis to
let's say reinforce the reframe
to cause you to think about the reframe
more than the other thing
that could be done
but it would require you know a certain
level of skill
a pretty high level skill
but in theory
yes
in theory for
some of the most
i'd say for the most treatable forms of
mental illness you know lower on the
severity scale
you almost certainly could get the same
benefit that say
therapy would give you
and for some people
nothing is universal
for some people it might be almost
instant
like a day or two
but also
there are people who can with therapy
can fix you in a day or two
so it's you know there isn't really any
science that i could rely on for this
stuff
so
uh and the way therapy would fix you in
a day or two is with a reframe that just
made you say whoa
let me give you an example here's a
reframe
somebody thinks that they have not they
don't have any worth
they just have low self-esteem
here's a reframe
they say do you feel other people are
worthless
no
like why not
because you know some have all kinds of
flaws and stuff and people will say well
everybody's have flaws like i'm not
going to judge them for
you know their anything like you know
they're good at some things i'm good at
some things
and then then you say
well do you think they're judging you
why why do you think they're thinking
anything different then you say how much
do you actually think about
people other than your immediate
group that you deal with do you ever
think about them
and they'll say not really
do you care that much
not strangers
and that's just a couple of reframes to
get you to understand
that your feeling of low self-esteem
isn't
doesn't fit any mental model
so it doesn't immediately make you feel
better
but if you just keep telling yourself
wait a minute
other people really don't judge me
and i'm not judging other people
so what does it even mean to feel like
you have low value
it actually starts losing its meaning
and if you just say
well isn't everybody good at something
and bad at other things
do you think yeah i can't even think of
an exception
like everybody's
better some things and worse than others
if you were to judge people by their
mistakes you'd hate everybody so that
doesn't work if you judge people by what
they're good at and bad at
again you'd hate everybody except some
small number of people i guess
so there's no standard by which you can
measure anybody's worth
see these are just reframes i'm just
talking so this isn't hypnosis
but imagine that these same ideas
could be reinforced
through a hypnotic
process
so that somebody is just more likely to
think in the positive frames than the
less
less positive ones
totally doable
but you know would it work for everybody
now
because hypnosis doesn't work for
everybody
not every
not every hypnotist is good
etc
all right
um
now that ladies and gentlemen
is
your amazing amazing live stream for
today um
best that's ever
can you confirm
the best thing you've ever listened to
in your whole life
i think so
i think so
we all agree all right youtube
see you tomorrow
