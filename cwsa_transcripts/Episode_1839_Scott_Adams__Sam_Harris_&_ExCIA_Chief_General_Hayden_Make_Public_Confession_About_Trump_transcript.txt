good morning everybody
and welcome
to another highlight of civilization
it's called coffee with scott adams and
um i don't want to
get you too excited
but
today
double whiteboard
that's right not just one
double-sided
i know
it's almost too much to handle
but we'll we'll do it together
together we will handle this awesomeness
and i think we can
climb this mountain
but first we need some fortifications
and all you need for that is a copper
mug or a glass of tanker chelsea in a
canteen jugger flask a vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
it's the dopamine of the day
it's the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous sip
and it's happening now go
ah
sublime
oh so
good all right we're going to do a
little test a little intelligence test
here let's see if the
locals people can beat the people on
youtube platform who are watching now
all right it's a question for all of you
it's going to be based on erasmus and
poll
and
people were asked if they agreed with
this statement
this was something that trump had said
at one point he said quote
there is a group of politicized thugs
at the top of the fbi or using the fbi
as joe biden's personal gestapo
what percentage of people
strongly disagreed
with trump
strongly disagreed
whoa
you're pretty good
pretty good yeah the answer is uh
uh
26 who strongly disagreed
26 strongly disagree that joe biden is
using the fbi
as his personal gestapo
i don't have an opinion i'm just saying
that's what the numbers are but at the
other end
actually if you added together the ones
who strongly agree
and the ones who agree
um
you get a much bigger number all right
uh let's see who doesn't agree a
majority
see
a majority now agree
53
with that statement
oh actually that i'm sorry that wasn't
uh trump's quote that was roger stone's
quote
so roger stone is the one who quoted it
i i said it was trump it was stone
but 53 percent of voters now agree that
the
fbi is run by a uh joe biden's personal
gestapo
now that means that means that there are
a lot of independents
or at least a smattering of democrats
who are now in the
are now on the side of thinking that the
fbi
is joe biden's personal gestapo
[Laughter]
i don't know
anyway
this
the cdc
who came under a great deal of criticism
for their handling of the pandemic
how do you think the cdc
is going to respond
to all the
criticism so they're going to take
action now they're responding to the
fact that they i guess they confess they
didn't do as good a job as they'd like
to do what do you think they're going to
do about it
what what would dilbert's boss do about
it
what would they do about it
like literally in a dilbert comic what
would they do about it
they would reorganize
so it appeared that they had done
something
that's exactly what my comic would do
now
do you remember uh
the the rule that elon musk has for
tesla
don't do something that could show up in
a dilbert comic
i've never done a comic about tesla
just think about that i've never done a
comic about anything that happened at
tesla
so apparently they take that
seriously but the cdc
as soon as they're being criticized they
decide that their response is to
reorganize
i'm thinking to myself
that is exactly my comic
that's exactly my comic there's i
wouldn't even add anything
that's the joke right there
so good job there cdc and making it
worse
all right so yesterday um
based on a
smart suggestion
i decided to
grab the domain hoax quiz.com
so now i i own that domain
hoaxquiz.com
and it seems to me that what we need is
some kind of a competitor
to snopes and the other fact checkers
and so you know i started with my list
of you know the the top 10 hoaxes which
is now up to 14 people have added to it
so we've got 14
what i would consider confirmed hoaxes
one of them's not quite confirmed but
looks like it will be
but here's my problem
here is my problem
i'm not willing to put the hoax quiz up
unless i can do conservative hoaxes too
you okay with that
if i say uh seth rich
being murdered by hillary clinton as a
hoax
you're gonna be okay with that
will it
because if i don't do it there's no
point in doing it at all
is there if i don't have conservative
hoaxes on there there's no point in
doing it at all it'd be a complete waste
of time
but if i put both of them on there
then what position does that put me in
it put it puts me above the news
now
could i pull that off
probably not
probably not
it would be pretty tough
but imagine you could create a place
where people could go look
and find out if the news is
promoting a hoax and let's say you
actually were convinced that it showed
hoaxes on both sides
you showed the conservative ones as well
as the
the left-leaning ones
would that make you
more uh
likely to find it credible
before you answer
know for sure that i'm going to tell
tell you things that you believe are
true or hoaxes
i can't help it
i can't help it because we all have
different opinions right so there are
going to be things on that list that you
think are real that i think are a hoax
so you have to be okay with that
can you handle it
see the trouble is this is not the sort
of thing you can do right
okay can we agree on that you can do
maybe good enough
and good enough would be some kind of a
maybe a guardrail on the fake news so
the fake news doesn't get too far out of
control but i wouldn't be it wouldn't be
possible for me to be right every time
no matter how how i judge it or who i
bring in to help me judge it it's not
really possible that i'd be right all
the time
should i do it anyway
knowing that i would be wrong on some
notable
probably some big examples too i don't
know what that would be
but should i do it if i know i'm going
to be wrong
yeah see already i'm getting pushback on
the seth rich here's what i'd say about
seth rich
there are rumors
there are rumors that this happened but
there's no evidence of it or no proof of
it
something like that i'd probably say
there's no proof of it
now
would you be okay with that
see i don't know if i could call that a
hoax
i could just say we don't know one way
or the other
so i feel like i need another category i
wanted to do hoax or no hoax and keep it
simple
i didn't want to do the slightly true
slightly not true thing but you probably
get forced into it don't you
because there's gonna be too many gray
areas
all right well i have the domain and
i'll maybe uh
pack at that a little bit and see if see
if it gains some energy to pull me by
the way this here's a little uh
tip
a tip on how to get motivated
does anybody have trouble getting
motivated to do something they know they
need to do
here's a tip
i start lots of things that i know would
be interesting or good to do
and i take the first step
and then sometimes i'll take the next
small step
but
i i'm looking for the project to start
pulling me
right so the energy i have on day one
i don't know if that's the same energy i
would have if i started going on the
project because sometimes you get
excited then it gets boring and then you
know
so you've got to find a project where if
you seed it you just just give it a
nudge
it takes on its own energy and then
starts pulling you
i don't know if this one will pull me
i know i had enough energy to register
the domain
and i know i have enough energy to think
about how it would be and i put on a
question on on the locals platform if
anybody wanted to help
but i don't know if i'll yet have enough
energy for it to like pull me to
completion
so i've got a number of projects right
now that are in that state i've done
something
a little bit
but i'm seeing which ones are going to
start pulling me right
now my book i'm writing
i was pushing that until just recently
like it was just work
but more recently it got to the point
where the
is shaping up nicely
and so as it starts to shape up it
brings its own energy it's like oh wow
this would be good to finish this book
because it looks like it's going to be
pretty good so now it's starting to pull
me and i wake up this morning and think
i hope i have time to write that to
spend some time writing because i can't
wait to
can't wait to fill it down a little bit
all right
well uh alex jones is uh off the trump
train as people are saying he's gonna i
guess he wants desantis to be president
he would prefer him
now i don't know what alex jones will do
if
uh desantis doesn't run
what if the only republican choice is
trump will alex jones be back
i don't know
yeah we'll talk about sam harrison
so geraldo rivera made a bold statement
on twitter
now i know a lot of you are
sort of anti-geraldo rivera
but i am so pro-geraldo
i'm just totally pro-geraldo which is
different from agreeing with him
can can we make that distinction
i love the fact that he puts himself out
there
i love the fact that he doesn't appear
to be afraid of anything he doesn't seem
to be physically afraid of anything he
doesn't seem to be embarrassment wise
and afraid of anything
yeah he took off his shirt at age 70 or
whatever it was he's my role model
yeah yeah geraldo is absolutely my role
model
and again it has nothing to do with
whether i agree or disagree with any
opinions
but his
i guess his approach to life
is one i think you should all emulate
yeah if you could be as you know
as
let's say unafraid as he is your life
would look a lot better it really would
so
let's try to separate whether we hate
his opinion on any particular topic
because i disagree with him on this
particular one i'm going to talk about
but i just love the fact i just love the
fact that he expresses himself with no
remorse
here's what he said in a tweet her elder
did he said whatever your politics
we should all recognize liz cheney's
selfless courage in standing up to the
trump tidal wave
wyoming republicans are going to enter a
congressional career today i guess this
was yesterday but nothing will wash away
the role she played standing up for
democracy and the constitution
now
i like
the fact that he knew he would get
absolutely crapped on today
for that opinion and he still put it out
there
still put it out there
i love that
he shows his work
right he gives his reasons
shows his work that's all i ask of
anybody
if we could learn to appreciate
somebody who acts the way he does
even when we disagree
now we would be so far ahead so far
ahead
all right but here's what i think about
liz cheney
i would i would buy into the um the
selfless
courage part this is geraldo's
characterization
um
i would buy into it being a selfless act
for the country under the following
condition
that the way she had acted had presented
some kind of balance
that she was open for example to
let's say open to an argument on both
sides
and acted in a way that her rhetoric
showed an openness to know to find out
what happened
as opposed to
a
captain ahab mission to kill a white
whale or an orange whale in this case
at what point did liz cheney say we
don't know the motivation of the
protesters
but a harvard study just said that the
vast majority of of them believed that
they were saving the republic
not overthrowing it
now if trump was the primary persuader
of the group
and the group had been persuaded that
they're trying to save the republic
isn't that completely different
than the way she has
presented it so far
now independent of what evidence
specific evidence gets
presented
if you don't start with the context
being right
you're not an honest player
so i don't know what was happening in
liz cheney's head i try to be consistent
about saying i don't know what people
are thinking
but we can say for sure
that her actions
did not display any balance
who would disagree
did her actions
show that she was open to an argument
and discovery or did it look like she
had an opinion she was trying to just
prove no matter what
so
you know i get her oldest point
that it takes a lot of courage to go
across the go against the uh mainstream
and she had to know she had paid for it
she had to know there would be a price
right
so i would get i would uh accept the
fact that it's um courage
so i would accept courage but i'm not so
sure about selfless because i feel as
though her actions strongly suggested
that it was a personal it looked
personal
now again we can't we don't know what
she's thinking
but if you act in a way that doesn't
have balance in a situation that just
screams for balance
you know you should have balance in that
situation more than any situation
especially if you're a republican
looking at a republican if you can't
have balance in that situation
one has to assume that there's something
else going on
and and i do
[Applause]
all right um
i would like to revisit this idea
um
so edward
edward loose tweeted this i don't know
who he is but he's just somebody on
twitter
he twittered uh
i guess he's a reporter of some kind
i've covered extremism and violent
ideologies around the world over my
career
uh have never come across a political
force more nihilistic dangerous and
contemptible than today's republicans
nothing close
really
nihilistic would be people who
don't want to follow the rules
don't want to follow the rules
would republicans be a group that
doesn't want to follow the laws and the
constitution of the united states
there's someone who actually is smart
enough to write sentences and use
twitter
who believes that the most central thing
about republicans that they're rule
followers
constitution
bible the law of the land
there's nothing that defines republicans
more than wanting to follow the rules
and making sure other people do as well
nothing defines them more
periods that's that's almost baked into
the definition of conservative right
conservative let's do it the way we've
been doing it follow the rules
all right
but anyway this is this one person's
view that
that the republicans are opposite of
what it looks to me and they're
dangerous and contemptible
okay
now clearly
some republicans are dangerous as some
of every group are right
but here is the shocking part uh general
michael hayden ex-cia director
uh
agreed with this tweet
and he said i agree and i was the cia
director
so the guy who was the cia director
believes that republicans today
are more nihilistic dangerous and
contemptible
than anything else around the world
such as al qaeda
taliban
just to pick a couple of examples
now
i'm not going to disagree with his
characterization because that's not the
point
the point is that we finally got a
direct confession
it's a direct confession
in his opinion the republicans are
as bad as this
and that would be
a complete
a complete explanation of why the cia
and the fbi apparently colluded for the
russia collusion
hoax
and probably they're colluding again
he says it directly
that he believed that the threat of the
republicans was greater than external
threats
so if you would be willing to you know
assassinate al-qaeda
what would you be willing to do to a
greater threat than al-qaeda
he doesn't say
but i appreciate the transparency he's
saying he's basically
saying that there would be nothing
if you read between the lines
it suggests
that there's nothing you wouldn't do now
let me say
let me say there's nothing wrong with
that
and a little bit i'm going to agree with
sam harris and it's going to make your
head just
blow up
i agree with general hayden that if
in this one narrow sense i agree if you
if you really believed that this group
was as dangerous as as he apparently
says he does
then you would break some rules to stop
him because you would murder hitler
wouldn't you
i would
i would break a rule to murder hitler
right so he's basically saying
you know that the the republicans are
worse than
al qaeda worsen external threats
so he doesn't say that he would break a
rule to stop them but i think that's
perfectly implied
if you're the director of the cia
and there's something that's like a
mortal threat to your country
i feel like it's implied that you might
bend a rule to stop it
and if you wouldn't what's wrong with
you
would you want anybody who wouldn't bend
the rule in that case i wouldn't want to
be around somebody who wouldn't bend the
rules
in that case
um
but
here's the problem
the fake news
is what's
our main problem and we're being
distracted
i'm going to go to the white board and
i'm going to tie it all together you
ready for this
tying it all together
here's how i see the world
i see the fake news
creates extremism
and then the fbi encourages the
extremists
and then
not in every case but in some notable
cases such as russia collusion
and uh
you know there may be something with the
contraband laptop so basically every
time we see the people in charge who
should be protecting us doing sketchy
stuff
it makes the extremism worse
does it not
so between the fake news and the fact
that we don't trust the people who are
supposed to be protecting us
this creates a feedback loop that
creates more fake news more money
etc
so this is the answer to the question
why don't they ask the would you kill
hitler
question
the question that the media won't ask
because they make money by not asking it
is
if you believe the fake news
if you believe what the news is saying
why wouldn't you murder about
republicans
if you believe the news
right
so the news can't ask the question
because they're the problems
so
everybody who thinks that the extremists
on the left are the problem have been
duped by the fake news
everyone who believes that the
extremists on the right are the problem
have been duped by the fake news
so general hayden and we'll talk about
sam harris later both
duped by the fake news now i don't think
that either of them
seem to quite grok
how strong the news is its persuasive
ability in other words its ability to
make you believe something that
absolutely couldn't be true
the news is good at that
i believe i
i believe yesterday alone i believed two
hoaxes until
until i got corrected
that's just yesterday
i fell for two
yesterday
that's just one day and i fell for two
hoaxes
now they were on social media they
weren't in the regular news but it's so
easy to fall for a hoax
right
any if you ever see me
mocking somebody from falling for a hoax
you should correct me
because you shouldn't mock the person
for falling for a hoax
you should be mad at the hoaxer
because the reason that hoaxes are a
thing is that they work
right it's not always the fault of the
person who believed it we can get better
at not believing stuff but it's not
really the fault of the person who
believed it it's more the person who
created the hoax
so we have this system in which the
people who are causing the problem are
telling us that it's other people and
we're believing them
and the tell for that is that they won't
ask the only question
that matters
the only question that matters
hey democrat if you believe what you're
saying about republicans
would you break all the rules including
an election rule
to stop them from power and let me say
clearly that i would
i would
if i believed the fake news about trump
i would
break a law to stop him
wouldn't you
if you believed it
now the difference between me and
general hayden and sam harris we'll talk
about in a moment is that i don't i
don't believe what they believe
but if i did i wouldn't act the way they
act i would act pretty aggressively
so they have this weird dichotomy where
their actions and their words are not
aligned
or at least they're not willing to admit
it
although i think sam harris came pretty
close
we'll talk about that in a minute all
right
uh i had something on the other side of
this
let's tie it all together
oh
so let's talk about
sam harris and then i'll give you my
test for
cognitive dissonance
uh we'll work up to it
so here's a jeff giza tweet he asked me
on twitter this question how would you
rank the following forces
based on their impact on today's
political discord all right so which of
these things do you think is causing the
most
political division
media distrust
social media algorithms
foreign intel operations
perverse political incentives
specific corrupt political actors
politicization of fed of the fed
federal bureaucracy
and economic shifts
now all of those have an impact
but the but the main one is left off the
list
the one that's left off the list is not
it's not media mistrust
our problem is not media mistrust
our problem is the media
it's not that i don't trust them
it's that they're not trustable
it's not my fault
did i do something wrong by not trusting
people who lie to me
how's that my fault
i feel like i'm doing it right
but not trusting people who have a track
record of lying to you feels like that's
right that's right in the sweet spot
right there
so it's interesting how blind we can be
to what's happening because and i'm i i
don't mean to make fun of uh you know
jeff because he's a smart observer
in fact you should follow him he's a
good follower on twitter
it's just that no matter who you are
it's so easy to lose sight that the
media is actually just
manipulating and hypnotizing us for
their own benefit not yours
and it's just so easy to lose sight of
it somehow it's the public is you know
we're extremists and
we're not following the news and we're
not doing their own research it is not
our problem
it might be our problem to fix but it's
not we didn't cause it
we're just being people
all right
so in my opinion um the fake news is
what makes us fight and if you fix the
fake news extremism would disappear
it would disappear
have you ever have you seen lately what
the left
thinks about me personally
have you seen any of my social
traffic lately
think about the things that people have
said about me
almost or maybe 100 of it is based on
incorrect information
so there are really bad bad feelings
about me
but i think zero of them actually know
my opinion
they've heard it from somebody else or
from somebody else so basically we're
all suffering under insanely bad
information
and it's causing us to hate each other
where does this bad information come
from
well in my case a lot of it is on social
media
but
do you think the people on social media
would be
coming after me every day
if they did not believe fake news
let me
explain if they knew what my actual
opinions were
they wouldn't have much problem with
them
or at least they'd you know disagree
with an assumption but they wouldn't
think i was you know hitler myself
and i think that that's largely true of
of all of us
i believe that if you put me in a room
with the
leftist lefty and the rightist righty
you know extremists on both sides
that i could find out what information
we differed on
and probably bring them together
the leftist left and the right is right
i believe if if nobody else were in the
room
and i was allowed to give them accurate
information
i actually think i could get them on the
same page
no matter how left and no matter how
right now the
now the exception would be if they're
just being crazy right
if they have an interest
and they're not in deep cognitive
distance if they have an interest
i could do it
now what happens if somebody's in
cognitive dissonance
how do they know and how do you know
well i'm going to give you an example so
sam harris was on the uh
triggered nomitry triggered nometry
podcast which is a big
big very good podcast
and
he said directly
that trump was such a menace
and especially the trump university was
such an example of something that was
far worse
that anything biden is accused of not
only
not only worse than what biden may have
done for sure
but even worse
than what biden is accused of you know
accused of
maybe some bad dealings with uh ukraine
for example
and
and in sam harris's
view
the media suppressing the hunter laptop
story
to get biden elected was
legitimate
and he agrees that the news faking the
news to keep trump out of office
literally faking the news
it was justified
because trump is such a risk
what do you think of that
here's the problem
did you just say to yourself damn that
sam harris that that freaking sam harris
that guy's there's something wrong with
that guy right
okay i'm gonna disagree with all of you
do you know what's wrong with sam harris
nothing
nothing
he's a victim of the news
he's a victim of the news he actually
believes the news
or he believes some subset of the news
that got him to this point so if you
think the problem is with sam harris
again you're being diverted
the problem is the news
if the news told him the truth
i'm pretty sure his opinion would be
different
all right
so i do
i i give him an a plus for intellectual
honesty
and he's saying basically i'm okay with
breaking the rules
if you're stopping a you know mortal
threat
i totally agree with that
i would break a rule all day long to
stop somebody from getting killed
right now of course you know you got
this slippery slope if everybody's if
everybody is breaking the rules blah
blah blah but i don't think that counts
if you're talking about killing hitler
nobody thinks that killing hitler is a
slippery slope do they
well if you can kill hitler next thing
you know you're going to be murdering
toddlers no no special case
i think we can handle special cases
without worrying about
uh the slippery slope every single time
so the real problem is is um
is sam harris experiencing cognitive
dissonance
or am i
and in this case i'll be a proxy for
many of you in the audience
am i
and you experiencing cognitive
dissonance about trump
and and you see maybe like the hitler
that
some are afraid of or is sam harris and
people who would agree with him
suffering here's your test
to find out
all right here's your
test can you argue the other side
that's it
can you argue the other side if you can
take the other person's perspective and
and argue it in a full-throated balanced
way
then you probably do not have cognitive
dissonance
if you can't do it
and you change the subject or you start
going off on the person
you probably do right
so if i said to you okay
and i'll just use sam as my my
experiment
i'll say all right sam you've made a
claim that the trump university thing is
worse than anything biden has done or is
even accused of doing
i'm going to take your point of view and
i'm going to argue it
right
here's my argument
trump did something with trump
university which shows that he cannot be
trusted
and somebody who is
who would do something so blatant should
never be president
and therefore that gives us cause to
doubt anything else he ever does because
that example gives us a clear pattern of
his
personality and his priorities
did i do it
did i take his point of view and argue
it
in a way that shows i understand the
argument
now i'm not saying you need to agree
with the argument that's not the point
i'm not trying to convince you
i'm just saying can i take that argument
and argue it
did i succeed
right
now i had a problem with the trump
university too
but remember what trump promised us
do you remember his promise
i'm no angel
i'm gonna do for you what i've been
doing for myself
which is you know maybe break some rules
and make stuff work
that's what he said
and when i when i supported him i
thought wow he's going to be expensive
he's going to break a whole bunch of
stuff but he might do some
some things that can't be done otherwise
so i've always characterized trump as
being someone who can't do easy things
such as staying out of trouble
but he can do some impossible things
such as
the abraham accords and you know
shaking hands with kim jong-un until
that problem basically went away
right so there's some things he can do
that just other people couldn't do and
that's what i was buying
i thought that's what i was buying and i
thought it'd be expensive
because i thought there would be some
division in the country and i thought
it'd be expensive so i got what i
thought i was buying
an imperfect person who had a set of
skills
that
were right for the times
in some very specific ways
now do you think that sam harris could
take my argument and
and argue it back to me
i don't know but that would be the test
if he could take my argument and present
it in in a full throat
then i would say to him okay all right
well that looks like you've looked at
all the facts and maybe our priorities
are different but you know i see where
you're coming from
but
his current argument that the trump
university thing is worse than maybe
colluding with ukraine or you know being
victim of potentially blackmail of
ukraine or something like that
that's
i mean on its surface it looks like
cognitive dissonance
to to this audience i'm sure
but i don't think you can be sure the
cognitive dissonance is not on your end
can you how do you know it's not on your
end
by definition you don't know
i would
i would propose this test and see if you
can do it
see if you can make an argument that
agrees with sam harris
right even though you don't believe it
see if you can make the argument if he
can
if you can
then maybe you're looking at it
objectively
if you can't there's no chance you're
being objective no chance
right now of course there are some
people whose arguments are just so crazy
you can't you can't even make an
argument on their on their side
but i don't think that's the case with
sam
i think sam shows you his work
and i can reproduce it
yeah the character of this person is
such it's been demonstrated by these
past things which we have some
confirmation of
why would you trust such a person
in such an important job it's a very
easy argument to make
all right
so
there's a good test for you
see if you can argue the other side
um
and
all this stuff about his big fake
enemies now here's i think this is sort
of related to this
so
i asked
i did a little
twitter poll
and i said that i predicted that
republicans would be hunted if
biden got elected i predicted that in
2020 and i asked people if they thought
that that prediction had been realized
and 80 percent of the people who
answered who are probably mostly
right-leaning
said that indeed it appears to them
republicans are being hunted in a
variety of different ways from january 6
on
now phil bump
who i believe writes for washington post
right
he
wanted to mock me and
there were there were two tweets and
with two
separate but related
predictions
one was that
you'd be hunted
but the related tweet in the same thread
said that there's a good chance you
would be dead
in a year
if biden got elected
now the trouble is with a prediction
like that there's a good chance
what do you interpret as a good chance
of being dead
go
if i
what is the minimum percentage of the
chance that you would say fits a good
chance
some would say 51.
some would say 10
some say 50 25 50 50.
now remember
this is a good chance of being dead
if you talk about the chances of being
dead
any percentage seems like too much
doesn't it
so in this context i was thinking more
like five or ten percent chance of being
dead
you know two percent something like that
and
what did biden do as soon as he got
elected
it took a little longer than a year
but the next thing you know we're
talking about nuclear war with russia
that was all biden
biden actually got us into a serious
conversation about nuclear war with a
nuclear superpower
now i don't think it was that close
but it was close enough to talk about it
so when i say there was a good chance i
was thinking five percent
you know it would be ridiculous to think
that you are most likely going to be
dead in the year
what is what is it about
anybody on the left who would believe
that i thought that
would anybody interpret it as i thought
there was a greater than 50 chance that
you individually would be dead in a year
because of who got elected
who would believe that i would actually
predict that
but it's provocative enough to say that
there's a good chance
five percent
yeah
so
yeah so
open borders fentanyl deaths
yeah
correct
but i was thinking uh in terms of civil
war as well
so
phil decides to be my personal critic
and uh he's he's got an argument
he wants you to see
but um
to me it looks like uh cognitive
distance that's what it looks like
and here's my uh here's my guide for
identifying an npc
now i've been using the npc thing as
sort of a metaphor from
uh
is that the right word is it a metaphor
for uh the simulation that some people
are just scenery
and i don't mean that literally i mean
it could be true literally but i don't
mean it literally
what i mean is that there are certain
number of people who will only say the
most obvious thing that you say in a
situation
for example
if i were to tweet
i believe that
let's say
i believe that uh we'll never make it to
venus or something whatever it is some
sciency thing what is the most obvious
thing that somebody would tweet
the most obvious thing would be oh the
dilbert guy
disagrees with science
that'd be the most obvious thing right
so that would be an npc kind of approach
the other thing is a personal attack
if somebody just says there's something
wrong with you
i mean that these are both personal
attacks but it doesn't have to be a
comic reference
so if somebody says to rob reiter let's
say rob reiner doesn't tweet
what is the most obvious thing that
somebody's going to say if they disagree
with his point of view
they're going to say oh
i guess that's why they called it
meathead when he played that character
years ago
it's the most obvious thing you would
say
how many people say the most obvious
thing every time he tweets a lot
every time he tweets
people go into the comments and say
well
i guess that's why they call them me
head
that it
now the people who tweet that
are you unaware that it's the most
obvious thing to say
because i don't know the answer that
or are you just trying to be first
with the most obvious thing
i don't really know what's going through
their minds
the other is
if i say i have a technical problem as i
did today what's the most obvious thing
to say if
i specifically
me
if i have a technical problem what's the
most obvious thing to say well reboot
yeah
boomer
yeah oh boomer boomer right
now
sometimes that might actually be the the
full explanation but it's also just the
most obvious thing to say
the other thing is
people will imagine that you're thinking
something dumb or wrong
so if somebody says
you know this policy is bad somebody's
going to say well what you really mean
the most obvious thing is to doubt
that they're thinking what they're
saying
or how about the hypocrisy one
if i say
you republicans did a bad thing
somebody will always come into the
comments and say some completely
unrelated thing
well the other time the other team did
that too
it's the most obvious thing now
sometimes it's worth saying oh your team
did it too so you know there's value in
that but it's also the most obvious
thing you're gonna say
so don't always say the most obvious
thing
it makes you look like an npc
even if you're not so i've been just
tagging everybody who says the most
obvious thing with the npc
you know hashtag npc
and let me tell you it changes the
conversation immediately
when you tell somebody can you try to
avoid saying the most obvious thing
they don't know what to say
because they they can't get beyond it
most people don't know how to get beyond
the most obvious thing
so they it just shuts them down
yeah now if you're doing a tv show to
entertain people
in politics then you always do the
hypocrisy thing the both sides the what
about ism because that's part of the
entertainment
but
if you're making an honest argument and
you think that what somebody did
somewhere else at a different time in a
different situation is relevant to this
discussion
you know then you're just being
political right
so i think that we are we've all become
fake enemies
do you think that i couldn't get along
with the leftist lefty if they didn't
know
or if they'd never seen my social media
easily
easily
not not any problem at all
i mean i live in california northern
california i'm surrounded by the lefties
of the lefties and i have no problem
with it at all
now i'm not sure i get invited to as
many places
so they might have a problem with me but
one-on-one
i never have any difficulty do you
do you ever have any any difficulty
one-on-one with any american citizen
ah
i don't
see and and the the news has convinced
us that we're at each other's uh necks
the number of people i've seen suggest
that we're close to an actual um
you know a violent civil war
just blows my mind
we could not be further from that
do you know how we're not
at the cusp of the civil war
do you want me to prove it to you
just walk outside
say say hi to the first person you see
do they want to kill you or they want to
want to say hi
there's no anger out there at all about
each other
not on an individual basis like we all
have this generic anger about the other
group
but we don't have individual anger
and we don't have a reason for it
we are so far
from being divided in reality we're only
divided mentally because the news has
made us divided why does the news divide
us
for money
they divide us for money
and we go along with it because we're
entertained by it largely
uh you have to turn the hunger up i
don't know what that means
oh you have to turn the hunger up to see
the revolution so you're saying so if
things went wrong it would turn violent
now do you know what happened if the
united states got hungrier
we'd uh band together to feed each other
that's what we do
do you know republicans would do if the
democrat for some reason
only democrats were starving
they would immediately form
some kind of help to feed them
and i hope it works the other way
i'm a little less confident about it but
i think it works the other way
now when it comes right down to it we're
going to take care of each other we
always have always will that's just the
way it works
and and this whole division thing
is entirely manufactured by the fake
news
and we're buying into it don't buy into
it
you you do not have to dislike anybody
it's just not required
you can just break free
all right let's see if i uh forgot
anything i was going to talk about oh
yeah
this declassification center i believe i
have the best question on this topic
and i've not seen it addressed
and the best question on the topic of
declassifying the mar-a-lago
documents is can a president declassify
things by his actions
meaning it's obvious that he meant it to
be declassified
and i think the answer is yes
now i'm not the constitutional expert
but
um this is what i read today that i
didn't realize that both the george w
bush and obama had both signed executive
orders which are still in force
and they and it gave the presidents
whoever the president is sweeping
authority to declassify secrets
and here's the important part
do not have to follow the mandatory
classification
declassification procedures
that all other government officials do
and i'm sorry i took this off a website
i meant to give it credit
if somebody knows where i took that from
you probably read it too
could you give credit to wherever this
came
from i think there was a good addition
to the conversation but it was on a
right-leaning website somewhere
anyway
um
in my opinion
if a president who has full sweeping
authority to declassify
says
take these boxes and put them in my
residence
he's declassified them
who disagrees with me
if the president who doesn't have to
follow any procedure
says take these top secret things and
move them to this non-top secret
facility
they're declassified
now
you could say you don't like that
you can say you don't like it but how in
the world are you going to get a court
of 12 people to think that's not the
case
do you think you can get 12 jurors
who are going to say oh no that's that's
not declassification
yes the president can declassify any way
he wants
he doesn't have to use any specific
words
doesn't have to
write anything down doesn't have to do a
document doesn't need to tell anybody
doesn't need to tell anybody
doesn't need to tell anybody
there are no requirements on the
president
that's it so if you put me on the jury
i'm just going to say
i don't know
i mean you can't prove that he didn't
declassify him and by his actions it
sure looks like he did
and i would say that's that's the end of
that case
if you can't even know if they're if
they're classified or not why are we
even talking about it
now keep in mind when we talk about it
in the news you know we're just people
talking about it
we can act like
you know we have some certainty that we
don't have oh definitely declassified or
oh definitely wasn't
but what if you're a jury
the jury would have to be you know
beyond a reasonable doubt
certain that these had not been
declassified
how in the world would any jury be sure
of that if the
if the attorney says you know he didn't
need to follow any rules and by his
actions it's obvious he meant them to be
declassified
would you agree that if somebody takes
something out of a top secret place and
intentionally puts it in a low security
place
that they have changed the
you know the de facto decline
classification
you don't need to get all 12 to agree to
that but there's no way you don't get
nine of them to agree
am i wrong
how in the world
do you not get at least some of those 12
to say you know
that is enough of a gray area that i'm
not going to convict somebody on that
let's say i'm looking at this comment
or set
anywhere about document if he writes it
anywhere about or sets of documents they
become immediately declassified
yeah
so i don't know if he said something
that would also qualify but maybe he did
i mean
suppose trump has said and this is not
in evidence but suppose he had said to
the gsa people who were packing up the
boxes
suppose they said hey this is top secret
stuff
you know we have to handle it
differently and suppose trump just said
oh no just
put it in the boxes and send it to
mar-a-lago
that's declassification right in my
opinion it would be
so i think he's gonna be fine on that
i don't think there's any any legal risk
at all on that
all right
um
so even newt gingrich pointed out that
liz cheney said
quote i will do whatever it takes to
keep donald trump out of the oval office
and news says is it any wonder most of
us think the january 6 committee is a
stalinist show trial
she is so bitterly anti-trump how could
she be trusted
now again newt is doing a little
mind reading
you know he's looking into her mind and
seeing that she's bitterly anti-trump
but i feel like that's an evidence
the anti-trump part is clearly an
evidence and the bitter part
it looks better to me
i mean i can't read her mind but if
anybody ever looked bitter
that's that's about as bitter looking as
you could ever look
all right
so pretty sure i covered everything i
want to cover um oh one other thing
so uh i submitted a comic to
my syndication company this week
and it was uh
rejected
for content
and i had to rewrite it
and i believe the rewrite has been
accepted so i completely changed the
joke
but if you belong to the locals platform
and you're a subscriber
sometime later today you will see the
comic that the rest of the world will
not see
because it's too dangerous apparently so
you'll see the original version that's
not yet published
uh will you it's um see i think the date
is september 25th when it would come out
and you'll get to see the one that my
editor said
nope nope nope
nope
what was the topic
the topic was dilbers company
created a robot
that looked
too much like an attractive woman
and
it went from there
so i had to rewrite that
but it wasn't sexual
it was not sexual
yeah
well
what a what it was supposed to be
what it was supposed to be is a comment
on the fact that we will have robots
that are more attractive than humans
really soon
really soon and that that's going to be
a
civilization
threatening the situation
because once you like your robot better
than people
and why wouldn't you
because keep in mind
your robot will eventually look more
like an attractive
human
than the person you're with
right if you pick a human you'd be
really lucky if you got like a super
beautiful one or super handsome
but the robot's going to be super
beautiful or super handsome if they make
it that way and it's very soon going to
look exactly like a you know an actual
human
so very soon
and what happens if ai
gets into the robot so it can have a
conversation with you just like ai can't
now
and the ai will be interested in what
you're interested in and it will show
interest in you and caring about you
that's better than humans
we're right at the edge right at the
edge and we'll definitely go past it
where the robot will just be better
company and more
more rewarding to spend time with
yeah we're very close to that but anyway
that was my point but the risk was that
women would uh
women might take it differently
now i don't think my editor was wrong by
the way
so i want to be clear
i think my editor got this one right
you know the job of the editor is not
just to
uh
you know make sure that the editor stays
out of trouble but to keep me out of
trouble
so part of their job is to keep me
employed
keep me from getting cancelled and my
editor's opinion which i trust in this
situation
was that this would get me canceled
so you'll get to see it on locals
all right
oh talk about self-hypnosis that makes
you more horny for your own mate
i did it and she responded interesting
well we'll not talk about that today but
that's a topic we'll revisit
all right um
the golden age of walking on eggshells
no i think we are at the golden age
i really think we are
it never looks like it when you enter it
it is going to look like it in
retrospect
all right
uh
a micro lesson for kids leaving for
their freshman year at college lesson
for who the parents are the kids
not sure what what you want on that
uh
reparations
yeah i do i i do have a reparations
comic coming i think that's gonna get uh
i think my reparations comic is going to
get
get stopped too
now i did tell you that i don't plan to
retire
i plan to get cancelled did i tell you
that
because i thought about do i really want
to just like
fade away
so i think i'm going to make dilbert
more and more dangerous until i get
canceled that's the way i want to go out
i want to go out and cancel
all right that's all for now
i will talk to you
tomorrow youtube
and spa
