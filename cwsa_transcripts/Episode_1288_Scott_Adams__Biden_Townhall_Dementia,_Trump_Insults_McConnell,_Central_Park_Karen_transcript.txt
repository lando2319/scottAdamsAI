glasses anchor challenge to steiner

and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes
everything better except the energy grid
in texas it's called the simultaneous
sip and it happens now
ah yeah
yep let me say this if you're in texas
have some warm coffee today you deserve
it
let's talk about the news so the
mystery of coven continues the mystery
being
why this is sometimes subside
so the mystery in india is deepening
they have a dramatic
drop in covid hospitalizations
infections and everything else
nobody knows why nobody knows why
what does that tell you about our
scientific understanding of
the coronavirus well there is some
gigantic variable that's just sort of
hanging out there
now it's definitely not
hydroxychloroquine we would we would
know
that for sure because it's the first
thing you'd look for
right it literally would be the first
thing you look for
it's like hey india's has a big drop in
infections what are they doing
differently so
i would say you can't say a hundred
percent but
95 99 odds that the
the answer is not hydroxychloroquine
now somebody says blood type but why
would that make the infections
just stop or or
or plunge because it's not as if all the
people with one blood type
got the thing and then you ran out of
those people
we don't have any kind of infection
that's close enough
to have uh expired an entire category of
people
i don't think so here's another mystery
to overlay on top of the first mystery
that there is covid seasonality and i
had a little exchange with somebody on
twitter
who knows more than i do about this
stuff and send me a list of
published papers about uh flu
virus seasonality and
here was a little tidbit that apparently
around the world flu viruses
always peak in february
are you confused around the world
so places where it's winter and places
where it's summer
at the same time whether it's winter or
summer
february causes a decline worldwide
in infections why
why now if it's the temperature
february should be the worst at least in
the winter places right
but winter and summer places all have a
sharp or at least they peak that's the
highest point
so if you thought that the whole reason
there is seasonality
is because of the temperature meaning
that it either doesn't kill the virus
when it's outdoors
or it causes people to spend more time
indoors
if you thought it was one of those
things
apparently it's not it doesn't seem to
be related to the weather
somebody says it's because february is
28 days
i would hate to think that's true but i
know what you're saying
that you know if you just compared it to
the month on either side it would look
lower because there are fewer days so
fewer
fewer people died that month or
something i it's not that
i think we can assume that the
scientists
know how many days are in a month and
may have adjusted for that
so let's assume it's not because
february has 28 days
although i love that i love the
suggestion
because every now and then you have to
remind yourself
you have to remind yourself that that
the world can make that kind of mistake
it's not crazy but i don't think i don't
think that's what it is
let me let me give you my speculation
you ready for some non-scientific
speculation
here's why i think february might be the
low month
because christmas is worldwide
or ish not completely worldwide
but no matter where you are christmas is
still december 25th
and people still get together in ways
that they would not normally get
together so here's my speculation
that what's different about christmas
is that people get together in
combinations they don't normally get
together
and so you're taking a bunch of people
who are already not
socially isolating well and they just do
it even worse
but not only do they do it worse but
it's a different combination of people
who have traveled from all over
so in theory december january should be
your worst months
just because of the lack of social
distancing
by february you've kind of hunkered down
with your crowd meaning that the people
you see in february
all month are the people you saw a month
the people you saw in december was a
whole bunch of different people from all
over
so could it be that there's literally
nothing to seasonality
except what it does to the mix of people
coming in
and mixing with each other is that
possible
um i'll just put that out there that i
don't know that we know why there is
seasonality
all right retail retail sales
jumped 5.3 in january economists thought
it would be 1.1
so apparently the stimulus is working
and
the stimulus worked so well there's a
question whether you should do another
one
might be too much i'm not really worried
about too much stimulus
that's the last thing i'm worried about
at the moment but
something to worry about so that's good
news uh on the bad news
still millions of people i've seen 3
million 4.2 million so i don't know what
it is at the moment
without power in texas and
you know unprecedented or maybe
precedent
cold temperatures there and people dying
people dying in their cars
because they're trying to use their cars
to stay warm
and the carbon monoxide gets them in
some cases
so this is a major uh
tragedy but it also has to say something
about texas doesn't it
do do you let texas off the hook for
this
do you say that the way texas managed
their energy
has nothing to do with the outcome i
don't know
you know could it be that nobody could
have seen this coming
is that true nobody could have seen this
coming that you'd have an
extra cold day and would do this to
texas
i just don't know but i don't think we
can say
texas is this gigantically well-managed
state and california is a disaster
when at least right now i've got
electricity in california
so at the moment at the moment i've got
a little advantage
let me give you a little uh life
uh advice
one day when i was in my senior year of
college in upstate new york
i went to a job interview for a job i
would take
after college if i got the job and
it was it was february coincidentally
and my car broke down
on the road between college and my
interview in a different city
now i happened to break down on a chunk
of road at night
or at least after dark in which there
was no other traffic because it was
upstate new york and
after a certain time at night sometimes
there's just no cars
and i didn't bring a jacket i actually
went on a trip in february without a
jacket because i was just going to go to
my car
and cart a building and i didn't have a
nice jacket for an interview
so i didn't wear one so my car stops
breaks down in the middle of winter in
february in upstate new york
has anybody ever been to upstate new
york in february
oh it's cold it's really cold
and i get out of my car and you know
i thought to myself okay there's no
other traffic and there's no other
civilization
within walking distance or running
distance
and i said to myself i know that if i
try to go backwards from where i would
just came from
it's too far to civilization i wouldn't
be able to find a house or any place to
get warm
but what i didn't know is if that was
also true ahead of me
so i didn't know if i were to run
forward
maybe i could find a house before i died
now when i say before i died i mean that
literally because it was
really cold and if i didn't mention it
didn't bring a jacket
that's how smart i was and so i started
to run for it
and you can't run very far when the
temperature is
zero issue or whatever it was because
your
hands and your feet start to freeze and
your ankles don't move
like they just become frozen and you're
just like running on sticks after a
while
and everything hurts and you start to
get numb
and you say to yourself i think i'm
actually gonna die
i might actually die and
i made a promise to myself that night if
you haven't heard this story before
i promised myself that if i lived
and it was pretty iffy at that point
that if i lived
uh i would sell my car for a one-way
ticket to california
and never see another effin snowflake
again
for the rest of my life well the story
ended with a station wagon finally drove
by it was a
shoe salesman who had been doing some
work out of town and
i stood in the middle of the road and
made sure he couldn't go around me
and he saved my life drove me back to
campus
and a few months later i graduated and
traded my car
for a one-way ticket to california to my
sister
and uh it was a one-way ticket i wasn't
planning on coming back
to where there was snow and so i moved
to california and i live here in
northern california and one of my
survivalist methods
and and i built my adult life around a
survivalist
kind of uh attitude is that i wanted to
live somewhere where i could not
die because i went outdoors
that was it i don't want to die
because i went outdoors i can go
outdoors here
in most seasons and if i bring even a
light jacket i'm going to survive
i might not like it on some days but i'm
going to survive
in texas it's getting pretty iffy there
are people literally dying from it
so part of you your decision about where
to live should be
what happens if things go wrong because
you know if you live if you live 100
years
something's going to go wrong sooner or
later so that's one of the reasons i
chose to live where i live
all right so good luck to texas
i hope you can pull out of this this is
just horrible have you noticed that
iphones are made
to break do you ever wonder about that
you take on a brand new iphone
and it's it really looks good i mean the
design is great
but it's slippery it's it's like they
made it out of
like wet soap or something it's like
flips out of your hand
and the only way you can actually have a
phone
that's not guaranteed to be cracked and
broken
is to put an ugly case on it now there's
no such thing as a good looking phone
case
right so apple gets it both ways
they claim that they have you know a
good design and it's something they can
show in their commercials and it looks
great
i mean just look at that thing that's a
good looking phone
but you can't use that phone it's the
greatest mind
that that you think you're just you're
buying a well-designed
product but you can't possibly use it
i mean i know some people use it without
a case and i hear about the people i've
had my phone three years
i've never cracked it okay that's not
typical
most people drop their phone two or
three times a week
i mean i do never broke one yet
because i'll never use a phone with one
hand
without a case so that's my rule would
you like to hear the rule again
never use your iphone with only one hand
unless it has a case on it so if
before i put a case on it i get a new
phone let's say an upgrade
i will only hold it with two hands
period
i just will never use one hand i'll
never do this and i've never
never lost a phone the other thing i'll
never do i will never use my phone
over a body of water
how many phones have you replaced in
your family because somebody used their
phone
in the pool or in the bathtub
yeah or in the beach never
in any circumstance will this phone
be directly above a body of water how
many phones have i lost
because i dropped them in bodies of
water zero
how many have my various family members
lost
because they dropped them in bodies of
water
a lot that's a big number right
so if you're wondering if apple makes
them intentionally slippery
so they'll break i would say probably
yes
because how hard would it be to to put
some non-stick
surf surface on it how hard would it be
to make it
not breakable not hard
right how hard would it be to make this
not breakable
they would just have to put a a screen
protector on it when it ships
it would be the easiest thing in the
world there's no way it's unintentional
when i worked with a phone company local
phone company years ago
and i i would get to see the discussions
that happened you know within the
company
obviously and one of the discussions was
about one of our
most profitable lines of business which
we called
we called it a line of business was late
payment on your phone bill
because people would be penalized a fee
for being late on their phone bill but
since everybody needs a phone
or at least in those days you needed a
landline phone
you were going to pay eventually because
even if you moved and tried to get
new phone service you couldn't do it
until you paid your old leafy
so it was this you know this lock on
people that
if they paid late they would have to pay
the late fee
or never have phone service in the
modern world
so what happened do you think when i
brought up the idea
of maybe making it easier for people to
pay on time
so that the customers would not be
inconvenienced by a late fee
we would get our money on time and then
everything would work the way it's
supposed to work
what do you think they said about that
shut up shut up not
not really shut up but nobody wanted to
hear the idea that would reduce our
profits
just that's it it would just reduce our
profits
that's all it would do for the company
now for the customer it would be
terrific
but we wouldn't even have that
discussion
because we liked having built a trap
so that people would fall into it and we
would make money
and that actually happened behind closed
doors
that was an actual conversation in a
real company
about screwing the customers
because it was
easy it was easy and it was really
profitable
that's real now you you tell me that
apple has not had conversations behind
closed doors
about fixing their easily breakable
phone
of course they have do you think there's
no engineer who can figure out how to
make these phones
to not break so easily of course they
have those engineers
of course they just prefer it this way
for whatever reason
all right uh racist central park karen
uh has been apparently she won't have
any jail time
she's the one who uh i guess she tried
to call the police or did call the
police
uh because there was a black man in the
park
who was a bird watcher and by the way if
you've seen a picture of the black man
who's the bird watcher
he is the least uh threatening
most nerd-like human being you've ever
seen
like if there was one person you were
gonna see in a dark alley
and not be afraid of it would be that
bird watcher
if you haven't seen the picture of him
because usually you see the video of
just
the the karen woman uh complaining but
you have to see the picture of the bird
watcher
to understand how completely
non-threatening this guy looked
like if all you're thinking in your mind
your racist mind
is oh a black black male i could see why
she maybe she was afraid
if you're a little racist you're
thinking that but then you see a picture
of him
he's not the guy you're going to be
afraid of in the dark alley
he's just the friendliest looking nerdy
guy right
so she gets released but only after she
went through
what do they call it a comprehensive
respectful program
at the critical therapy center where she
focused on quote
the ways in which ms cooper could
appreciate their racial identities shape
our lives
but we cannot use them to harm ourselves
or others
and because she went through that
program and now she
sees the errors of her ways she was
released without any jail time
and some people are arguing that that
was you know white supremacy or
something
but what do you make of the fact
that she avoided jail time by accepting
brainwashing is that a place we want to
be
i mean do we could there be anything
worse than that i mean it would probably
be it would be hard to come up with
anything that would be worse than that
is that fundamentally different than
what china is doing with the uyghurs
sure you know they've got the gang rape
and the
the other stuff that's pretty bad but
they are brainwashing the wingers
like that's a part of part of the
holocaust over there is they're
brainwashing them
so now we're doing that now we're
brainwashing a citizen
now just to be completely clear i'm not
backing the karen in this story i think
what she did
needs some kind of it should be
addressed
let's say i don't think it should be a
free pass
for her behavior and i don't even mind
that she maybe was exposed to some
sensitivity training and
you know maybe this uh maybe this could
help her in some ways
but is it say is this a thing we want to
make
our thing do we want this precedent
to stand that you can be forced to
attend a brainwashing
event forced to attend brainwashing now
even if
remember i call it brainwashing even if
it's good for you
i call patriotism and the pledge of
allegiance
brainwashing but i think they're really
good for you like it's good to have a
coherent patriotic country
so brainwashing can be good or bad but
do we want to build it into our
our legal system do you want your legal
system
to have brainwashing as
an as a legitimate component
i don't know we want to go there i don't
think so
all right let's get talk politics
finally
ex-president trump is back in the news
and it's interesting again if you didn't
see trump's letter
uh complaining about mitch mcconnell
oh you gotta see it here's one line
from trump's letter about mcconnell
he called him a dour sullen and
unsmiling political hack
that was just one sentence just one
sentence
out of a long document a dower sullen
and un-smiling political act
now just feel
that sentence just feel it
you're imagining trump and you're
imagining mcconnell and now you're
imagining trump writing he was a dour
sullen and unsmiling political hack
that writing that language
is just alive it's just alive
it's like a creature and you forget
after even just you know a month of not
enough trump in our lives
after a month you forget how freaking
good he is at this
this being inciting people and getting
people worked up and using
interesting language and being
impossible to look away
he doesn't know how to be uninteresting
he is so naturally interesting
that i'm just so happy that he's back a
little bit
you know even with just his letter uh so
you have to read that just uh just to
feel
just how his language excites
and i mean excites good and excites bad
like it's so
active and alive uh you just don't see
that from
the other boring politicians all right
um
uh playboy playboy magazine uh their new
cover
is a a singer an artist named kelani
uh and she's posed as both a male a man
and a woman
kind of a image so she she plays two
people on the cover
both of them are her but one is man one
is women so she's the king and queen
of the prom and
apparently the uh the back story is that
she's
uh gender fluid i think is the right
term that she used so she
doesn't identify as either strictly male
or strictly female i believe that's
what gender fluid means in this context
and i said to myself all right
now i totally get that we want to be
a more inclusive society and as you know
nobody has been more supportive of the
lgbtq
and especially the the transgender
community than i have
and i mean it like i just think
everybody is
different from everybody else and that
you know artificially saying this group
of people who are different are
the good ones and these are the bad ones
just doesn't make any sense
i just think everybody's infinitely
different
and let them be themselves as much as
that's
practical right you have to make some
practical considerations
but so i'm i'm as pro-lgbt
as it is possible to be um
but playboy magazine
the whole point of the magazine was to
uh
cater to a certain perspective right a
certain
certain kind of man usually women read
it too but mostly mostly men
and i thought to myself years ago
i don't know if you know this but years
ago when uh hugh hefner himself stepped
down from
active management he put his daughter in
charge
of the magazine christy hefner and as
soon as
hugh hefner put his daughter in charge
of the magazine
i thought to myself well it's just a
matter of time
because there isn't any way they could
survive
with a woman running that magazine now
you may say to yourself you sexist a
woman can do anything a man can do and
that's true
but do you think that a woman any woman
should be in charge of a man's magazine
that
is trying to create an image for men
i mean it doesn't make sense right if i
told you that a man was
uh the ceo of cosmopolitan magazine
or some women-oriented magazine would
you think that made sense
probably not probably not but again you
know you
there's there are always exceptions so
it could have been that the very best
ceo of playboy would have been christy
after you can't rule it out
because she's a woman but it's hard to
imagine
in our world when the whole point of
diversity is that people have different
perspectives
it doesn't make sense that the person
with the least
probably the least appreciation for the
perspective of the magazine
is in charge and here you end up with
something that
for society is a good thing i like it
when society
celebrates people being not all the same
so i do like
the fact that kehlani is on the cover of
a magazine so if you said to me should
she be on the cover of a magazine i'd
say yeah
i like that story you know seems like
she's an
uh she yeah i think she goes by she
is an engaging person why not but
playboy
just feels like maybe that was a mistake
i don't know
uh the story today is that uh
there's a book out claiming that steve
bannon
quote realized that trump was repeating
the same stories over and over and
worried that he had early onset dementia
and then the book goes on to say that
steve bannon thought that uh trump
should have been removed
with a uh amendment 25th amendment
situation for being mentally incompetent
and that
that bannon himself planned to take over
trump's supporters and become president
later
does that even sound slightly true
does that sound even slightly true
because it doesn't to me
yeah i mean have we reached the point
where we could all know
instantly that's not true like do you
have to even talk about it
so here's the thing uh
if if this had stopped if this
if the claim had stopped at bannon was
worried that trump had early onset
dementia
i would have said to myself well that
might have happened
anybody who's a certain age who maybe
repeats a story or forgets something
isn't that the first thing you think
once you reach a certain age
it's on your mind to be sort of looking
for it plus it was in the press etc
so if it had been true that bannon had
wondered you know if there was any like
pre-dementia issues here
maybe i would have said well that could
be true
it could not be true but it could be
true
but when they add the part where bannon
was planning to take over his supporters
and become president
i'm sorry that's not true
remember remember i told you uh how to
tell if something
is a fake news and the standard is
if you can just read it and you shake
your head and you say
well that's not true it's not
all right you can now you might be wrong
once or twice in your life but if you
just use that standard
every time when it looks like this this
sort of story you go that's not
true
it's not all right but
why do we see this story today well
let's take the tucker carlson
uh i wanted to call it like a law or
hypothesis or something
i haven't got a good name for it yet but
tucker carlson always talks about the
the olinsky rule kind of thing where uh
bad people will blame you of whatever
bad behavior they're doing
now i don't know if this
i don't have an opinion that this is
some kind of widespread plan
thing that democrats do but we do
observe
a consistency to it why i don't know
maybe it's just an observational oddity
confirmation bias
maybe there's an underlying reason for
it
maybe it's intentional maybe it's not
but it's certainly
we observe it i don't know why somebody
says it's projection maybe it is
but uh the town hall last night with
biden
uh showcased biden and there was also a
video that went around yesterday
uh the video i think is fake i'm not
sure
but the video looked like biden looking
having
quite a mental episode he was just sort
of
slack jawed and his wife was just
looking at him
and he was just you know he looked like
his brain is shut down
in this video that went around now i i'm
gonna emphasize again
i think the video is fake or
somehow enhanced in some way to make him
look worse than he was
take it out of context maybe whatever
but i think it's a fake video
however when he did his town hall
he did not look sharp
to say the least so the question of
biden's dementia
or mental capacity is in the news and
then coincidentally
there's a claim about trump having
dementia oh isn't that
isn't that a coincidence that the moment
biden is acting like he has dementia
suddenly there's a book we're all
talking about about
you know bannon and trump's dementia
is it coincidence or is it
yet again the tucker carlson observation
that this is not a coincidence that they
blame you of whatever they're doing
or in this case you know they're they're
smearing the story about the dementia
stuff until
trump becomes the shiny object in the
story
which is a good strategy if that's what
they're doing intentionally let's talk
about how
bad that town hall was
and first of all i should point out that
one way to know that your political
system
in your country is suboptimal
if you're having a conversation about
whether your current president
or the one who just left office is the
one with the most
dementia that's not a good place to be
no no that would be like being in texas
in february it's just not a good place
to be
you don't want to be arguing about which
of your potential presidents
the the recent last one or the current
one is the most
dementia adult person that's not a good
sign
wouldn't you like at least one of them
to be maybe not
maybe not that'd be cool
but that's where we are here's the thing
that
made me the happiest you know you
watched biden when he was running for
president and then after he got elected
he continued to say that the reason he
ran
was in large part because the fine
people
hoax that he believed i think
was true now maybe we don't know what he
believed but
let's give him the benefit of a doubt
let's say he believed it was true and he
used it as the basis for running for
office
mentioned it almost every time and then
last night
during the town hall which follows by a
few days
trump's lawyers debunking that hoax in
front of the entire world
biden got to that point where he always
mentions it
and he didn't i mean it was conspicuous
he always mentions it because he's you
know you see the lead up
and where he's going and now now is the
point where he throws in the fine people
oaks
and he didn't is that a coincidence
or does he know that that would get fact
checked because now the lawyers have
have debunked it
i think it's intentional i think there
was an actual conversation
in which somebody said you know maybe
lay off of this fine people hoax
if we wait a few months we can revive it
and people will forget what the lawyer
said
maybe don't know
um biden had a few fact check problems
something about whether he knew there
was a vaccination
when he took office but before he had
said that he obviously knew it everybody
knew it it was a trump vaccination
so he misspoke or something i don't know
or it was dementia
we don't know um
but how did how did cnn cover the fact
checking
what do you think so stephan collinson
one of their uh propaganda demons
who always he always does the negative
trump uh articles on cnn
he mentioned two of biden's and i'll use
his exact word missteps
so while president trump is full of lies
when when biden says things which are
not true
they're missteps all right so that's the
first thing you need to know
it's a misstep and then collinson says
this he goes biden's missteps
paled in comparison to the hurricane of
lies
false statements bitter political
attacks and self-aggrandizement
that regularly dominated trump's
appearances and rally speeches and town
hall events
on conservative media and despite his
characteristic
stumbling so it's a characteristic
stumbling it's
it's not even anything to worry about
really it's more like
a little bit of misstep a little bit of
oh i'd say characteristic stumbling
because if it's characteristic it's
already baked in
you know just characteristic over some
precise figures
oh he didn't he didn't make a gigantic
error
about miss speaking about the
availability of vaccinations
now he uh he stumbled over some precise
figures
so there was there was a little bit of
just a little bit of lack of precision
you know and that's not so bad a little
bit a little bit of lack
just a little bit just yeah just a
little bit of lack of precision
and that's way better than the hurricane
of lies and false statements bitter
political attacks and
self-aggrandizement
from trump i mean that's it's way better
to have just a slight little
technical technical irregularity let's
call it
and nowhere in collinson's review of the
town hall
did he mention china
which is the biggest story the biggest
story of the time town hall
is that biden basically backed
china's policies against
you know the benefits of really the
united states you could you could argue
that was the biggest story and collinson
doesn't even mention it one way or the
other
it's like it didn't exist they're going
to make that disappear
so here's what biden said you have to
you have to watch the video to
understand how bad it is
if you listen to my characterization of
what you said about
china and you say to yourself i feel
like you're
you're spinning that it couldn't have
been that bad right
listen to it yourself you will hear
the president of the united states say
that
president xi's treatment of the uyghurs
who are in concentration camps
being gang raped the hong kong stuff the
the taiwan stuff and biden saying
basically that she has a good reason
for why he's doing these things because
he needs to keep his country unified
and that biden understands those reasons
basically basically
biden backed china's holocaust
and i didn't think i was watching it
like what the first time i watched i had
to replay it
because i thought this isn't happening
is it now if you were wondering
if biden is under the control of china
you can stop wondering because that
pretty much
cleared things up it did if you're
wondering
if china has control over biden i don't
think you would wonder after you saw
that
now can i read biden's mind no do i know
his inner intentions
no do i know if he's intentionally
being nice to china because of any
business dealings or any
you know blackmail they might have about
hunter biden i don't know any
any of that i'm not making any claim
about any of that
i'm just saying that if you watch your
leader if you're
american if you're watching your
president
the appearance is that he's working for
china
i don't i don't say that lightly because
i don't want it to be true
but it sure looks true now of course he
had to
uh correct that and cnn had to
jump into the breach to try to fix
what got broken here and
i'm not sure they made it better so let
me see if i can find uh
the exact quote here that's pretty funny
which i hope i didn't lose um
so what uh caitlyn collins did at cnn is
she
ended up taking two fragments of what
biden said and trying to connect them in
a tweet
so that his incoherent fragments sort of
made sense when you rearrange them
that actually happened doesn't it sound
like i just made that up
that cnn took his sentence fragments
that weren't even complete sentences
when he said them
arrange them so that one fragment would
be closer to another fragment
and it would look like a complete
thought that was
kind of different than what he actually
said
that actually happened and you you watch
my tweet
and see for yourself right use your own
judgment
and ask yourself if that really happened
that they took
two sentence fragments not even complete
sentences
and arranged them to look like they were
they were coherent
that actually happened all right
so of course he had to walk it back when
he was questioned about it
and here's how biden um sort of
uh explained himself
better he said quote so this is after
the town hall i guess he said china is
trying very hard to become a world
leader
true and to get that moniker
and be able to do that they have to gain
the confidence of other countries
biden said back in january i guess
and he said that oh so this was in
january so you said this before the town
hall
and he said as long as they're engaged
in activities
that is contrary to basic human rights
is going to be hard for them to do that
so biden's take on china is
that if they don't manage their own
brand well
that other countries will not give them
the moniker
of a world leader well i guess he showed
them
huh you know i i feel sorry for
president xi
when he found out that according to joe
biden
other leaders around the world might not
give china the moniker
of a world leader if they keep acting
the way they're acting
huh pretty tough on china isn't he so
we definitely have a and i guess in
another comment he said that uh
that china would um essentially pay for
their human rights abuses
so you so he accepts that some of that's
going on but he says that they'll
you know they'll pay for it in some
indistinct way that has nothing to do
with him apparently
um well
here's a little more uh background
breitbart
is reporting this that the
secretary of state under biden whose
name is
blinken was the co-founder of a
consulting company called wes
exec advisors which according to the
washington free beacon
so i guess you'd have to make sure this
is correct
i quote helped u.s universities raise
money from china
without running afoul of pentagon grant
requirements can you think of anything
worse what would be worse
than trying to get chinese money
influencing u.s universities
like literally what would be worse than
that
that's the worst thing i could even
think of like short of actual
immediate violence what would be worse
than helping china get financial
influence over u.s universities now the
way it's
way stated is that helping them raise
money
but what happens when you raise money
from somebody
they have influence right
if somebody gives you millions of
dollars they they've got a little bit of
influence over you
and our own secretary of state allegedly
and
you know i feel like i would need a fact
check on this this this feels like the
kind of thing that
might not necessarily be true once you
look into it
uh but that's the reporting we have
right now
is that he helped us universities raise
money from china
now what could be more disqualifying
than that
i can't even think of anything like
short of actually
selling nuclear secrets to china
what would be more damaging than helping
them get influence over our university
system
i can't think of anything worse than
that
and it's in breitbart but will it be in
any other publication
or will just be ignored probably ignored
probably
jillaine maxwell you know epstein's
partner there is reported to be losing
her hair and a withering shell of her
former self the daily mail says
and was physically abused by a guard
during a pat down
at brooklyn jail her lawyer claims
so the woman who was accused of serial
sexual abuse
is put in prison and got alleged
allegedly
sexually abused by a guard
now i don't even know what to think
about that
because my first impression was well
screwer had it coming or
some version of that but i also don't
want to live in a world where the
where the uh prison guards are feeling
up the
the prisoners so on one hand
i don't feel as bad about this as
my brain tells me iota so i'm not proud
of that
on the other hand if this is true
and this this guard actually sexually
abused her
you should be executed for that because
you have power you know anybody who has
power over somebody makes it
you know that extra bad situation yeah
and
why was there a male guard patting her
down i mean
it's actually it's not it's not
mentioned actually it's physically it
says physically abused by a guard
actually it doesn't specify whether it
was a male or female guard
so we don't know um
all right uh breitbart is also reporting
and increasingly there's a lot of news
that you're only going to see on
breitbart
if you haven't noticed that yet there
are whole topics
which are interesting and matter
and they matter to the country etc and
you don't see them anywhere else
they just just nobody else reports them
it's weird all right um
so apparently oregon's progressive
department of education according to
breitbart
uh they came out with a 82-page training
manual
manual to how to make uh math
instruction more equitable so it's
called a pathway to equitable
math instructions dismantling racism
in mathematics instruction so
their problem was that they believed
that math instruction was sort of a
uh that it it was a white supremacy
culture
kind of invention and so they're trying
to make math instruction
less racist and white supremacist
now i'm not making up what i'm going to
read next
you'll you're going to think maybe it's
a joke this is real
these are the real words i'm going to
quote them
from the oregon's progressive department
of education
the manual enumerates the signs of what
they call white supremacy culture
in the mathematics classroom which
include a focus on quote
getting the right answer an emphasis on
quote
real world math so you know things that
can be applied
teaching math in a linear fashion quote
unquote students being required to quote
show their work and grading students
based on their demonstrated knowledge of
the material
and it goes on quote in order to embody
anti-racist
math education teachers must engage in
critical praxis
p-r-a-x-i-s right now if you're reading
this
make sure you you get it right you've
got to
teachers must engage in critical
practice that interrogates
the ways in which they perpetuate white
supremacy culture in their own
classrooms
and develop a plan toward anti-racist
math education to address the issues of
equity for black
latinx and multilingual students
the manual declares
so um i would like to give this same
advice to all of you
a lot of you i've noticed have not been
engaged in a critical practice
have you be honest how many of you
have been engaged in a critical in any
kind of a critical practice
that interrogates the way in which you
perpetuate white supremacy have you done
any of the work
probably not right you haven't done the
work
and if you haven't done the work well
i feel you're sort of a white
supremacist
even if you're not white those are the
rules
uh so there you have it math is racist
and we got to do something about that
and the way to do that
in case i didn't mention it was to make
sure that you're
uh you're engaged in critical practice
interrogating the ways in which you
perpetuate
white supremacy
what's praxis mean no idea
um but it seems important
so we have reached a point where uh
you know we've we've legitimately
entered that 1984 territory
you know for my entire life i don't
remember any time in my life
people were not making 1984 comparisons
but they were always kind of dumb it's
like yeah it's not 1984.
ah you know you're just that's hyperbole
but we we actually have a situation in
which
organized governmental or
government-approved entities are
brainwashing
and and it's not even any kind of a
hidden
it's not a secret it's not they're not
doing it cleverly through their
advertisements or something they're
actually directly brainwashing
to make people think right
somebody says a slippery slope
i may have to change my my whole view on
the slippery slope
but let me uh state my view more clearly
things will go the way they're going in
all cases
until something springs up to stop it
so typically you can depend on something
some counter force to spring up and
that's why the
i'm not a proponent of the slippery
slope
because there are there's always a
response to it if it matters if it
doesn't matter then things will just
keep slipping
but if people care they will mount a
defense now what's unique is that
because
of the topic we're talking about you
know any racial sensitivities etc
you can't mount a defense because
anybody who mounts a defense
becomes part of the problem right so
this is a slippery slope
that any counter element that tries to
pop
up gets slapped down so that's a weird
kind of slippery slope
mostly the slippery slope just goes
until something happens to stop it
but the unique situation here is that
anybody who tries to stop it
becomes part of the problem by
definition
so so the slope the slippery slope has
built into it
that if you try to stop it
you should be killed basically you're a
horrible person
you're you're a racist or whatever so
that's a unique
situation in which it's not the slippery
slope part
that's the active part it's the fact
that they suppress
anything that would normally stop it so
it's the suppression that's the story
not the slipperiness
if that helps you at all uh is 1984
worth reading i don't know i've never
read it
uh 1984 an animal farm
i resist reading because everybody tells
me to do it
honestly that's why i i feel like the
crib notes are good enough i don't feel
like i have to read
fiction to get the idea i get the idea
right you don't have to read 1984 to get
the idea in
animal farm same thing we've all heard
enough about it you know
we all have the crib notes
somebody says what you must read them
do you think they're reading them would
add a let's say
a new filter to my head or would it just
propagandize me harder
because if you know the concept why does
reading it
in the form of fiction make a difference
i know the concepts
read it anyway get that propaganda
well if you don't mind i will ignore the
parts that are
uh intended to inflame my emotions
and i will take from it the facts which
are actually useful
it might blow my mind as fiction as
fiction it might blow my mind
um
so so i'm saying here that people are
saying that
if you read 1984 you will learn
something that you won't get
from just knowing the concepts in it
that might be true for you i don't know
that's true for a hypnotist
i really don't i feel as if it would
look like
territory i'd been on a lot just
organized well that's what it feels like
but uh
yeah the ministry of truth we know all
these concepts
and uh atlas shrugged
so let me say about ein einrand
the most overrated author and thinker
maybe of all time all right so i've read
you know the two big you know
ayn rand books atlas shrugged and found
head i guess and i just didn't find
anything there
it was just empty to me it was just a
bunch of nothing it was just a poorly
written books
i didn't see anything of value in any of
them
sorry um
the golden age you said it was coming we
might be pretty close
to the golden age i'll check my stocks
but
stocks during the biden era
had been good so far let's see what it
looks like at the moment
yeah they're just bouncing around so at
the moment stocks
are down a little bit uh
bitcoin is at a new high
um the uh retail sales are up
we have peaked in coronavirus and it's
going down
we've probably learned a ton about how
to handle
our next pandemic
we are preparing to colonize
space thank you elon musk
and i believe that we have completely
begun to rethink everything from our
education system
in a way we never would have before the
worst
situation would have been our school
system continued on the way it was
that would have been the holocaust okay
i won't use the holocaust
i'll take that back that would have been
the disaster
but having to rethink it losing a year
as
expensive as this is in the lives of our
children and and their parents
as expensive as that is in every
emotional and physical
and economic way we probably had to
we probably had to break the system
before we could re-engineer it
likewise the the idea of work
has completely changed we've now
accepted
the uh the idea of direct payments to
people who don't have jobs
universal basic income we've basically
accepted that
you know we accepted it under the
pandemic but now it's sort of in our
minds and it would be easier to
implement in the future
and working at home without the commute
is obviously big
seeing all kinds of movement toward
figuring out how to make
it less expensive to you know have
housing
i think that as bad as these disasters
are with the the texas
power grid etc that these all create
the good things when you look at elon
musk making a 100 million dollar
prize available for whoever builds the
best carbon
capture that's really big
that's really big now that doesn't mean
that's what's going to solve
climate change if you think if you even
believe there's something to solve
but it is part of a tapestry of
good things happening in that realm and
i think that we're all getting a lot
smarter
about green energy versus non uh you may
have
you may have heard i think i mentioned
it that the trump
administration in december just before
they
were out of power passed through a bill
that included
money to develop our fusion
technology so instead of nuclear fission
which we have but has some issues
nuclear fusion would be sort of
nearly unlimited low-cost energy
so there's a whole bunch of stuff that
happened
in the last year or so that are really
big
really big and even though they look bad
because they are you know our energy
problems are pandemic that's bad
but they've they've they've opened a uh
a doorway
on each of those topics in which we can
see them more clearly for the first time
and when you when when humans and i'm
going to say americans
if you with apologies with apologies to
people around the world who are watching
this live stream
i do have a bias toward the american
let's say spirit now i don't have a lot
of knowledge
about the spirit in other countries so
maybe somebody's got a better one
but the american spirit
if you will is if we can understand the
problem
we can fix it it's not understanding the
problem
is where we get in trouble it's like are
we supposed to be working on this
climate change is it really a problem
i'm not sure
should we fix immigration or should we
just open the gates
if you can't agree on what the problem
is
then you you can have trouble fixing it
but when americans agree
let's say the year 2000 bug i like to
use that example all the time
nobody in the world wanted the year 2000
bug
to destroy computers around the world
and plunge us into
a depression nobody wanted that
we had just this this specific problem
you got to fix the old code that won't
recognize
when the year turns 2000 everybody
recognized the same problem
and then we went and fixed it that's the
way it works
but you first have to understand you're
all looking at the same problem
and i feel as though these recent
disasters everything from the pandemic
to the energy problems
uh et cetera are sort of opening up some
visibility into all these things
and it's a new visibility and maybe that
gets us on the same page
and gets enough ingenuity going to
to solve things yeah i think we're in
the golden age i do
do you realize that that at least in the
united states
by the way correct me if this is wrong
we had our entire food distribution
system
attacked in a way we've never seen
anything attacked
i'm talking like trump now in a way
we've never seen before
yeah we've seen things before so remove
the hyperbole i didn't need it
and how did we respond
there are a lot and by the way i've been
meaning to do this
i would like to directly and explicitly
thank everybody who worked in any part
of the
food distribution network
from farmer to you know everybody who
gets the food to your plate
all the people working on that
especially the meat
the meat packing plants etc you guys are
heroes
because you guys and and women of course
you didn't get to take time off you
didn't get to work at home
you you had to produce the food to keep
us alive
and how how'd they do how'd they do
nailed it absolutely freaking
nailed it now you know lots of problems
things didn't work
perfectly but of course it was a
pandemic but
correct me if i'm wrong give me a fact
check on this
zero people starved because of the
pandemic in the united states
can somebody give me a fact check on
that i think that's true
i think it's true that zero people
starved
now a lot of people had a lot of trouble
still do i'm not minimizing
the amount of pain and suffering that's
happening but
nobody starved i mean think about that
that and by the way in hindsight
in hindsight you know it doesn't look as
impressive
but in the beginning we didn't know if
we were going to starve
we didn't know and they and the food
service people
from farmers on they pulled it off
so here's another example there was
nobody in america who wanted anybody to
starve
right we were all on exactly the same
side
we've got this big food problem
we need to solve this and then we did
and that's
typical of what happens certainly in
this country but we saw it all around
the world
is that if the problem is agreed on
you can solve it it's only when you
don't agree
that you got a problem all right that is
all i have to do
for today that's all i have to tell you
yeah that is my dog snoring you can
actually hear that on
listen that snickers snoring
that's what i have to listen to all day
all right that's all for now i'll talk
to you tomorrow
all right um what exactly
was the problem somebody says
uh
bridgette don't talk like that i don't
think the protesters should have hung
anybody
but if i'm being honest and i've said
this before i know this is terribly
wrong to say which is why it's fun to
say because it's terribly wrong
terribly wrong i do think that the
capital assault
while i don't promote it i disavow it
and the people have to deal with the
justice system appropriately
but i do think that your government
needs to feel the people
now and then i do think that the
government needs to be reminded
who they work for now if the capital
assault
reminded them that there are
people in the country they need to uh
they need to
do their job in a way that the public
generally will
you know be happy i don't feel that they
were doing their job
now i don't just to be extra sure
you hear me i'm not i'm not giving any
apology or support
for any of the assaulters on the capitol
they're they're uh disowned
you know that that that's their business
they need to deal with the legal system
uh but i'm not going to say that there
were no benefits
because i feel as if the people
need to show that they control the
government and not the other way around
this was maybe the worst possible way to
do it
you know i can't imagine a worse way to
do it but it did have that
it might have had that effect
and we won't know for a long time but
maybe congress will be
maybe a little bit more effective
if they feel the pressure
but don't storm the capital again just
be clear about that
alright that's all for now and i will
talk to you later
