uh
yeah
it's not giving me an error can anybody
see me
over on youtube do you see me
oh yes okay it looks like we're back
online
well you can't stop me can you did you
see the simultaneous hip
i hope you didn't miss that
all right we're back up and we're
rocking now
sound is good everything's good
well
let me give you a ukraine update
the theme for today will be all your
news is fake
it's probably the same theme every day
it's a little more obvious today though
i guess it's the obviousness
did i not take the sip
all right
i know my audience and when you need the
sip
you need to sip the simultaneous sip
it's the dopamine of the day go
luckily i didn't spill all of it
well yes i've had a uh
challenging technology day today so far
so the news out of ukraine is remember
that little snake island there's some
fake news
so the russians were threatening the
island they had ukrainian defenders on
it
and the ukrainian defenders when told to
surrender they said f you
and then the fake news was that they
were
killed by the russians or something
and the real news was they were captured
i guess
but ukraine just uh took back snake
island
they basically just bought they just
missile attacked it into oblivion
and the russians left now the reason the
russians left according to the russians
is
it was a goodwill gesture
russia says
they abandoned the strategic outpost and
they quote gesture of goodwill
[Laughter]
and the the accompanying photo the
accompanying photo is the little island
just completely on fire
literally it's a photo of the island
completely on fire it's just like
there's nothing there but a burning
ember
but russia left it as a gesture of
goodwill
as the u.n looks to secure shipping
corridors
amid increasing concerns over global
food shortages
so
[Laughter]
now
so like i told you the the theme today
is not that it's fake news because
that's every day the theme is that the
fake news isn't trying to be real
anymore it's like they're not even
trying anymore the the
the stories are so just crazy
[Laughter]
yep it's a gesture of goodwill it's not
a it's not a
[Laughter]
it's not a burning husk of nothing
it's a gesture of goodwill
um
so here's something that just kind of
snuck up on me you know one of the
things about twitter is it makes the
world really small
have any of you had an experience of
being uh
getting retweeted or responded to by
some famous person on twitter
and you said to yourself whoa did that
just happen
like
somebody on the other side of the world
who's famous just recognized me and
retweeted me it just makes the world
small doesn't it
because even if you haven't been
retweeted
they're very big users who are famous
for other reasons who do read your
comments they do read your comments not
all of them it happens you know you see
elon musk
often responds to just
you know your everyday twitter user
fairly routinely although he's
disappeared hasn't he that's a story in
itself
but uh this morning you know i'm just
tweeting away and responding to people
and i realized that within the span of
like two minutes on twitter
i had directly interacted with a member
of congress and a playboy playmate
and it was so routine
it was just sort of an ordinary day it's
like oh
thomas massey
congressman massey just made a comment
i'd like to comment on his comment he
commented back and i commented back
and
and then you know jessica vaughn
um playboy playmate
from i don't i don't know what year but
uh
she she responded to some things i
tweeted and i thought
how weird is it
how weird is that that you can just
reach into the world
and some of the most you know notable
people in the world just reach back and
say hey how you doing
it's just the strangest experience sorry
it's hard to integrate it
you can sort of observe it but even when
it happens to me
i i've mentioned this before but it's
the weirdest feeling
when you are a public figure
you look at yourself like other people
do sometimes like not as if it's you
it's like you're watching it too it's
like oh
i watched that too i just got a better
seat
it's actually not like looking at
yourself it doesn't internalize for some
reason
snopes
who often is accused of being
biased toward the left
um now we don't have to wonder anymore
if there was any doubt about that i
think today removed all doubt
and i tweeted this so you can see it for
yourself but they were debunking the
claim that the secret service had quote
officially debunked
hutchinson's testimony
about trump allegedly trying to grab the
steering wheel and
uh and strength and strangle the driver
of his own car
again
again
everything is about like snake island is
just like the
the
appetizer
do you need do you need to do any
research
to know that trump didn't try to grab
the wheel of a moving car and strangle
his driver
he probably didn't
i'm just guessing that that's fake news
and sure enough it was you know
immediately debunked when fox news
reached out to the people who were
involved
as opposed as opposed to the person who
heard about it
they reached out to the people who were
directly there
they said nothing like that happened
what no nothing like that happened
and
snopes instead of
instead of dealing with the question of
whether it happened
which you would think would be the thing
that they would do right
snopes is about what's true
what really happened so instead of
asking instead of debunking the question
of whether trump actually did that
which they could easily debunk by
looking at the fox news reports
that say they talked to them and nope
they said it didn't happen
in fact and i think some other news
entities by now have talked to those
same
secret service people and all got the
same answer nope never happened
right
but so the way snopes handles it is to
insert the word officially
because then they can say the secret
service didn't say anything official
about this
now did you would you catch that trick
if you were a casual um consumer of the
news
you'd say ah these republicans are
saying it's been debunked but here's
snopes saying that the secret service
did not
they did not officially debunk it no
because nobody needed to ask them
you don't need to ask the secret service
you can actually talk to the people the
actual agents
why would you need to talk to the secret
service when you have direct access and
they're willing to testify and they're
not holding back anything
you can just go and ask them
so how does snopes deal with the fact
that fox news and probably others by now
have talked directly to the people
involved and debunked it
how would you handle that if you're
trying to hide that fact
the first thing they said about the news
is that nbc tried to talk to the agents
and didn't get a response
seriously
[Laughter]
[Music]
seriously
that's actually what they did
that they actually reported that the
person who didn't get a response
like that was the lead story here's one
that didn't get a response
now
should that be the first thing that they
list in terms of the people trying to
find out if it's true that shouldn't be
the first thing
i would have listed first the people who
got a response
now i've never been a professional
editor
but i do some writing
and it seems to me that the people who
actually had information and responded
those would be like right at the top
of the things that you would list
not the people who tried and couldn't
get a phone call returned that was nbc
now again
this isn't like other fake news is it
this is so in your face
it's so shameless
that is closer to gaslighting than fake
news isn't it
because gaslighting is
is when
you're being told something so obviously
not true
but you're still being sold it that you
think you must be crazy
because you can see it's obviously not
true so
if these people you trust are saying is
true
well maybe you must be crazy
so that's what they're doing to us
they've gone beyond
uh your facts are wrong and they're all
the way to your crazy
no
this thing right in front of you you
don't see
let's talk to the people who don't have
the story to fact check it
seriously the fact-checking organization
led off with the people who didn't have
facts
and that was you know let's let's talk
about the people who didn't get any
information
and then they talked about cbs in some
related way the same way
all right
here's a statement that i want to see if
you agree with this is from a twitter
user who calls himself
fat drunk and stupid
um i'm not going to fat fact check that
but
there you are
but the comment was uh one that i was
wondering about too so i didn't i didn't
see every moment of the testimony you
know i saw the key parts
but uh fat drunken soup and says the car
incident where trump allegedly grabbed
the steering wheel and tried to strangle
his own driver
the car incident was the only aspect of
her testimony which was even arguably
newsworthy and made the front page of
every left-wing media source
but within 24 hours the driver of the
car himself confirmed it was a lie
now
would you agree with that would you
agree that the only thing that was
vaguely newsworthy
was a car incident
i think you might be a little biased on
this because i think the left would say
that's not the only newsworthy thing
we'll talk about one other in a moment
but
this gets to the question of how do you
thwart laundry list persuasion and i
talk about this a lot but every time you
see an example of it it's worth
you know seeing how it works or what the
exception is
so in this case
you could say that hutchinson's
testimony and really the whole hearings
are laundry list persuasion they're
trying to come up with a long list of
allegations
such that if you were to debunk one
they could say all right all right so
even if that one's wrong what about all
this other stuff
and then you debunk another one and they
say
i disagree with you but it doesn't even
matter because look at all this other
stuff
and then you just go down the list and
you debunk them all and what happens
after you've debunked everything on the
list
always
what happens
does the person say wow
i didn't realize that every single thing
i believed was wrong but now your
debunking has convinced me
they go back to the start it's that's
right
they go back to the start
of the list
and and act like you didn't already talk
about it and debunk it
and you'll have to just do it again
and if you do it again it doesn't matter
they'll just start yelling at you for
being a bad person
you just can't debunk a laundry list
because people will devolve into such
irrational defenses
so i've argued that what you should do
is take the strongest claim debunk it
and say well by your own by your own
description that was your strongest
claim
i've now debunked it so we're done
and just leave it and walk away because
there's nothing else you can do now
that's not like gonna be a clean win but
it's all you can do it's the best you
can do
and i'm gonna talk about my own list and
and
do a call back to this a little bit
um so here's one other thing that was on
the list
that when l when
uh trump said that uh they should take
down the magnum magnum eaters or
whatever they are the metal detectors
his
what he said about it was they're not
here to hurt me
and then he followed up i saw this on a
twitter feed called the haplor he said
they can march to the capitol from here
they're not going to hurt me
and they're going to march the capital
from here that was interpreted as trump
means like what trump is thinking
internally is that he wants to let
people with weapons into his event so
that then those weapons can be available
for marching on the capitol
now do the facts support that
interpretation
yes yes they do
yeah they do that's why that's why
people are interpreting it that way
because the facts do support that
interpretation but you know what the
problem is
that's not the only interpretation they
support
the facts also support
completely other interpretations
here's my interpretations
we know that trump likes big crowds and
that and we know that was the context
he was saying my crowd isn't big enough
because the metal detectors are slowing
down the flow
and it's a bad picture so this part is
not in
in dispute we know he was obsessing over
crowd size we know that he's always
obsessed over it and he's not wrong
about that
he's not wrong
because when he sells his big crowd size
it's part of uh
what's the term
like
peer confirmation
right it's part of persuasion it's an
important part it's a very important
part
if you think everybody's doing something
then you think well maybe i should do it
too
so he's not wrong
from a political
uh persuasion perspective he wants big
crowds and he wants the
he wants the video to show it right the
video should accurately show it is what
he wants so we know that and there's no
dispute that he cares a lot about crowd
size in fact he has been mocked
mercilessly
for caring about crowd size more than
other things am i right
he has been mocked mercilessly by the
left
for caring too much about crowd size
and here he is again
caring so much about crowd size
that he was willing to take some
physical risk of dying
right because he said they're not here
to hurt me and he was right about that
but still you would have to admit
there's a physical risk to a president
if somebody gets in with a weapon
right has any president ever said stop
checking for weapons i'm in public
has any president ever appeared in
public and said you know i trust my
crowd so much
that you don't even have to check them
and here's the weird thing
he was right
he was right
no nobody brandished a gun to try to
hurt him
and nobody used a firearm
during the you know the episode
uh the riots
so once again he was right
but i would also say it was risky you'd
agree with that right
i mean we didn't know in advance he'd be
right there's no way he could know he
was right but his gut said
that he'd rather have the crowd size
that was just a better cost benefit at
that moment because the entire country
in the future of the country was at risk
and so he said quite reasonably
that he would accept a little extra risk
so in the context in which everybody's
criticizing trump
for not being concerned enough about the
risk
to pence
the direct evidence is that trump
was literally removing protection from
himself
because he didn't believe his crowds
would hurt him
so
how how trump internally deals with risk
is a big unknown
and you can't know it by looking at what
happened
because there's always more than one
interpretation of what his his mental
state would have been
to have gotten the situation you got
so here's how i take it
he's a guy who believes that republicans
are not dangerous and if it's all
republicans which it was
or conservatives anyway
that they don't use firearms
for no good reason
and he was totally right
so
what we're seeing in these show trials
is primarily trying to fool you into
thinking we can read his mind
that's primarily what it is
because his state of mind is everything
isn't it
the entire thing is to figure out if we
can determine what he was thinking
not what he did
not what he did
because what he did will support
multiple theories of what he was
thinking and only what he's thinking
matters
because if he was thinking i want to
overthrow the country i know the
election was fair but i'm going to try
to make it happen anyway if he was
thinking that
my god
should be executed
i don't know if that's a law but
right
if he was actually thinking
i want to violently overthrow the
country
and overturn a fair election
well then i think he should be killed
am i wrong
obviously i don't think he did that
but if that were true
yeah
yeah i think he should be actually tried
and executed if guilty
i don't know if there's a law that would
execute you for trying to overthrow the
government in that fashion
but if there is
you should be executed for it
but the other interpretation is he was
trump being exactly like he's always
been
obsessing about crowd size
not being terribly concerned about
physical risk
which isn't entirely consistent isn't it
that even trump's rallies
he wasn't super
concerned about people getting roughed
up in fact he played with it had some
fun with it so very consistently he's
been i will accept a little extra risk
i'll accept a little extra risk he he
did it with his own physical risk by
saying
forget about the checking for weapons
they're not going to use them
now what do you think trump knew
or believed about pence's actual
physical risk
during the worst part of it because part
of the accusation and it's a bad one
is that he may have been on board with
something bad happening to pence
what do you think he knew internally
do you think that trump
believed that the republicans were not
dangerous to him so much so that they
didn't even check him for weapons at a
public event which is outrageous really
or he didn't want to but they did anyway
um
if if that was his mindset
that this crowd is
not so much about violence they're about
you know protesting
do you think that he believed pence was
an actual physical danger
how would you know
you know we have the we have the benefit
of hindsight right
do you think that trump had good
information
about where pence was
you know what the defenses were
what was the nature of the crowd
how many of them were just being
hyperbolic and you know it's not unusual
in political context for somebody to
have
uh a noose
in fact it's one of the most common
political approach to ask things a noose
right
it doesn't mean they're really gonna
hang somebody
it's sort of how protests work now what
do you think trump knew
at the most critical moments now
remember remember
what we know
we learned after the fact
during the fog of war
and don't you think that during january
6 during the actual hours of the protest
don't you think the fog of war
was pretty thick
how do you know what trump knew or
believed
during that time
there's no way to know it now if you
could create a situation where there's
only one interpretation of what he could
have been thinking
well then i might be persuaded by that
i'd say well there's just nothing else
you could could have been thinking of
that situation
but we're no we're nowhere near that
you know we we have completely innocent
explanations for everything
and and every time you compare the
innocent explanation to the allegation
one of them sounds way less likely than
the other
doesn't it
what is more likely
that trump wanted to
with witnesses
acted as though he was okay with trump
with his own vice president being
murdered
so that's one theory
just think in your mind what are the
odds of that
that trump
was okay with his own vice president
being murdered
any minute
that's one theory the other theory is it
was a fog of war and he was unaware
of the danger or
or
he was actually completely right
that he wasn't in danger
because remember
after the fact we can say with certainty
that the defense of pence was sufficient
right
because pence actually lived and was not
directly assaulted
so we can say as of this moment
if you know if anybody had magic
abilities they could have said at the
time yeah his defense was sufficient he
was fine
what did trump know did trump trust the
secret service to protect pence
and therefore believe there was no real
danger
did he also think that republicans just
talk that way they talk tough but
they're not violent by nature and if
anybody tried to get violent here's my
belief
here's my belief now if somebody had a
gun and you know took a shot all bets
are off
but could you imagine just just try to
wrap your head around
this republican crowd
you've got some percentage of bad actors
then some percentage of people were just
trying to protect the republic
what would happen if that mixed crowd
the whole bunch of them
surrounded
surrounded pence
and the secret service agents were you
know maybe
putting their bodies in front of the
crowd and you know they're starting to
lose to the weight of the crowd
what exactly
do you think the rest of the republicans
in the crowd would have done
i wasn't there and i don't know
but i'll give him my assumption
if a bad actor
had done something that looked like real
violence threatened it let's say brought
out a gun
let's say let's say somebody brought in
a gun
aimed it at pence
in front of a whole room full of
republicans
you tell me what happens in the next 60
seconds
it's a room full of republicans
somebody pulls out a gun they pointed at
pence
they wouldn't
they wouldn't just grab the gun away
from him
they would kill him
they would kill him
am i wrong
now they might beat him and you know
beat him into a coma or something maybe
they would actually kill him but i think
he'd get torn apart
i think
because what republican is going to let
that happen right in front of him
and that's
i just can't see republicans let that
letting that happen no matter how many
bad actors are in the group
now let's contrast that to the
you know the the riots you know antifa
blm
i didn't see a lot of people trying to
stop the protesters but i think in a
republican crowd
they would have done it for sure
just speculation now anything i
speculate about trump's mental state is
equally non-credible
can we agree
i could speculate on what he was
thinking
but i don't know
and that's the point
how could you have a
um how could we be going through this
process when the only thing that matters
is what he was thinking
and there are multiple theories that
would support
everything he did
and the least likely one is that he was
thinking the worst possible thing
that's the least likely explanation of
anything we see
all right
um
do you think it's fair to compare the
the blm riots
to the
january 6. is that a fair comparison
i used to think
that that was fair
i thought oh that's they have enough in
common that i could compare this to but
i've decided to go with the majority
on this
i know you might not like it but
i decided to go to the majority and what
the democrats taught me is that it's not
legitimate to compare the fake news
about an insurrection
to real news about riots
they're not comparable
so what would be comparable like two
real things
if you had like a real riot
compared to a real insurrection
that you know maybe maybe that would be
something to compare but it wouldn't be
sensible to compare a real riots
uh with you know billions of dollars
damage and multiple deaths
to a
a protest
that is being called an insurrection but
isn't
so i'm gonna go with the majority and
say you can't compare those two things
fake news to real news
um remember i told you that we would
find out for sure which
journalists or platforms were completely
non-credible
because the the spin that would come out
of this would be just so
so clear
that you could tell who to never believe
again
and even today after that the steering
wheel thing got debunked the la times is
going with it as a major story
and they said trump didn't care about
you know weapons at the event but they
leave out the part about why he said
that
um
and
you know to me the fact that he didn't
think republicans would be dangerous to
him
tells me his state of mind was not
thinking anything would get dangerous
like he probably just thought it was a
peaceful group
so to me they've
essentially
that's trump's defense
that if he wasn't thinking the crowd was
violent
aren't we done
now he said they won't be violent to me
but i feel like what he really meant was
it's not a violent crap
all right
um but there's no way to prove that that
would just be speculation
all right so the la times uh
it's just jaw-dropping that they can
carry the story after the people
involved have debunked it
but there it is
uh apparently aoc said about the supreme
court decision about abortion
uh i need to fact check did she really
say this
she said the right to our bodies does
not belong to nine supreme court
justices
was that a real quote
if she didn't say it
it is at least a fair characterization
of what a lot of democrats are saying
that
uh women's bodies
should not be subject to the decision
from you know nine
nine people in a court
and they believe it should be more of a
democratic decision and not
some fascist dictator situation with a a
court making the decision about what
women do with their bodies
and so here's what i i suggest
based on this comment
because
um
rarely
rarely do you see the country come
together over such a contentious issue
but here it is
this is one time that um
the democrats and the republicans are
completely on the same page
because the entire point of the supreme
court court ruling
was that the nine justices on the
supreme court should not make making a
decision about women's bodies
that's what the ruling was
the ruling was exactly agreeing with aoc
the supreme court should not be making
decisions about what women do with their
bodies so take us out of this
let the states do it because you know
what the states do
they've got a democratic process
exactly what aoc wants
and not only that but can you do a fact
check for me is there any state whose
state laws uh oppose their own internal
majority
and why isn't that like a headline
why am i asking that question and it's
not already the headline
the headline should be
somebody should write the story that
says the laws in our state actually
don't agree with the majority somebody
says michigan and wisconsin did somebody
write that story
or do you just know that from your own
research
isn't that important to you
because if there's only let's say that's
true i don't know if that's true but
let's say let's say there are
two states
where the majority is clearly out of
line with the law
shouldn't the
pro-abortion pro-democracy people
be just concentrating on those states
because you know what do you know what
californians reaction was to the supreme
court decision
let me give you the reaction of most
californians
ah doesn't affect us
because it doesn't the state has its own
laws which i haven't checked
but i would be willing to bet
that california's
let's say liberal abortion laws
are probably what the state wants by
majority
am i wrong
i think california wants abortion and
they have it
so
democracy right
um
but it's
it's kind of mind-boggling to watch the
left uh stage riots to achieve what they
were just given
we just gave you democracy
go fix it in your state like the system
is supposed to work
take yes for an answer
take yes for an answer how about yes
you people decide and not the supreme
court but damn it we don't want the
supreme court deciding
that's what we just said
that's exactly what we just said so
we're in complete agreement
you nine old people stop
stop controlling our bodies
that's the opposite that's the opposite
again
that would be the opposite of what we
just did the opposite
and watching this happen right in front
of you is just insane
again
going back to my theme
this is this is beyond fake news
this is a whole other level of not
caring if you notice
i feel like the old fake news like the
russian collusion thing
i miss that
because russia collusion at least had
something that looked like fake evidence
you know the dossier had an old argument
a structure
i mean you didn't know on day one it
looked ridiculous to me i mean i doubted
it from day one
but you don't know i mean i was open to
the possibility that if they looked into
it well we'd be surprised who knows i
was open to it
so that was the old kind of fake news
where you really couldn't tell
you really couldn't tell
but now you can tell
you can tell
they're not hiding it anymore it's like
nothing's being hidden but it's like the
russian propaganda
well the reason we pulled off a snake
island
not because it's nothing but a smoking
barren ember
that's not why
it's because we wanted a
gesture of goodwill
that's the way we do it when we're at
war
totally believable
speaking of news that's totally
believable
a tragic story of drummer travis barker
been checked into a hospital for
now we've heard the following reason
that he's developed
allegedly he's developed pancreatitis
from a colonoscopy
that's right so they
they stuck something up his ass
and they gave him pancreatic
pancreatitis
that's his statement now
in the story i read they talked to some
doctors and say
can you really damage somebody's
pancreas by shoving something up their
ass
uh maybe
they take a chemical you know is it the
chemical is there you know a tear in the
lining
and the doctor said
well
they said well
not very likely
let's just say that it's in the it's in
the the risk level of we don't really
think about it
when we do this procedure
it's so unlikely
that we don't even consider a risk and
in fact we wouldn't even mention it to
somebody as a risk that's how unlikely
it is
however
in unrelated news
eighty percent of pancreatitis cases are
due to gallstones or alcohol abuse
now i suppose if there was a gallstone
problem we'd hear about that
they probably would have said well he's
got a gallstone problem and caused some
pancreas
so
what would be a possible reason
that uh
they wouldn't mention
i know i can't take one
uh once again
the fake news is not really trying too
hard to not be fake is it it's not
trying too hard
uh
i saw a tweet today
it's just one sentence and it just made
me laugh for 10 minutes
and this is a tweet by uh
twitter user alien hotep
and i don't know if you're gonna have
the same reaction to it i'm just gonna
read it and then i'm gonna be silent for
a moment
and his tweet was
believe all women is not having a good
year
oh my goodness
uh there's a brilliant uh tucker video
video package you put together muscle
run last night
in which he shows all the cases many of
them i'd never heard of of republicans
being haunted and arrested for various
 things and that you know the
police
you know uh
coming in home at five in the morning
and arresting him for basically nothing
and taking their phones for basically
nothing
and you know there's always some fig
leaf of a reason why they did everything
they did
but none of it looks appropriate it all
looks just purely political and until
you see the
the full
number of them
you don't see the pattern
but the pattern is really clear
that
the
republicans are being haunted
for their opinions
now let's we'll talk about laundry list
a little bit more in a moment now is it
a laundry list to show examples
it would it would be a laundry list
problem if some of the examples were
debunkable
so what's the strongest one
and then can you debunk it
so if he can
that would be interesting i think i saw
at least one thing on his list where i
said
i think there's a i think there's a
counter
narrative to that one
so i i have to admit there was at least
one thing on the list i forget which one
it was where i said i don't know i
wouldn't put that one on the list
but that doesn't mean i'm right
that was just my reaction
so yeah republicans being haunted by the
government
um
i i saw this now that the apparently the
biden administration
is saying
outright that if they had to choose
between russia holding the don bass
which they already have
versus a global recession in famine they
would prefer a global recession and
famine
and of course the risk of nuclear war
that they would prefer it
we'll go that's a little bit of famine
we're going to take a little bit of
recession a little bit of famine
but the important thing is that russia
doesn't control the dumb baths
and i
and the
the context is that they're actually
saying it directly
how's that not the biggest news
all right
so i i added the uh the steering wheel
incident that was in the news yesterday
about trump allegedly grabbing the
steering wheel of the beast
so i added that as the 11th item on my
hoax quiz
some people said
and this is entirely reasonable
they said scott you always make fun of
laundry list persuasion
but then you created a laundry list of
persuasion
so are you not being a little
inconsistent here
to which i say
i'm not
because you should use the same
debunking method on my list
if you can
and the if you can part is the important
part if you can take my laundry list
and pick the strongest one on the list
and debunk it
you win
so go ahead
please do
and the problem is you can't because
there's nothing on the list you can
debunk
i mean people will think they did it i
suppose
and
yeah so if you have a list in which
they're all true
especially the strongest one on the list
like the russia collusion oaks so the
russia collusion hoax
not that not the part where russia tried
to interfere that's the separate but the
collusion part
i think we know is fake and that's the
strongest one on the list so if you were
to pick the strongest one on my list
good luck
because it actually went through the you
know the legal system and the special
prosecutor and everything else
so good luck that's my strongest one
but now that the country has come
together on this question of democracy
should be making decisions about women's
bodies and not nine people on the
supreme court
now that we've all come together on this
important issue i think we should
celebrate
and i can't think of a better way to
celebrate the country coming together
than
a riot i think a riot would be the
appropriate way to do this
and
i would try to combine riots in this
case
so i'd want to i'd want to bring all the
blm people all the antifa people but
also all the people who were on january
6 get all the proud boys all the maggot
people uh all the militias get them all
in one place
and let's just have a proper riot and
celebrate the fact that we all agree
that the supreme court should not be
making fascist autocratic
dictatorial decisions
it should be made at the states with a
democratic process and now we're there
boom the whole country came together
now if you didn't think that trump could
bring the country together
well there's proof that he could do it
we've all agreed
that the supreme court is not the place
for those decisions
and
i believe i've delivered once again with
the finest live stream
possibly ever seen in the history of the
united states or reality itself
which is changing every moment i feel
like there was something i was going to
talk about that i forgot
so i'm
boring you by looking at my notes while
i decide that
nope got it all
that's because i'm efficient
the scott epps moment
um
thank you i think it has been delightful
you know delightful
is an underused word and i'm trying to
change that
when people ask me how anything was i
often now say it was delightful
doesn't that make you feel happy when
you hear that word
how how was your party last night
i got to say
it was delightful
it sounds better than excellent or
awesome doesn't it because those are
sort of too generic
doesn't get to how you feel
all right well i love you too
um
bring back guerrilla tv
yeah i don't have that on my list of uh
hoaxes the the one that
uh trump
would keep the tv tuned to uh the
uh guerrilla tv channel
that was funny
splendid is good too
how was your event splendid
yeah that's a good one splendid
how stupid do they think we are
i don't want to answer that question
all right
yeah i think we've covered it everybody
have we covered it time to do something
else go make the world a better place
yes it is
youtube thanks for sticking with me
through the uh technical difficulties i
think it was worth it now where is
