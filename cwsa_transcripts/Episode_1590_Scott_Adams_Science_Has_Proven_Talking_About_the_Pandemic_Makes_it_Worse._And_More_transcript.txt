good morning everybody and welcome
to another exciting episode
of coffee with scott adams and i dare
say this will be the best one you've
ever experienced
possibly the best thing that's ever
happened in the entire
solar system at least that's the part we
know about
could be more surprises
a few parsecs away that's my new word
for the day parsecs
and
we will talk about all that
but if you want to enjoy this at the
maximum potential
and why wouldn't you i mean
you're already the sexiest and most
well-informed and
smartest people in earth
why wouldn't you want to take it to
another level you would and all you need
is a copper mug or a glass of tiger
jealous and stein a canteen jugger flask
a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and
join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day
the thing that's going to make
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip and watch it do its
work go
antibodies
scott's finally awake
you know the trouble is i've been
blocking people who say
scott's finally waking up
but now i can't tell who's joking
because so many people are saying it as
a joke now it all looks the same
all right well
there's new news today that andrew not
andrew but chris cuomo
was apparently reportedly according to
anonymous sources
now let's be fair
if there were anonymous sources saying
something about trump
would you believe it
no
because anonymous sources have no
credibility whatsoever
but
cnbc has some anonymous sources
which if it weren't already in the news
i wouldn't even talk about it because
the credibility of these things is so
low
but accordingly to this
source
chris cuomo
worked with his brother
brothers top aides
to discredit fox news meteorologist
janice dean
because she was a big critic of the
governor you know chris cuomo's brother
for his handling of the nursing homes
and
her family members who died there
um
now
do you think that's true
do you think they quote targeted
somebody
because she was talking out
would that even work
you know she was already talking out and
we'll suppose it was a hit piece
saying that she'd i don't know strangled
a puppy or something
i suppose they could come up with some
kind of a hit piece on her would that
have stopped her from talking
i don't know
that feels like a bad play
like such a bad play
that you wouldn't even really consider
it
you know if you're operating at the
level of
a sitting governor
or a host on cnn
aren't you smarter than that
i mean i definitely can see going after
pundits who are sort of full-time
pundits
right both sides are going after the
pundits on either side
so it makes sense the you know that the
the right was going after chris cuomo
and the left was going after tucker
carlson
that makes sense
but this janice dean thing was such a
special case it was about deaths in her
own family
you can't shut somebody up about a death
in their own family
and it's not like she's she was some
continuous
critic of all things you know cuomo
she just had one very specific complaint
that was quite valid
do you really
i feel as if yeah they died her
relatives died in the nursing home
was that in laws i can't remember
but
i i don't believe this story
i don't believe this story and the
reason i don't believe it is that it
wouldn't make sense for people who
operate at this level of
understanding politics to take out
somebody who had a death death in the
family
and really just had one topic
of complaint you couldn't really take
that person out
i don't know
but it does suggest that maybe it's a
thing if if this were true it would
suggest that taking out critics is a
ongoing conversation
i am so curious
how many conversations have happened
about
me are you
don't you wonder
like who exactly is looking to take me
out
because it's not nobody
i just don't know if it's a lot or
anybody who knows how to do it or
anybody who'd be good at it i'd love to
know what the what the secret file on me
is
like what what is it that somebody's
already found out
or made up i suppose more likely made up
i don't know i would think that the top
um i don't know
20 or so effective people on each side
are all targeted
one way or the other
i'm definitely the top 20 of effective
uh persuaders
so anyway
a little uh a little doubt on that one
uh there was
a mike cernovich tweet
uh that i loved
and uh the reason i love it is just
because i like making trouble
can i be honest
there there are some topics in which i
get all outraged about or
you know like anybody would
and there are some topics that i think
are just funny
even though i know they're kind of
serious
so as long as nobody's dying
or getting hurt
i i often will find humor in things that
other people are taking quite seriously
and the topic here is the
the trans uh swimmer
uh a woman
uh by designation
and uh by by preference
and she would say by nature
um
and
but it was someone who was born and
raised male and had all the testosterone
advantage of that
and so this person is just breaking all
the swimming records at at the college
where she attends
and
the teams are very unhappy about that
because they they have no chance of
winning if she's in the competition
and this is when mike cernovich tweeted
about this he goes can't wait for this
brave hero to break all the olympic
records for whims women swimming
to which i say
could that happen
could that happen
i mean do the olympics have rules that
would prevent this and what's going to
happen to the olympics
because in the olympics why would you
ever
you know if the olympics allowed this
i'm saying knows
but what specifically is the rule that
would disallow it and how long can that
rule last
would the united states have to pull out
because they're discriminating
they used to have rules
it's allowed so there's some difference
in the in the comments somebody says no
rules so why would any country
feel the women's team that wasn't
all trans
why
why would he even do it if the whole
point is to win
the olympics are pretty much about
winning right it's not so much about
you know competing
the whole point of the olympics is
winning
you know sure sure we're you know it's
all about
fellowship which sounds sexist
east germans used to do that did they
i don't know if they actually
had trans athletes i think they just had
injections didn't they
anyway i don't know this history that
but i do uh the thing that amuses me i
think is that i think the olympics
should be canceled
just for
because it's ridiculous it gives people
the absolute wrong message in life
um it's the opposite of the message that
i give people
my message is don't try to be the number
one person in the world
as some specific thing
because you're probably not going to be
instead put together a set of talents
that will serve you well in a variety of
situations throughout your life
and if somebody focuses all their time
on
like throwing a
javelin
then they end up being a certain age and
they have one skill
they can throw a pointy stick
good luck with that it's a terrible life
strategy
now if you win the olympics and get a
gold medal you might be able to parlay
that into something but there's only one
person
every year who gets that gold medal for
javelin throwing
to pick one example
so
uh i think olympics are a terrible
um
terrible role models just the worst role
models
in the world
they're wasting their lives preparing
for something that doesn't have any
practical use
so that's my opinion and so when i see
the potential that the trans situation
could completely break the olympics
i just think it's kind of funny
i don't know i don't feel proud about
that i mean
i'm not saying you should think it's
funny
it's probably just a defect in my
personality that i like trouble
but if it if it's bad for the olympics
i'm all in for it
um here's a question for you remember i
told you many many times
that you can have any world you view you
want
because our view of the reality is
completely subjective
well 95 subjective
and
you can have anyone you want but you
should pick one that that predicts
because the best filter on life for
understanding it is the one that
has a good record of predicting things
if you thought that trump was definitely
going to jail for all of his many many
many
so obvious crimes
are you confused that it hasn't happened
yet
aren't you wondering
why the news told you that he was
definitely going to jail
oh if there's one thing we know for sure
all these crimes i mean i can't even
list them all
give me a give me a longer piece of
paper and a couple of sharp pencils
because i don't have time to list all
the felonies
president trump has created
so
he been handcuffed yet
nope
was there
anything he did
that looks like it's going to be a legal
problem
haven't seen it have you
but there are secret
investigations going on and the way that
we get those taxes and
where do we get those extra testimonies
about january 6 we're almost there
almost
and then we never get there
yeah somebody somebody in the comments
says trump will share a cell with matt
gates
do you think matt gates is going to be
actually
go to jail for any crimes
i don't think so
whatever it is they have on him looks
political
um just like gate stretch you play games
all day in hopes of being the next
shroud
yeah yeah anything where you're trying
to be the best
in the world or even the top 10
is pretty tough now i know that sounds
funny coming from me
because in the world of cartooning
i'm in the top ten
you know of working cartoonists maybe
not in the top ten of all cartoonists of
all time but of people who are still
alive and still making comic strips
i'm in the top ten
so do i look like a violation of my own
theory no because the way i got here was
with a
talon stack where i'm not the greatest
at anything but you put them together
and they work pretty well as a as a
combination
so
uh
look at me as an example of a talent
stack not of being
the best at any anything in particular
here's some cnn fake news
but it's real
so it's a fake news because the way it's
presented
but all the details i think are real so
there's no question about any of the
facts
just the way it's presented is a little
fake
all right here's the topic
uh rising uh murders in cities
rising murder in cities and this is on
cnn
now does that surprise you
the cnn would do a pretty big feature on
the rising crime especially murders
in cities
so you know a story like that is going
to be talking about all these blue
cities right
um yeah all these blue cities with their
bad governance causing all the crime by
defunding the police and stuff like that
right
that's probably the story you're
expecting
uh here's the headline
austin texas this is cnn
one of the fastest growing cities in the
country
the capital of texas
 you texas that's what they're
saying
is nearing the end of its deadliest year
on record in 2021 as cities nationwide
are experiencing oh
can you name another city
what would be an example of another city
that's not in texas
how about picking one that's not in
texas
no let's focus on texas
so they find this city in texas
presumably a red city right
austin isn't blue is it
can anybody confirm that
oh it is blue it's the one blue dot
i was wondering about that
okay so people in the comments are
saying that austin
is a is blue
but that's even better
all right so that's even better for the
point i was going to make
which is why they pick texas
for the focus
because texas is pretty you know has a
lot of gun rights right so they make it
a story so the emphasis of their story
is that
uh the problem in uh texas in their
capital city is guns and covent
so you got a big problem in texas
with all the guns and the
bad treatment of covert i guess
here's the other way this story could
have been been done
the biggest problem in texas is the only
blue city according to you guys and i'm
going to assume you're right about that
defunding the police
probably made more problems in other
places but
basically everywhere you've got uh
you know democrat leadership
you've got trouble
that's how fox news tells the same story
so
we have one story about
rising violence in the country and if
you look at how the left covers it it's
something wrong with the right and how
the right covers it is something wrong
with the left
anyway i just thought that was
hilariously overtly propaganda-ish on
both sides by the way
on both sides
so it's not like one side is doing
propaganda on this
but i do think
fox news is probably closer to a correct
context
what do you think
do you think that i'll call it the fox
news tank
which is it's the blue cities that are
clearly the ones with problems
is that fair
does that first of all does that pass
the fact check
i haven't done any research on it myself
yeah um
okay
well that's enough on that
um
i think i gave some terrible advice on
uh
on twitter yesterday for the first time
for the first time
um aviva fry was uh
jokingly tweeting that he was
considering cursing
on twitter
and then he thought better of it because
he realized that his
his kids friends you know
see him on twitter too so you know maybe
he won't
um
here is my
advice because i feel like i may have
accidentally
uh
hurt some of you
like actually
like in a bad way career-wise or even
socially or something and here's how i
might have done it
don't tweet the way i do
because i i worry that people see me
tweeting and you know i have a lot of
followers and i get a lot of retweets
and stuff and people say oh
it's working out for him
i think i'll be you know provocative too
don't do it if it's not your job
it's my job to be provocative because
essentially it's a marketing strategy
for what i do which is all public if you
do things in public for a job
which is the only thing i do i i try to
attract attention to
make my business model work right
so if you have what i call you know fu
money
so if i got banned from twitter tomorrow
it wouldn't make much difference it's
not going to prohibit me from getting a
job somewhere right
but if you do
you might not get a job
if you say something that's a little too
far on twitter
you know your your dating prospects will
be lower your
ability to run for office will be
destroyed
so don't use me as a role model for how
provocative to be
and definitely don't use me for as a
role model for how much you should curse
now i know uh viva was joking but it
made me think
that there might be people here who are
saying and i can think of one in
particular that i think
maybe got in trouble with it
you know one person who might have said
i think i'll tweet like him
and i don't think that works for the
rest of you so i'm just going to say
just know that the way i do it is
because i'm literally a professional in
this domain
and i can take risks that you can't
at least reasonably i can take risks
that you can't so don't be like me when
it comes to tweeting or swearing
i told you before that uh cnn was
replacing chris cuomo with rekhanish at
least temporarily i don't know what
they'll do in the long run
and i told you this murkonish is rare
on
cnn um
oh did uh i'm seeing matt is saying that
uh
cernovich and passable made the same
point good
good for them
that is something we all should have
warned you about it sooner i think i
feel like we all let you down
honestly
um
so smurkanish
is like i said the most balanced
reporter on cnn by far there's nobody in
his class i i don't think who's balanced
and
he he would just went hard at biden
he went really hard at biden now he does
it professionally it doesn't look at all
like propaganda it looks like he's just
laying out the facts but unfortunately
the facts are not working for biden at
the moment here here's what
reconnaissance is
saying
and he's mentioning that the revised cbo
score
the
what does cbo stand for the
congressional budget office cbo
congressional budget office right
yeah okay the congressional budget
office so they're the that's the entity
that looks at all the budget
propositions
proposals and says uh what will will
happen to the economy if you do this or
don't do this and so they scored this
biden's build back better bill
uh
biden's build back better bill
i i gotta say that at least one more
time because it's too much fun biden's
build back better build
and and unlike the first estimate that
said it would be closer to revenue
neutral
meaning it wouldn't increase the deficit
it would actually help more than it hurt
um
the republicans cleverly asked for this
now i would like to give the republicans
some kudos
i'm not sure exactly which republicans
were behind it
but
thank you
thank you for a good governance and what
the republicans did is said
hey cbo can you run this again
except this time make the following
assumption
that the temporary programs are not
temporary
that the last at least 10 years
turns out that if you make that
completely realistic assumption because
the government is not good at
discontinuing giveaways
right
if you do it with a more realistic
assumption that the temporary stuff
lasts forever or at least 10 years which
in in financial terms 10 years is
forever how many of you don't know that
let me put that out there
most of you don't have any you know
experience and financial projections but
i have a lot of it for my corporate life
10 years in the future is the same as
infinity
when you're doing a financial projection
because after 10 years nothing's
predictable after that nothing
the the predictability drops to zero
at about 10 years so so the republicans
quite smartly
picked
pretty much the exact right number
10 years
because you get the same benefit as if
it had been a forever calculation
without being stupid about it right
because infinity is always a bad
assumption
so very smart
very uh realistic
uh ask of the cbo and when they scored
it with these more realistic republican
assumptions
it turned out to increase the deficit by
three trillion
dollars dream king you're going away
scott adams has gone downhill
i've always been downhill
goodbye
also don't do this the way i do it i
also block a lot of people but as uh as
was noted on twitter today
i block people because it's part of the
show
it's you know maybe bad for the people
who get blocked but i don't care
they'll have it coming
so when i block i always tell you why
and i just make it part of the show but
if you're not doing that
you know you may might not want to block
people like i do
so uh it's notable this murkanish gave
the correct
context for this story i know that
sounds weird
you know a new show
is supposed to give you context but it
doesn't happen that much and i just told
you a story where it didn't happen on on
that austin story but smirkownish is
good with context
and uh i'm gonna call him i'm gonna give
him kudos for that
um he goes on to say that
now that the buildback better bill looks
like uh a dog
and it looks like joe manchin is gonna
say no and here's why joe manchin is
saying no to build back better
he says that they used budget tricks
to make it look good
so he's a democrat who's calling out the
democrats for using budget tricks which
is what the republicans called them out
for too
literally a trick to make something
very expensive look like it's free
and so
do you remember uh
how many of you remember me telling you
that joe manchin is actually running the
country
before he was actually running the
country
now it's very clear he basically makes
congress's decisions for him
right
probably one of the best decisions i've
ever or predictions i made
is that this one guy
by being the smartest guy i hate to say
it but
you know at least on the democrat side
he is the smartest democrat
and here's why he's the smartest
he realized
that
the world had simply handed him power
and then he's responsibly using it
he's responsibly using
the immense power that the united states
just handed him somewhat accidentally
because of the you know coincidental
balance of power and coincidentally he's
one of the few people with
uh with kristen cinema who will cross
the line
so i don't know if i can say enough good
things about joe manchin right now
i feel like he's holding the country
together single-handedly
now you know how uh great power corrupts
you know power crops and great power
corrupts absolutely
somehow the universe handed joe manchin
great power
like really great power
so far
he is handling it responsibly in my
opinion
now that doesn't mean he makes the same
decisions you make that's a different
standard the standard is is he being
the patriot that we want him to be
democrat and all right right you may not
be on your political side
but is he being a patriot
in exactly the way you wish any any
american would have been if they found
themselves in this situation
i say yes
i say yes
so
i don't know if i've ever given a
democrat this much credit
but uh
you know if you had a patriot of the
year award
to me he'd be it
he'd be it
crossing party lines
for the benefit of the country literally
the only person doing it in the whole
well kristen cinema too
so we'll give her a credit too let's not
be sexist
let's not be sexist give all the credit
to joe manchin
christian cinema's doing the same all
right
um
then biden and and smirkonish is calling
out biden for this
which is again is weird to see it on cnn
biden
was a clip where biden says the economy
is doing great in every way
in every way
except inflation
that's right the economy is doing great
in every way except inflation that's
what biden says
meaning that the economy is great except
we all can buy less stuff
or at least the other low income people
can buy less of the stuff
that's exactly what a bad economy looks
like the whole point of the economy is
to buy more stuff
you know i'm simplifying but if your
economy is going great but you all have
less money to buy stuff
that feels exactly like the opposite of
a good economy i mean i suppose it's
good for you know paying for our
military in some ways like that but if
you're just a family or a person and
you're just trying to buy stuff
it's definitely worse for you
um
and then and then smurkana showed the
actual inflation category so he was
driving that point home
and uh
so anyway
good good jobs murkonish i wonder if he
can last on cnn
by being actually even-handed and
showing context
i don't know if you can survive on the
network if you keep doing that
i guess we'll find out
all right here's my new uh
i'll put this on the watch list i'm not
totally convinced of this but i'm
watching it
um you know i like to tell you
the ways to spot cognitive dissonance
because people use similar language when
they're in it
and here are a couple that i think
are showing me cognitive dissonance
could be something else could be a false
signal but here's what i think
when people tell me
as i talk about risk management during
the pandemic when people tell me that
i'm quote panicking
and i'm panicking
about
the virus
and i think to myself i was actually
thinking to myself
i can't think of any time i've ever
worried about death
do you has anybody else have that
experience
like my whole life
i can't think of any time i've ever
worried about dying
um
and yeah and i think it might be unusual
i definitely worry about getting hurt
so i'm not trying to tell you i'm
without fear i have you know normal
amount i think
you know standard amount of fear pretty
average
so i worry about you know injury
you know i'm going to wear a helmet if i
use a motorcycle etc
but i don't think i've i can't think of
any time in my life i've worried about
death
per se
and so when people and
twice today people told me i was
panicking
just just today
two people told me i'm panicking
and you know if you look at the whole
week it's just person after person
you're panicking you're panicking
and i think that this might be cognitive
dissonance
because cognitive dissonance
makes you hallucinate the things that
aren't there
and i think this is a hallucination
that somebody just talking about risk
management
who wants the mandates to go away as i
do i want the mandates to go away
and i think we're already at a point
where we should just you know go back to
normal because we got the therapeutics
etc you know keep an eye on the icus but
get back to normal so i think i'm about
as close as you can get to not being
panicked as anything's ever been
and
because my fear of the whole pandemic is
you know reduced to
not much anything
at this point
so
um i think that's a tell
if if the if the only way you can
explain
my opinion
is by imagining i'm panicking which is
not evidence in any way
then you're probably hallucinating
because there's something in your own
thinking that's not working there's a
there's a connection that's missing so
you just hallucinate to fill in the
connection
here's another one
uh also said of me many times and you've
you've probably watched me block people
in real time
uh he's starting to come around
said about me
he's starting to come around
oh
took you long enough to figure out that
the vaccinations are you know all about
the money or something
to which i say
i was always there
so was everybody
not not only was i always concerned that
you know the
pharmaceutical companies might put
profits over safety
everybody was
there's there's nobody who didn't
consider that
that's
so so i'm not coming around to the idea
that the vaccinations might be dangerous
there's simply different information
there's more information we have you
know therapeutics there are alternatives
now there's absolutely nothing about the
situation that looks the same as it did
at the beginning
so if your opinion didn't change
there's something wrong with you
i mean i should have modified a little
bit
if you have exactly the same opinion you
had at the beginning you have some
explaining to do
so no i didn't come around that's
actually hallucination
i've always been exactly where i am now
i just have different information
all right
here's another bad argument i like to
call out bad arguments that agree with
me
now normally people call out bad
arguments that disagree with them
but i feel embarrassed
being on the same side as any bad
arguments do you ever have that feeling
like your own argument you feel is
pretty solid
but there are people who agree with you
who have terrible arguments you're like
oh don't don't target me with that
i don't want to be part of that
i don't understand your comment chad
it's a little over my head
so here's the argument that i hate
because i don't want to be associated
with it even though it agrees with me
uh that uh
twitter user paisano said this today and
this is just representative of people
who say it all the time maybe if we all
stopped reading and viewing all the
misinformation and hyperbole about
viruses that have always been with us
then we can stop the irrational panic
pandemic over something that's been 99
survivable
now what do you think of that argument
that we should stop panicking about it
which i didn't think i was
because 99 survive is that a good good
argument
well here's my problem with it one
percent of the population of earth if we
imagine that
everybody gets it eventually
because we're now past pandemic into
endemic you know beginning of endemic
endemic means basically everybody gets
it
so 7.8 billion people on earth one
percent of them would be 78 million
people
roughly the same number as died in world
war ii
should we ignore
a risk that's the size of world war ii
now as someone pointed out the
population of earth was far smaller
during world war ii
so their percentage of death
was higher and touched more people
true
but when you're talking about fatalities
percentages are
sometimes inappropriate
because if somebody you know dies that's
just the death it's not a percentage
right
so i think the total number the raw
number is a little more what i would
focus on
than the percentage of people died
you know they both have their point but
it's a real person right i want to count
them i don't want to just say oh well
it's only one percent so that's the
first thing that bothers me is just
thinking of deaths and percentages even
though we have to obviously i do it too
but as a focus is sort of obnoxious
and
here's what i would prefer
and i know somebody was going to say oh
i got the numbers wrong because it's not
you know it's well under 99 and it's
stratified and it's you know the people
with comorbidities it's not children we
should and i agree with all that okay
but my only point is if you're gonna
make that argument just do it honestly
just do it honestly
here's the honest version of the one
percent argument
it says the same thing
but it's more honest about it and it
goes like this
um
just say that you don't care if tens of
millions of people die
because that's not worth it to limit the
freedom of everybody
and especially because many of them will
be older
if you say that directly
then i'm okay with that
at least as a coherent opinion
you know i could disagree with it
but it's a coherent opinion
what i don't like is
saying that you want everything to open
up and pretending like that's not going
to have any impact on people dying
so let me say my own opinion in the most
honest way i can
i think we should go back to normal
because we have the therapeutics and
all that
you know keep the people who have the
the worst risks you know they could take
a little more
a little more uh care
but i would go back to something like
normal
with the full understanding that at
least a million people will die
it could be a lot more
it could be 5 million
it could be 10 million
but i'll say it directly
if you can't say it directly i don't
know if you belong in the conversation
right
ron says that's a dumb take
ron
if you had said
almost anything else
i wouldn't be blocking you right now
goodbye
um
it's the risk stupid and who gets to
assess it well here's my point you
should be able to say both the good and
the bad of your decision the good of my
decision is that we get back to normal
life most of us
the bad is that maybe five million
people would die it wouldn't necessarily
die
the same way
and maybe you'd be a different five
million if you kept everything closed
and the economy sucked
but
what do you think what do you think it
might take
that i don't have a problem with that
the 99 survivability if as long as
you're willing to take it to its
you know obvious
context
which is you prefer freedom over the
lives of five or 10 million people that
maybe you don't know
right i'll say it directly
i'll i'll say it directly but if you
can't say it directly i just have a
problem with your argument
all right um
i have two solutions for completely
ending the pandemic uh i know some of
you think it's already over but just
bear with me here because this is fun to
talk about
right
so
the next thing i'm going to talk about i
know a lot of you turn it off when it's
you know virus stuff but we're going to
talk about the engineering and the logic
of something which i think is way more
interesting than just the usual lockdown
no lockdown
blah blah all right
here is a question i asked and i believe
everybody got the wrong answer
and i want to walk through it with you
and see what you think
so i asked and again this is a
non-realistic situation just to isolate
your thinking this is not about the real
world okay so i'm going to give you a
very artificial situation that can never
exist in the real world you've got two
choices you've got you know you're in a
room with somebody who has covet
so that's the first unrealistic thing
because if you knew they had covet you
would probably get out of the room but
suppose you were in a room with somebody
in new head covet
and you had two choices for dealing with
it and again this is artificial
constraint you always have more choices
than this but one is to open one window
just one
and the other is to turn on the ceiling
fan but leave the windows closed
now it's not a sealed room with no
ventilation there if it's let's say it's
the winter
probably the you know the heating is
going and circulating stuff and if it's
the summer maybe the ac is going
whatever
so it's a closed room but you know with
the normal circulation of a closed room
so which one would be more dangerous in
the comments your closed room with the
fan but of course there's some
circulation or the open window no fan
now based on what i saw on twitter
almost all of you are going to say open
window
but i'm seeing more people say fan
interesting all right here's how you
would decide this i think and i need
some help with this
what is more dangerous a plume in other
words the
the virus that's coming out of a
speaker's mouth
like going directly into your face
is that more dangerous than simply being
in a room
where the
you know the average of the air has some
virus in it
which is more dangerous
a plume
or being in a room that's got a rising
amount of virus in it the longer you're
there but it's just sort of spread out
those of you who said plume
might be right
but
doesn't it depend how long you're in the
room
but if you're in the room for five
minutes
the plume is definitely worse
i'll agree
if you're only in the room for five
minutes plume is worse than ambient or
whatever it is background virus i think
we'd all agree with that
but what if you're in the room for an
hour
and apparently there are ceo there are
co2 sensors you can buy they're kind of
expensive it's 600 bucks or so that you
can put on the table in your conference
room and it will actually show you a
light to tell you when your co2 has
reached a certain level
now if the co2 reaches a certain level
that tells you the ventilation is not
good
because the the exhaling hasn't been you
know
left the room your exhaling has started
to build up in the room if the co2 is
building up now
would the virus amount in the room
build up in lockstep with the co2 what
do you think
um
yeah i still don't understand chad i
don't i'm sorry i don't understand your
context but i appreciate that you're
that you're adding the details
so that i i appreciate when somebody
tries to put the details in the comment
even if i don't get them all i mean
that that's the way to go
so
here's my question for the experts and
this is my missing piece of data
how many people get
covered just by being in a room
for any length of time
compared to the number of people get it
when they know they were talking to
somebody with a plume
take chris christie
do you think chris christie got
covered from trump allegedly
because he was in the room
or because at some point
trump spoke directly to him and
plumed him
right trump probably plumed everybody in
that room
at one point or another he was probably
talking directly to everybody who got
infected
now we don't know
speculating a little bit
so here's idea number one for ending the
pandemic
you have the following
rule
if you can't open a window
and you don't have like really high
level
ventilation like an airplane does
if you can't open a window
you have to have a fan on
that's it
and then the pandemic's over because in
my opinion
a fan would dissipate the plumes so
effectively that you'd have to be in
that room a long time to get covered
from the background distributed
stuff now this is of course hypothesis
i don't know that anybody has the data
that could say this is right or wrong
yet
but you could a b test it couldn't you
could you not say all right the
following rooms this winter
we will have fans on
and it'll be a representative bunch of
people using this room and then there
are other ones that we won't have a fan
on it'll just be the normal
circulation and we'll see which one
produces more
more infections i feel like you could
test it
and i feel pretty strongly that if you
could get covered simply by being in the
on the other side of the room from
somebody who has it
we would all already have it
why do only 20 percent of 25 percent of
spouses get it when the spouse has it
why do you think that is
well that dovetails into my next
way to solve the pandemic you ready for
this
we we are very aware that breathing
can exhale the
the virus right
but do we not believe
that talking is the primary
spreading method
fact check me
is that not well understood
that the talking
and singing in particular talking loudly
and singing
are those two things not the primary
thing that spreads it from the spreader
right
i think that's true right
now if you have to be talking to spread
it
and only 25 of spouses are giving it to
each other
does that sound wrong
because i've got a feeling that that
makes perfect sense
it under under the assumption which is
not confirmed
the spreading is let's say spreading is
80
of how you
let's say talking is 80 of how you give
it to somebody do you think that that
would hold up
just a guess
but suppose
talking is 80 of it
i think it could be that would
completely explain the 25
you know i was teasing the other day
that when you're you're married or in a
relationship
your spouse will try to talk to you
while you're standing next to running
water in the next room
because that's how spouses talk to each
other they shouted each other in the
other room
or they talk to you as you're walking by
or they'll they'll yell something to you
that you need to know before you get in
the car
or you know you're you're you're opening
the door to leave
and your spouse in the kitchen says oh
you know today blah blah remember this
all bat spouses
don't talk close to each other very
often
if they've been married a while
you know if you just took the number of
people who don't have sex in a two-week
period
right
take the number of married people who
don't have sex
in a two-week period
uh and they don't even sleep in the same
bed often because of snoring and other
things
i'm not sure that we should be surprised
that only 25 percent of spouses get it
if
talking closely is how it's mostly
spread
i mean that would explain it completely
right because if you're in a let's say a
uh
a beginning relationship you get really
close to each other and talk a lot
but if you're married you kind of
shouted each other as you're walking by
and you know you're lucky if you have
sex every two weeks if you've been you
know in a standard marriage for a long
time
so i don't know
so here is my other my second suggestion
for ending the pandemic are you ready
first one is turn on fans in any room
that doesn't have a window open the
second one is
we all stop talking for two weeks
still communicate
but you can only talk if somebody is you
know across the room
or you text them
just two weeks
no i'm not serious because anything i
say with two weeks you're all gonna
you're all gonna piss your pants and say
but but but scott
they told us we would flatten the
flattened the curve in two weeks no it's
a coincidence that they're both two
weeks it has nothing to do with this
idea
how about testing it
suppose you took a uh high
let's say a group that you knew had some
coven going around and you said all
right
for this group of people
just stop talking for two weeks
voluntarily right just to test it
i could go two weeks without talking
in fact i went three years without
talking i had a voice problem so i think
i have some special insight on this it
turns out you can go two weeks without
talking
and you're not even gonna be worse off
for it at all
it would be like the smallest sacrifice
you ever made in your life
and you might even be happier right
because you can still communicate you
know we most of our communications by
messaging and now let me throw in a
provocative thought
we know that covet is highly correlated
with age or bad outcomes
and the older you are the more likely
you are to have a bad outcome from covet
but
old people talk in person more than
young people
could it be
i don't believe this by the way but it's
fun to talk about
could it be
that one of the biggest reasons that
kids don't get it is
they don't talk in person
even have you ever seen two teens
hanging out
let me give you my impression of two
teens sitting shoulder to shoulder
hanging out
that's it that's my impressions of two
teens talking right next to each other
they're both talking to someone else
right
everybody who's observed
children knows this right they're
talking to someone else now obviously
there's
direct age-related
issues
the ace to you know whatever receptors
or
children have more of them so they're
you know obvious biological reasons
there'd be more but on top of that i
wonder if
below a certain age people don't talk to
each other in person
as much
just wondering
a lot of people went to work when people
weren't going to school
governor newsom is
being smart in a way that you're not
going to like
some of you
he announced that his administration is
going to make it easier for private
citizens to sue people who sell assault
rifles
or parts for these ghost guns
do you know where he got that idea
does anybody know where
newsome got the idea of allowing private
citizens
to sue people who sell assault rifles
texas abortion law
i don't think i saw this coming did
anybody else see it coming
yeah
so uh
from a political perspective it's kind
of brilliant
but from a uh health of the republic
perspective
i'm not sure either of these is a good
move
because it just creates a whole new set
of
things that can happen that
maybe
should go through the normal process
instead
um
i don't like using the chords for this
that's my take anyway
bud is smart
you know at the moment i would say gavin
newsom would be the number one
uh
potential
presidential candidate who could make a
dent
anybody disagree
um because i can't i just am i can't
imagine biden running i can't imagine
kamala harris winning
again at all
now i'm not saying you like him
i'm just saying he has the most skill
well let's let's take the two of them
consider mayor pete
versus
newsome i don't think that's even close
what do you think
mayor pete would look like uh
he would look like a teenager compared
to newsome wouldn't he
joe manchin interesting
i'm not sure joe manchin is president
material but he's definitely leader of
the congress material
feels more trustworthy somebody says
well
maybe trustworthy in one way but i don't
know
yeah
i don't know that's subjective
newsome's voice is irritating does
anybody else have that problem
i know it sounds kind of leaderly his
voice
newsome versus trump would be troll that
would be trouble for trump
actually i think newsome can beat him
he's the only one i can think of
who would have a
like an actual shot at beating trump
what do you think
his speech pattern is annoying
newsome would be trump
yeah i'm not saying you'd you'd like him
with vax mandates for kids no way but
remember
everything that newsom does is at least
popular on his side that's
sometimes
sometimes that's all you need
it's the policies scott no not really
it's not really we want it to be about
policies but it never is
tulsi gabbard could beat trump
[Music]
that would be tougher
that's an interesting matchup
the reason that's an interesting matchup
is that she wouldn't take the bait
and might be the only one who wouldn't
take the bait
so she would i think she would take his
energy away and i don't know what that
would look like
um
took two yeah mayor pete took two months
off that that's going to haunt him
forever
but i actually support him on that
i don't know if i said that directly
have i yet i actually support buddha
judge taking those two months off
um and here's why
everybody has a reason not to do it
everyone has a reason not to take the
two months off
now you could say but but it's a
pandemic
in which i say but but but he had other
people doing stuff
now we don't have direct evidence that
his two months cost us anything if we
ever got that then i would revise my
opinion that would be new information
but as a general
here are a couple of general things
sometimes when you think you there's
somebody indispensable but you want to
fire them
and then you fire them and you find out
they were never that indispensable
so
sometimes
you know we assume things to be true
that just aren't true
um
generals don't
is that true
why not why wouldn't a general you think
that uh there's only one general who can
handle every situation
we don't have like an extra general who
could stand in for two months
if if generals don't maybe they should
maybe they should
yeah you know if you look at the
value to the family and to the child
especially for those two months
you know such a bonding experience and
stuff we don't know the value of that
compared to the value of you know pete
doing
something instead of his stand and doing
something
so at the moment uh
in in the absence of direct evidence
that buddha judge's time off heard
something directly and i don't have that
evidence in the absence of that i'm
going to support him taking the time off
because i would do the same for you
right if you were in a job that looked
critical
you know and there's no way you could
take time off i would still support you
taking that time off because we always
figure it out
we just always figure it out
you know it's one of those things that
looks like a problem until you're in it
and then you're like okay that wasn't so
bad
um
he should have probably announced it uh
and who was stepping in i agree with
that yeah i agree that the way he
handled it and not telling us who was in
charge what he was going and stuff
at least telling the public
that was clearly a mistake
yeah and i i think you can ding it for
that for sure
why has mayor pete done that impresses
scott nothing
nothing
um i'm basing only on his intelligence
uh and his communication ability which
are both both quite good
um
there was an admiral at midway he was
replaced by a fleet admiral
because he was down with his skin
disease well there must be plenty of
examples where
where somebody had to fill in for
leaders
um
this guy has a soft spot for gay or
black men
that's true
that's true i have a soft spot
i'm not sure how to call the soft spot
but i do prefer the underdog
somewhat reflexively
uh i don't apologize for that
how do you know peter smart uh went to
harvard and he was a mckinsey consultant
you can't be a mckinsey consultant
unless you're in the top
one percent
all right
if you're in the top two percent
you don't get to be a mckinsey
consultant top two percent is literally
genius level according to mensa
but that wouldn't be good enough to be a
mckinsey consultant
you'd have to be sort of in the top one
percent
so
we know that about him
you know
um
top one percent of memorizing stuff
now mckinsey is not going to pick people
who are just good at memorizing
the i think they're hiring standards are
pretty good
all right that's all i got for you today
today was not a very newsy day but wait
for tomorrow oh my god
tomorrow i'm working on a micro lesson
for the folks on locals
on how to predict
it was a little harder than i thought to
put it together because the way you
predict is different for each domain
so if it's a relationship versus
politics versus business so i'm going to
try to give you a quick tour of the best
ways to predict in each of those domains
almost there might see that today or
tomorrow
and that
is all i've got for you today
um
taiwan invasion of the olympics i'm
going to make a prediction
no taiwan invasion and no ukraine
invasion
um
for the next 12 months
that's my prediction
now i think
probably there'll be no invasions ever
but for the next 12 months i feel
confident that neither of those
countries will do a
land invasion or anything that looks
like an invasion
10 years from now who knows
wise guy
all right that's all for now and all
uh
yeah we talked about craig wright
already
um
australia camps yeah i've talked about
that before
um oh if you're on locals by the way if
you're using the app
don't turn it to landscape
um
and then back because it'll lock it so
it's a bug they're working through at
the moment but if you use the browser
version you don't have that problem
all right and galen maxwell i haven't
heard anything that has come out of that
yet
um
i love my camp
oh herbert you'd be so
wrong um
all right similar blah blah blah
low humidity on planes kills it maybe
maybe
uh what do you do with the money people
pay you here
that's an interesting question uh on uh
on youtube most of it goes to you know
just pay my assistant
and pay my taxes and there's not really
much left
uh locals is um
if you want to make money the
subscription service is the way you do
it uh youtube is
really more of a marketing
device at this point
all right that's all i got and i'll talk
to you tomorrow
