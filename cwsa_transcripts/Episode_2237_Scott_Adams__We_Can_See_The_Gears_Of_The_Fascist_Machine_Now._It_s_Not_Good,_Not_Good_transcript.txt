yeah
good morning everybody Welcome to the
highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and
aren't you glad you're here because
today
if you'd like to take your experience up
to levels which have never been known to
human beings all you need is a cup of
micro glass a Tankard shelters dying the
canteen jug of flask of vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day the
thing that makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous separate it goes
like this
ah
I feel that your oxytocin was just
activated
even from a distance it's one of my
powers
I wonder if you could increase some of
these oxytocin by hypnosis
I'll bet you could
I'll bet that's actually possible
but let's talk about the news
so there's a new way that AI is being
trained you know the old way was I would
look at words
and it would say oh if this combination
of words is more common
then it'll use it that way and so just
the combination of words created this AI
that we use now but you might also be
aware
that Tesla is using a video trading
thing so it's trading its cars to drive
autonomously
by just feeding it a gazillion videos of
cars driving
and it doesn't teach you any rules it
just shows that you know a bazillion
miles of driving and the AI just figures
out how to drive
by looking at how other people drive
but apparently that could be extended to
other things
so now there's something called a lbm
so the llm is the large language model
so that's trained on human words
and the lbm is a behavior model
so they are here's how they they train
it to make breakfast
they put the AI there and they say watch
this
and then they make breakfast in front of
it
and then they do it again a bunch of
times
and then it knows how to make breakfast
now it's only going to know what it
cooked and what you cooked in front of
it but it's actually learning tasks by
observation
I guess one of the breakthroughs is they
gave it a thumb that could feel like a
human hand
so if you've got at least one part of
the robot that can feel something
then the feeling you know adds to its
learning so it learns faster
but apparently you can just teach you
things it's already taught at a bunch of
things now my only caution to this is
the first time I read about this was
15 or 20 years ago
I think it was at least 15 years ago
that I saw a article that a a robot had
been trained to fold laundry
simply by looking at a lot of people
folding laundry I guess
but it never that robot never turned
into anything but it looks like it's the
same model you just show it how you do
it and it learns it
so that's pretty exciting maybe it will
learn to do everything
like I said the robots will take all the
manual labor jobs but then AI will take
all the the intelligence related jobs
but that still still leaves a lot of
room for humans
uh it's called crime so if you want to
get your criminal uh skills up to up to
date it might be all you have left
well Don Jr's uh account got hacked on
the X profile
uh and somebody had a good time uh
tweeting on his behalf
let me just tell you some of the things
that were tweeted from Don Jr's account
that we're not actually Don Jr
North Korea is about to get smoked
okay
and I'm sorry to announce my father
passed away
I'll be running for president
yeah and more like that I believe the Nu
n-word was a part of it yeah yeah he got
now that's hacked
that is hacked
do you know what weird I thought I had
basically yesterday and today
uh one of my devices I don't want to be
specific but one of my devices is
showing an indication that somebody's in
my phone
or in my account in some way
and you know there's a whole bunch of
things you can do
like you can you can get rid of your
phone and then you can put it on total
lockdown mode you can get rid of all
your prior apps and you know reload them
from scratch so I I know how to create a
clean phone
but the work involved in making sure
that my phone is clean
is more than the benefit of not of
having my privacy
isn't that weird
I actually compared the two and I
thought you know what
I just don't even need my privacy that
much
they win yeah they win exactly they win
when I looked at how much work it would
take to secure my phone and then what is
secured let me just give you a hint once
your phone is secured
the only way it could ever stay that way
is if you never click on a link again on
your phone
that's the only way if you click on a
link even if it comes from your best
friend
you don't know if your best friend got
you know taken by the same link
right so if your phone can't be used to
click on a link
it's almost useless because I use my
phone mostly for work related stuff and
it's it's just people sending me links
all day it's basically the only thing I
do with my phone look at links if I
can't do that I don't even need the
phone practically I I mean I'm
exaggerating but they actually got to
the point
we're actually at a point where there
are two things that I assume to be true
number one I'm definitely compromised
just because I do you know political
things in public I just assume
somebody's in there maybe more than one
entity I don't know
the other thing I assume is that if
somebody wanted to find out something
about me there's nothing that would stop
them
so I mean I could I don't really have
anything I can think of to hide but if
they wanted to find out more about me
I don't know that I could stop anybody
and the other thing is that the moment I
cleaned my phone
wouldn't I have to do the same thing
with all of my devices
from my you know iPads to my laptop
and if they were in any one of them
they're going to be into everything
right so it's basically a situation
where it's not actually practical
to keep hackers out of my private
information
it's actually not possible
I don't see any practical way I could do
that I mean I could do it for a minute
I could get a burner phone that would
have no utility
but I wouldn't be able to just do my
business and also maintain my privacy
those two things I don't think can
happen
two phones uh
yeah that's just too much trouble
yeah so I don't know
I think we're all hacked
all right I'm gonna I'm gonna talk about
a story and I'm going to try not to lose
my
like I'm really going to try hard
I'm just going to tell you the story
and try not to lose my shift
so this is uh I believe we're coming up
on the five year anniversary
of China killing my stepson
along with the cartels
um so my stepson died of a fentanyl
overdose five years ago
now in 2018 I said I was going to
destroy China
in Revenge
and if you believe Peter's Zion is
pretty much almost dead it's it's going
to fall apart any time
however this uh I'm sure that the my
feelings about China
also influenced my feelings about tick
tock
because Tick Tock is as many people said
digital Fentanyl
so to me The Tick Tock issue and the
fentanyl issue are just two ways that
China is killing Americans and
destroying America
so in my head even though they're very
different topics
they're not
they're not they're not different topics
so this is all by way of telling you I
do not have an objective feeling about
this topic
and I'm just barely containing myself
right now I'm just barely holding on I'm
going to tell you what the story is in
the Wall Street Journal today
about tick tock
I'm not sure I could even get through
this
uh honest honestly god I think I'm gonna
 lose it
but I'll do the best I can just to tell
you the story
so this is a Wall Street Journal I think
I'll just read it
Washington Tick Tock has hardly any
friends in government
earlier this year
as the Biden Administration Congress and
State legislatures were threatening to
ban the Chinese owned a video Giant
now
would you agree that I was part of the
push to ban tick tock
I mean I don't know who was talking
about it harder than I was
in in some ways I feel like I might have
actually been the main influence I'm not
sure
but there were other people
all right so so here's the background
that Congress was against Tick Tock and
it looked like there was going to be
movement to ban it
and then do you do you remember it
didn't happen
and you kept wondering well what's going
on like why is it not happening it's so
obvious and then did you notice that
every time the politicians talked about
it
they wouldn't say that there was an
influence risk which is actually the big
risk they would say there was a data
risk and I kept saying why do you keep
saying data risk although that is a
small risk when the big risk is the one
you're not mentioning like why do you
keep doing that now the only thing I
could think of
is that some members of Congress enough
of them had been bought off by tick tock
because it looked exactly like
somebody had been bribed
and probably a lot of people have been
bribed
so that's what I thought at the time and
I think many of you can verify that I
said it publicly and probably a whole
bunch of times
right can can you verify that I said
publicly Congress must be bought off
because there's no explanation for this
observation all right now let me read on
let me continue reading on from The Wall
Street Journal
Tick Tock now has many more friends
how did Tick Tock get so many friends in
Congress
with something in common
backing from billionaire financier Jeff
yes
Yasss
they've helped stall attempts to Outlaw
America's most downloaded app
why would this billionaire care about
this app
why is a billionaire care about a tick
tock app huh well here's why yas's
Investment Company Susquehanna
International Group bet big on Tick Tock
in 2012. boy that was a good time to bet
on it buying a stake in parent company
bite Dance Now measured at about 15
percent so he owns 15 percent of bite
dance which owns tick tock that
translates into a personal stake for yes
of seven percent in bite dance
so he doesn't own everything that's
invested in it he owns part of the
investment it is worth roughly
21 billion dollars
that's one guy
one investor
one person
is worth an extra 21 billion now he's
already a billionaire
but that's most of his net worth
the vast majority of his net worth is
tick tock
right
um
and his whole his whole valuation like
the billionaire is worth 28 million 28
billion but 21 of the 28 billion of his
net worth is just tick tock
okay that's because just because take
time did so well
[Music]
let's go on yes is also one of the top
donors to the Club for Growth
the Club for Growth
well I wonder who that is
there's a Club for Growth it's an
influential conservative group that
rallied Republican opposition to a
Tick-Tock ban
gas has donated 61 million dollars to
the Club for Growth political spending
arms since 2010 or about 24 percent of
its total
according to Federal records
the Club for Growth made public its
opposition to Banning Tick-Tock in March
in an opinion article by its president
at a time when sentiment against the
platform among segments of both parties
was running high on Capitol Hill
are you ready for this part
oh it gets worse
this gets worse
Days Later Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky
stood up on the senate floor and quashed
an attempt to fast-track a bill by
Senator Josh Hawley
to ban downloading of The Tick Tock app
Senator Rand Paul
said quote we will be acting like the
Chinese government if we ban Tick Tock
here Paul said around that time
in June that's just a few months after
Rand Paul said that yes donated 3
million to a political committee backing
Paul
including that contribution Yaz and his
wife Janine have donated more than 24
million to Paul
or committees that support him since
2015.
according to Federal records Club for
Growth has given Paul
and supporting political committees
one eight 1.8 million since 2020.
it was exactly what it looks like
it's Rand Paul
now
let me give you a little bit you know I
want to I want to show both sides
Rand Paul is unique in that he's more
libertarian
right Libertarians don't like
governments interfering with their
business
do you think that's what's going on do
you think Rand Paul is simply being a
good libertarian
and he's just being true to his his
belief that the government shouldn't get
involved in Banning stuff
yeah well let's look at his statement we
will be acting like the Chinese
government if we ban Tick-Tock here well
that's correct isn't it isn't that
correct
they would be acting we would be acting
like the Chinese government if we ban
tick tock do you know why that would be
like the Chinese government
because the Chinese government bans Tick
Tock in their own country
because it would be damaging to the
children
so yes we would be acting like China
because China is acting correctly
they're protecting their children
does this sound like a real opinion that
Rand Paul has
do you believe this is his literal
literally this is just his whole opinion
well
to me it looks exactly like what it
looks like that he has bought
that China owns China indirectly
through the billionaire
owns Rand Paul
and Josh Hawley we should conclude is
not owned by China
because Josh Hawley tried to kill it
and Rand Paul stopped it from being
killed
now why did why did it take so long for
me to learn this
why did it take so long for you to learn
it and by the way big big props to the
Wall Street Journal for doing the
article I I should have noted the
authors
but I recommend it just go to the Wall
Street Journal and click on it see
what's up
so why do you think we found this out
now
I don't know
but I would hate to think it's because
Murdoch who owns The Wall Street Journal
and is a billionaire himself may have
some problems with this other
billionaire like like maybe it's not
even news
for all I know it could be just one
Billionaire's matter and another
billionaire and found out found a way to
take it out of them
so you can't really trust anything can
you
but at least we know more than we knew
before
somebody said give Rand Paul 48 hours to
respond
no
no nope
absolutely not
no no no no no no he's not going to give
48 hours to respond
um
how do you feel about that
how do you feel about the fact that Rand
Paul is your kids
for money
yeah he's your children for
money
I mean not physically him
but he is destroying their brains and
their lives
with tech talk
apparently for money
Now isn't it convenient that it also
matches somewhat his political opinions
that the government shouldn't be
involved but you know
you don't have to be much of a mind
reader
to know that's not what's going on here
follow the money it's very predictive
it's exactly what you thought it was all
right now
let me change topics
let's see this was a situation where it
was very clear that the right thing to
do was to ban it very clear
right it's very clear
is there any other situation where it's
very clear what the right thing to do is
but for some reason Congress isn't doing
it
can you think of another one like that
yeah the Border that's right
the border is exactly like this
at least observed from the outside is
something in which you should assume
that Congress overwhelmingly agrees they
should be closed or controlled
and yet it's not happening
Tick Tock overwhelmingly was you know
people were in favor of banning it
but it wasn't happening
it's the same situation you can now
comfortably assume based on pattern
recognition and the fact that the
government is guilty until proven
innocent not the other way around as
long as there's lack of transparency
they're guilty you just have to assume
that
and so it seems that the cartels either
through some other billionaire or
directly
have enough control of our Congress
that they can make us do things we don't
want to do
yeah
so uh
you know I think it is fair to hear what
Rand Paul says in response
but if it's true that he he's the one
who stopped the ban I don't really need
to hear anything else
because there's no way in the world
he's dumb enough
to not know what he did
he knows what he did if the if this
reporting is true and you know it seems
incredible to me it's a credible source
talking about public information
so you know how wrong can it be
but we'll see I mean maybe there's more
to this story but at the moment it looks
like Rand Paul has just bought and paid
for
that's what it looks like
do you all agree with that
interpretation there Rand Paul is just
bought
I'm seeing it now
all right but let me ask you this those
of you who are saying no
I know it's because you you have good
feelings about him and so so if I up
until this point
but it's going to be a little hard to
ignore this
pretty hard to ignore this
wow there's a lot of people who still
want to back him even knowing he's
operating against the United States
but you understand he's operating
against the interests of the United
States in probably the most basic way
that is destroying the country
do you don't you don't think that Tick
Tock is the main reason the country is
if you haven't been paying attention if
you don't think it's the main reason
it's the main reason
our youth has been destroyed their minds
have been turned into
by this app
and and others like it but it's a
primary one
so what else is going on
um the ex-prime minister of New Zealand
yes and uh ardern
this is Jonathan turley's tweeting about
this and writing about it
uh
she's turned down to be the number one
voice for censoring free speech
is that amazing that the prime minister
ex-priminister in New Zealand is like
giving talks at the United Nations and
she's just directly is against free
speech
she says misinformation must be stopped
and the government gets to decide what
is misinformation
what is that
that is the end of free speech how in
the world does she not know that
what would you assume about
somebody who has an opinion that is so
objectively and obviously bad for the
world
you have to assume she's owned by
somebody who has some financial interest
you could not assume that this is a real
opinion
does anybody think this is a real
opinion that the government should be in
charge of what's real
do you think she's really believes that
that the governments
should tell everybody what's true
really you think she really believes
that
because you know who believes that
nobody
there's nobody who believes that there's
only people who want to want their
version of Truth to to be Supreme
you know if if Republicans somehow won
all branches of the government
do you think that the Democrats would be
saying you know you've got to listen to
the government when it tells you what's
true no they would say that the
government is lying because it's all
Republicans you should really listen to
Democrats
but when the Democrats have you know
sufficient control of the government
then they say you should listen to the
government coincidentally Democrats
right so none of this is about
information or misinformation or your
health
it's complete control it's just a
control play
like so many other things are
well if you were a subscriber to Dilbert
reborn either on the locals platform or
you could subscribe on the X platform
just hit the subscription button to see
Dilbert every day the spicier version
that's not censored by anybody
uh but you would be amused to know that
dogbert has started a
non-profit organization called the
dogbert defamation League
and his business model is accusing
corporations of uh being racists unless
they donate to the dog defamation League
yeah unless let me tell you business is
booming
so that's what you're missing
if you're not subscribing to
the Dilbert reborn comic
well uh Louis CK made the terrible
mistake of trying to talk about
something that mattered
and every now and then you wonder how
dumb people can be who seem otherwise
successful and smart
and
Louis CK explained why he was in support
of open borders I think it was on Joe
Rogan's show and he said quote my
feeling is that we should open it let
everybody pour in
but then there will be all these
problems yes there should be it
shouldn't be so great here in America
and he goes on to explain that because
America is doing so well
and other places are not doing as well
that it's not fair that we keep all our
good stuff
that we should let them in to have our
stuff
do I need to spend even 10 seconds
describing why that's the dumbest
opinion in the history of all opinions
in the world since the beginning of the
universe and the big bang and possibly
before the Big Bang when there was
another timeline that existed in
no I don't
I don't that is so dumb
that one wonders what does somebody's
face even look like when they say
something like that
so I captured a screenshot Louis CK as
he was describing
his uh erudite ideas
so here's the picture I swear I this is
not photoshopped
he actually looked like the
pointy-haired boss in Dilbert
he actually looked like the pointy air
boss when he said it
now
again this is not photoshopped
you know it's unfair to catch somebody
in mid-speech because their you know
their mouth will be funny like like that
but that's actually his picture
now have you ever seen a a face that
matched an opinion better than this one
right so if you didn't see the picture
and I said he was in favor of open
borders because we have too much
you'd say
who said that
and I would say a person that you
thought was a reasonable person
and then you say who
and I'd say well let me show you a
picture of the person who said that and
then I'd show him this picture and then
you would say oh I get it now I get it
oh wait I can put my own picture next to
it oh my God I can make the reflection
I can make him turn into me
are you seeing this it's different on
the two platforms
I can make him talk
we should open the mothers we should
also to the mortars
okay
that was weird
well uh let's see there's a new
investigation that's going to be opened
on Elon Musk oh what a big surprise it
turns out it was a bit of a a hunting
trip to find that if they could find any
bad stuff on Elon Musk to shut him down
so let me see if I get this right so
Congress wants to promote Tick Tock for
which some members are getting paid
uh and you know indirectly
um
but it wants to kill Twitter probably
because it's the last place you have
free speech in the United States
in any practical way everything else is
just narrative and and
but now he's being investigated for
the the allegation doesn't even make
sense to me
so I'll tell you the allegation but I'll
tell you also I'm positive this doesn't
make sense
so the allegation is that he was that
musk was going to use Tesla as like a
private piggy bank
to pay for what would be you know an
elaborate home he was going to build
some kind of a glass home now I don't
know if that ever happened I think maybe
there was some movement on it maybe it's
not happening now I don't know
but do you believe is there any part of
you that believes
the Elon Musk who's running a public
company right has shareholders in that
he he was going to take some Untold
millions of dollars just out of the
shareholders money
and he was just going to buy a house
with it
because that's what's been reported
that he was just sort of expensing it
off of Tesla
does that sound even slightly true
no it it doesn't there's not even like
like 0.001 width of that possibly being
true
but do you think that the public is
aware that there's basically no way that
could happen in a public company
there is no way that can happen in a
public company
it just couldn't happen
but but that's the news the news is
saying that maybe it happened it's crazy
all right well if there's more to this
than I know I'll update it
so there's a new study they did some
brain Imaging
and they found that people who were
likely to be obese
have a heightened neural sensitivity to
reward
so people who overeat
uh get more benefit from overeating it
just it feels better
have you heard have you heard that
opinion from anyone who was let's say
not a research scientist
somebody who wasn't an expert
yeah me
as I've told you a number of times and I
love telling this story because it's
when I learned probably the best lesson
I ever had in my life
I was
and I was taking hypnosis class and the
instructor was overweight himself
and you know I don't know if you call
him obese but he was in that
neighborhood and
he explained why even though he's a
hypnotist
you know he couldn't be hypnotized to
quit eating
and here was his entire explanation of
everything you need to know about diets
and dieting
I like to eat
that was it
I like to eat
and he said if he didn't like it so much
he wouldn't do it
and the the extension from that is that
people who don't like to eat as much are
going to be able to control their their
weight now I'm perfect example
I am currently actually I overshot my
Mark I'm actually below the way I would
like to be at the moment I could
probably add two pounds but
I got there effortlessly
by just not eating bread for a while
that's it I just took bread out of my
diet nothing else just any bread and
lost 10 pounds right away now
do I sound like somebody who's like
obsessed about food no I'm not a foodie
I don't like dessert you know I'm just
not drawn to it
it's the same reason I'm not an
alcoholic
you know I am not an alcoholic
I don't enjoy alcohol as much as
alcoholics do
you know I'm not fat
because I don't enjoy food
as much as other people do
and that's it
once you understand that one sentence I
like to eat
that's the explanation of every
everything in the world if you believe
there's this thing called willpower that
doesn't make sense
because you could say yeah yeah maybe
you like it better but you use your
willpower you just got to ramp up your
willpower a little higher just get a
little more willpower
there is no such thing as willpower
or free will
they're only competing um things that
you like to do or you're afraid of
that's it the things you want to do and
the things you're afraid of there's
nothing else
and if there's something you're not
afraid of and you want to do it you're
going to do a lot of it
and if that happens to be eating you can
eat too much
everything can be explained by simply
competing levels of Interest how much
you want something it explains your
entire all Behavior All activity all
human activity everything you see can be
described by people follow the thing
they like the most and they fear the
least that's it you don't need any free
will or willpower or any of that stuff
you can explain all observations
nothing's left out
anyway that's just another example
um
in which the people who are hypnotists
have learned what science is learning 40
years later
and it's all right right I may have told
you this about the large language models
that as a hypnotist I'd learned 40 years
ago that people don't have actual
thoughts like reason
that they just put words together and
then they say later well that was a
reason
and that's what the large language
models taught us 40 years later yeah
hypnosis was way ahead
of all the brain science and it wasn't
because there was a science to hypnosis
it was just trial and error and it
became obvious what a brain was if
you're a hypnotist if you weren't a
hypnotist you believed in Magic oh I've
got a soul and Free Will and willpower
these are all just magical thinking
hypnotists don't see any of that in
practice they just see it like a machine
and then it explains everything
here's a horrible Trend that you knew
was going to happen but I'm going to
give you the optim most optimistic take
so over in Spain there are dozens of
girls reporting in school that people
had generated uh AI based nudes of them
so they were fake but they were AI made
so they looked probably they probably
took a photograph of the real face and
then added the nakedness to it so of
course it's a huge
psychological traumatic experience as
you imagine it would be but by the end
of this year
every girl in high school will have an
unauthorized AI nude
of them because their friends will be
happy to do it all they need is to take
an app and take a photo and drag it in
and push a button and you got a nude
picture of your your classmate of course
everybody's going to do it of course
they will there's nothing that can stop
it and and it wouldn't even be illegal
to do it privately for your own purposes
um
I don't even know if it's illegal to
pass it around but I bet you could find
a law that violates
if it's not the actual person
then it wouldn't have the same criminal
problems as a picture of the actual
person but it would be abusive
so if there's blackmail involved I guess
sometimes there's blackmail involved so
there would be lots of crimes that they
could hit without it being an actual
picture of the person I guess
yeah there's nothing that can stop it
but here do you want to hear the
positive thing
here's the positive part of that
in theory as The Fakes get better and
better
two things are going to happen number
one you will get bored by it
imagine the first time you see an AI
picture of one of your classmates and
you're 14 years old you're 14 years old
you're like oh this is the greatest
thing I'm going to send it to all my
friends
and then they say what app did you use
and they're like oh we got to make some
more of these I've got somebody else I
want to do this to so you do a few more
of your friends and you know it's trauma
and it's psychological damage it's
terrible
and then a few more people do it because
it's easy and a few more people do it
because the other ones didn't get caught
and pretty soon
you will literally be bored when you see
another AI nude picture of your
classmate
it's just going to be like another meme
it will just be a meme
and you'll just be Boop now you might
say to yourself oh this one's really
funny and you might send it around
but nobody's going to believe it's real
you see where I'm going
pretty soon and very soon even the real
pictures of you nude will be regarded as
fake because the fakes look like the
real ones so you could get to the point
where nobody cares
that even an underage person has has a
picture floating around because people
would just assume it's Ai and they will
or that they don't know and they'll also
be completely bored by it they will be
completely bored by it you'll see a nude
of your best friend and you'll be like
so
it's not a real nude
yeah I've seen 50 of these
so yeah I I think that it will be
terrible for a while and then we'll just
get used to it and it won't be such a
thing
all right uh Christopher Ruffo I think
I'm pronouncing that right our UFO is it
rufo or Ruffo
does anybody know
I'd like to say it right
ooh rufo okay I think it's rufo but he
likes dunking on uh Ibrahim Kennedy who
are let's say uh
what would be the right word
um policy wise they would be opposites
right so Abram is the anti-racist guy
who many would say is actually just a
racist
so
uh rufo tweet says Ibrahim Ibrahim ex
Kennedy has admitted defeat in the
latest edition of his book Kennedy has
deleted his most famous quotation I
guess I used to say the only the only
remedy to racist discrimination is
anti-racist discrimination
and that rufo says he blames white
people for making him look racist
he recommended racism against white
people and then blames white people for
making him look racist
and then you know I'll remind you of the
other news that Kendy had some kind of a
anti-racist center that had been
partially funded by I think Jack Dorsey
and some other entities and he had a
little staff of people doing anti-racist
stuff
and the staff ended up complaining about
him
so he actually created a group of
professional complainers and then it
turns out oops
you got a bunch of professional
complainers on your staff I mean who
would have seen that coming you hired
professional victims
they were literally people who were
primed to be victims and you hired him
and then they said that they were
victims working for you
who who could have seen that coming well
I'll tell you who could have seen it
coming anybody who understands how cause
and effect works do you think Louis CK
understands how cause and effect works
when he says open the Border
he actually couldn't game that through
in his mind to understand what the cause
would have affected he actually couldn't
do it
and almost anybody could do it I mean
I'm sure I could get a 12 year old to
game that out or if you open the borders
tell me what happens next he couldn't do
it
he thought everything would work out
okay
um
anyway that was fun to dunk on candy
I do feel like there's some kind of a
corner being turned on all the Dei and
CRT and the SG stuff it's way more
obvious than it's destroying the world
now right
it's completely poisoned uh race
relations
and it made it basically it uh it made
it dangerous for white people to be
around black people who had been trained
to
complain about you
which again has nothing about there's
nothing about being black has nothing to
do about your DNA it's nothing about
anybody's genetics but if you happen to
be a group of people who have been
trained to demonize another group
well if you're the demonized group you
should get some distance from that group
if you can as far away as you can
it's not really possible for that
that's hyperbole
all right
have you ever seen anybody criticize me
for having an opinion on something on
which I'm not an expert has anybody ever
seen that anybody ever see me say but
Scott you're not an expert on that
every day every day now I defend myself
by saying I'm not an expert on anything
well
not any of the things in the news
usually but
I do have one one expertise
I'm pretty good at telling when
somebody's lying
and when it's and you don't
really need to be an expert in the field
to recognize would you agree
they're recognizing is my
expertise
I mean I do it every day you can you can
look at my track record yourself
I think it's the best there is by far
actually let me ask you this for those
who've been watching me for a few years
is my calling of the best
you've ever seen
the best you've ever seen
yeah a wall of yeses for the people who
watch me the most it is the best you've
ever seen it's because the the hypnosis
skill set
plus my age
plus having a you know a business
background it gives you a lot of Windows
into things and so you can see the
 a little faster
for example if you didn't understand how
business models work it would be harder
to spot
if you didn't know that follow the money
always works
you'd be confused about a lot of stuff
if you didn't know that the story that
grabs your interest the most in the news
wow I can't believe it
is almost certainly to be untrue
that's why it grabbed your interest
because it's almost certainly that's
untrue how about those Mexican uh UFO
bodies
could you look away for that for even a
minute the moment you saw UFO bodies and
found
didn't you stop everything
didn't you stop even thinking about
other things Zoop and look at that yeah
that's your tell that is fake
as soon as you found your brain hijacked
that's that's like an 80 to 90 percent
likelihood it's fake because real things
don't do that
real things are not that interesting
it's the fake stuff that gets you to
like what
yeah
so here's another one of those
situations when the F-35 went
missing with what the government is
calling now a mishap
uh I weighed in with my lack of
expertise saying this
nobody ejects from a plane that's still
at a high altitude you know high enough
that it's their normal flying altitude
and it's capable of flying another 80
miles
or at least a long distance we didn't
know it was 80 miles but it was
obviously flying on its own
and it wasn't flying directly to the
ground
so what I said with my total lack of
expertise is that it's very unlikely
that there was a catastrophic problem
because we would know that if the plane
blew up or or if or if let's say the
cockpit was full of smoke
it's the first thing you know
they would tell you that right away oh
there was a technical problem in the
plane
so we grounded the fleet until we find
out what it is to see if it's common to
any of the other planes
so you could know right away
that the the first level of was
you knew the government knew if the
plane had failed in in a normal way that
was just some kind of mechanical problem
right you would have known right away
because that's the first thing they
would have told you there was a
mechanical problem
the the pilot got down safely because
that would be like a success right if
the pilot got out safely after a
catastrophic mechanical problem
I think they'd want you to know that
that the system works well enough that
even if a plane fails which would be
kind of rare
pilate gets out alive that would
actually be more of a plus and a
negative you know if you thought about
it in its in its totality it's more of a
plus
um but we didn't hear that did we
so you knew something was going on
that wasn't the normal stuff the normal
stuff would be there's a problem with
the plane and it's catastrophic and so
the pilot got out
the fact that you didn't hear that
explanation right away the most normal
obvious one it could be
is a really clear signal there's
something else happening but the fact
that the plane was not near the ground
and was able to fly
when the pilot left is a very strong
indication that there's another mystery
involved
and now that it's being called a mishap
what does that tell you
so the the official word which was used
by
um
hmm who was who's the guy in charge
whose name I can't remember but
basically all the guys in charge are
saying and women in charge Kirby yeah
Kirby said mishap as well so mishap when
do you use the word mishap
under what conditions would you call
this what we know about it a mishap
well the first thing you'd have to know
is that they don't know the real cause
they're not sure the real cause
as possible as pilot error
and they don't want you to know that
that's possible so one of the
possibilities is is pilot error and they
don't want you to know it the other
possibility is they suspect it was
hacked but they don't know yet
or they suspect it was hacked they do
know
and they don't want to tell you or
they'll never tell you
but none of but the word mishap in my
opinion eliminates the possibility that
there was a catastrophic problem
because if there was a catastrophic
technical failure they would just tell
you
the pilot would say I don't know what
went on but major failure I have to get
out
and then they would say there's a major
failure we don't know what it is
pilot pilot lived
but they called it a mishap
so my indicator
was correct the first time
I'm positive now there was not a
catastrophic uh jet can't fly anymore
problem
would you give me that is it too soon is
it too soon to say that by
detector
accurately detected it was not a normal
catastrophic problem in the air
I think so so far it looks like I'm
right
without any expertise
except that I was once married to a
pilot so I I know that Pilots don't
think Pilots don't think of jumping out
when the plane can still fly
it's just not a thing
all right
here are some more Gears of the machine
so uh Joel Pollock writes about this in
Breitbart
so the Department of Homeland Security
and the secretary there is Alejandro
mayorcas
same same person who's in charge of the
border security
so the person that you don't trust
because he is in charge of border
security and appears to be doing nothing
like border security
looks like he's just letting everybody
in which might be more of a congress
problem or a president problem maybe
he's just doing what he has to do but we
don't trust him
because he's the person most associated
with uh lying about what's happening at
the border at the very least he's lying
about it I don't know what else he's
doing but he's certainly lying about it
and he's not doing anything to fix it
it's his job to fix it and it's our
biggest risk at the moment so you have
big questions about that don't you but
just to make you doubly suspicious
he's created some kind of an Advisory
Board the intelligence experts group
and it's comprised of private sector
experts who are going to give their
unique perspective on the federal
government's intelligence uh you know
entire workings
and two of the people that were
appointed to that were
John Brennan and James Clapper
oh my goodness
oh my goodness
now this audience is well trained I I
would say that the people watching this
live stream right now and the people who
watch it recorded are probably in would
you agree with this statement in the top
five percent of well-informed people
about politics when you say you're in
the top five percent generally speaking
right now as soon as I said these names
John Brennan and James Clapper everybody
who's been paying attention
all of your flags went up right whoa
whoa whoa whoa these are designated
Liars
I've already told you with these
specific names that when they tried out
the designated Liars there's something
terrible going on
so we don't know what the deal is with
mayorkas and we don't know what the deal
is with the Border we just know it looks
crooked
it looks crooked
and then to bolster his support he added
the two most crooked known Liars in the
intelligence world
now who would do that
who who would ever do that well it would
be somebody who knows that 95 of the
world won't notice
or will think that these are good people
to have in the committee
probably
but to me it looks like a criminal
Enterprise is just making sure that the
their criminals are on all the important
committees and Watchdog groups and fact
Checkers it just seems more of the
important people making sure that they
have their their their plants in all the
important positions now have I ever told
you that one of the ways the Machine
Works the Democrat machine is they
create fake advisory Watchdog think
tanks
they put their people there and then the
people that they put there say what they
want them to say and then the
politicians could say you know it's not
just me
I mean this Think Tank advisory
committee uh all these advisors they say
it too
so you know don't give me a hard time
I'm just taking expert advice
but it's not real expert advice
it's people that they put in these jobs
who are owned in some way either by
money or blackmail or common interest
and
and then they pretend to the other 95
percent of the public that there's some
kind of legitimate system and it's all
operating properly because they can't
they can't see the gears
but would you agree
that with the Rand Paul story about Tick
Tock you can see the gears of the
machine
it's really obvious what went on really
obvious
and with the Border
is it not completely obvious that the
intention is to keep it open with all of
the damage it will cause it's very clear
you know what I'm wondering
does somebody have blackmail on uh
Alexander Soros
or maybe even the his father
because there's no way to explain the
Soros donations and Elon Musk said this
he said you can't explain it
on any uh
based on any public information there's
nothing that we know publicly that
explains these activities
it it could only be
that somebody is trying to destroy
America
because you would never let the
criminals enter jail and open the
borders to the cartels
you would never do that no nobody who
understands as much as Alexander Soros
must understand about the world you know
by now he would he knows the gears of
the machine probably better than anybody
do you think that he would let this
happen unless he would unless he was
under duress
I think he's under duress
meaning that somebody has something on
him
because imagine if you could control the
entire Soros Empire
by blackmailing one person
now you know he's not doing it for money
because he has all the money in the
world
so what else would make you do something
that is obviously bad for you in the
world
blackmail
I can't think of anything but blackmail
that would do it so my working
assumption is that Alexander Soros is
being blackmailed because you couldn't
explain anything he's doing any other
way
there's no way to explain it
so that's my working assumption but I
don't have direct evidence of anything
like that
uh let's see if you can spot the
propaganda
I saw a
saw a tweet about a poll
and the poll says that uh both Democrats
and Republicans have an unprecedented uh
low trust in politics and their own and
political parties so
Trust
um let's make sure Trump doesn't get in
yeah so
do you think that's the way to frame the
story that the public has an
unprecedented level of distrust in
politics is that the right way to say
the story
say the same thing in the non-propicana
way
all right here's the non-propaganda way
politicians are so corrupt
that the public
now understands the level of corruption
and they've adjusted their opinion
accordingly
the story makes it sound like the public
has some some problem that they have a
lack of trust you know as if the media
is the problem like the suggestion is
there's something that happened in the
Public's mind you know maybe the media
you know maybe social media is like
pluting their minds so that they have so
little Trust
that is a backwards way to tell the
story the story is the government can't
be trusted and the public is catching on
why isn't that the way they write the
story
that's the true that's the most accurate
way to describe it
politics is bad and the public has
caught up
can you see the gears of the machine
even the polls whether whether whether
they collude to do it or they just know
to do it are part of the machine
to disguise from you the Badness of the
political system
all right uh here's my
provocative thing I'm going to add here
I'm going to make a claim that
you you'll have to fact check on your
own I guess and the claim is this that
as a trained hypnotist
I can identify people who were in a
waking trance
now waking trance means that you know
you're up and you're talking and you're
you you look like everybody else
you're just doing your thing
but if you engage somebody in a topic in
which they have been brainwashed
they immediately their their face and
their actions immediately go into a
waking trance mode
and one of the things that makes me
crazy is that once you're trained to
recognize it
you can't unsee it
so a lot of what you think are people
doing some kind of a political debate
nothing like that's happening they just
go into a trance mode and they repeat
what they've heard
now some of the Tells for somebody who's
in a waking trance mode
would be give you the telescope and
you've seen these all before but the
more I tell you the more more easily you
can spot them
uh do you ever see somebody who you give
them some Counterpoint to their point
let's say on the X platform they say
blah blah is true and then let's say you
give them a link with some credible
looking uh data that's opposite of their
opinion
do you ever see them say oh I didn't
know about that no what they'll usually
get is they'll get they'll show some
level of consternation
the consternation is a tell
because if you're just dealing with the
topic you would just deal with the
information and you'd judge it good or
bad or something like that but if you
get mad and go after the person who said
it oh well that's exactly what you'd
expect from a science disbelieving mango
person
right that's a tell for somebody who's
in The Waking trance they can't process
why what they're hearing doesn't match
what they've been prop brainwashed to
believe
so the brainwashing is causing them to
have an angry reaction to having the
brainwashing being challenged by facts
or Reason so here's another one um look
for the unusually high confidence in an
opinion which is word salad
so somebody will give you an opinion in
words and you look at the words and
you'll say well I understand how the
sentence makes sense
but not how the point makes sense it
looks like you just strung words
together and it looks like a pattern of
words I've seen before you know sort of
like the large language model because
most most people's opinions are assigned
by their preferred media and they'll use
even the same language to describe it
so if you see somebody with high
confidence
but when they describe their opinion it
sounds like word salad it's the
combination of the high confidence and
the inability to say anything that makes
sense that's a tell that they're an
Awakening trance
brainwashed and to use other words
um
but the other way is one that I can I
see but I can't explain how to to do it
what are the biggest skills of a
hypnotist is to observe the subject as
they're hypnotizing them and to see if
it's working or not
and you can tell if it's working
by very subtle differences in their
posture their breathing their skin tone
there might be a flushness there could
be you know little ticks in their bodies
so there's a whole bunch of things
wealth their eyes are open or closed
it's different but you look for just the
smallest towels of muscle ticks and and
posture and stuff
now when I have a conversation with
somebody who's showing these other tells
I'm usually also seeing it in their body
you can actually tell somebody's
brainwashed in an awaking trance if
you're trained to see it
so I have this terrible feeling that
many of you don't have
which is when I'm walking around in
public I can tell the not just walking
around but if you're having a
conversation with somebody about
politics you can see them go into the
trance
and you know the eyes will change and
the every their mannerism will change
and they'll just be in the trance yeah
the the Trump derangement syndrome
trance
now the the other thing that uh you look
for is the the wide-eyed if anybody saw
a Kirby uh talking to Martha McCallum
and he was being asked a series of
questions when when Kirby was telling
you something that was true and you
didn't have any doubt about it that's
true his eyes would be normal and he
would talk like this blah blah blah blah
blah blah blah this is true
as soon as he went into uh propaganda
mode his eyes would bug out like Adam
Schiff
and the and the bug eyes if it's
somebody who doesn't have bug eyes all
the time
when they're trying to tell you
something then their eyes go big
is because they know they're lying or
they know it's propaganda
and they're trying to use their eyes
to sell you what their words can't
right they use the eyes when they know
that the words are not convincing
when the words are convincing because
it's just something normal and obvious
he doesn't do that
but but watch Kirby's big eyes
that's another sign of somebody
brainwashing you so I have this terrible
experience
where it's like I'm walking around with
zombies and and people who are in a
hypnotic State and and propagandists
and if you think you're walking around
with a bunch of people who are listening
to the news and forming their own
opinions you're not even in my same
world
we are not in the same world
because I don't see anything like that I
don't see people listening to the news
and forming their own opinions
I see people who have been propagandized
and people who are propaganda people now
nothing's 100 right if there's a news
topic that you don't have any emotional
interest in there's a really good chance
you're just looking at the facts
but as soon as you introduce any bit of
emotion
any bit of caring any bit of team play
which is enough just team play Oh I
gotta win then everything goes off the
rails and turns into pure propaganda
people go into trans mode their eyes get
big
and there's nothing happening there in
the form of reason or reasoning or or
even honest debate
social credit scores I don't you know I
don't think anything could stop it
I I feel like
we're gonna have to start another
country
so you know how United States was formed
by a group of people who wanted specific
freedoms and religious freedom I think
was top of the list right and then that
morphed into other freedoms like freedom
of speech that sounded good
freedom of assembly
that stuff
so the country was formed because where
people were before they didn't have the
the freedom that they wanted
but unfortunately America has turned
into a
propaganda cesspool
so we don't have anything like free
speech you know you can get banned if
you if you even try
um and we're just taking people out for
like political things and something they
did 20 years ago which might have been
plenty bad but it's not a really a good
system
so it's almost like you know you want to
go to a green field and say all right
if you were the founding the founders of
the country
and you knew that the internet was
coming would you have done anything
differently
maybe you would one of the things you
might have done is you might have
written right into the Constitution that
Free Speech applies to all digital means
and it doesn't matter if somebody
privately owns those digital means they
cannot stop your free speech or
something like that but but to imagine
that the system that was built into
pre-internet world
should fit our current system is sort of
unreasonable it's unreasonable to think
that our current system is applicable to
the mass brainwashing Digital World
we're in So at the very least
we should rethink
free speech
like how do you protect it
and my view was is that the one and only
way to protect it is with Community
notes or a system like that so you could
imagine for example that Facebook
um and you know the other platforms
let's say the government said here's the
deal you know your platforms can you
know be anything you want because you're
as long as it's legal but the one thing
you can't do
is suppress opinions and not allow
context to be added to them
so you have to build a system like
Community notes that contacts can be
added to any political opinions or
medical or scientific and that uh that
the platform can't take them away
so if you're going to let people have
speech on your platform you have to let
everybody have speech in your platform
and there might be still some things you
know like
child related things that just have to
be banned but generally speaking you'd
say Free Speech means everybody gets to
talk anything they want as long as it's
legal and
you have to provide a context
tool like Community notes
now how different would things be
if everything out of context in it
like really really different
and there should be
um
some law that says you can't be for
example
demonetized based on an accusation which
is what's happening to Russell Brand
Russell Brand is being demonetized
because of an accusation
the serious ones
but unproven
very unproven in the court of law
so
yeah
so it seems to me that we either need to
start a country that has actual Free
Speech as we understand it in the
digital world or we have to make some
basic changes about what platforms can
do
because you know here here's a
conversation I'm really tired of
uh these platforms are suppressing free
speech
they're privately owned privately owned
platforms they are not required
to do what the government is required to
do
yes Dale
everybody knows that
everybody knows that so what you added
to the conversation was nothing
because everybody knows that
and still
while everybody knows that
we think that this is a new situation
and should be rethought and that perhaps
some controls or you know some let's say
guard rails would make sense in the
digital world
but they're private companies
yes but in a practical sense having free
speech isn't really meaningful if you
don't have access to social media so
really we should rethink but they're
private companies
so that's how that conversation goes
every time
all right ladies and gentlemen I think
I've come to the end of my most
magnificent live stream I'd like to
drink a toast to you those people who
are at the top five percent
the people who know what's going on
so you've seen the gears of the machine
you can see the manipulation you can see
the fake entities that support the other
fake entities you know what a wrap up
smear is you know what propaganda looks
like and how to spot it you know the
Tells for cognitive dissonance
and you are probably the people who can
keep this country
running
I I was I was asked by uh
uh Michael malice so and don't ask me
when the podcast is going to drop but
I'll let you know when I know so so I
talked to Michael malis had a great
conversation I think you're going to
enjoy it
um
but I want to offer some optimism that I
offer there which is most of the
problems that we have
right now in the country are the ones
that have this long-term nature like you
can see them coming for a long time and
America is terrific
fixing problems that they can see coming
for a long time I call it the Adams law
of slow-moving disasters if you can see
it coming
you're probably going to be able to
figure it out because that's why we're
still here there would be no humans if
we were not really good at solving
problems like that
uh the ones that you worry about the
ones that catch you off guard like the
pandemic
pick the best relationships not the best
dilemmas
I have to think about that
oh the fetterman dress code all right
let's talk about the fetterman dress
code
so
I'm sure that uh
the dress code was changed because of
fetterman we all agree with that right
but I for one would be perfectly happy
to see which of my politicians decide to
go casual
to me that's just more information if
you know what I mean
did are you following
right if if representative bobert
shows up to her job wearing what she
wore to the uh the play well then I'm
going to modify my opinion of how
serious she is right
if if everybody wears a suit except for
a fetamine
I don't have a problem with that
do you does anybody have a problem that
he's the exception
because it's not helping him is it is
anybody saying you know I like the cut
of his jib not so much because of his
policies or his defective brain but
rather his fashion choices are starting
to work for me I feel that his
rebellious look is part of something I
feel good about I like to associate with
that a little more closely
now there's no problem there's nothing
to be solved and my guess is
two or three times you're going to see
somebody in a polo shirt
because they just came off the golf
course to do an important Vote or
something but otherwise nobody's going
to care
it will have no impact on your life and
it is not the end of the Republic
I don't think you're going to see casual
Gene Friday
in Congress
and if you do
well the ones who don't do that are
going to look a little better probably
is it disrespectful let me or let me
debate that
is it disrespectful
to dress down
for for one person who's kind of a
special case
here's what I think
fetterman
um this is going to sound weird but just
stay with me
if let's say Steve Jobs were still alive
and decided he wanted to run for the
Senate
and Steve Jobs famously would always
wear his black turtleneck and mom jeans
now suppose he won and he won the Senate
and he said you know what I want to keep
wearing my outfit it's like my uniform
would you be okay if there was a special
case for Steve Jobs to wear his
turtleneck
and jeans would you be okay with that
but would you find it disrespectful
would you find it disrespectful when
somebody's brand
is that they don't dress up for anything
this is brand you would okay
all right so that was a good test just
to see if you're consistent
um I don't have an opinion on it yet I'm
just being making a point here's my
point
if you generally just drop the the dress
code for and everybody was part of that
and everybody should have started
showing up in casual clothing
that would be sub-optimal
to me that would not be a good situation
and I would agree with you completely
but there's something about
um
fetterman
that's different from all the rest
fetterman had made it his brand it's his
political brand to dress like that
under that unique situation in which is
your long-term political brand
I'm actually completely happy with an
exception
because and of course they'd have to
make it something everybody could do
because you couldn't you know you don't
want to make it a rule for one person
but I don't think the rest of the
politicians are going to be dressing
down
I think the one guy who made it his
brand will just keep doing his thing and
if this guy had been Steve Jobs and I
liked him more than I like fetterman
I'd probably say the same thing and say
you know what I'd make an exception for
Steve Jobs because that's that's been
his long-term uniform
so that's a different situation than
just normal people dressing down so I
see it differently and it doesn't bother
me at all actually it doesn't bother me
at all
and
by the way I would like to point out
that the best way you can keep your
brain healthy and not propagandized and
not brainwashed is sometimes you have to
say a full-throated support for somebody
you don't like
if you can never do that then you're
just brainwashed right this this isn't
team play
right now I I don't need you to agree
with me on this it's not it's just not
important I don't really care about the
dress code but
uh you should be able to do what I did
not on this topic necessarily but on
some topics you should be able to say I
really don't like that guy
but I'm going to support him on this one
thing
if you can't do that then you know about
your own brain
there's a problem
yeah it's a good practice to just sort
of routinely routinely see if you can
support the other side
just try to make your best argument for
the opposite of your opinion
and see what happens
um
the people who can see the gears of the
machine do look crazy to the other
people
and but when when they're seeing you
that's when they get that waking
hypnosis look
fetterman is lowering the bar for
everything well I'm all in on Federal
here's what I want the the Democrats
have have taken let's say a sub-optimal
situation because some you know several
other members are just mentally
incompetent at this point it's very
sub-optimal
so if I'm looking at a sub-optimal
situation I could be annoyed you know I
have a lot of normal feelings it's like
ah sub-optimal why can't they be better
than that
but the Democrats have gone so far into
the Absurd like the fact that they're
still pretending that Biden you know is
whole or that Kamala Harris is a backup
none of these things are true these are
or that they pretend phetterman's good
enough oh he's fine he's fine none of
this is true
so we reached the point where I don't
want them to stop doing it
I don't want them to stop supporting
these ridiculous things I want them to
be anti-nuclear because it's stupid now
there was a time when I think reasonable
people could be anti-nuclear but with
our current knowledge and the current
technology it's actually just stupid and
there are enough people who know it
that watching them play out is going to
be fun
so you tell me
tell me you wouldn't enjoy Biden running
against Trump under the current
situation which is that Trump is
functional and Biden is not even close
you wouldn't enjoy that
you wouldn't enjoy
Democrats slowly realizing that that
you've been right about everything
if you were watching Fox News yesterday
you saw they were they delightfully or
delightedly showed clips of prominent
Democrats saying uh
maybe we were wrong about this you know
this Biden being ready to go you know
maybe the
maybe his age is a factor right so
watching the the slow opening up of
their minds or at least pretending to
open up maybe they knew all along uh
it's going to be hilarious when I
watched Morning Joe
you know come around to the Republican
opinion on crime it was it was crime I
guess the topic was crime so now the the
Democrats are saying hey
we should do something about crime and
hey we should do something about the
Border
you tell me you don't want to watch an
election
where the Democrats themselves are
saying uh I can't even support the
Democrat
because the border is open and crime is
taking over the city how could I be on
that team
I want to watch it I I want Biden to be
the candidate there's no chance he can
win at this point let me say that
clearly there's no chance Biden can be
can win I mean they would actually have
to kill Trump at this point you couldn't
even cheat that much but by election day
the Gap is going to be so big
you know unless unless Trump does
something so amazingly
wrong
but I think Trump has figured out now
that just staying out of trouble is all
he needs
he just needs to bring the temperature
down and not look scary
Trump has one job
one job only don't look scary
don't look like a authoritarian
do you know what an authoritarian would
have said about uh abortion an
authoritarian would have said I'm going
to do a federal ban on all abortions and
then you'd be right back where you were
where he's the dictator who wants to
take control of women's bodies and you
lose and you lose that's a guaranteed
loss
100 guaranteed loss would be Trump
saying he wants a federal ban on all
abortions no way he wins in fact I would
I would stop even being interested in
the race at that point
I would actually
I would actually lose all interest
because you would know what would happen
they would they would the Democrats
would knowingly elect a corpse
before they would let a federal ban on
abortion they would knowingly with
complete awareness of what they were
doing elect an actual corpse
if that was their option
and that's not a joke
you think Scott Galloway was talking
about banning Tick Tock before I was
you better do a fact check on that
why don't you do a little fact check on
that
that's funny it's funny that you would
even think that
all right that's all I got for today and
I'm gonna be uh
let's see it was tonight I'll probably
be on Man Cave tonight for the locals
people
yeah oh Galloway humor Joe Blow
he says that was Galloway humor
nice
nice Dad joke approved talk to you
tomorrow
