Good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of Human Civilization
Sunday edition. If you'd like to take
your experience up to levels that nobody
can even understand with her tiny shiny
human brains, well, all you need for
that is a copper mug or a glass of
tankerstein, a canteen jugger flask, a
vessel of any kind. Fill it with your
favorite liquid. I like coffee. And join
me now for the unparalleled pleasure,
the dopamine of the day, the thing that
makes everything better. It's called the
simultaneous sip. And it's going to
happen right now. Right now.
EJ says, "Scott, you're a dishonest man.
I'll drink to
that." Uh, I like to see the comments
from the terrible
people. Let me just uh insult your
character and we'll start from there.
All right.
Well, um I've got a uh movie
recommendation for you. So, the other
day I watched uh the
new year 2025 uh Captain
America. Now, if you haven't seen it, um
Captain America is black this time, but
he's not the only Captain America, cuz I
guess I guess the idea is there's more
than one Captain America. And there was
a original one and then there were a few
others and then there's the 2025 version
but the uh the new one is black and the
original one is uh also
black. So there were there were two
Captain Americas in this movie and they
both starred and they were both black
Captain Americans. Uh, but there's the
news is that dis Disney wanted more from
Marvel, but now wants less. I guess the
uh people are getting tired of the
superhero genre, but maybe they're
getting tired of just remaking
everything to be woke. Maybe. I don't
know. It was an okay
movie. It wasn't really any better or
any worse than the other ones, which are
all kind of boring at this point. I
don't think any of the superhero movies
are worth
watching. So, we'll see. Uh, Australia
is launching the world's largest battery
powered ship. Can carry up to 2100
passengers and 225 vehicles. And it's
entirely battery
powered. Now, of course, you're going to
ask, what happens if there's a battery
fire? Do you jump into water with the
sharks or do you let it burn you up? I
don't know. I don't know. I'm just
telling you that there's the world's
biggest battery powered I think it's
some kind of a
shuttle. Um, and it's 426 ft
long. It's a big ass
boat. Here's a
another story that I like a lot if I
understand it. So, in California,
probably other places too, um there are
companies like Tesla that will sell you
a battery for your home. So, you might
have solar panels and then you could
charge up your own home battery so
you've got some backup power. But, uh
another company that does that is
Sunun and their Cal Ready system. And
apparently what they've done is they've
they'veworked together
56,000 homes that have their
batteries. And if you have enough solar
panels on enough houses and they each
have their own batteries, apparently you
can turn it into essentially its own its
own power system. So even though that's
56,000 homes that are connected, it
would power 280,000 homes, which would
be the equivalent of all of Ventura
County.
Now, if I'm understanding this
correctly, this would be one of the
greatest energy accomplishments of all
time, cuz if if you just have your own
solar panels and your own battery, it's
kind of good. But, you know, if things
go bad, it's, you know, you might not
have enough battery personally, but
apparently, if you've got all these
batteries connected, um, you don't have
to worry too much about ever running out
of energy.
So that's pretty pretty impressive. And
then the people who become part of the
network get paid. So they get paid for
being part of the network and they get
pretty good
power. Allegedly Hyundai the automaker
uh they've got a plant in Georgia and
they're going to use Atlas
robots to automate their plant.
So, do you believe that? I I feel like
all the robot stories are a little
premature. They might be testing it, but
uh they they aim to manufacture 100,000
electric and hybrid vehicles annually,
but they're going to use the bipedal
robots bipedal. In other words, the
two-legged robots developed by Boston
Dynamics, and they're going to do a
whole bunch of different tasks that are
part of assembling that car.
And the idea is that the robots will
automate up to 40% of the vehicle
assembly by the end of this
year. Does that sound even remotely
possible to you? that by the end of this
year there will be an operational
um you know a car making plant in
Georgia where 40% of the effort will be
done by robots two-legged
robots that seems a little bit
optimistic but we'll
see you probably know that Elon Musk was
starting his own city um I guess in
Texas near where he was doing is is
SpaceX stuff. And now it's official.
It's uh called Starbase, Texas. And I
guess it's officially blessed by the
state. So
So you can add to Elon Musk's
accomplishments that he built a
city that that wasn't even like a a
major project. So do you have any minor
projects? Well, I built a
city. I would love to know if this city
has any like special engineering
features that that make it extra good to
live in it, but maybe we'll learn about
that
later.
Um, I saw a interview with L. Trump and
Elon Musk in which uh Musk was saying
what he often
says that
uh that that Grock the
AI should be maximally truth seeking.
What do you think of that? Do you think
AI should be maximally truth seeking?
Well, maybe not
maximally because I think that the truth
would destroy
civilization. How many of you believe
that's
true? Cuz I'm not even going to give you
examples of where I think it would
destroy civilization because if I gave
you an example, I would get double
cancelled. So, I can't even give you an
example. And you're telling me the AI is
going to be able to say things that I
can't say out loud because it's
maximally truth
seeeking?
No. No. We're We're not going to have a
maximally truth seeeking AI because it
would rip the fabric of society in a 100
pieces. We largely live in this world of
illusion. That's the only thing keeps
from killing each other.
Let I I'll just give you one
illusion. One of the illusions is that
you can just work hard and you'll do
great. Not really. I mean, you would
have to be unusually good-looking or
unusually
smart. Then if you work hard, you might
actually make something. But you can't
really tell people, well, you know,
given your capabilities, you will always
be a low-income person, but you'll be
part of supporting the rich people so
that they can have wonderful lives on
your back. Yeah. No, you don't want
maximally truth seeeking AI because it's
going to tell people things that will
make them stop working and want to kill
you. So, there's that. Fox News has a
story that I'm not sure I completely
believe this story, but allegedly
there's a Swiss writer who called a
journalist a quote fat lesbian and for
that was sentenced to 60 days in
prison. Do you think that's
true? Do you think that there's nothing
else missing in that story?
I feel like there's something missing in
the story. You really can't call
somebody a fat lesbian without going to
jail if you're
Swiss. I mean, I guess that's
possible, but seems like there might be
more to that
story. Well, speaking of AI, uh the new
version of Grock, which will be 3.5, is
going to drop next week. And it was
initially only for the super Grock
users. Um, but apparently this will not
just be a better version of Grock, but
this one is allegedly able to reason
from first
principles. Now, do you believe
that? Do you believe? Because that would
be the next level of AI. It's the one we
haven't seen yet. Do you think Grock
already got there?
because the large language model AIs,
the kind that are everywhere,
um are really just pattern sort of
pattern machines. So they can just sort
of guess what the next word will be and
you know they can suck up a bunch of
data on the internet and regurgitate it.
But none of them can reason from first
principles. Now, do you think that Elon
Musk has already cracked that and he's
developed the first first new version of
AI that would be a whole different
level? Maybe
uh you know, cuz I don't think he would
lie about it. So, you you must believe
that it's there. So, we'll be watching
that with great anticipation to see if
he's got the the ultimate level. not the
ultimate, but it would be the next level
of
AI. Well, Warren Buffett, who is uh I
believe he's a thousand years old or
maybe 94. Um he's going to step down at
the end of the year as
CEO. Um now, we don't know what that's
going to do to the Brookshire Hathaway
stock because I'm not sure how much work
he was doing at age 94 anyway. I'm sure
he had good people who were doing the
the heavy lifting, but uh I'll I'll tell
you my bad investing story. I may have
told you this before that I think it was
25 years
ago, I put a good chunk of what little
money I had at the time in into
Berkshire
Hathway. And sure enough, you know, just
like you'd expect, it did great. I think
it might have doubled during the time
that I held it. And so I said to myself,
you know, that Warren Buffett's looking
pretty old. I think he's going to retire
or maybe just die of natural causes. And
I don't want to be sitting on this
Brookshire Haway stock when he
goes. If I had simply held that
stock, oh my
god, I I don't know what percentage it
went up in the last 25 years, but it was
pretty good. Pretty good. So, don't take
my don't take my advice for for
investing, that's for
sure. Well, Warren Buffett also has a
half
opinion. You you've heard me say that
before. A half opinion is when you
ignore either the costs or the benefits
of a situation and you just act like
only one of them exist. Oh, it's just a
cost. Don't do it. Or it's just a
benefit. You should totally do it. Now,
in the real world, things have costs and
benefits. And one of the words that
signals that you have a half pinion is
the word
should. It should is usually a signal
that you've got a half opinion coming.
Um, so listen to this. This is what
Warren Buffett said about tariffs.
Quote, "Trade should not be a
weapon." Trade should not be a weapon.
So, is he in favor of using
uh tariffs as a negotiating tool?
Does he think that we should simply
accept the tariffs that other countries
put on us so that we don't start any
trade
wars? That is what you call
a half pinion. He gets to say the part
that's that makes him look good without
having to commit to anything should. So
let let me give you another example. I'm
going to give you my opinion about war.
Are you ready? This will be my official
public opinion about
war. We should fight wars without
killing any
civilians. Who's with me? Anybody?
Anybody want to sign on to my half half
an opinion? Because in the real world,
you don't get that option. So, you just
say, "Well, we
should." And what about using trade as a
weapon? Well, uh, we should
not. As soon as you see the word should,
there's some happening. So,
that that's your, uh, persuasion lesson
of the day. Always look for should. And
when I use the word myself, which I
do. It's just too easy to grab that word
when you're talking. Um, I try to
correct
myself because, you know, you can you
can easily just fall into this should
thing and it always means you're not
looking at the whole picture. It's
almost a
confession. All right. Um, the
postmillennial has a story about
uh RFK Jr.'s Department of Health and
Human Services. They have decided that u
the recommended treatment for people
with gender
dysphoria is the therapy as opposed to
gender affirming surgery for example and
points out that the uh more invasive
stuff is not proven to be effective sort
of in general and uh so this is
basically a review it's not a law so the
review that uh HHS did stated that the
effectiveness of psychotherapy for other
mental health issues
um including those present alongside
gender dysphoria quote suggests it may
also be beneficial for gender dysphoria
specifically is it true that
psychotherapy is effective for other
disorders that's actually a real
question I don't know the answer to that
because I've heard a lot of people say
that it's just fake that you know
therapy doesn't work for anybody really
but I suspect it doesn't work for some
people what do you think do you think
that uh psychotherapy is a real thing
that fixes
people probably it depends a lot on who
the psychotherapist is it you know I've
got a feeling that the top 10% best
therapists can fix a lot of
people. I'm not sure if the bottom 90%
can get anything done except taking your
money. And you know, maybe it's not
9010, but I'll bet it's not
100%. Do you think 100% of therapists
are good enough to fix people's mental
problems? Not
100%. And do you think it's 50%.
because 50% would be, you know, worth
trying. I' I've got a feeling it's
closer to
10%. That can really make a difference.
The rest just give the benefit of being
a good listener, I suppose, which is
valuable, too. Just a guess. So, don't
take any of my that this is not a
medical or therapy
um advice because I don't know enough
about the field. So, I've never I I
haven't had any mental problems I've
needed to get therapy for.
Um, which I always think is
weird. How many of you would say of
yourselves that you've not really had
any mental problems that required any
help? How many of you would say that?
Cuz I feel like I'm unusual. Like I
don't have anxiety. I don't have
depression. I don't have
self-doubt. Uh I I don't have I don't
have any of that. And I'm not sure why,
you know. I I don't think I was like
born with better genes or anything like
that. I have no idea why. I just don't
have
them. Yeah. So, a number of number of
you are in good shape, too. Oh, good.
According to the New York Post, there's
a former State Department analyst who
wrote checks to herself and during her
job for
$650,000 over two years. Now, the fun
part of this is the trick she used for
embezzling. So, apparently she was using
um what do you call it? Uh
QuickBooks. So, she had access to
QuickBooks and then she would go in
QuickBooks and I guess nobody was
checking her work and she would uh write
a check to herself and then print it.
But here's what she cleverly did. Then
she would go back into QuickBooks after
she had printed the check and change the
name that was in QuickBooks from her own
name, which is what she had just printed
out, to some name that sounded like a
vendor. And she got away with that for
two
years and got
$650,000 out of the government. Now, the
question I ask you is, how much of that
is happening?
You know, I I go back to my observation
that if you just drive around in a nice
neighborhood, you can't really
understand how so many people got so
much
money or or back in the times when I
would go on vacations and nice places
and I would think to myself, you know,
I'm the Dilber guy. I got super lucky,
you know, made more money than most
people. So, I get to go to this resort,
you know, some five-story resort
somewhere, but then it would be full.
And I would think to myself, how could
it be so many people who are so lucky?
Did they inherit it? Are they criminals?
And I don't know what the percentage is,
but I just think that there's some
shocking number of people who are rich
who literally stole it from the
government because the government has so
much money that you can steal a lot for
yourself and nobody
notices. So, I mean, it's just
speculation, but I got a feeling that
not everybody's earning their money the
hard way like I did.
Well, there's a big trial going on with
Meta's AI. There's some authors
and mostly authors who are uh trying to
say that uh the AI, in this case Meta,
um use their copyrighted work and they
believe that their copyright should
protect them from having the AI suck it
up and be able to do stuff with it. Now,
the good news is I was just reading a
little bit about the questions that were
being asked by the judge, and you know,
it's hard to know for sure from a
distance, but the judge seems to be
really, really sharp because I looked at
the questions and how we frame stuff and
I thought, "Wow, you really you really
kind of get this topic." So, Ars
Technica is writing about this, but uh
the judge, he downplayed Meadow's what
he called messed up
torrenting.
Um, and uh, whatever he rules, this
could be an important ruling in the
world of AI, cuz if the judge decides
that AI can't do this sort of thing
because it's a copyright violation, then
the United States will fall behind in AI
because we won't be able to train it the
way, you know, China would, which is
stealing anything it can steal and don't
care about copyrights.
Um, so it's really big deal. On the
other hand, it's really bad for
authors. So the judge is going to end up
making a
decision even even though it's really
just a legal decision. It's going to be
a decision about which industry dies.
So if the judge says you can't train
your you can't train your model on
copyrighted material well then AI as an
industry will just die or it'll get sued
out of existence. But if he says, "Well,
you know, it's too important or um it
looks like it's fair use," then I would
argue that the the book authoring
business would be completely dead in
just a few
years. So, you're sort of you're going
to have to decide which one is going to
die, the literary world or the AI world.
Unfortunately, as someone who has
written books, I think it's going to be
the author world that dies because that
seems like the the older technology, the
one that doesn't really it's not really
supporting the country directly. It's
just something people like. Whereas AI
is more
existential, you know,
necessary for defense, for economics,
for everything.
So, I did a little test where I went to
Grock and I told it to summarize the
book
uh um
uh Atomic Habits. Is that the And it
didn't it didn't uh pause for a second
and it gave me a good little summary
where I would say to myself, huh, I
don't know if I need to read this book
now. And I thought to myself, is that
only true for non-fiction
books? Can I just go to
uh and I've tried to do it with my own
books? But it but when I do it with my
own books, it tells me that
um it can only tell me what other people
have said about it. So if there are
other people who have written long
reviews or if somebody went to I don't
know went on X and did a big thread
where they said here's the best ideas
from his book. I guess it could train on
that.
And so I don't know if I would write
another
book because we're at that point where
you don't really need to buy a book if
you have AI. You can just you can just
tell it to summarize all the top 10
business books and you know by the time
you've reached your destination on your
your airline
trip you you'll basically know what's in
10 different important
books. I don't know. And then what about
the ones that are just pure
fiction? Do you think that uh do you
think the AI will just be able to look
at a bunch of fiction that other people
have written and just say, "All right, I
can see how this works. I see the
patterns. You made a prediction. If I
write another one, it'll be my best."
Well, even if it is my best, it wouldn't
be economic
um at this point. I don't know. So, this
is a big case. We'll see how that goes.
According to just the news, there's a
rumor that uh the first big trade deal
might be with India. Now, we don't have
confirmation of that, but uh commerce
secretary Lutnik, he hinted at the fact
that there's going to be an announcement
coming and it wasn't long ago that JD
Vance was over in India meeting with uh
Modi. And so if you just sort of, you
know, read the tea leaves and you figure
India might want to might want to be
first, um, maybe it'll be India. But
here's the political
element. So the Democrats have gone
allin on the the tariffs being the worst
idea and nothing but chaos can come from
it. Now, would you agree that they're
all in on that? They're just they're
they bet their entire farm on tariffs
are destroying the economy so that by
the midterms they can say, "See, look
what he did. He destroyed the economy."
Now, they're not getting what they want
in terms of the stock market, which has
largely recovered, or the price of eggs,
which have gone down, or the price of
fuel, which I think has drifted down a
little bit.
So they're really they're really going
to have to bank on the tariffs being a
disaster. So what happens when the
tariff deals start coming through
because you know they will. There's not
really much chance that we won't make
any tariff deals and we'll obviously do
the important ones that we think we can
get done and make a difference first.
So, isn't it going to look like one loss
after another to the Democrats? Oh, he's
so chaos. Oh, everything's okay. Well,
we we'll give you that the India trade
deal was better for the United States,
but all the rest, oh, the the chaos and
the uncertainty. Okay. Okay. Maybe Japan
can make a deal, but they're, you know,
they're a good ally. You can't count
them. Oh, but the the chaos. All right.
South Korea did make a deal and it looks
like it's a little bit better for us,
but but really it's still just nothing
but K. And okay, Europe made a
deal. It correct me if I'm
wrong, but I think the I think the
Democrats are going to have something
like a full year of having to just suck
every word they've said for the last six
months.
It's it's going to look like they're so
wrong that it would be wrongness on a
scale that we've never seen before
because it's just going to be one thing
after another. I think there are what
160 countries and every you know when we
reach a certain point you know maybe in
a few months it's going to be every day
every day there's going to be another
announcement of how we improved our
trade situation with a particular
country. I think Democrats just created
this own trap for themselves because
they put so much attention into the,
"Oh, the tariffs are bad. The tariffs
are bad. He doesn't know what a tariff
is." That they're just going to have to
eat
it. We'll
see.
Um, apparently Bernie Sanders is not too
unified with uh Chuck Schumer.
Um, and he was arguing that
uh um that the reason that Trump won,
this is Bernie Sanders, he thinks the
reason that Trump won is because he said
he would smash the system. How many of
you have voted for
Trump because he was going to smash the
system? Does Bernie have the right the
right uh vibe there?
I feel like he might for the first time
because that's why I supported Trump. I
wanted him to break everything because
everything was everything was
corrupt. And when everything is corrupt
and somebody comes in and says, "I'm
just going to stomp on everything." I
think to myself, that's the first
step. Bring him in, have him stomp on
everything. Just break everything. And
then, you know, maybe we can recover.
But we definitely can't just keep going
the way we're going. So I think Bernie
might be a little bit right about
that. But uh Sanders was pushing back on
Caitlyn Collins suggestion about the
cohesiveness of the the Democrats and
Sanders said uh that they're not
cohesive. He said quote you needed an
agenda questioning what the party was
united around. what exactly would we be
united around? You would need some kind
of an agenda. And I would add to that
that once the Democrats had uh gone
allin on opposing common sense, in other
words, always taking the 20 side of the
8020 situation, what once you've
committed to being against common
sense, I don't know that there's a path
back because you would either have to
embrace the entire
Republican concept of common sense or
You have to stay against common
sense. There's only two paths. How how
in the world do they come back from
that? Well, I guess they have the media
to to keep them in
business. Well, let's look at the uh
designated liars and the Democrat side.
You know, the de the designated liars
are, you know, Adam Schiff, Jamie
Rascin, Swallwell,
uh and Elizabeth Warren, and some more.
Now, what's different about the
designated liars, this is my own name
for them, the DDLs, Democrat designated
liars, is that they will they will lie
in public about something that's already
been debunked or is easy to check is not
true. Uh, Goldman, yeah, Goldman, I
guess you could add to the list. Um, but
not all of the Democrats will do that.
there there's a whole bunch of just sort
of normal Democrats who might, you know,
they might spin things, they might leave
something out, they might say their idea
is better than it is. They might
exaggerate a little bit, but they don't
tell the the just big whopper
lies. So, here's what uh Elizabeth
Warren did recently, and I saw this in a
post by Maize Maize Moore on X. So, as
Maize is pointing
out, so in uh early March, there was a
story about a French scientist, and this
is a fake story, but the story was that
the French scientist was denied entry
into the US because he had some
anti-Trump text messages on his
phone. Now, apparently, I I just missed
that story because it seemed too small,
I guess.
But so Elizabeth Warren is going to
pretend like that's true after it's been
debunked. I guess the real story is that
uh the scientist did something with some
confidential
materials. So it had nothing to do with
text messages about Trump. It was
something about designated I don't know
confidential materials. But so Elizabeth
Warren is at the Senate and Finance
Committee and she wants to bring this up
after it's been completely
debunked. So unambiguously didn't
happen. But as Maize points
out, listen to how carefully she words
her statement uh because she knows it's
been disproven for weeks. But the way
she talks about it is she says that
reportedly reportedly it
happened because
reportedly is
accurate. It's accurate that somebody
reported it, but by now she knows it's
not
true. And she can still say reportedly
if you had a bad message about Trump on
your phone, you might be denied entry to
the country.
reportedly. Now, that is something that
only the designated liars could say. I
mean, it is so shamelessly obviously a
lie, but you know, she's using the
weasel word
reportedly.
Reportedly. So, that's my leadin to my
next story, which is James
Carville has the most insane claim here.
He was talking to uh Ryan Liza on a
podcast and according to Carville, he
said, "Quote, people say to me all the
time, James, why don't we just do like
the Republicans do? Just stand up and
lie." All right, so this is Carville
claiming that the Republicans
lie and and then he's going to tell you
why they can't do that.
And he says, "Uh, because our effing
people wouldn't stand for it." Carville
says, "If I stood up and lied, you would
be the first person to say James
Carville lost all credibility last night
when he said X, Y, and
Z."
Really? Has James Carville never
noticed that Democrats lie?
I mean, I I don't even know what to say
about that because I can't tell if he's
actually stupid and clueless and he
doesn't know or is that just one of his
lies and he's just, you know, sort of a
happy warrior, lies about anything. But,
but Carville is not one of the
designated liars. He does try to weasle
his way around to something that's
closer to spinning or omitting some
facts or leaving out some context or
something. So, he's not I wouldn't call
him one of the designated liars. He
doesn't like to get caught in like a
really really direct lie, but he
certainly said some things about
Republicans getting ready to to cut
Medicaid and Social Security to which I
say, but the president says he won't do
that and there's no support for that.
And then he would argue, well, but you
know, there are reasons to think they
might do it
anyway. So that's not it's not the worst
lie.
It just, you know, lacks context, I
guess you'd
say. All right. But at the same time,
uh, Jen
Saki, Democrat,
um, she was asked,
uh, about the so-called cover up of
Biden's mental decline. And, uh, she was
on some podcast and she argued that she
doesn't like the word cover up because
that suggests that they were aware of
the fact that Biden was mentally
incapable and they were hiding it from
people. and she doesn't believe that she
ever saw the uh Biden with any mental
decline. Now, is she a Democrat
who is
lying? You can't really
tell because, you know, maybe, you know,
maybe by weird coincidence, she just
never saw it because he had good days
and bad days.
So, it's it's wildly improbable that she
was not aware that about his mental
decline. Wildly improbable. But you
can't say it's
impossible. So, again, she's not one of
the the Democrat designated liars. She's
more of a spinner, you know, more of a
leave out some context, you know, allow
you to believe something that that you
shouldn't believe.
But anyway, I guess the Democrats think
they don't lie. So, Elon
Omar was asked about uh on some
interview about the rise of
Islamophobia and she was asked if that's
a legitimate fear that people are afraid
about the rise of Islam of Islam I guess
in the United States. Um, I would say
that I'm afraid of that because the
Islamic system is such that it's it's
built to
dominate and usually there's a very
clear plan to, you know, get more
people, have more babies, you know,
carve out your own little area where you
say, "Oh, you know, we'll be a little
Muslim area." Next thing you know,
they're going to be pressing for Sharia
law and then after that trying to take
over the
country. So yes,
um I don't know if I'm
Islamophobic, you know, I can say the
usual things like obviously it doesn't
apply to, you know, most Islamic people.
You know, there are good people and bad
people in every group, blah blah blah.
But yes, I'm completely I'm completely
afraid. not afraid, but I'm completely
concerned that it's an incompatible
system with our current system, but it's
also a uh what would you call it? A uh
sort of a hungry system that looks to
eat the other
systems. Uh but here's what Elon Omar
said. Our country should be here's the
should. Our country should be more
fearful of white men. If fear is the
driving force, we should be monitoring,
profiling, and creating policies to
fight the radicalization of white
men.
Okay. Now, is that a Democrat
lying or is that spinning and leaving
out context? It's more of a spinning,
leaving out context. But I can tell you
that most of us would be cancelled
forever if we had ever said anything
like that. But
somehow somehow she gets to say that in
public and goes on like nothing
happened.
Amazingly. Well, as you know, every time
Trump tries to do something, there's
some kind of federal court that tries to
block it and then it gets raised to a
higher court and sometimes Trump wins.
Well, one of those things was Trump
trying to fire the staff of the Voice of
America people and then there was a
judge that says you can't do that and
now there's a DC court um who struck
down the first judge and says yes you
can. So the gayway pundits writing about
this. So apparently it's a big win. So
Trump does get to say who works in the
Voice of America and he would like that
to be nobody.
So, we'll see if this extends to other
topics. I'm not sure it
does. Um, Brett Bearer was talking to JD
Vance and he was asking about the uh the
Trump
2028 and whether or not Trump really
wants to run for a third term. And
here's uh JD Vance's uh answer to that.
He said uh yeah, with a big smile, he
goes, "I'll let the president speak to
his political future. One thing I'll say
about the president of the United
States, he loves to have a good time
with the American media. Now, I think
that's your answer, right? You your
answer is he doesn't want to speak for
the
president, but he wants you to know that
the president likes to have some fun
with the media. So the so the Trump 2028
thing, I think, you know, maybe he's
testing the waters to see if there was
some legal way to do it, but I don't
really think he plans to run again in
2028. Um, at the same time, you probably
saw the meme that Trump put out of
himself looking like the
Pope and Bill Crystal is trying to turn
this into some kind of news. um you
know, he said that the Pope meme is, you
know, disrespectful to Catholics. And he
he asked JD Vance on X, you know, if if
he thought the Pope meme was
disrespectful to Catholics. And JD Vance
responded in an X. Um well, here's
exactly what Bill Crystal said. He said,
"Jie Vance, are you fine with this
disrespect and mocking of the Holy
Father?"
advanced replies on X. As a general
rule, I'm fine with people telling jokes
and not fine with people starting stupid
wars that kill thousands of my
countrymen because that's a direct
attack on Bill Crystal who likes his
wars. So, that's a perfect answer. You
know, a as you're trying to decide if JD
Vance will be the
2028 Trump uh
follow-up, these are just perfect
answers that he likes jokes and he
doesn't like war.
Perfect. Well, here's another lie from
the uh
Democrats. I saw this in a post by John
McCloy. So, over on MSNBC, the former
Senator Doug Jones was claiming that
when Trump did his uh commencement
address at Alabama,
um that he wasn't
invited. He said he wasn't invited to to
Alabama to give a commencement address.
And they had to open the event to the
general public because they couldn't get
anyone else to come in. In other words,
they the college didn't have enough
people interested to go. So they had to
open it to the public just to sort of
fill the
space. None of that was true. They did
invite him and the place was packed to
the gills and it was a closed ticketed
event so it was not available to the
general public. So every part of that
was just completely made
up.
And does Carville even notice that?
Probably not. Probably
not. Well, here's another least
surprising story of all times. Have you
noticed that the New York
Times likes to do these deep dives on
stories to discover something that you
and I have known for years and then they
make it look like, you know, they're
that they've done some great
investigative work and you and I stay
here and go, um, we all knew that for
years. Here's another one. So, a big
investigation by the New York Times
um and they've revealed that Washington
and and Kiev have operated what amounts
to a shadow military alliance.
So, the New York Times is just finding
out that the US built 12 covert CIA
bases inside Ukraine, trained elite
units for years, elite Ukrainian units,
and had a constant stream of battlefield
intelligence to help Ukraine strike
Russian
targets now. How many of you didn't know
that?
Is there even one person here who didn't
know that the US was sort of, you know,
low-key using the CIA to help Ukraine as
much as possible? And obviously we were
on the ground. And obviously there had
to be, you know, facilities for all
those CIA people. And obviously we were
going to train them. I if only for using
our weapons, we'd have to train them.
So, isn't it weird that the New York
Times does these these big deep dives
and they say, "Oh, this this might
surprise you, but guess what? The United
States has been deeply involved in this
war in a very practical level since the
beginning." And we all
say, "I think we all knew that just
because it's
obvious, worstkept secret."
Well, um you might know that uh Putin
had asked for a three-day ceasefire
because Putin's got this big victory day
celebration that they're doing in uh
Russia, victory day over, uh I guess o
over Hitler, and they're going to have
uh foreign dignitaries will be there,
etc. So he wanted to make sure that
um that Ukraine didn't use that
opportunity to attack the event because
people would be exposed and it would be
you know it'd just be terrible if he
attacked it. And Zilinski has uh
basically said uh it's fair
game. Zalinski just said directly it's
it's fair game. You know we're at war.
We can attack anything we want. Now, on
one hand, I kind of agree with that. If
you're at war, you can attack whatever
you need to
attack, but uh it seems like it would be
the worst idea in the world to attack
this victory day thing because it would
just make Putin more angry. And that's
nothing good could come from that. But
it doesn't sound like Zilinski wants
peace.
If you wanted
peace, you would at least say, "All
right, we'll give you the three days,
but we'd rather have a permanent
ceasefire." You don't say, "We might we
might attack your Victory Day
parade." This is very clearly not
working toward peace.
Speaking of not working toward peace,
the Times of Israel is reporting that
the Hoodis
um sent some ballistic missile toward
Israel and it blew up near Bengurion
airport. Didn't kill anybody or hurt
anybody, but uh Israel is wondering why
they didn't shoot it down. So, they've
got their they've got their missile
defense systems and it was only one
missile and it apparently got through
the defenses. So, they're going to have
to figure out what's up with that. But
does it seem to you like the entire
point of the
Hoodies is to either create a bigger
war? Well, just that, to create a bigger
war. I feel like that's all they're
doing is trying to create a bigger war.
Meanwhile, over in the UK, I saw the
Amuse account writing about this. Um,
the UK has found what they think are
eight terror suspects that are Iranian
that were in their country accused of
planning massive terror attacks against
British
citizens.
Now, do you think that would have been a
good play from
Iran to do a massive terror
attack in the
UK? I don't know.
It seems like that would be a weird play
while while they're talking about a
peace
deal. Um or unless it's, you know, just
in case things went bad or something.
But doesn't it make you wonder how many
Iranian terrorists are already in the
United States. If there were eight of
them in the UK and they were looking to
do some big terror thing, there might be
dozens of
them, if not hundreds, in the United
States because we haven't had border
security until recently.
So that's the thing I worry about the
most is if if we ended up being involved
in some kind of a terror
attack on if we got involved in let's
say working with Israel to attack the uh
nuclear facilities in Iran. I feel like
they would activate their
terrorists and it would be a really bad
week in
America. So that does worry
me. Well, in other science news, uh
there new scientific not scientific
solar panels that are a thousand times
stronger and thinner than a human hair
and it's way more
efficient, a thousand times more
powerful than silicon, and way more
durable according to the bright side of
the news. Now, I think I've told you
before that all of these massive
improvements in solar panels and fusion
and uh you know batteries
um you really have to think in terms of
you know 5 to 20 years before any of
this finds its way into the commercial
world. But it's kind of
exciting. And then lastly, because it's
May 4th,
um there's a company uh called, let's
see, who are they? It's a Polish firm.
They've created this Star Wars styled
airbike except it uses a jet engine. So,
it's like a flying motorcycle with a jet
engine and it shows it, you know,
looking really cool and flying over this
desert area. And I'm thinking to myself,
you kind of have to have your own
desert, don't you? Because where exactly
would you fly a jet powered
motorcycle? You wouldn't do it in the
suburbs. You couldn't do it in the
city. You couldn't do it really
anywhere, you know. You couldn't do it
over other people's property because
because they're really low. They're not
way up in the air. They're like, I don't
know, 20 feet
up. So, to me, this seems like the worst
commercial idea I've ever seen in my
life. Although, the technology looked
pretty cool. So, all right, that's all I
got for you today. Uh, yeah, it's also
loud. Yeah, I I can't see that. That is
a future, but who knows?
Maybe. Uh, Jay Leno has a jet
motorcycle.
He probably doesn't use it too
much. All right. Um, thanks for joining
everybody. I'm going to talk to the
locals people for just briefly. And the
rest of you, thanks for joining. I'll
see you same time tomorrow, same place.
