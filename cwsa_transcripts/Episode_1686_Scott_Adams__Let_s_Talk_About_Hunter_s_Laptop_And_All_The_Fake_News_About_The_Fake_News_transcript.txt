good morning everybody
and welcome to the best thing in
civilization it's called coffee with
scott adams gets better every day you've
probably noticed and how would you like
to take it up a notch because we're
going to be talking about hunter's
laptop and all kinds of stuff
and
somebody in the comments just said i
think i'm pregnant
okay
congratulations maybe
but if you'd like to take it up a notch
all you need is a cup of margarita glass
to tank your jealousy's diet a canteen
jugger flask a vessel of any kind
why don't you
put your liquid into it
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's the dopamine of the day
it's the thing that makes everything
better
it's called the simultaneous sip
some call it the sultry sip
but no it's a simultaneous sip go
what's a banger
somebody's going to do a simultaneous
banger is that like a well i can't even
imagine
well according to rasmussen
republicans have an 11 point lead
against a generic
democrat on the congressional ballot
with only 235 days left before the
midterms
and
if the election were held today 50
percent of likely u.s voters would vote
for the republican
while only 39 would vote for the
democrat
does that tell you that the republicans
are going to win everything
the trouble with this kind of a
survey
is that while it accurately captures
what people are thinking it doesn't
accurately capture how they act
because how they act is they say yeah
all these politicians are terrible well
except mine
mine is good
but all those other ones in the other
states that are bad
so as long as people vote for their own
incumbent
which they typically do
uh i don't know that it's going to make
that much difference that there's a big
generic lead
because nobody both nobody votes for a
generic
so i'm going to say this is a highly
encouraging for republicans but
i don't think it's predictive and sort
of a straight line
i mean you could have individual
match-ups
that are more important than the generic
feeling of things if all the candidates
who run are
you know the best democrat candidate
against a
second-tier quality republican then the
democrats would win everything
i don't think the polls are going to
tell you that
well apparently the u.s is
getting close to announcing some kind of
uh
iran deal which uh the experts say is
worse than the last one
do you believe it
maybe
i mean it's easy to believe things got
worse just because we have such you know
bad attitudes about our government
so that's easy to believe
but i don't think we know anything about
it
the iran deal is going to be another one
of those big confusing black boxes
where everybody will think they know
something about it but they don't
they don't know what's going to happen
they don't know if it'll work they don't
know what the details are
but
um
i can't see lifting their terrorist
designation
as long as they're still doing
terroristic things
how in the world
uh how in the world can
the sanctions be lifted and how could we
not call them a terrorist organization
if they act like it
or are they not acting like it
has anything changed in iran
or by iran's behavior
since uh solomony was uh killed
i haven't heard anything have you so i
haven't seen any news stories that says
you know iran used to do a lot of
adventurous stuff
and they still
do i haven't heard that story
but i also haven't heard the story that
that they stopped doing it
is it possible that solomony was the
the terrorist party and maybe we just
took him out and maybe
maybe the
rest of the government wasn't so
big on
helping other people do stuff in other
countries
maybe
but have you seen any kind of news
either way because i can't tell you in
the last
they bombed our embassy do you believe
that
do you believe that
do you believe that iran bombed our
embassy or i don't think it was an
embassy it was some quarter some sort of
official structure though
do you believe that they bombed our
embassy and we just kept talking to them
about this deal
i don't
i don't believe that at all
i don't believe that the u.s knows they
bombed our our consulate i guess was you
believe that they know iran bombed our
consulate and we're just still talking
to them about this deal
that doesn't make sense
does it you do believe that all right a
lot of people say yes
that even though they bombed the
consulate we're still talking to them
i mean it's possible
it's not impossible
but it seems to me that the first thing
they would have done is said uh let's
let's back off
and uh
this isn't the right time
i mean i think at the very least they
would have said
we're gonna wait a month before we get
serious about this to see if you can
stop doing this sort of thing
you can ask your friend he's right there
iran said they did it
well probably there's a lot about this
story we don't understand
do you think
and in fact i don't think we know enough
about the whole uh iranian negotiations
or maybe you know what he does to even
have a good opinion on it because i
don't know what iran's been doing lately
i don't believe the news just in general
do you believe the news if the news told
you that iran
bombed the consulate
do you believe it because it was in the
news
i mean it might be true
but i wouldn't believe it because it's
in the news
this is exactly the kind of thing that's
not true
you know if you're going to put it in a
category
is it in the category of things that
usually pan out to be true
or is it in the general category of
things that later you find out well that
wasn't exactly right there was more to
it
might have been a military facility
there who knows
might have been an accident who knows
yeah maybe it's true this time
maybe this is the one maybe this is the
first true story we got this year
could be
could be
um
so china is apparently doing this
balancing act where they're trying to be
friendly to russia but not
help them too overtly and apparently
china's done some things which
were not exactly good for russia
but it looks like china's deal is going
to be consistent and i have to say i
respect it
i gotta say that the way china handles
you know the the way they talk about
their relations with other countries
they do that well and they do it
consistently
and their message is always the same
we don't want war we want to be in
business
no war
more trade
am i wrong that china is very consistent
about that
it's like no we don't want to be
involved in this we just want to sell
you stuff and buy stuff that's it
so i think that they did a you know the
usual
china good job of
saying hey don't get us involved you
know this isn't our fight
but
did you think that
china was ever going to actually
directly help russia in the war
how many of you thought china was
because our news told us that they were
thinking about it right
how did the news know that they were
thinking about it was it
dozens of intel sources
is that how we heard
was it all of our intel sources
i never believed that china was thinking
of directly helping militarily or even
directly
backstopping them to the point where it
would be effectively a military
assistance
and apparently they're not the the
indications are that they're not going
to do anything too special for russia
now
this might explain why
even though
russia and china do a lot of business
the total amount of business that china
does with russia is about two percent of
china's business
so two percent of china's trade is with
russia
a lot of it is with america and the
european union
so what's good for china is to stay
friends with whoever is buying most of
their stuff
and to maybe be a little ambiguous with
somebody who's only a two percent
impact
so if you ever thought that china would
bat its entire economy
to help russia beat ukraine which is not
even worth doing
at least from china's point of view has
no no benefit
why would why would china risk its own
economy because they know that the
sanctions would
start to you know move into anti-china
stuff if they do that
why would they do that to help russia
conquer ukraine of all things they
couldn't they couldn't have less
interest than that
so
i think that was always fake news and
i'm going to say that the
the intel if you can call it that that
said that china was going to help russia
probably was just fake fake intel again
how many times have you seen that
all right
so new york times has confirmed
that hunter's laptop is real
i was
a little surprised
that that's still a story
i thought everybody knew it was real
but i guess not
is it really a story that the new york
times says is real
because i wasn't aware
i mean obviously you know jen saki and
biden everybody said it was russian
disinformation but we know that we know
democrats lie and we know
politicians lie
but didn't the public already know this
was real
i haven't seen a poll
but was there anybody in the public who
thought it wasn't real
i thought they all knew it was real
but maybe i'm surprised
maybe the
mainstream news was so strong with their
brainwashing that they actually
convinced the public it wasn't real
did that happen
yeah there is a there is a uh phenomenon
which is that the news doesn't become
real until the new york times says it's
real
that's the thing by the way if you don't
know that how the media landscape works
um
the the paper of record
as they like to call it
is the new york times so when the paper
of record says is true then everybody
else can comfortably say it's true
well the paper of record says it's true
so that's basically like our fact check
so now they've said it's true
yeah and the story was blocked by
facebook twitter and google
everything about this story is
everything that's wrong with the world
or the country maybe maybe let's just
say the country
um
let me deal with the uh
that there's a good comment there i
wanted to deal with
uh but remind me after uh reminding me
to talk about prednisone after i talk
about
hunter's laptop
now of course as we look back on how
this was presented to the public
we were told that dozens of former intel
officials i think 50 of them signed a
document
saying that it was russian
disinformation and rather obviously so
rather obviously
according to these 50 people who didn't
look at it
and now richard
grinnell tweeted this a republican
senate must in all caps
a good use of all caps in this case a
republican senate must hold hearings
with all 50 of the people who signed
that letter
three weeks before the 2020 campaign
because the timing
they all said hunter biden's laptop was
russian disinformation and they didn't
have a single piece of intel to suggest
it
that is correct
i do believe that the republican senate
should talk to every one of those intel
people
and say why did you say this with no
information
was this purely to influence the
election
because it looks like it was purely to
influence the election
which would mean that the 2020 or the
yeah which would mean the 2020 campaign
was rigged
by our own intel
is that too
is that is rigged the wrong word
because it's corruption
i mean based on what we could tell
i mean we you know maybe if they testify
they've got some story that
is not obvious to any of us
that would suggest that maybe they were
legitimately fooled
legitimately fooled
do you think they could make that case
what is the definition of rig
let me look it up right now
rigged
rigged
because i'm not sure if uh
misinformation gets into that
um
okay to rig as in crime okay
to manage or conduct something
fraudulently so as to produce a result
or situation that's advantageous to a
particular person
so did somebody manage or conduct
something fraudulently
yes
the news
yes the news
was managed fraudulently right in front
of us
to create a situation
favorable for one candidate an advantage
in an election which had great
consequences
so yeah actually according to the new
york times
the 2020 election was rigged
that's kind of big
trump was right
now he wasn't talking about only this i
mean he had other allegations which uh
you know we'll have to wait on some of
those or maybe we'll never know
but
if 50 intel people lied
to change the result of a an election or
at least that would be the presumed
intention of that
the 2020 election
was rigged
and the paper of record just confirmed
it
what do you think of that
but the way i just said it
will not be the way
you know the public hears it right
they're never going to hear that
they're just going to hear
they can hear with their own team all
the time but yeah
wow the new york times confirms that the
2020 election was rigged
by the intel
uh the intel's
community
amazing
um but we're so numb to bad behavior at
this point it won't make any difference
do you remember
speaking of russian disinformation or
the united states
creating disinformation about russian
disinformation
do you remember when russia spent almost
nothing
to make a bunch of memes for facebook
that if you saw the memes and i have
you know two things number one
you don't know anybody who saw them
they weren't means you've ever seen
number two they looked like were
developed by a high school project
meaning that there was nothing about the
memes that suggested any kind of
persuasion skill whatsoever trust me on
that right that's sort of my domain
there was there's no persuasion quality
to them whatsoever and they spent 100
thousand dollars
which is nothing
so the whole story about russian
election interference was
technically true but the part they leave
out is that it's a little bit like
pissing in the ocean
did russia piss in the ocean
true
did the
uh did the
did the shoreline show any difference
not so much
no not so much
did did the uh
yeah the sea level rise when russia
pissed in the ocean
oh tactically
technically yes
not enough you can measure
so that's sort of what the russian
election interference was then and how
do we know there was so much russian
interference then
well i believe we heard that from plenty
of current and former intel officials am
i right
current and
current intel uh and past intel
officials
so pretty much everything we've heard
about russia is disinformation from our
own side
often disinformation about their
disinformation
just to complete the picture
so spot the pattern it's pretty clear
that the united states is now
completely
controlled by its own intel agencies
i i just said that like as a matter of
fact
did you like how he did that
i just said the most provocative thing
that's ever been said in the united
states but i said it like a matter of
fact and you just said yeah that's true
that the united states government is
captured by our intel
now i have a theory that all governments
eventually are captured by their own
intelligence agencies
because it has to happen
am i wrong
am i wrong
that if you just take any situation
where there's a strong intelligence
entity
that if you wait long enough
that intelligence entity will control
the government that hired it
right
you can't really go any other way
i mean there's a reason that putin's in
charge of russia right
[Laughter]
going from the intel agency to running
the country is a pretty direct path
in a dictatorship for sure
um
yeah yeah i think at this point it does
look like the uh the u.s government is
essentially
an intelligence agency
cut out or just a puppet
that's what it looks like
now
i probably get kicked off of social
media if i say i have proof
that's what it is i'm just saying that
based on everything we've seen just in
the public domain
that would be the reasonable
interpretation
am i wrong
who disagrees with me it's a reasonable
interpretation based on public
information no special research needed
that our intel agencies are running the
government
effectively you know on anything
important
certainly on anything that involves
foreign countries maybe far less for
domestic stuff yeah let me modify that i
doubt our intel agencies are having much
impact if any
on any domestic policy because they
don't care
but i think they have a lot of impact
maybe it's the only impact
on foreign
relations
so that's my take
all right um
so
trump is right again
starting to become my best prediction
that trump would look better every day
he was out of office
do you all believe it yet how many
believed me when i said it
do you remember what i said it in in the
beginning they said he would look better
every day he's out of office
i'll bet you didn't believe it right
all right let me talk about uh
prednisone
uh there was a uh mike cervich tweet
today that said among other things
that uh putin has a world view so if
you're just looking at him as a crazy
person
you may have been you know hypnotized or
brainwashed by the media i'm adding that
last part but the the the
point being
that listening to
putin
you don't get the sense that he's insane
necessarily he's obviously stressed
but he has a world view that holds
together even if you disagree with it
and therefore he's not operating from
insanity
he's operating from
a different set of priorities or you
know
there's a sense of what's important
now
when uh my cervix said in that tweet he
said that if you're thinking that
prednisone is the explanation
then you're not a serious person and
i've said he looks like somebody who
could be on some kind of
drug and their prednisone would be a
good guess
because prednisone my experience with it
is because i took too much of it and 20
whatever 19.
and
it just changed my personality
i mean i could feel it in real time
those of you who are watching me on live
stream can you confirm i think you can
can you confirm that when you knew i was
on prednisone because i told you
publicly
that i was more aggressive
can you confirm that
based on just observation i mean you
don't know what i'm thinking
but i want you know i know a number of
you could say yes but i want those of
you who didn't witness it
to hear from the ones who did
you saw me every day and you saw me on
president zone and you saw me off and i
don't think
you could miss the difference
am i right
the difference wasn't
small
the difference was striking
and i could feel it in myself so while
you were while you were observing i was
different i could feel it too
i felt it maybe even more strongly that
you could observe it
i felt fundamentally like a different
person in other words even
you know if i always had that
personality that i had under prednisone
i would think i was a different person
but of course the prednisone goes away
and i go back to my normal my normal
situation
so um i'm going to
agree with cernovich
um
but i'm going to say this
if you think the entire story is bred in
his own you're wrong
so i agree with him on that
it's not the entire story
you know i'm not saying that he doesn't
have or that russia doesn't have some
historical
claim you know
claim or interest to ukraine that's true
they do
and i'm not going to say that they don't
have any military or defense
incentive because they do
right i mean you could if you were to
write on paper
write an essay
uh try to write it from putin's point of
view
does he have good reasons or just
reasons to do what he's doing
i think you can make a case worked
you could make a non-crazy case for what
he's doing
it's not working out
so you could say that he's failing
that's a separate question
but he had a reason
here's the question
if you have a reason to punch somebody
do you always do it
if you have a reason to punch somebody
do you always do it
the answer is no
now i put you on prednisone and i give
you too much of it
now you still have the same reason to
punch somebody there's no no change you
had the same reason to punch somebody
now do you take the punch
maybe
maybe you do
so definitely
i agree with cervich that you can't say
this is a
prednisone only or any drug you can't
say it's a drug only situation it's not
of course
it's it's russia has a good point
ukraine has a good point that's why
there's a war
if they if they didn't both have a good
point
it wouldn't look like this right now i'm
not saying i agree with russia's point
or agree with ukrainians i'm saying that
from their points of view they can make
an argument that holds together on paper
not everybody can do that
i'm just saying that if you add
prednisone to any situation that's
already tense
it's going to get tenser
it's not going to get more relaxed
so
it is possible
but there is no
no direct evidence that i would that
i've seen
it's possible that prednisone is a
variable
i would go as high as 20 percent
possibility
that it's either prednisone or some
medication
is changing putin's uh
personality in his judgment i'd give it
a 20 chance
but i'll tell you he looks like he's a
guy who's different
um
yeah he looks like a guy who's changed
now when i say that i'm not saying that
well
let me be as careful as i can with my
words
i'm not intentionally
telling you something that i don't
believe to be true
in other words i could be wrong that
putin is on some kind of drug i could
easily be wrong
but i honestly think he is
and i have a strong feeling about it i
have a strong feeling
that he's on drugs of some kind that's
affecting his behavior
and that i can identify it just by his
mannerisms and his look
now you know that there's a lot of
science
that says that people can identify
people who are sick
just by looking at their face
did you know that
that's an actual thing it can be tested
now people don't get it right every time
but if you showed two faces and one was
sick and one wasn't
you the humans can pick it up like that
because we're designed
to identify
other humans who are good for
reproduction
and you're going to be less likely to
want to reproduce with somebody who
looks sick than someone who looks
healthy so we could pick out healthy
just like that we're really good at it
and i look at i look at putin and i say
i don't see health
i see bad health
doesn't mean i'm right but humans are
good at this
that's the only case i'll make is that
we are good at it and he does look sick
or something's going on
all right
why did our intel know that putin would
invade long before we long before he had
150 000 people surrounding the country
at that point it was a little more
obvious
but
how did our intel get that one so right
when they got so many other things wrong
what do you think that is
now
you're going to say it wasn't hard
because russia
had said enough things to indicate it
and they had started massing troops so
really they were just looking at what
was happening
so it wasn't that much of a prediction
but
i want to give you at least one other
possibility
without evidence
so that there's not any evidence to what
i'm going to say
it's just in the possibility set because
we don't know what's going on
one of the possibilities
is the reason our intel people knew that
russia was going to invade is that they
caused it
do you know it's a lot easier to predict
things that you cause on your own
have you ever seen me do that
all right here's an interesting question
for those of you who have been watching
me for a long time
have you ever seen me predict something
and then after it came true you said to
yourself
wait a minute did he predict that or did
he cause that to happen
and he knew he was going to cause it to
happen so he just acted like he was
predicting it have you ever seen me do
that
i'm seeing some yeses
you know you can't be sure right
because you'd have to trust me
and you know you shouldn't trust anybody
really
as a general rule i just don't trust
anybody
okay so during the 2016
election cycle
there were things that i did attempt to
directly change
and i know things went my way but it's
hard to know how much effect you had
all right uh
true or false russia as wall street
journal is reporting is russia
um or at least ukraine is it becoming a
graveyard for russian tanks
do you believe the report that 400
russian tanks have been stopped or
destroyed
by the ukrainians
now 400 is a lot of tanks to destroy
we are told that the russian military
advance has stopped in the last day or
so
two days i think
now again i'm not even sure if that's
true they could be just regrouping you
know maybe they're not bogged down at
all
could be anything
but
uh so as a general rule i don't don't
believe any of the reports coming out
the only thing you could believe is that
ukraine is still fighting right they're
very basic things you can believe yes
they're still fighting
we know that
um i always say at this point that
ukraine is poised to win the war
and
i'll go back to my original prediction
remember my worst prediction is um and i
kept the prediction long after it was
obviously obvious it wasn't going to
come true because i just wanted to be
consistent but i predicted that russia
would not invade
because it would be
the worst decision putin ever made and
it was obviously a bad decision
now i believed it because
i thought that russian tanks couldn't
survive uh american technology
meaning the shoulder mounted
stuff and the drones and whatever else
we have that you've never even heard of
so i believe that ukraine would have
enough of the good technology that the
russian tanks would be stopped cold and
that russia really can't hold the
country without tanks
so here are my assumptions
ukraine would have enough
modern technology so having enough of it
counts it appears that's going to be the
case
i i said that their technology to defeat
a tank would be better than the tank
technology that appears to be the case
and i'm going to add to that i don't
know if i said this originally but i'll
add to it
i don't think you can conquer a country
without tanks
so they need tanks and they're not going
to have them
that tells me that the ukrainians will
eventually stall their tanks
and start picking them off until the
russian army has to
dissolve
or you know disappear
so
i think that the
ukrainian strategy of going for supply
routes
and tanks
and nothing else i mean basically you
could just go for those that would be
enough to win the war
so they have the they have the morale
they have the strategy they've got the
communication they've got the
coordination they've got the satellite
view so they can find stuff they've got
the modern equipment that's better than
the tanks in other words they can
destroy the tanks
what would ever stop them from losing
i mean russia from losing how in the
world
so i'm seeing
richard
i call him dick
asking if i went to west point
and i would like to defend my military
uh
opinions this way
rock always beats scissors
you don't have to be a military expert
to know that rock beats scissors
right if one side had nuclear weapons
and the other had sticks and stones
would you have to be a military expert
to predict who would win if let's say
they all used all of their weapons
probably not
you don't have to be a military expert
to know that there is someone some
number of handheld anti-tank weapons
that is enough to defeat defeat
a given quantity of tanks wouldn't you
agree with that
they're given a a certain number of
tanks it's only it's only a question of
how many people with handheld shoulder
mounts
there are
that's the only question if there are
enough of them then the tanks will go
away
now i've heard much said about the
russians lack of coordination of forces
so if you've got a tank formation
you need to support it with
with uh what do you call it infantry
you need to support it with air cover
and apparently they're not doing a good
job of supporting it
i don't know that that's going to help
them
how much would air support
help to stop
two ukrainians with a shoulder mounted
rocket
do you stop that with air support
i can't imagine that would be a thing
can you find two people in a forest
with air support
i mean you can hear the jack coming so
you just stand next to a tree when it
goes over right
i it just seems to me that
there are some things that are so
plainly obvious you don't need to be a
military expert to know
if i said to you um the united states is
going to enter the war
would you wonder
if our
warthogs could take out the
russian columns of
no you wouldn't wonder that
that's just
rock beat scissors
right one weapon is better than the
other weapon that's all it is
so i don't think you have to be much of
a military genius to know that rock
meets
scissors every time and i think that's
what we have
they need tanks
they're not going to have them
am i right
let's take it down to that level and see
if i'm wrong
they can't conquer you know the the
cities and hold them with their own
tanks and they won't have them
i think that's it that's the end of the
war
you you know as long as the ukrainians
have food
and it looks like
that's happening
ah
i think they just keep fighting i think
russia's got to figure out how to get
out of there
all right there was a deep fake putin
i'm wondering why there haven't been
more of those apparently the deep fake
uh putin was saying that russia
surrenders or something
so we're not quite at the point where
the deep fake isn't a little bit obvious
when you look at it
but it's really close
and i would guess
that if our government tried to make it
deep fake it would look just like the
real thing
whereas some some person with a computer
tries to make one it's still pretty good
but it doesn't you know it's not like a
counterfeit bill you know the united
states can make a
a 20 bill
that's got all the technology in it and
it's hard to counterfeit
but a person can't usually do that
so what happens when governments get
involved making deep fakes
back in the bin laden
times
when i thought we had enough technology
to do it i thought we should be doing
that because nobody knows where bin
laden is
everybody seems to be taking
directions from him we should create a
deep fake
and so nobody knows if they're getting
the real bin laden or the deep fake
in fact we should make more deep fakes
than real ones
so every time you got some bin laden
information you'd be like i don't know
maybe
can't tell
um that's what i would have done but
maybe the technology wasn't there
well the hacker group anonymous has uh
you know renewed their call for all
hackers to attack
russia for their inhumane or on ukraine
are you wondering why the lights are
still on and kiev and
are you wondering why the russian the
so-called
their great cyber capabilities have made
no difference at all
is is it my imagination or did the cyber
abilities of russia
turn out to be completely irrelevant
um
i don't know
i i just i think we have a big question
mark about all those
cyber capabilities that seem to
disappear
all right um
i believe that is all the fun news
and
did i miss anything
you know the the i looked at cnn as soon
as i saw on twitter all the uh the noise
about the laptop being confirmed
i immediately went to cnn
to see how they covered the fact that
their news had been wrong
for years
on a really important story
i don't think they mentioned it
can you confirm that does anybody have
another page open go look at cnn
uh i don't believe
that they're even mentioning that the
new york times confirmed it's real
there's a putin rally
what do i think will happen with the
hunter situation i think the hunter
situation will be
investigated until joe biden's out of
office
so i think the biden administration as
it stands will never have to answer for
it
and then after he's out of office he'll
still have you know lots of connections
there'll be some kind of a
uh jesse smullet
kind of a situation
where where maybe justice acts
but when it's done
hunter serves 10 days in jail and
suspended sentence or something i feel
like
something will happen that's nothing
because they can't do nothing nothing
they have to do something but they can't
do something that matters so they have
to do with something that's nothing like
with jesse
well you're going to jail well not
really going to jail
and by going to jail i mean you'll not
go to jail
that sort of thing now one of the things
that hunter apparently did
is he paid a million dollars of taxes
after after it was due
but you don't really go to jail too
often
even for not paying taxes
if you voluntarily paid them before you
you know got to court
so apparently you know juries and judges
they look
more leniently on somebody who has paid
their bills
if you haven't paid your bills then
maybe you go to jail but if you have
paid your bills you just didn't do it on
time
that's not too different than a lot of
america right so
so if if it turned out his only problem
was taxes he doesn't have a problem
it's the other stuff that might be the
problem
and i don't know if there's going to be
a
smoking gun
or would you say there's already a
smoking gun
i know it's like a pre-smoking gun
it's like i could see how it might be a
smoking gun but it's not quite a smoking
gun if you know what i mean
because the stuff that i've seen
from hunter
is definitely eyebrows you know go all
the way up to your forehead like what
10 for the big guy what i mean it sounds
like the worst possible thing
but uh we'll find out or we won't maybe
we'll find we will never find out
but i'd certainly like to
get to the bottom of it
now
watching how the news handles the fang
news
it's probably the most frustrating thing
i do
because if they wait long enough they
can just correct their story
but the story no longer is salient
people just moved on with what they're
interested in
so they can just keep the fake news
going for years reverse it whenever
nobody's paying much attention
and perfect and get away with it
completely
accused of money laundering well we'll
see if they can prove that
you know remember uh for all we want to
criticize hunter for
he was
a yield was he a yale trained lawyer
do i have that right yale
now he might he might have gotten in
because his father was
joe biden or something but i suspect the
hunter biden is legitimately quite smart
do you think that's not true i mean he's
got his issues
no question
but in terms of if you if you gave him
an iq test
i think he'd do really well
i think
you don't go to yale and get a degree
without being a little bit smart
uh
um
and and he's an artist of sorts
all right
anyway keep an eye on that
keep an eye on that all right here's my
favorite story of the day uh arnold did
you see arnold schwarzenegger's video in
which he tried to talk directly to the
russian people
and i gave it a uh 100
a rating
for persuasion
i'll tell you
i've always liked arnold
and arnold is one of the best
communicators which is ironic because
you know he's got the accent
but arnold has been one of the best
communicators
in
political or any life he's just the best
i mean really
he's better than trump
now trump's more provocative so maybe he
can get more attention but in terms of
actual persuasion skill
yeah he's better than trump and i don't
say that lightly
that's that's like a big deal
uh here's what he did right
now first of all let me acknowledge i
saw some pushback on it when i said it
was good the number of people said i
turned it off
when he said that the january 6th thing
was actually an attempt to overthrow the
government
now i don't believe january 6 was an
attempt to overthrow the government to
me that's obvious fake news
but
arnold wasn't talking to you
he didn't make the video for you
arnold made a video in which he wanted
to
demonstrate his credibility
before he told the russian people
something that was hard to understand
and hear
based on the propaganda they've gotten
so far
so what arnold did was perfect technique
he showed how much he loves the russian
people and is connected to them with a
personal anecdote of a russian
weightlifter who changed his life and he
still drinks out of the same cup of
coffee that this guy gave him years ago
and he actually shows you the cup of
coffee the actual cup
he says i've been drinking out of this
for years because it was given to me by
my good friend and he shows the pictures
of the weight lifter
have i told you that visual persuasion
is the good stuff
oh my god
arnold took the visual persuasion from
actually showing the the bodybuilder
then he talked about the uh the fight he
had with his dad who didn't like
russians because he'd been in world war
ii and his dad wanted to take the
russian off the wall when he was when
arnold was kid and arnold refused
arnold arnold was going to support the
russian guy now you've got the visual
of him meeting the bodybuilder and he
shows the picture
you've got the visual in your mind of a
young arnold with a poster on the wall
and then he ends it with the visual of
actually holding the coffee cup that
that guy gave him
what do i say about visual persuasion
it's the best i mean fear is the
strongest
if you have fear persuasion you can't
beat that but without that
the best one is visual
and man did he nail the visual he nailed
it here's the other thing i teach you
you have to pace people before you can
lead them
you have to agree with them before you
can change their mind
he did it masterfully
including and i know you don't like this
sorry
the january 6th part
if you don't think that was good
persuasion because it's untrue
you're on the wrong conversation
i'm not saying he was right
i'm saying that if he's talking to a
russian public
and he says look you can trust me i'm
even throwing my own party under the bus
remember he's a republican
arnold's a republican
who's throwing other republicans under
the bus he's saying look i'm throwing
republicans under the bus you can see me
do it right now
now
that makes him wrong about january 6 in
my opinion
but it does make him a really good
persuader
because he's trying to establish his
credibility and
let me ask you another thing
is arnold schwarzenegger famous for
telling it straight
or is he famous for lying
what do you think
just your own opinion
is arnold famous for lying
or famous for being pretty much a
straight shooter
i think he's famous for being a straight
shooter
i mean i
maybe some story i don't know about but
i don't think he's ever been accused of
not giving you his honest opinion
even if he didn't like it
so even the january 6 stuff i kind of
hate but i do love his transparency
i love the fact that his opinion is very
clear
and and he said it and it was against
the grain and
you know
okay
i don't agree with it but i respect it
completely
now i think that this is a bigger deal
than maybe you think because correct me
if i'm wrong but i'll bet arnold is
really popular in the in the russian
public am i right you know above a
certain age and
that's probably what he's targeting
i i would guess because he's made movies
with you know russian elements and i
think he's and he's an action figure so
there's always play bigger overseas
so i would guess that arnold is maybe
just about the exact perfect person
because he's not just a star
he's also a legitimate political figure
in america
and when he talked to the russian people
he did a really good job of establishing
his
non-bias and his credibility a really
good job some said it lasted too long
but he made it interesting the whole
time
i'm not sure if it lasted too long if
it's interesting the whole time and he
made it interesting because he's a
performer right it was a performance it
wasn't a speech it was a performance and
it was a good one and by the way
anything you ever thought about arnold's
acting ability
well my opinion of it went up
because this was an act i mean overtly
he was he was putting on a show for
purpose to persuade i think he nailed it
i mean i think is not only is it
persuasion perfect even though you don't
like parts of it the persuasion part's
perfect
um and he's the right person at the
right time
i think he could actually move the dial
now the problem is will any russians
actually see it and by the way there was
a translation that came with it
which is good good technique
um
we don't care if he's a rhino
that's not the question today i mean you
could care about it separately
but it doesn't matter to today's topic
yeah it doesn't matter what he did in
his personal life right
okay
well from the russian perspective
as long as they think he's republican
enough
then it's good persuasion that's the
only point
you used to admire him but now you don't
do you think he actually wrote it
uh
that's a good question
it's so good
that i suspect he might have
so if he didn't write it he was
obviously deeply involved in editing it
my guess is he probably had a little
help
but that there's no word in there that
isn't
the one he wants in there
my guess is that arnold isn't gonna take
somebody else's thing and just read it
is that your take
i mean arnold's kind of hands on right
he's not
he's not gonna just say oh just go on
camera and read this thing and make a
convincing that's not gonna happen it
looks like he wrote it i mean he's the
only one who knew about the you know his
connection to the russian
weightlifter and what happened when he
was a kid and stuff so i don't it just
seems to be that
seeing hunter biden memes go by
um
scott is working to get into a different
set of clubs
you know everybody who's uh
who goes tribal on here
and and your comment is
what club i'm trying to join or or if
i'm trying to make some democrats happy
or sometimes you say i think he wants to
sleep with aoc
all of those comments are the lowest
level of analysis
really i mean you're welcome to
participate of course you're all welcome
but
just know when you say that that other
people read and they're like
if if your only take on this is tribal
about how republican is
is arnold that like that's the thing
that mattered to you and and it is scott
always on the side of the same side
sometimes does he agree with the other
if any of that matters to you you're
operating at the lowest level
of analysis
and i'm you know i'm not saying that
tribal affiliations don't matter they do
but if that's what you're obsessed with
you don't have any value
you have com you have no value
because everybody knows that things are
tribal
like you're not adding anything
the russian captions make me think it
was produced by a propaganda outfit well
here's my question do you think the
government asked
arnold to do it or do you think arnold
just came up with the idea on his own
the existence of the
high quality russian translation that
accompanied it
suggests he had some
help
i mean i don't think he put the russian
translation on there himself
um
so i would guess that
i would guess that somebody in the
administration may have reached them or
in intelligence because it looks like a
combination of
government
level
and arnold level it looks like a combo
my perception is that scott has been got
to over ukraine persuasion
is there anybody who thinks that the
ukrainians have persuaded me
and that uh i'm believing their
propaganda
who thinks
so he says yes clearly
all right well let me say as clearly as
possible
you shouldn't believe anything that
ukraine says
is that clear enough if you believe even
one word that the ukrainians are
saying during a war of survival
why
and why would you think i would believe
ukraine
ukraine is the most corrupt you know one
of the most corrupt governments
involved in a war
you can't believe anything they say
somebody says i'm a zelinski apologist
i've told you apologist is a sign for
you having cognitive dissonance right
so
why do you think that i'm a
pro-ukrainian
when i or i'm believing their propaganda
when i tell you i don't believe any of
it like zero of it
none of it and i and i strongly
recommend
that you don't believe any of it
the only things you can believe are the
things that are sort of obvious there's
a war
it's in ukraine you know just basic
stuff that's all you know and otherwise
we're all just sort of guessing
because the news is fake
and everybody's lying
so if you don't start from the premise
that all the news is fake and
everybody's lying
then everything's confusing to you
so when you say that i have been
co-opted by propaganda how exactly do
you get pro co-opted by propaganda that
you are absolutely sure is false
i mean i suppose it could but
if i talk about ukraine winning the war
it's not because
i even i'm not even sure i'm not that
invested honestly
i don't know if i'm that invested
because
i i don't know
ukrainians had some issues
i'm not sure that it matters to the
united states who owns ukraine
i just don't know that it matters to us
so i i don't think i have that
the personal interest in it
i do have an interest that dictators
can't conquer countries
like i have an interest in that because
that
in some ways you could look at the
ukraine situation
as being entirely about china have you
ever thought of that
have you ever thought that the situation
in ukraine is not even about russia
is just about china
because whatever happens here is going
to tell china what they can get away
with
right
so if ukraine doesn't go well for russia
taiwan is safer right remember i told
you that
if you were to arm the taiwan
population with these same weapons
and uh china had to get there by sea
for the most part
i don't know i'm not even sure china
could conquer taiwan without destroying
it totally and i'm not sure that they
could do that so
i do think that ukraine might be
entirely about china
oh akira the dawn has started up his
live streams again i hear so
check out akira the dawn
uh what's a corrupted scott gonna do
uh
china gets both ukraine yeah you know
china might uh get ukraine
i heard somebody say that uh there's no
way that russia is gonna starve their
army because it's the green basket of
the world
so they're not going to run out of bread
because
it's the bread basket of the world
to which i say
have you ever tried to eat wheat
what do you do just grab a handful
in the field
how much wheat is growing in the winter
where is it stored
do you think it's just stored where they
can go get it make some bread
i don't think it's that easy to turn the
wheat in the field into food
you know if you're in a country where
anything that's a factory is going to
get destroyed
i
how do you turn it into food
it can't be that easy
uh
yes we do need fertilizer fertilizer is
a good question
you gotta mill it that's right you gotta
mill it
the 13 dead on a ukrainian island was a
lie yeah most most of what we've heard
is lie or out of context or something
so anyway
i say arnold good
russia bad
and that is your show for today possibly
the best thing you've ever seen
if you were a subscriber to locals you
would have seen my micro lesson on how
to control all the things
you can control
and
you can get a countertop and milling
machine well i agree that you can mill
the wheat
but i don't know if you can mill it fast
enough and efficiently enough to feed an
army
and if your army is eating only bread
and
melted snow i don't know
doesn't seem like a good situation
uh that's all for now and i'll talk to
you tomorrow
