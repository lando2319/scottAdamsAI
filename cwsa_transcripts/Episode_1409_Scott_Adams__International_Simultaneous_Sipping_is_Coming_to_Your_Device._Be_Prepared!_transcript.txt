but it was it was time
no i wasn't lubing the tubing
but thanks for asking yes it's a time
for the best part of the day the part
the part that makes all the other days
all the other parts of the day
look well shabby shabby i'd say
and if you'd like to enjoy to the
maximum
extent the simultaneous sip that's
coming at you
it's coming at you hard all you need is
a cupboard mcgregor glasses tanker
jealous designer can't enjoy a glass of
vessel of any kind join me now for the
dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and
watch it clear up your skin
it happens now go
do you feel that i think a pimple just
went away
it doesn't work all the time but when it
does
wow so in the news
a spanish man according to cnn a spanish
man has been jailed for
15 years and five months for killing and
eating his mother
at the apartment they shared in madrid
when i read that story i remembered
something my mother taught me when i was
young
which is if you can't say something nice
about somebody
don't say anything at all and since i'd
like to talk about this
i'd like to say something nice about
this man who killed
his mother i mean it's not much you have
to dig kind of deep
to find something nice to say but i feel
like we should be balanced
on one hand he's a horrible murderer
who ate his mother well i think we can
all agree that's very bad
but is that everything about him no
he has some redeeming characteristics
some qualities that i think need to be
called out
he was resourceful i'm saying this in
the in the comments exactly
um i like to say that he doesn't waste
food
that's not nothing um
so that's that ron desantis
continues to be the most clever
politician that i've seen in quite a
while
you know he's he's been killing it as a
governor
by doing things that are just wildly
popular for republicans
and apparently weren't that hard to do
which is the weird part
the other there's a list of things that
all republicans want and then he just
took the list
and he's just like checking the boxes
okay we'll get rid of
you know critical race theory in schools
bang you know
we'll do this but everything he's done
so far had the quality of being local
he was doing stuff for florida
and he just came out with one of the
most genius things
i've seen a politician do a long time at
least since
trump was uh thrilling us with his moves
both good and bad
and what he did was he decided to answer
the call to help
floor i'm sorry to ans answer the call
for uh texas and arizona
who both need some help on their borders
because of the influx
of people coming over the border and
so ron desantis just went national
he used florida resources and i think
it's mostly a personnel thing he's going
to
let them borrow some personnel and
i don't know how much extra personnel of
this type
florida has but it looks like they
haven't cut their police budget
so they they had something to spare now
who knows how much it is right
it's a state it's not the government
it's not the federal government so who
knows how much
he can share with them but he's making
an announcement he's making news
and he looks like a national leader
and so he he did something i don't know
can you think of the last time a
governor
did something that was clearly a
national thing
because their job doesn't really let
them do that you have to be pretty
clever
to figure out how to be a national
leader when you're when you're just a
governor
just the governor i mean it's pretty
important state
so i would say whoever is advising him
or maybe maybe these are his own ideas
but
in either case he hired the advisor and
decided what
what advice to take so you have to give
him credit and
and criticism if things don't work um
he's just killing it i mean it's it's
actually
it's starting to become actually
humorous
because descent is making uh
leadership look like it's easy
right he's making it look easy and we
know it's not
because if we're easy everybody be doing
it right but i swear to god
making it look easy and so star
helm says he's a brilliant guy on his
own i would say based on
based on just what we're observing it's
pretty darn brilliant
i would have to say and by the way i
would say this if you were a democrat
the way he's playing the politics of it
separate from
you know are these good ideas etc it's
just brilliant
and i don't think you can overlook that
he's really
he's just killing it and there's a he's
even doing things on such a regular
basis
that you can't quite get them out of
your head you know you wait a few days
boom just dentist does something wait a
few days boom desantis does something
who else is doing something
lyra long says trump is advising him
well
i don't know because trump is probably
competing with him for the primaries
don't you think
so i don't know how much advising he's
doing unless
unless they maybe have talked about uh
desantis being a vice president
maybe i mean he's young enough that he
could make the leap to present
after being vice president so maybe
maybe that's in the offing but
i would think desantis would like to
jump directly to the top job
i mean would so
biden continues to amuse and
he said that he gave putin a list of
16 critical infrastructures that he
doesn't want russia to hack
now let me tell you when i heard that
i had so many jokes that just rushed
into my head
that i was paralyzed i tried to write
one down
but there were so many other jokes that
were just like burying it i was like oh
no no no i gotta no no no
no no no no and i turned into like this
monkey in a room full of bananas and i'm
like ah it's an embarrassment of riches
but um i did manage to make a joke out
of it
with the robots read news my alternative
comic if you've seen it
and the robot and robots read news
talks about biden giving putin 16
infrastructure
targets and the robot said that experts
expect biden to give putin a list of
cities we don't want nuked
as sort of a follow-up bad news portland
didn't make the list you didn't make the
list
now here is your uh humor writing
tip for the day somebody on
twitter said hey i beat you to it and i
said something similar about
detroit now which is funnier
okay you ready so in the comments and i
know you're biased toward me or you
wouldn't be watching this
but try to be unbiased right i won't
won't
hurt my feelings what is funnier
detroit or portland go
i'm looking at the comments i'll read
them out so i'm saying portland for sure
portland portland portland by a mile
portland portland portland san francisco
portland portland portland portland
all right so we we might all be biased
here no one's more biased than i am on
this particular point
but the point is that there are words
that are funnier and it's not just that
the word
portland is funnier uh
at least it sounds funnier to my ear but
because it's more recent
and it's silly and it's a place that
should have been a
a successful uh city but turned to crap
recently
so you got that recency stuff detroit's
kind of an
old story so it doesn't have that
that recency thing to get a little extra
juice
so portland was the right answer all
right i'm going to give you a little
quiz here are you ready
i'm going to read a tweet and you have
to guess
which news organization or wrote this
tweet
okay you ready so i won't tell you the
news organization you have to guess it
here it is the tweet said
after five months focused almost
exclusively on
pressing domestic concerns it was
evident that nearly every stop
during biden's travels across europe
that the president was at last in his
comfort zone
on his first international trip
what network
oh you all got it right cnn cnn
now maybe some of you saw it on twitter
but uh it was sort of easy to guess
wasn't it
now if you can guess which network
wrote the tweet with just the context of
the tweet
there's something wrong with our news
because if it weren't
news you wouldn't be able to tell
right it's the fact that it's propaganda
it's obvious if we're news it would
sound like
i didn't took his first overseas trip
and talked to putin
i was new but whatever this
is has not even tried to trying to be
news
so cnn has become a parody
of itself really and it just continues
getting funnier
so as you know biden did not cover
america in glory
at the g7 and especially with his
conversations
with putin not much happened there
um but i have to ask you this question
because i saw a meme that was very funny
showing putin
being large and biden being old and in a
chair
um basically picked from the the meme
that showed
uh remember the the carters jamie carter
and
and his wife and they looked tiny in a
picture and somebody else looked big who
was in the picture i forget
doesn't matter but they they used that
meme and it was you know putin was big
and then
biden was a little guy in the chair and
i saw that and i thought to myself
that's too far isn't it
it was very funny you know i i don't
begrudge anybody from
doing mean but just from my personal
taste
it feels too far um
oh yes right it was it was biden with
the carters thank you
and here's why it feels too far because
that's the power of
the visual image have i
criticized biden when he was meeting
with international leaders
yes i have do i feel comfortable with
that
well you know should you ever criticize
your president
when your president is doing a foreign
trip
it's a little bit on the edge wouldn't
you say
you know and i'm kind of in that weird
gray area i'm not cnn but i'm also not a
you know just an individual because i do
this
so i have a platform and so i've got a
little higher
standard for good behavior right that i
impose on myself
because i think it's just reasonable and
i ask you this
at what point is mocking your own leader
in the context of something like a cold
war
not exactly but you know what i mean and
what
at what point do you go too far and
i guess my you know my limit was the
the visual the meme because the meme
didn't have
a reason right when i'm criticizing
biden i say
this is what he did yeah and it's pretty
obvious what i'm criticizing i'm
criticizing this specific behavior for
example or
or something about you know he said
wrong something like that
but a meme doesn't have any of that a
meme is just
demeaning and if you're demeaning your
own president
and promoting putin
and you're using a visual element which
is you know just
more sticky than anything that's
conceptual
it feels too far so i i saw it and i
laughed and i appreciated it
but i couldn't retweet it and i don't
think i would necessarily
try to impose that standard on anybody
else but you have to ask yourself that
question
you know we do have a president who
frankly everybody is
aware that as he's at a certain age
and we all expect some hiccups because
of his age it would be
it would be naive to think there
wouldn't be any even democrats have to
expect that
so it's fair to call that out it matters
but just just think about it think about
think about when you've gone too far on
that
ken says dementia say it scott
well i can't give him a medical
diagnosis
but if i did uh i might think there's a
little that going on
so did you see the news clip of biden
angrily ripping into
cnn's caitlyn collins because she asked
him a question
and said why did why was he confident
that he could get putin to do whatever
it is
that he wanted him to do and biden gets
all angry and he says
uh basically he accused her of putting
words in his mouth because he had never
used the word confident
which he was quite strident in pointing
out i never used that word
look what you're doing blah blah blah
and it reminded me of something maybe
you can help me
because it's reminding me of something
and uh what is it like when
cnn makes up something
and assigns it to you as if you said it
what's that called it's uh it starts
with an
f right like if
fake news fake news fake news yeah
so biden is actually accusing
cnn of fake news
and i feel as if biden's
this close to turning orange and
demanding a border wall
just saying just wait a few more days
and the
transition of biden into trump
may be complete giving him a give
another 90 days for the full transition
you all remember hawk newsom famously of
new york city uh black lives matter
and i blocked him a while ago and
he tweeted he tweeted when he saw that
the biden administration has said that
white supremacy is the biggest domestic
coax
hawk tweeted at me and he said in a
tweet
where he tweeted at the world but
included me he said
when i said this two years ago scott
adams blocked me i demand an apology
in other words uh he believes that i
said
that white supremacy was uh not the big
problem and that that's why i blocked
him
but i did not block him for that reason
the the question of whether white
supremacy is the big problem
is worthy of discussion and people can
disagree but that's not why i blocked
them
i blocked him for being a racist and for
saying that white people were the
problem
not white supremacists did he think i
was
supporting white supremacists no i
blocked them
because he said white people were bad
not weaponists
white people now i don't think i
remember her wrong
i believe he said something right on
point with what i just described
um he might see it differently so you
know be aware that
there's some subjectivity in this this
account and you're hearing
you're hearing my version of it so to be
fair you should hear his version of it
too
but here's here's the thing uh
about his data
one way to look at um the future
of uh terrorism is that
there's a lot of rumbling and you know
it looks like the the white supremacists
are are making a lot of noise and so i
guess the government has decided that
based on you know recent tragedies
plus the noise that they're making if
you put those two together
and apply a little law enforcement logic
that it tells you that white
supremacists and that kind of thinking
is the main driver of future
domestic terrorism okay
you know when when experts tell you
something like that
it doesn't mean they're wrong but it
also doesn't mean they're right
let me ask you this what have they been
right about before
when predicting the future now
it doesn't count that you might say well
defunding the police caused a rise in
crime
because everybody saw that one right you
didn't need an expert for that
but if you're experts predict
a specific thing will be the big problem
in the future
how often do they write how many times
have they gotten it right
did they see 911 coming
right so you're talking about a group of
people who have
no ability to predict certainly not any
better than you do
which would basically be guessing so the
first thing about the data is
it's coming from a group of people who
don't have any track record of being
good at predicting
things that sort of come out of nowhere
right
and if they're so deeply embedded into
the
i guess the militias and various white
supremacist groups because you know
they've
they've penetrated all of them right at
least electronically
so they they either have human assets or
they have complete
you know digital control of their little
white supremacist world um
how much trouble can they cause
it's probably the most deeply penetrated
you know uh terrorist group of all time
i'll bet there isn't one uh substantial
of white supremacists or anybody who has
that kind of ideology
i'll bet there's not one of them that
doesn't have an fbi
asset and digital complete digital
penetration
so i would think if i were if i were to
guess
i would say the fbi is going to do a
hell of a good job of tamping down
things there
because they're just all up in their
underpants so it just feels like
stopping al-qaeda is hard
it's hard to get an fbi informant in
al-qaeda
but all over the place domestically
because you can fit in
and you can get their digital signals
and everything else
so that's the first point here's the
second point
we think that data is objective
right here is the data well now you have
the facts
data equals facts but i feel like in
2021
you should be on to that you should
realize that the way things are framed
is what matters and because the data you
collect
is the dado that will populate the frame
you've chosen
so if you choose the wrong frame you can
populate it with accurate data but it
won't help you because you got the wrong
way of looking at the world
here's another way of looking at this
white supremacist
problem and i tweeted back to uh
to hawk about this by the way uh i like
hawke
you know as as a human being because i
interacted with him a number of times
as a human being he's delightful like i
could hang out with him he's a
he's a fun guy he's very substantial uh
i think he's
very serious about you know making the
world better um
etc uh but we do disagree
on on on some stuff so i tweeted back at
him and i
and i said but about your data
i said black violence is mostly a
teachers union and economic
opportunity problem played out
white racist violence is mostly a mental
health problem
played out that's my frame
that instead of saying hey black people
shoot a lot of black people
or black people shoot a lot of white
people how does that help you
so like and then what
you you hire uh the the extra special
black police to stop the black crime
what did you get from that
it's it's a frame that doesn't help so
if you put good data
into a bad frame what the hell are you
going to do with it
well not no policy is going to come out
of that that's that's useful
but suppose you said black violence
is driven by a certain economic you know
situation
and that economic situation is primarily
perpetuated by bad
schools because if every black kid had a
chance for a
quality education nothing would look the
same
it just wouldn't look the same right so
if we treat black violence as is root
cause
the teachers unions then you know
exactly what to do
problem solution let's work on this
tissues union
blockade of competition in schools
because that's why they're so bad
there's no competition
suppose you took white supremacy
and say to yourself instead of a racism
problem
it's a mental health problem because it
is
right you know you could you could be at
least in terms of
how we judge these things you could have
good mental health
and be racist unfortunately you know
it's
so common that you'd have to say it's in
the norm
but by the time you pick up a weapon and
decide to kill a bunch of people over it
that's not racism not really
that's mental health that just has
racism as a trigger
and how would you treat things if you
said it's a mental health problem
well you maybe you would put more assets
into mental health
maybe you'd find the people who are
loners who have no friends
maybe you'd maybe you'd make sure that
nobody spends too much time alone
do you think that many of the the people
who became mass shooters do you think
they spent a lot of time around people
friends let's say friends they might
have a few
might have a family member or two but i
don't feel like they had a lot of
friends contact right now i'm not sure
that's the solution but what i'm saying
is if you
define it as a mental health problem you
still have to do all the fbi law
law enforcement stuff of course but
you'd go at it differently that's all
i'm saying
so hawks framing that there's something
like a
white people problem with violence is no
more useful
than saying there's a black a black uh
citizen
violence problem they might both be true
right does it matter because it doesn't
help you
it just makes things worse pick a frame
that's useful and then the data might
might help you rasmussen has a
poll on criteria's theory asking people
if they thought
race relations would be better or worse
if critical race theory is taught in
schools
how do you think that came out well of
course it lined up as you might expect
by a political party
but the sum of it is that uh
24 said it would make things better
that's right only 24
of likely voters including all parties
you know including independents
only 24 of them think it would make
things better
43 say you would make things worse and
17
it would wouldn't make much difference
which also tells you not to do it
right because you don't want to put time
and resources into something that
doesn't make a difference
so if you add together the ones who say
it's worse and the ones that say it's
not much difference and presumably they
would all want it not to happen
you get uh sixty percent
saying don't do it why are we doing
things where
sixty percent of the public including
all the parties
sixty percent of the public say it's the
the worst thing ever or they don't say
it's the worst thing ever but 60
of the public say don't do it basically
yeah in effect they say that
now when i look at a poll like this i
don't care too much
about what republicans said versus what
democrats said
because they're so predictably you know
on their sides
that that the only people who matter in
terms of finding out where things are
going or how things might lean
are the independents right the people
who are not aligned with either party
uh or the moderates let's say the
moderates
that are between the the extremes and
the moderates say
uh only 20 of them think it would be
better
for race relations 33 say worse and 27
say no difference so you get a uh
exactly the same
uh 60 percent of the moderates say
it it's either worse or doesn't help
which is
also don't do it
i don't know if i've seen can you think
of an example
where something was this unpopular and
also
pretty well understood know i guess you
could argue that
the public doesn't know exactly what
critical race theory is all about
and i'm in that category as well i mean
i haven't looked at the details of the
syllabus or anything
but i think we know the basic idea right
that it's
framing things as a race and white
people are
you know the the the enemy in this in
this framing
i think we know that uh so when you have
an issue that people sort of understand
as opposed to like
trade deals we don't understand that
stuff right the economy
we don't really understand that stuff
how does that work i'm not so sure when
it's a
a country because it's not like a
personal debt
so there's a lot of political things
where
the public doesn't even understand the
concept of what's going on
so their opinions are just meaningless
you know political
jibber-jabber but what happens when
people do understand the topic
and 60 of them are against it
um rustic says scott is playing dumb on
critical race theory no i am dumb
i'm not i'm not being modest i have not
looked into the details
but i understand the big point right
that it
frames things on racial grounds and
that's all you need to know about it
i i don't need to dig deeper to know
this is a um
a toxic idea
so anyway uh i can't think if you can
think of a
any example where something this
unpopular
uh and this well understood
somebody says the border you might
yeah that might be right is it about the
same um
yeah about the same number of people
want the border to be more controlled
right
voter id it's a good example you know
what i'd love to see
maybe rasmussen can pull this together
i'd love to see
uh the list of of things where the
the government's policy opposes the will
of 60
or more of the public or maybe let's say
50
how often does that happen because i'm
okay with it
when the government is overriding
stupidity
oh marijuana might be another example
you're right this is good examples
prohibition is you know ancient history
all um
here's my take on masks
i understand there are some people who
turn off this this live stream the
moment i mentioned
the pandemic um i'm not gonna change
that
because it's sort of the biggest thing
happening and
and it has all kinds of meaty stories so
um i i saw the feedback but no that's
not gonna change
here's my take as you know i thought
masks were certainly a good risk reward
thing
to try out early in the pandemic
didn't mean masks should be worn when
you're jogging i just thought
there are places that make sense places
it doesn't make sense
etc and we're at the end of the pandemic
people are vaccinated and this would be
the time to get rid of the masks
at least in in america
and so i've suggested that uh july 4th
will be the last time i wear a mask
and if somebody uh no i real i realize
that the government has
the california governor has said that
you know masks are not required but
still businesses
require them in some cases and so my
take is that i'm not going to frequent
any business that requires a mask
after july 4th so i think it's good to
just pick a date
because then that just adds a little
clarity to a point
uh that's the main reason to do it and
you know it's symbolic because it's
independence day
now i get it lots of you have already
thrown away your masks
lots of you are already on that side and
depending on the state you're in
that certainly makes sense that you're
already ahead of it ahead of
everybody but in california we're sort
of
laggards in the in the opening up and
um i i give my government actually
pretty much
leeway like to be wrong because
it's a lot of guessing involved and some
of it's going to be wrong
they're going to be mistakes people are
going to die it's like any war
right you could have the best general in
the world but people are going to die
and they're going to make mistakes so
i'm kind of
i'm an easy grader on the governments
and i told you i would be at the
beginning of the pandemic
i told you many times over a year ago
that after we were done with this i was
going to be grading our government
all the governments easily because they
were guessing
they were doing the best they could
everybody had experts advising them
mistakes were made they're not bad
people necessarily
governor cuomo maybe a special case
because of the
nursing homes but even that probably had
some
you know mitigating circumstances if you
dug into it
i doubt there was anybody in new york
who was quite aware
of what they were doing like there had
to be something there about the
bureaucracy or something
so there was a horrible mistake but i
don't think we know exactly the nature
of the mistake
like it wasn't just a communication or
bureaucracy
it could have been a lot of things
anyway um
and so july 4th i think is generous
because as as you're already thinking
well why are you waiting so long right
and i am giving them a nice
a nice generous kind of cushion
but after july 4th i'm done
i'm done so uh
you may have noticed that when i tweeted
that
uh a cult leader named andrew tate
who came after me on on twitter for
changing my mask view
and in his view i went from a dumb
dumb guy who thought masks would help to
an enlightened person
who agrees with what andrew tate
apparently has thought since the
beginning that
that masks were a bad idea
and of course nothing like that happened
right
so uh he was just wrong and we're at
that
point in the pandemic where people will
be misinterpreting
or misremembering what opinions i have
expressed
and then viciously attacking me for
their imaginary opinion of what i said
that i'd never said
now let me ask you this did i ever
change my opinion
because i feel like my opinion was
always masks are a good idea in
in situations where it's obvious they're
a good idea
and it's not a good idea for say taking
a walk in the woods by yourself
[Laughter]
have i ever been inconsistent about that
i've always said
there's a place that they make sense and
then a whole bunch of places where they
probably don't
and i'm saying now that conditions have
changed and we're
achieving a situation where it doesn't
make sense
completely consistent you just look at
the risk reward
as you move and adjust accordingly based
on facts and
changes and things but according to this
cult leader
who has a manly man cult that involves
smoking cigars and bragging
and saying manly things and he and his
supporters i think there are some of
them here
uh came at me today uh
saying that i was a coward a coward
and that i was justifying my cowardice
with all of my you know talking and
stuff
to which i say what the hell is wrong
with you
since when is doing a risk management
assessment
and acting according to risk management
you know data
as best you can surmise when we're not
all right about the risks
but when did that become cowardice
when did it become really manly
to do things that could get you killed
with no particular benefit
when did it become more manly to ignore
a risk which could be completely
eliminated
without you know killing you
so anyway the the uh the cult came after
me
and a lot of uh i i think this is
another example
and see how many times you see this when
somebody says
that they're they were in favor of masks
or that masks
work what do the critics say
do they say sometimes they say oh i saw
some studies that say they don't work
but why is it that every major
medical group in every industrial
country hasn't seen what you've seen
because all the people who really know
this field and are in it and the experts
everywhere the whole world every country
so the politics is different everywhere
but all of them said masks are a good
idea
right so
or at least that they would have an
effect now in case in the case let's say
sweden
they may have thought well it might make
a difference but not enough for
for us given all all things considered
which is a different decision
but i think that people conflate it with
the lockdowns
now help help me with my own memory will
you
tell me in the comments what you believe
my opinion has been since the beginning
about the value of lockdowns
tell me what you thought just from your
memory of what i said
what do you think what do you think i
said about lockdowns
uh because i think we're gonna we're
gonna see
um you said i said they were necessary
for time
probably don't work i'm just reading
your comments you honored it
overreaction flattens the curve
necessary at first
don't work not good good in the
beginning
yeah i think most of you are pretty
close right so you've been paying
attention
which is in the fog of war
when it was originally going to be
something like a few weeks
i thought well maybe right
how could social distancing not work i
mean it seems like
it was worth a shot but i think we
fairly quickly reached a point
where it wasn't flattening the curve but
it was killing us
it was flattening our economy and then
that was different
so and of course i was never against
businesses operating outdoors or
or having some kind of mitigation one
person in the store at a time whatever
but not lockdowns so i think when people
uh criticize me about masks and say
masks don't work
they're usually saying lockdowns didn't
work but they're
conflating it with masks that that feels
like what happens every time i get into
this conversation
so look for that
so in censorship news
you've heard the story you know brett
weinstein was talking to a doctor
who was saying some positive things
about ivormectin
which has caused brett weinstein's dark
horse podcast to get
two strikes so far and one more strike
and he's off the platform
and there goes his family income
so stakes are high right um
and when i saw that i thought to myself
what
what kind of terms of service did he
violate
i mean just i'm just thinking of it sort
of as a logical person
without knowing the details of the terms
of service i thought
well what rule do you violate by just
talking to a medical expert who has an
opinion
that's very different from the
mainstream
isn't that almost the purpose of
communication
the purpose of communication is not just
to give the standard view the purpose of
communication is to give the
non-standard view
and make it compete with the standard
view right that's the whole point
is is there anything that social media
should be doing
that's more important than what i just
said show us the standard view
now show us the competition and let them
fight it out
now when the the new one loses let's see
another one
fight it out okay the standard keeps
winning show us another one all right
fight it out
ooh oh this time the the new one's a
little bit stronger
didn't see that coming right now the the
standard one maybe drops away
that's how all progress is made if you
get rid of the
the non-standard opinion civilization
just stops
nothing happens it's it's the the
problematic
conversation that's the only thing that
can drive you forward
the non-standard stuff so i asked
andre's backhouse we i just we had a
exchange privately on twitter
and i was just questioning what terms of
service
could possibly be broad enough
to cover this this description of a
doctor
promoting a a therapy
that is not mainstream like what how
could that be
i mean these are serious people right
brett weinstein
you know he didn't just like walk out of
the pumpkin patch right
he's got some serious academic
credentials and he was talking to
somebody
who was an expert in the field yeah it's
not like
it's not like crazy people right so uh
andres sends me the terms of service
you know just a screenshot of the terms
of service and
i swear to god i did not know this
it specifically blocks ivermectin
conversation
specifically i thought it was going to
be something general
like don't say things that will get
people hurt or
you know don't don't promote a cure
that'll
kill somebody okay but
it's actually named by name
you know don't promote ivermectin you'll
be kicked off the platform
so here's my thought uh experiment
suppose someday and i it's my
understanding andres
said this that there are at least two uh
are um high quality studies in the
pipeline
for ivermectin what would happen
and this is just a hypothetical what
would happen
if they showed it worked
you couldn't say that on youtube
because the world health organization
presumably would
would not immediately change things they
might look at it and they might change
things eventually
but between the time that a study came
out
and the time that you know the
organizations that control our medical
knowledge
decided to bless it would you get kicked
off the platform
because that's what the terms of service
say they say even if this
our you know high quality study comes
out
until the world health organization says
yes
you're out of luck you're off the
platform so
um this is uh pretty chilling
you know i i felt a whole different
level of
badness when i saw it was called that
one specifically
yeah and i see what you're saying the
world health organization presumably
in the pocket of china what would happen
if a cheap therapeutic doesn't matter
what it is
turned out to just be a killer therapy
according to a really high quality study
do you think that the world health
organization would say well there you go
okay we favor that now
or would it depend what china wanted
them to do
and china might not want everybody else
to think there's a cheap therapy
although they might use it themselves
but they might not want everybody else
to use it
so these are some big questions
will there be a moment when a critical
mass of democrats
come out in favor of free speech could
jon stewart help break the dam
yeah you also the jon stewart joking
about the
the fact that the wuhan lab actually the
name of it is something like the
coronavirus
study lab and one of the odds that uh
that it wasn't from that lab and really
came from a back kissing a turtle
as as john stewart quite cleverly said
well i don't think he can move the uh
the needle that much
but he's definitely a big contributor
and uh he made you it made me miss him
right i mean we could use more jon
stewart
um
how does this end this well
it's a good question how does it end you
know
the locals platform that um
that i'm on and i'm a small investor in
it as well
and it's a subscription service and all
of the things that
i can't say here i can say on there
so that's one way it might end it might
end with more subscription services
because when you've got that going you
can you can just do more
how do you convert someone from their
current religion
i'm asked um i've thought about that a
lot
i'm not sure it's a good idea though
unless you're talking about let's say
extremists who are going to kill you
here's how i would approach it
let's say let's imagine it's ethical
it's not but if you're just going to
talk about what would work
you know we'll talk about the tool the
ethics of it completely unethical
which is changing somebody's religion
just because you can
i would start with a uh if you get
people to
pay attention uh a lesson about world
religions
so that they can see that there are lots
of religions and they they have a
commonality to them
yet they're all different and people
believe them just as strongly as
you know everybody believes them because
until you see that everybody can believe
anything
anybody can believe anything until you
know that
you can't really get over the the fact
that maybe yours isn't the real one
so you have to understand that even if
your religion is right
how do you explain
75 of the world or whatever depending on
which religion is yours
how do you explain 75 of the world
looking at the same information you are
but getting a different answer
it should give you a little bit of
humility all right but that's not enough
to change into his mind
so you'd have to do a lot of work to
explain how religions uh
occur and how people believe them
and how easily people believe things
that aren't true
so i think you'd have to start with a
whole education
about how people believe things that
aren't true and
that would probably go a long way but
like i said i'm pro-religion i'm not a
i'm not a believer myself but i'm very
pro-religion
and i think it clearly has utility and
helps and people get benefit from it
makes people you know have some purpose
in their life
gives them sort of a program of what to
do
it has all kinds of good stuff you meet
people it's a social thing
etc
yes you can see into my bathroom from
here
uh you believe the simulation somebody
says i do
conversion is a capital offense yeah you
don't want to be converting anybody from
islam
that would be kind of a dangerous thing
that's a death sentence
depending where you are of course
um
any developments in housing and the tiny
house story
well i don't like the way you ask that
question because it assumes that an
inexpensive house would be tiny
and i uh resist that vigorously
i think you should i think we have the
ability to make very low-cost housing
that's as good as high quality it's as
good as any other housing
all right and so i have to tell you
one story about the the service here at
the hotel
so the service is tremendous it's like
it's so good
that it's actually almost funny but
i think i told you this story how um i
we have a butler
assigned just to us he probably has some
other
people he works for but uh he just seems
to appear
weirdly like
even when we're not calling him right
now that they have this cool system
where
there's an iphone that they leave in the
room and you just you just text the
butler using their iphone
and he gets back to you in like you know
30 seconds
and does pretty much anything you need
him to do and so it's amazing
it's like it's just the best experience
but
he has this weird way of showing up
exactly where he needs to be
so i went to the lobby yesterday and i
was just i was there
so instead of asking the butler which
would normally be the single point of
contact
i'm standing by the lobby so i
ask a question and i swear to god this
happened
the woman stands up and there's a wall
that's just sort of a decorative wall
but there was a fake door
built into the wall she opens the fake
door
and the butler walked down
what this was in the lobby it wasn't
like
my room or it wasn't where the butler
lives i don't think
he was behind that false door today
uh i went for a walk and then uh wanted
to grab some
food at the little little
place you get food what would you call a
little bar area that they sort of food
by the pool and
so you know this is like the one time
that i'm not going through
the butler to order food and i'm like
well i guess i'm talking to
other people now so the server comes
over and i'm like
can i have the menu i want to like to
order some food
she turns around and the butler walked
down to the kitchen
he was there now i randomly picked a
place to eat
just randomly it's like oh this is open
i think i'll go over there and the
butler was there
how i don't know but
uh damn they have good service here
that was that was the butler just
confirming something for me
yeah maybe i'm being tracked
okay what time is it oh i've gotta run
shoot talk to
