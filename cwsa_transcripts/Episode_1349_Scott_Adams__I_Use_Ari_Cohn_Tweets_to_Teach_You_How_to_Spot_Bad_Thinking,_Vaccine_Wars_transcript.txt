[Applause]
hey everybody
good morning all of you
it's great to see you
you know i have to say
that although i do monetize my channel
i'm pretty sure i wouldn't do it if i
didn't enjoy it
i'm sort of at that point in my life
where i don't really have to do anything
if i don't want to
and
i look forward to this
every day it's actually it literally
if you don't count the time i spend with
my wife
this is the best thing i do all day
i actually enjoy this more than anything
else i that i've done for a long time
but if you'd like to enjoy it to your
maximum ability all you need is a copper
margarita glass a tank or gels or
steiner canteen drug a flask of vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid i like coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day the
thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and if
you haven't tried it oh i feel sorry for
you today's the day go
well i'd like to start with the good
news
the good news is
america has achieved
air superiority
on mars
oh yeah
on mars
so we actually we i'm taking credit for
anything that america does right well we
just put a uh drone on mars the drone's
been there but they did a test flight
short test flight and
for the first time in the history of the
universe
human beings flew a spacecraft
in the atmosphere of mars
now do you think it's a big deal
that america is first to get air
superiority i mean not really but we're
heading in that direction where we would
control the skies
over mars
it's probably a big deal
whoever has control of
you know
of the airspace and mars
someday 50 years 75 years from now
whenever it really comes to matter
uh it's going to matter a lot it's going
to matter a lot so i think we're
this is probably one of the most if you
had this plus what you know elon musk
is doing these are the most important
things
for the future of the country
if you're looking at the the 50-year
mark it's not climate change
as big a deal as climate change is or is
not
controlling space
and being dominant in space in the long
run
is everything because whoever controls
that will control the wealth because
there are trillions of dollars of you
know rare rare minerals up there and
asteroids and stuff but whoever has the
the superior airspace just controls the
ground
if we don't give if we don't get a 50
year head start on that it's gonna be
trouble
china's gonna own space all right but
we're doing a good job on that so good
work
uh american
technology people
rasmussen will be reporting a little
later this morning
that 48 of likely voters say withdrawing
u.s troops from afghanistan is a good
idea
how would we know
how does the public know anything about
whether it's a good idea to remove
troops from afghanistan
now i certainly favor it
so if you ask me you know what do i
think we should do i say yes
let's let's get rid of our troops but
how confident
am i that that's the right decision
and what would i base that on
do i base that on all my secret intel
about what the taliban are up to
i don't really have any secret
stuff so you end up defaulting to really
a
a reasonable but
knowledge free opinion
because if you don't really know what's
going on over there and how many of us
do really do you understand what is the
current feeling of pakistan's leadership
about the taliban and you know is the
taliban changed over time any of that we
don't know any of that
but i think it's a fairly good rule
that if you can't articulate a good
reason for being there
you kind of have to get out
right
so we can't articulate anymore any
reason to be there at least not one that
seems convincing so yes i i would say
that america is
um wise to do this and i do give biden
credit
i would have given trump credit he would
have done the same thing i think
um so yeah
good job um biden getting us out of
there and by the way maybe it takes
joe biden to get this done right
have i told you a million times that
there's no such thing as a good
president
and there's no such thing as a bad
president
there are only presidents who are
suited
for the challenges that happen to be
going on at the moment
so a good war president would be useless
during peace time and vice versa
so
it could be that just because biden is
less controversial
that he could get the last of the troops
out a little bit easier than trump could
because it's just automatic
you know automatic against him for that
so it's possible biden was exactly the
right person for this specific task
don't know
um in the same way that i believe trump
was exactly the right president
for the middle east for north korea
just certain people fit in certain
situations
um chris cuomo
uh
i don't know why it's so fun to talk
about chris cuomo there's something
about him
where he projects maximum sincerity
while a lot of observers are
observing minimum sincerity
so
there's something about the disconnect
between the sincerity that he projects
i mean it looks real on screen
if he were just to judge
you know how he operates in his job
he's good at his job i think he's very
good at his job actually that's why he
still has his job
but
uh
there is something that triggers people
about him i i get it and i know what it
is but i can't put my finger on it
uh but he said that the only way there
will be fewer police shootings
of the or police killings of the
uh chauvin floyd kind i suppose that's
what we're talking about
uh even though that wasn't a shooting
uh he says it only will happen when
white people
when more white people are killed by
police
so chris cuomo thinks that more white
people killed by police would get white
people more interested
in solving this problem
well as many people pointed out twice as
many white people are killed by police
but not at but it's a smaller percentage
of the population so fewer as a
percentage of white people get shot
but twice as many of them
so i'm not sure that the data is going
to give us a solution to this
but i would like to point out this
i've never met a white person who's
celebrated
a criminal
who resisted arrest and got killed by
police
have you
i mean maybe there is one but i can't
think of one is there any case you've
ever heard of in which white people
rallied around the victim
when the victim caused his own demise
by resisting rest
do you know what i say about white
people who get killed by the police
resisting rest
good for police
all right
is does anybody even disagree with that
is it is there anybody here who
identifies as white
who says
who says we really want to celebrate the
victim the person who caused the problem
in the first place
i don't think i've ever seen that in my
whole life
and so
as candace owens has wisely pointed out
trying to be helpful to the black
community and i genuinely think she's
trying to be helpful and says really
helpful things it's just hard to get the
message across
and the message is if you have bad
strategy
you're going to get a bad result
do you know what's a bad strategy listen
to candice owens she says it as clearly
as you can
it's a bad strategy
to try to you know
raise the situation for whatever group
of people you're talking about in this
case
black americans if you're trying to
improve their situation
don't make heroes out of criminals
that's never going to work
so you should adopt a strategy that you
observe working
and i observe
that white people of course nobody
everybody's different right when you say
white people it doesn't mean everybody's
acting the same same with every group
and i think you're smart enough to know
that i don't have to say it every time
but
i feel like it's just a better
strategy to demonize your criminals and
to celebrate your police who kill them
am i wrong
isn't that obviously a better strategy
for improving the lot of
whatever people you want to improve
i mean to me that's so
glaringly obvious that i'm surprised
anybody would disagree
well we have maxine waters going full
hypocrite and calling for more
protesting slash wink-wink violence
especially if the chauvin case has an
acquittal
now
of course uh
kevin mccarthy and other republicans ted
cruz etc lots of people
are quite rightly pushing back on maxine
waters and saying hey that's the same
thing you blamed president trump for
you said trump was getting people all
riled up to go protest and obviously it
turned into violence and therefore if
you're going to blame trump you're going
to have to blame yourself maxine waters
so
i don't know if there's ever been a
clearer case of bad behavior
than whatever it is that maxine waters
is doing right now
i think she needs to lose her job
if there's any way that congress can
can get rid of her because anybody who's
an elected official who's calling for
unrest
um
i feel like
maybe they're just not in the right job
right and
should she call for unrest and then
there is unrest and i guess there was a
you know a shooting like right after
that
i feel as if
the the phrase blood on your hands is
pretty pretty accurate in this case
now keep in mind that i'm being
consistent because i criticized
trump for not doing enough to stop the
stop the
rioting at the capitol
and i'm criticizing maxine waters for
effectively
you know blundering into the same space
so at least i'm being consistent
right i could be right or i could be
wrong but at least i'm on the same side
in both cases it doesn't matter what
your
what your
party is
but here's where this is heading
so take this story about maxween maxine
waters who says basically there's going
to be rioting
if chauvin is acquitted
if you're the jury
and you know that
acquitting
means you cause riots
does that affect your judgment
it should
right because you're a human being the
whole point of a a jury trial
is that the idea is that american
citizens can use their judgment
on top of the law
but it's always on top of the law
right
there's the law and we all revere it
but the reason it's humans who make the
final decisions is that we all agree
that we'd rather have a human make the
decision or a group of them who are
reasonable right
so
if i'm a reasonable human i am
definitely affected by the
the possibility that i could spark a
riot
by my decision in the trial
how would i not be affected by that i'd
have to be an idiot not to be affected
by that
so let's keep that in mind that's just
one thing
now apparently we heard that an expert
witness
for the defense
uh a place he used to live and people
thought he still lived there was
assaulted by people who put pig blood
and a pig's head
i guess on the porch or something so
some poor person who bought that house
became the victim of a mob and they had
nothing to do with anything
right they just found a dead pig head on
their on their porch and and pig blood
on their house which is pretty nasty now
again i don't know if the jury has a way
to hear
news do you can somebody tell me
uh what level of um
sequestering the jury is is experiencing
i keep looking for that i thought it
would be like an or maybe we don't know
that yet because they're not sequestered
or oh yeah they would have to be
sequestered already right
so somebody cleared me up on that i
don't have either the legal knowledge or
the background of the case
they're not sequestered somebody says
they go home
so
all right let's let's say that
uh
oh there was no sequestration until
today
it was denied sequestered over the
weekend people are telling me all right
so there's some some question about what
kind of
sequestering there is
but it seems to me as long as they have
electronic devices
it's not really a thing is it
do you think the courts are monitoring
their digital access
that's not a thing is it
can somebody tell me if that is a thing
because i don't think it is it seems
like that would be illegal
if so if the jurors have their digital
devices it doesn't matter where they are
that doesn't
how can you sequester somebody
unless you take away their access and
there's no way that would be legal it
couldn't possibly be legal
to take somebody's phone away from them
for
weeks couldn't it
or digital access
so
can we all agree that there's no such
thing as sequestering
in the modern world does anybody
disagree with that because i don't want
to make that assumption yet
but i'm going to let me start with this
i don't think there's any such thing as
keeping the information from the jury so
let's assume that whatever
sequestration
happens is porous and stuff is getting
through
that's fair right do are we all on the
same page that the jury definitely knows
what's going on
everybody i think we're on the same page
right
so
if you knew about the pig head
for the guy who was just an expert
he was just an expert doing his job
and he gets a pig head
and then maxweden waters is calling for
violence and then you're seeing all
manner of
you know suggestion that there would be
violence and threats
and how would you handle this if you
were the jury
what would you do
could you
vote to acquit him
i don't think you could
because if you're the jury and you vote
12 to nothing to equip let's say on all
charges very unlikely but let's say you
did
well that would cause violence
so one thing that's out of the question
if you want to avoid violence it's out
of the question
to acquit him of everything
it's just out of the question at least
three powerful lawyers who actually know
criminal defense
have said
in public out loud with no pushback
this case will probably not be decided
on the facts
or the law
it will probably be decided on
public opinion and influence and just
how we feel about the whole situation
maybe politics and all that stuff but
there's probably an eighty percent
chance that this cop is being tried for
being white and being a cop
do you hear that clearly
officer shofen
may or may not be guilty of crimes for
which he should be punished it's hard
for me to tell as a layperson
but separate from what he did or did not
do that would be illegal or illegal
that's not what the trial is about
according to lawyers this is not even my
own opinion this is people who know way
more than i do
they say
he's on trial for being a white cop
in 2021
and we're okay with that
are you okay with that
he's on trial for his race for
all practical purposes
like on paper
it's about a crime and there's a process
but in reality according to the people
no again this is not some some whack
idea i came up with on my own people who
understand this space like ellen
dershowitz types you know robert barnes
people really know this stuff
they say it's not going to be decided on
the facts
well what's left
if it's not going to be decided on the
facts
it's not going to be decided on the law
what the is left
his race
and his occupation
right so he's not exactly being tried
for big white he's not exactly being
tried for being a cop
but he is being tried for being a white
cop in in 2021 that's really what it's
about
and
we're just sitting here watching this
like that's okay it's not
it's not okay
it's not okay at all and of course can i
say that without a
bunch of idiots coming in and saying oh
well you're supporting a racist killer
of course not somebody will come in and
say scott how can you support a racist
killer i'm not
i'm supporting a system
which should
be giving all people a presumption of
innocence and a fair trial and nothing
like that's happening it's happening
right in front of us
we all see it
we all see it
and we're letting it happen right in
front of us
we should be ashamed
you should actually be ashamed
like really ashamed
that you're letting this happen right in
front of you with no
no push back at all
well here's an idea
from twitter user happy hannah
and she suggested this by tweet she said
the jury should vote guilty
and send a note to the judge explaining
that they are not following the law or
the facts
but protecting their families from a
violent mob
the judge should affirm the verdict and
say he's doing so only to protect
himself and his family from the mob
now
i don't quite buy into this exact
suggestion but i'm going to modify it a
little bit so i'm going to take this as
a
uh if you ever heard me use the phrase
the bad idea is always useful because it
suggests the good idea all right so i
would call this a really productive bad
idea
because it makes you think differently
and then maybe you can come up with a
good idea here's what i consider a good
idea if i were on this jury and none of
this is a joke
none of this is slightly hyperbole
this is literally absolutely
positively 100 percent what i would do
if i were on this jury
i would convince the rest of the jurors
that it wouldn't be hard
that we would vote guilty on all points
with no deliberation and we would
include a note that said we did it for
our own
our own safety
with no regard to the facts of the case
and i would give the judge and the
public you have to give it to the media
or else nobody knows you say yeah we we
voted guilty on all counts without
deliberation
and we did it to protect our families
there you go
and you know what i would add to the end
of the note
 you judge
 you
for putting us in this situation
 you judge
for risking our lives
for nothing
because at the end of this are we going
to have a trial which people trust
and a system that we pr we
value
no
it's going to be worse
the result of this
judge
is to make the system worse if if this
goes through to
some kind of a you know normal result
the system will be worse the credibility
of the system will be worse
there will be a tremendous
violation of justice
independent of whether chauvin did
something that should be punished not
even talking about that
i'm talking about the fact that if you
punish him for being a white cop in 2021
which is what's happening
you haven't even talked about whether
you're committed a crime
i'd like to talk about that right
we should all be talking about whether
that was a crime really important
but that's not what he's being tried for
in any practical sense so yes if i were
on that jury there's no way in hell that
i would let them
convict or not convict
in any
like normal way
i would tear the room apart before i let
that happen i mean mentally tear it
apart not physically
and
um
and i i could get the 11 other 11 jury's
jurors to go with that and by the way
how hard would it be
how hard would it be for me specifically
me
to convince 11 jurors
to to go with this plan
do you think i could do it
yeah of course i could yeah because
people will vote for their own
self-interest
and now i would just
reframe it and say forget about the
trial
the judge just absolutely you
and your family
if you want the judge
to you
and your family and you don't want to
protect your family do whatever the
you want
but it's not going to happen to me
so
you know
join the side of the people protecting
their families
and don't be part of a corrupt system
that makes everything worse right
they can retry this in a smarter way and
you can force them to do it
now keep in mind
it's about the system
right
it's so it's got to be about the system
you got to protect the system if it's a
good system
and i am so in favor of our laws being
decided by a jury of our peers
and i would hope that my peers the jury
in this trial
would
try to figure out what's right
not what the law says
because if the only thing they're
looking at is the law
first of all we don't believe it you
know we don't believe that that's what
they would do but they need to
they need to look at what's good for the
public and what's good for their
families and i support the jury for
walking out even
you know i i would even consider walking
out if you put me on that jury
the day that i heard that the expert
witness got a dead pig on this on his
porch
here here's what would happen
your honor for you know the court would
open up and i'd raise my hand and the
jury and the judge would say this isn't
the time for
talking to the jury and then i would say
well if you don't talk to me i'll be
leaving right now
because i can't be physically
constrained
so the judge is going to say okay okay
say what you need to say
and i would say look
people are already being attacked for
their opinions on this case today is my
last day
now what do we need to do to make this
civilized because today is my last day
as a juror
what would happen
that would be the end of the case
wouldn't it i mean maybe they replace me
but the next person should be smart and
say um
if he got away with that
and this guy just said i'm done today
and i'm going home i'm going to do it
too
i'm pretty sure i could take down the
whole trial
i don't think it would be hard
and it should happen
remember i told you yesterday that i was
a little bit suspicious this is not an
allegation
right so i don't want to get sued
so i'm making no allegations in this
next piece i'm simply saying
speculatively and
hypothetically and based on the things
you know from your own experience
do big companies
ever lie about their competition
to get an edge has that ever happened in
the real world
yes
yes big companies do lie about other
companies and sometimes you don't know
where that lie came from
because it might have worked its way
through the media
and then you think a reporter said
something bad about the competition
but it really came from the other
company who was trying to kill their
competition
now you get that that's the real world
right
and i suggested that maybe
and again this is not an accusation i'm
just saying we live in a world where you
have to consider this
that when the j and j
vaccination the one that was
if it did not have
dangerous side effects we don't know yet
but if it did not have it was clearly
the best one
because you only needed one of them and
it was based on the established
technology that we'd feel a little safer
with because we've used it before all
right
so
coincidentally
this news comes out about these exotic
blood clots that only affect the best
one
and i said what are the odds
that it legitimately the best one the
one you only need one of and standard
technology
and also i guess it's easy it's stable
so it's easier to ship and it's been
just better in every way
what are the odds that the best one is
the only one that had these exotic side
effects
and i said you have to at least be open
to the possibility
that there's something bad happening in
the background
some competitor or maybe even an
investor doesn't even have to be one of
the companies could be just an investor
trying to change things up get an
advantage
and if you thought to yourself when you
heard that i don't think big established
companies would do something like that
right and then big company wouldn't do
that would they
well here's the news today
apparently j j
has said in public
that the their competitors also have uh
blood clot problems
except that
there's no evidence of that
so j and j a big pharmaceutical company
just said in public
right with no ambiguity they said it in
public
that their competitors have these
these problems
that there is no data to support that
that actually exists
so if you're wondering
could it be that the competitors just
hypothetically i don't have any evidence
of this but could they
be the type of people
who would be in a situation to say
something bad and untrue
about j and j
well we just watched j and j say
something in public
clearly
untrue
bad about their competitors
so yes this happens
um
let me tell you my current thinking
about vaccines
if i can i'm going to hold out for the j
j vaccination
so the one that's getting the most heat
is the one i'm most interested in right
now because number one i don't trust the
criticisms i think they could be
economically motivated don't know
right there's no evidence of it let me
be clear i've seen no fact to support
that suspicion
it's just an industry in which this just
happens all the time and we're watching
it we're watching it right in front of
us happening right now
so you don't even have to wonder if it's
a thing it's happening
so
um if we get to the point where the j j
thing becomes uh back on the market even
if it's only for you know men because
maybe it's safer for men
we don't know yet
i i think i would take that one i feel
like that's the one i want if only
because it's one shot
and i think it doesn't knock you out
like the other ones do after the second
shot
all right here's an interesting story
and i don't know what to make of it yet
and i'm gonna i'm gonna hold my
opinion gavin newsom
is uh bragging and maybe he's right
maybe he's right now
context here i live in california i've
been fairly brutal in my
um
in my criticism of our governor
but if he did something right i would
like to call it out i just don't know so
let me run it by you
so um the reporting is that
the governor in the state of new york
used the pandemic
as an excuse
to do something really fast
for the homeless
and what they did
now and i know when you first hear this
this sounds like the worst idea you've
ever heard
so just
um
suspend your criticism until until i
finish
because when i get to the end it's going
to look like a better idea than when i
start because at the beginning it looks
like the dumbest idea you've ever heard
which is they bought up a bunch of
hotels
and moved all the the homeless people
into hotels now part of it was for covid
separation
but part of it was they wanted to
put the homeless somewhere
now
many of you are uh
more trained in understanding the news
than the general public how many of you
are thinking right now scott you're
solving the wrong problem with
california it's not a homeless problem
it's a mental health and addiction
problem and even if you give everybody a
home
they're not going to want to be in it
because they got mental health problems
or whatever and addictions and
who knows and they couldn't take care of
it and blah blah whatever you think
but
these are paired with the social
services
so you're putting a bunch of homeless
people in one place
and of course environments do affect
people
we're very programmed by the physical
environment so could people who are in
the worst situation mentally let's say
could they be helped by simply having a
cleaner safer physical environment i'd
say yes i mean if they could stay there
and
you know if they can work with it yes
it helps your uh it helps your mental
situation
but the real the real key to this is the
quality i think of these social services
that would be paired with the
facilities that have a lot of homeless
now i don't know how much this costs
you know it was like
pushing a billion dollars to buy the
hotels then how many billions is it
going to cost every year for the social
services et cetera
but
i'm going to suspend my criticism of
this
because when you add the fact that
they're adding the social services to
the
combining them in one place
you might have something
so i'm going to say let's find out
right
who is it who's uh
how did i get out of nexium
that's a strange question okay i was
never in it
let's find out let's find out if this
experiment works
i mean i'm skeptical
but let's find out if it works
if it does credit him if it doesn't well
not surprised
all right um
i made a tweet yesterday that caused a
little problem with uh one person in
particular
ari cohn
you might know him as a first amendment
and defamation lawyer that you see on
msnbc and i don't know cnn or wherever
i'm not sure he's on one of those
left leading networks
and i'll tell you the tweet i made i
talked about this yesterday and then
i'll tell you his
his response to it and see if we can
find the cognitive dissonance all right
now most of you if you've been following
me for a while
have been trained in
identifying fake news
and trained in critical thinking far
more than the average of the public
so i think you'll be able to spot this
pretty quickly all right so starting
with my
tweets so here's my tweet one way to
eliminate police shootings during
traffic stops
is to allow only and only is important
here
uber-like self-driving cars
and no other cars in urban areas
if a perp is
in one of those police can override its
controls
lock in the perp and make it drive to
police headquarters for safe handling
all right now first of all let me put on
your reading comprehension hats
alright right reading comprehension
forget about the quality of the ideas
there
reading comprehension
um
do both of these ideas because there's
sort of two ideas in there do they seem
similarly serious to you
so the first idea is that if you had
self-driving cars only
and they were not owned by individuals
rather they were owned by say an
uber-like company
that you would eliminate all traffic
stops and therefore no problems could
happen
because nobody would ever be stopped
there would never be a reason
to stop a car
in which the car's movement is
controlled by a company so you might
give a ticket to the company
but you would never have a reason to
stop an individual in a uber-like
self-driving car
so the first part of it is serious which
is self-driving cars are coming if you
did it right you could eliminate
a whole bunch of potential problems does
anybody disagree with that
now
you might disagree whether it ever be
practical to have self-driving cars
right i think if you got rid of the
other cars on the road it becomes a lot
easier
right it's only self-driving cars they
can be networked to each other
even if one goes bad the other cars will
know it because they're networked and
they would know to avoid it and stuff so
so i think it's inevitable
that there will be self-driving cars
it's not inevitable
that they'll be owned by one company and
network together but that's that's what
i'm saying could be a solution
all right so the first part of the tweet
i think is you should have taken it as
completely serious
saying that we have a
self-solving problem
the problem of police stops will solve
itself
if we did nothing it would just take 20
years or whatever it is and we could we
could probably accelerate that
the second part of the tweet
is that if a purpose is in one of those
self-driving cars the police can
override its controls lock in the perp
and make it drive to police headquarters
for safe handling
all right
reading comprehension
was that a serious
suggestion
in the comments
did you take that as a serious
suggestion or or tell me how you did
take it i won't leave the witness
tell me how your reading comprehension
took that now somebody said satire
no it's not a satire
but by nowhere you're basically trying
to say it's not serious but i wouldn't
use the word satire somebody says it's a
joke
well i wouldn't call it a joke
i would say it's whimsical
meaning that it is kind of funny
but that wasn't the purpose
so i didn't write it because i had a
good punchline
um
somebody said a thought experiment
you're getting close
all right i already primed you earlier
so i i wondered if the priming would
help
it's the bad idea
i just told you that
on another topic right and i've told you
a number of times
at these broadcasts
there's nothing more useful
than a creative bad idea
because the bad idea makes you think
well
but that won't work sure that's a bad
idea but what if you modified it a
little bit
are you ready
let's take the bad idea
and see if we can modify it so it
actually work
here's a modification
instead of driving it automatically to
the police
suppose
there's facial recognition
which it probably would be you get into
your your car and the car knows who you
are that knows you have a arrest warrant
and a little message comes on and says
you have two choices
you can go nowhere
or
you can drive to the police department
uh to a secure area that's got concrete
walls and the door closes behind you and
the police will just keep you in there
as long as you want
you'd like to stay in there a couple
days and not surrender that's okay just
stay there
we don't care it's completely safe you
can't get out
and there's concrete walls
so you could certainly wait until you
could get the person down safely
so there's certainly no possibility that
is more dangerous than a traffic stop if
if they drove to a secure place with
concrete walls and blah blah so the
first thing is don't assume it's being
implemented in the worst possible way
that's the dumbest way to read anything
is okay let's assume that the idea
has as a base assumption
that we'll implement it in the worst
possible way
there's no such thing as a good idea
that still works if you implement it in
the worst possible way
so how about assuming you don't do that
how about assuming that you work through
the problems
and you figure out what works and what
doesn't
so
certainly if you give the person the the
option of driving to the police uh and
and essentially uh surrendering
or it doesn't go anywhere
is that more dangerous
than our current situation
it feels like it's less dangerous right
and it's just a little bit of
modification
to the bad idea the bad idea is that the
car just takes you to the police station
whether you like it or not right that
would be the bad idea
but it's easy to take that and then
tweak it a little bit and say all right
well what if you just got one option
it's the only place it'll take you
otherwise you're gonna have to work out
your problems
all right but let's let's see how uh re
cone
uh dealt with this so after reading my
tweet this is what harry said
and keep in mind he's the lawyer
he says sure
what kind of legal problem could there
possibly be with an automatic arrest for
traffic stops if the cop feels like it
and then parenthetically
read you're not white
and then it goes on
but on a more fundamental level just
what kind of traffic stop are cops going
to be doing on self-driving cars
and then he ended by characterizing me
as and i quote
 dumb
well let's pull apart ari's uh
analysis
so first of all he says what kind of
legal problems could there be with an
automatic arrest for traffic stops
the idea is
there are no traffic stops
so ari's criticism of
huh how about we eliminate the
possibility of any traffic stops
because there wouldn't be any reason to
stop a self-driving car that was owned
by an uber-like company because who are
you going to give the ticket to
uber the programmer the person in the
car is completely innocent they didn't
have any choice
so ari first of all doesn't understand
that there would be no scenario in which
you would give a ticket
to the driver because there is no driver
of a self-driving car
all right so first of all complete lack
of understanding of a simple concept
and then he takes this to
the cops
and rereading this
what could possibly go wrong if the cops
arrest you because they feel like it
read
you're not white
to which i said
how did this become racial
what part of my idea
even suggested in any way
that it would be a racial component but
ari's problem is that the cops would be
sitting there with a remote control
and they'd see like white white people
go by in cars and remember every car is
obeying the law because they're
self-driving cars
none of them are breaking the law
but in ari's reading you the cop would
be sitting there
white driver good white driver white
driver white driver black driver bump
black driver got him
and then the car would be taken over by
the police but only the black drivers
because you know police are racist and
then they would make only the black
drivers drive to the police department
and surrender themselves now what would
they be surrendering for
well apparently no crime
they would be surrendering for being
black
in a self-driving car according to ari
cohn
that was his interpretation of where
this would go
ari you do understand
that the problem we're trying to fix
is that there's a concern that the
police are targeting people of color
that's the current situation
that's the part we're trying to not do
that's the part that goes away
that the police wouldn't have any reason
to target anybody they wouldn't even be
there
they wouldn't even have a reason
all right
and so that was his insightful uh
and and keep in mind that he
he capped it off by calling me
dumb
all right
um
so how was i going to respond to this
now keep in mind that uh yesterday i
told you before before anybody was even
blowing this up on twitter i told you
that i wasn't completely serious
or i said you shouldn't take me that too
seriously
the part about the car drives to the
police department
you heard that right yesterday i said
before any of this happened i said don't
take that part too seriously that's more
just a thought experiment right now
somebody pointed out and this is a good
point what if there's an armed person in
one of these cars and what if they try
to escape the car by shooting the window
out that'd be pretty bad for people
around there yeah that's a problem
yeah if you
if you actually forced the person not to
be able to get out of the car under any
circumstance and drove them to the
police department
that would be a problem
so just don't do that
just give them a choice of going to the
police department
or i can't go anywhere that's all and
you're done
now it wouldn't be more dangerous than
police stopping somebody who has a
at least who is
close to being able to pull a trigger
i mean you don't want the police to be
stopping them so it's better almost
anything is better than what's happening
now
all right but here's the trap suppose i
had responded to ari and saying ari
you're taking seriously part of a tweet
you should not take that seriously
i don't do
i don't design products on twitter
twitter is just sort of you know top of
that idea see where it goes
and
but here is the trap do you see the trap
because he asked me to defend myself
but what would happen if i had
what would happen if my response to him
saying my idea is dumb
what if i'd said
oh you took the tweet seriously it
wasn't meant to be taken at that level
of seriousness what would have happened
do you see the trap
the trap is
yeah the trap is i lose
it was a trap
so the trap was that if i'd said ari
you're taking me seriously
when this shouldn't be taken as like a
product design
everybody would have jumped in and said
oh nice try scott you got caught
you said something stupid
and now you're trying to defend it as
not that serious oh it's just a joke i
get it it's just satire
gotcha
we gotcha we got you backpedaling and we
got you being stupid two that's two
crimes one is being stupid and the other
is lying about it and saying you were
just joking gotcha gotcha
so i knew that so
having lots of experience in
media stuff
i could see the trap forming
so what do you do how do you avoid the
trap
so here's how i tried to do it not so
sure i uh
did it well
um
i uh i just retweeted him and i said
that
i'd let the commenters go first and let
the commenters
clear him up
so my best play
was to let the other people who were
watching the conversation
come in and say that they understood
without me telling them
that that wasn't to be taken seriously
which it did so lots of people poured in
and said uh i don't think you're
supposed to take that part too seriously
which was the correct interpretation
so
once other people
had said they read it differently
then finally i can come in but if i came
in first it would look like i primed the
other people and they were just agreeing
with me so i had to have other people go
first and then i could go in do you get
that
this is
you know
living in the in the media and then the
public as i do
you learn these to see these traps
before they form
all right so here's how it went so um i
let other people uh comment and then ari
commented this he said uh
so what you're saying is you can't
defend your own idea lol
uh have i ever taught you how to spot
cognitive dissonance
it's in that book right behind me win
bigly i think i also put it in
loser think but it's definitely in win
bigly and the trick is this
when somebody starts a sentence with so
and then they mischaracterize
your opinion after that
um
that's cognitive distance
pretty much every time
now i can't say it's a hundred percent
but i haven't seen an exception
every time you see a sentence in this
form starts with the word so
and is followed by some weird absolute
that's a person who's been triggered
literally into a condition of cognitive
dissonance now you have to look for the
trigger
all right there's no cognitive
dissonance without a trigger there has
to be something that causes it it
doesn't just sort of happen
and here the trigger is very obvious
the trigger is that he had committed to
calling me dumb in public
and then when people poured into the
comments
and told them that they read it
properly and that a proper reading would
remove the objections
what's he going to do
what do you do if you're a public lawyer
and your job is to be smart in public
that's his job
he's on tv
being smart in public that's why he's
hired
and then you find out that you were
really really dumb in public
that's the trigger
so the trigger is he can't um and this
would be any person like you put any
normal person in the same situation they
would be triggered exactly the same way
so this is not a comment about
ari cohn
this is a universal comment anybody in
this situation would have his exact
experience which is you can't integrate
that my entire job and identity is being
smart in public
but i just did something so amazingly
dumb in public like like really dumb
those can't be reconciled
so when that happens cognitive
dissonance comes in to explain how two
opposites i'm very smart but i just did
something very dumb how they can be
integrated and the integration is
lol you can't defend yourself kenya
scott
well he didn't see part two which is
first i have to let the commenters
show him that a
a wiser reading of the words gives you a
different uh outcome all right so
just to show that other people saw it uh
differently than ari here's some other
replies david uh gilly replied he said
to ari where did scott say anything
about an automatic arrest
waiting waiting
we'll be waiting for through infinity
for this answer yes correct
there was a little too much red into
that
then uh
an engineer jd christioni
says i'd imagine they would need a
warrant for an automatic arrest still
and to be honest i'd much prefer having
a self-driving car take me to a police
station compared to having my door
kicked in and my house trashed all while
my neighbors are watching
now what did
this this commenter who was an engineer
and maybe he watches my content
what did he do correctly
what he did correctly was compare it to
the alternative
what do i talk about all the time
you can't judge anything
until you've compared it to an
alternative
so
he did he compared it to the alternative
right that's good thinking
now you could disagree with this
conclusion but not the fact that he
compared it to an alternative so that's
just smart
um
then somebody else said
i guess uh jay senza tex whoever that is
they pretty much can do the former now
meaning
just you know stop anybody they want for
any reason and the whole point is that
there wouldn't be a cause for any
traffic stops so another other people
are agreeing that they see it the same
way
blah blah
and
uh
okay
so the other thing that people do when
they see this kind of thing is that they
imagine it would be designed in the
worst possible way i think i mentioned
that
and uh
that would be a case of uh joe utchill
i think he's a
he's a reporter and he commented he said
uh just to make me look extra stupid he
put some dots in this he goes the
dot dot dot dot
the driver still needs to exit the car
at some point
scott
i mean
the driver still has to exit the car
but this is an example of assuming you
would
design the dumbest possible system you
would make sure if you did this at all
you'd make sure that it went to a safe
place so that when the person exited the
car it's the safest possible way to exit
the car but yeah they have to exit the
car
one is a dumb way one is a smart way why
would you assume you'd design it the
dumb way
all right
here's another uh criticism
since less than one percent of traffic
stops result in harm it's a needless
policy
so
a notorious legal somebody who has some
kind of legal background believes that
it's a waste of time
trying to fix this you know problem of
police stopping people because uh less
than one percent of traffic stops result
in harm
to which i say well that might be true i
mean somewhere in that neighborhood less
than one percent probably
but
those are the ones that cause the riots
the one percent
that cause the harm are a hundred
percent of the riots
it's a hundred percent of the racist
animosity
so
how bad could you be at math to look at
those traffic stops and ignore the riots
that are destroying the country together
anyway
um and i'm pretty sure that um
because i agree black lives matter
i'm pretty sure that stopping one
percent of the problematic
traffic stops to stop a hundred percent
of the riots
is a positive thing
all right um and then here's my favorite
have i told you that
about half of the news is based on
imaginary people
all right here's another one that's just
based on an imaginary person so some
user called uh
serve food a lot
is weighing in with this conversation
that says on twitter
um
uh why are these uh f-nuts he swears
perfectly fine with the government
taking control of your car
but won't wear an effing mask
so here this twitter user believes
there's a person
who is perfectly fine with the
government controlling your self-driving
car
but they won't wear a mask
who is that
he's really mad about the imaginary
people it's not me
i mean that doesn't describe me
all right
the in the kyle rittenhouse case you all
know kyle shot two people in what looked
like self-defense but he's gonna be on
trial for murder
and
um there was a gofundme and the news
came out that i guess the the list of
donors leaked
and one of them was a utah paramedic
so he donated to the defense fund for
kyle rittenhouse and
it was like 10 bucks right just small
donation
and the guardian wrote about it and the
next thing you know
a reporter shows up at his house
this utah paramedic
to
try to shame him i guess i mean
on the surface it was news
but why are you going to this guy's
house
he gave ten dollars
he gave ten dollars
to something that he thought was
supporting justice
and this guy needs to be dragged through
the news
we're going to make a victim
out of this utah paramedic
paramedics save lives
he's this guy's not a jerk
he's a guy who looked at the video just
like all of us did
he reached an opinion
made a free person's decision to put
some of his money behind his opinion
and then the news is going to take him
down for that
this is the most disgusting
unethical immoral thing you'll ever see
in the news i mean really truly
disgusting
all right here's something that made me
laugh a lot uh
especially lately uh james lindsay
uh also known as conceptual james
sometimes on uh
on twitter
um i believe he has done some or said
some controversial things which i'm not
fully informed on so i'm not
i'm not buying into any controversial
ideas that he may or may not have said
because i don't even know what they are
but i know that he's provocative so i'm
just telling you i'm not aligning with
all of his opinions i'm just giving you
this one's kind of brilliant two tweets
and he says i don't think a lot of
people realize how much resentment gets
boiled up in people who are smart but
too impractical to know how to make
money
especially when they see quote dumb
people making more money
over producing these bourgeois types is
very dangerous to any society
and then he goes on i suspect a lot of
the reason so many academic temperament
types turn to marxism and other marxian
ideologies is that they're
simultaneously not good at making money
smarter than average and suckers for
theoretical constructs that would work
if only people were smarter
oh my god
that hits
that hits exactly home doesn't it
you know
when you see people complaining about
anything you always have to ask okay are
they really complaining about that or is
it just political or is it just some
personal problem they're having at home
and this just hits
this this feels right doesn't it
it feels that the academics
are working off some kind of anger or
guilt or feelings of low self-esteem
and that the way they do it is this way
and and
uh maybe that's all that's going on now
of course i doubt it's all that's going
on but uh
this is definitely part of it
there's definitely a jealousy arrogance
element in all of this
all right
um here's a prediction for you this is
my prediction
before long i said the consumers of ad
based news which is most of it right
most of the news is supported by
advertising that the consumers of that
will be seen as mental slaves
to ridiculous narratives
that's largely the situation now right
people who are consuming cnn and msnbc
especially
um
are
they're basically victims
they're they're mental slaves to
ridiculous narratives now
are you going to jump on me and say but
what about fox news yeah fox news too
fox news too the only difference
and i feel strongly about this is that
the people who consume news on the right
fox news etc
tend to also be exposed to the news on
the left they might prefer the
narratives on the right but at least
they see both of them
more likely than the people on the left
i think that's
anecdotally that's so obvious
that i feel like
science would support it
but then i'm going to go on and say that
the consumers of subscription-based news
let's say sub-stack is one
locals is another platform with
subscription that's the one i'm on
and
that they're they will be the only three
free thinkers
and that the world is actually going to
bifurcate
into people who are mental slaves to
narratives they've been fed that'll be
all the ad based advertising based news
but people who have moved to at least
including some of the subscription-based
stuff and i'm going to call out as i
often do glenn greenwald
as he's in sub stack
matt taibi
also in sub stack amen locals you know
greg goff elders and locals
um
lots of people are locals as well
so
i think that's where it's going the
future will be two types of people
mental slaves
and free thinkers and if you don't have
a subscription
so that you can get the free thinkers
you will be just a slave to the
narrative
and that's where it's going
um
all right
that
is my show for the day
and
um
pretty soon can anybody tell me when the
closing arguments for the defense happen
in the chauvin trial
does anybody know when that happens it's
this week right
so here's my other prediction
no matter what the evidence
seems to show in this case with chauvin
and floyd no matter what the evidence
showed
i do believe that the closing arguments
and especially this attorney he appears
to be quite qualified
i believe that he can in his closing
comments absolutely destroy the
prosecution
he couldn't do it with experts
because they they kind of felt a little
bit short but i think that it would be
easy to demonstrate um
demonstrate probable cause and the way i
do it is what i've told you before i
would just say
imagine you're this police officer
the the whole case depends on him
knowing he's causing this danger to
floyd
the whole case depends on his mental
knowledge that he knew he was doing it
and preferred to do it maybe he didn't
know he was going to kill him but knew
he could put him in a situation where he
you might have a tragic outcome
how does that make sense with the fact
that he did it slowly in front of people
filming him
that's the end of the case
nobody you can't even imagine it in your
mind
that somebody did it intentionally
but they also did it in front of a crowd
of spectators filming it
it's unimaginable that that happened
and so that's a lot of reasonable doubt
and it wouldn't matter what the evidence
said as soon as you framed it like that
i'd say oh okay
i just know in my own mind he he
couldn't have been thinking that that's
the end of it you don't need any
evidence for that now i don't know if
you can say that in a closing argument
can you
can the closing argument depart from the
facts presented in the trial
i think they can a little bit right
there's must be some limit to what you
can do but i feel like you could ask
people to
to judge the case
using common sense
and that you can encourage them what
that looks like
i think that's okay right
all right
yeah somebody says ask
ari
uh but you've already said facts won't
matter in the verdict correct
what i just said was
that uh
the argument wouldn't be based on so
much the facts that were presented but
the facts that are already in people's
heads
putting putting a fact into a head and
making it matter is really really hard
but telling people to use the facts that
they already accept as facts and just
reframe it
that's really easy
so that's why this looks easy to me you
don't have to introduce any facts you
just reframe it and anybody who hears
the reframe is going to say well
that at least gives me some doubt gotta
say
gives me some doubt
all right that's all i got for today and
i will talk to you
tomorrow
