good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams I'm
pretty sure it's the best time you'll
ever have and if you want to take this
up to levels well that humans can't even
understand all you need is a CER muger a
glass a tanker chelin a canteen suar
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffeee and
join me now for the unparallel pleasure
of the dopamine H the day the thing that
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it's going to
happen right now
go oh yeah it was good it was
good so you know it's funny uh I was in
Starbucks the other day and I could
swear I got decaf I know I didn't you
know cuz I watched him make it but uh I
was feeling like oh maybe the coffee is
wearing
off but it is a thing that as some as
some
stores they will give you decaf if they
ran out of regular
coffee that's a real thing I don't think
that happened to me but it's the thing
well scientists had discovered at least
four new species of
octopus who I call
octopi now you might know it but is it
is appropriate to say both octopi and
octopuses
one of those sounds naughtier than the
other so I go with
octopi um however if you found four new
species of
octopi and you wanted them to form some
kind of a political action group what
would they be
go octopi forming a political action
group go octopi Wall Street that is
correct octopi Wall Street that is their
new political action
committee uh um and you think that four
four octopi is not enough but let me
tell you they got a lot of
hands yeah they got a lot of
arms all right we're done with that that
is all the octopi humor I have no more
octopi
count well as you know the sperm count
among humans is plunging toward the
ground and by 2040 uh you can all
day and you'll never have a baby so
that's good news Well it's bad news in
the sense that it would be the end of
humankind so like that would be a little
bit bad but on the positive side no
unwanted children by 2040 you'll be
you'll be just shooting blanks
there now what do you suppose it is
science is all confused what could it be
why why has our sperm count been
dropping for years and years
everywhere yeah it's the thing that the
news can't tell you it's the thing that
you govern ever been K say out loud our
food supply is
poison obviously walk down the street go
to a mall look around you don't see that
90% of your fellow citizens have
literally been
poisoned they look like it just look at
them and very obviously they've been
poisoned not to death I mean not quickly
they'll die faster but yeah so I think
this sperm count thing and
you know maybe even excess mortality I
mean you know there are other possible
reasons for that as we all know
but I think it's the biggest story
that's unreported and it can't be
reported under our system because I got
a feeling there are some big food
companies that have some influence in
this world so uh we'll probably just uh
run on a sperm and all die because we
can't ask the right questions in our
current system
Dr Jordan Peterson's problems with h
Canada continue the Ontario College of
psychologist uh said that he needs to go
to re-education
school because of some damn thing he
said that they don't like so Canada
wants uh you know this is an older story
but this is the update so the update is
I guess uh Dr Peterson tried to uh tried
to get the courts to weigh in and they
said nope you have to be re-educated if
that's what they
say so right now Peterson is out of he
doesn't have any legal challenges
left is this CRA that's crazy isn't it
now of course he threatens uh you won
this round he says to them but mark my
words however the war is barely started
there's nothing you can take from me
that I'm unwilling to
lose so watch out seriously you've been
warned well I don't know what he can do
to this this Ontario blah blah blah
but does he really need his his
license I mean how how much Private
Practice does he do I feel like his job
is largely giving it away on
video yeah so um bill akman needs to get
involved somebody says is there anything
Bill Amman can't
fix um I don't know what's going to
happen with this story but I'm
definitely on Peterson's side this this
doesn't seem like something that should
happen in this civilized country uh you
ought to have a little bit of Free
Speech but apparently not apparently not
you got to go to Canada re-education
Camp if you say something the government
or this this body doesn't like all right
Canada is broken Ted Cruz is endorsing
Trump is anybody surprised by
that nobody surprised that Ted Cruz is
endorsing Trump right I I think it was
yesterday or the day before I saw a
story it's like Ted Cruz hasn't endorsed
anybody and I thought well it's not
really a big mystery which way that's
going to go is it maybe it was but I
kind of expected
it so who else is saying good things
about Trump well uh JP Morgan CEO Jamie
Diamond is going out on I think he's
going out on a limb jie diamond is not
any kind of famous Republican I don't
know what he registers as but he's not I
don't think anybody considers him
Republican uh but he said this quote on
uh on TV he said I don't I don't like
how Trump said things uh but he wasn't
wrong about those critical
issues JB Diamond continues to not be a
 jerk which surprises you doesn't
it like when you see a famous person
these days who just says something that
just sort of is ordinary ordinary
obvious common sense and it's not just
full-blown Trump derangement syndrome or
crazy or or clearly just
stupid he actually made News Jamie
Diamond did he made national news by not
being an who just was trying to
destroy the country with propaganda just
saying a normal thing that yeah Trump
was right about and they named some
things uh and he said
uh but he wasn't wrong about those
critical issues that's why they vote for
him people should be more respectful of
our fellow citizens thank
you as he notes Biden is running against
Maga he's running against the
Citizens he's he's running for president
against the Citizens or at least you
know a third of them at least at least
Jamie Diamond notices is there's
something wrong with that you know I I
don't know if he ever thought about
running for office he'd be crazy if he
did it but he would be a strong
candidate just the fact he's willing to
talk about it honestly so he says that
uh uh Trump was basically right about
China immigration NATO and I think he
said taxes he mumbled a little
bit do you
agree I think you do right sounds pretty
yeah Trump was right about a bunch of
stuff um let's add another one so the
Biden Administration is considering uh
adding the hooes to the terrorist list
does that sound familiar as in what
Trump did before Biden reversed it so
let's add to JB Diamond's list that
Trump was right about China immigration
NATO taxes uh the entire Middle East
Yemen we could go
on now here's a story
that I it makes you just shake your head
the whole time you you think about it
like try listening to this without
shaking your head oh God like try just
hold your chin and try to hold your head
straight while I tell you this story
because you're not even going to believe
it on Bill Mar show he had Bernie
Sanders on and it turns out that when
challenged Bernie Sanders didn't know
the difference between equity and
equality as it is defined by his own
party Bernie Sanders the Lefty of the
Lefty
leftists could not Define and did not
understand that his own party's primary
policy primary the most important thing
is to make sure everybody has the same
outcome and he actually believed it was
about
opportunity the
opportunity version went away years
ago now I heard uh also Dr Jordan
Peterson said in a post the other day on
X that in his experience he's talked to
a number of members of Congress and that
they actually don't know that Equity
changed from being about opportunity to
being about outcomes and that that's the
standard definition used by the
left so even the politicians elected by
the left the Democrats Bernie Sanders is
not aware of the most important part of
his own party's
platform hold your chin quick quick
because your head is shaking isn't it
it's like what no
no no I can't be living in a world in
which that is even possible no no that
can't possibly be that the most
important part of the Democrat policies
is unknown to the main head Democrats
that were
elected is that
possible turns out it
is like you ask yourself how could we be
in this place where Equity is being
talked about seriously and policies are
are being built around it and you know
that the cities are being
destroyed it's because our leaders
are too
old that's
it for for the the reason that Bernie
Sanders doesn't know what his own party
is doing is because he's too old
he doesn't belong in the job we need to
be able to say that directly you're too
 old you know who else is too old
Trump I'm not going to not say that I
prefer him over Biden you know by a lot
but he's too old I that the
reason that I back of a vake is because
I just can't be a hypocrite about this I
can't tell you Biden's too old and
Bernie's too old and say that ah Trump's
fine because he's acting
right to be clear Trump does not show
any worrying signs of age I don't see
any he he looks like he's
100% but can you trust that can you
trust it no I don't trust it at all then
you shouldn't trust it it would be crazy
in fact Biden wasn't completely gone
when he ran for office if we'd gotten
the Biden that ran for
office he was he was on the edge of
functioning but he's not now and and
every every smart person who had lived
in the world the real world for a little
while could tell that four years was
going to be devastating based on his
starting point now Trump could do better
I mean he could sail through four years
with no signs of aging it's possible
but would you bet on it we're going to
have to because the alternative is
worse so
great um but yeah I I think that's
literally true that the top Democrats
don't know what their top policy is like
literally don't know what it
is
unbelievable uh Trump was quoted as
saying yesterday in his speech that uh
if fake news uh didn't exist 90% of our
problems would be solved who thinks
that's true do you think it's true that
if fake news didn't exist 90% of our
problems would be
fixed well this is what I call a theme
this is my theme for the rest of the
show so we're going to talk about the
other headlines and then I'm going to
bounce against this idea you tell me if
the only news is fake
news starting
with uh I saw a very funny post from
kakoa the
great which I'll tell you every time I
mention him you should follow him if
you're not following uh kenoa the great
you're just missing all kinds of good
content I have no idea who it is you is
real identity but he's is pretty much
gold every day you long long thing long
threads that perfectly explain our
situation so definitely follow him so
here's his comment this is the just the
driest funniest thing he says in a post
just in uh World economic Forum climate
scientist Carlos no says 2023 was the
hottest year in
125,000 years but he doesn't understand
why so many people no longer trust
science now why is it that you can
simply accurately describe what a person
did in public and that's the joke
it's a
joke there's there's no there's nothing
added this is just literally what
happened he
said he said that they think they can
measure the temperature accurately over
125,000 years and then he wonders why
people don't trust the
science uh I have no idea gosh that's a
that's
mystery I wonder why people are voting
for The populist anti-science candidate
uh I saw Gad sad posted today that uh
that there's a lot of proof for climate
change let me give you some of the
strong evidence for climate
change however much is snows is proof of
climate change if it snows too much well
that's some climate change right there
if it doesn't snow at all climate change
if it snows the exact average amount of
snow
well that's a little suspicious isn't
it yeah everything is a reason for
climate
change is climate change real I don't
know but I know there's no way to know
there's no way for me to know I don't
know if there's any way for anybody else
to know but no way for me to
know all
right so CNN and MSNBC have uh dropped
the Veil of trying to be news is that a
fair
statement the MSNBC and CNN based on the
Iowa caucuses and how they were handled
I feel like they stopped
pretending which actually is sort of a
relief because it was to pretending they
were real news that was bugging me the
most as long as they don't pretend
they're
real and and people understand that then
I'm a little more comfortable I've
always liked that about Fox
News H in my opinion Fox News you know
has obviously it's it caters to right
leading audience and so they present
news that Their audience is going to
like and but the thing is with Fox News
they're completely
self-aware as are the audience I think
you know when when Jesse Waters jokes
that he's that he's going to be you know
sort of an unreasonable Republican
sounding pundit you we laugh with him
because it's it's obviously true that
he's going to take a republican prot
Trump position and so once he laughs at
himself right in front of you because
he's mocking you know the understanding
that he's Pro Trump um it doesn't bother
me because it's
transparent here I am going to be
favoring this person so if you want to
watch that
content Fox News is a great place to do
it I I always say the same thing about
Fox News because they don't get enough
credit The Producers for Fox News are
just the
best like they just put on the best
shows and they're consistently the best
everything from who's on the show to the
combination of people on the show to the
topics they pick the production quality
itself it's just all the
best well you can you can dislike the
coverage or the bias or whatever that
would be fair but the production quality
is just it just blows me away every time
I see it you know somebody just said
hair and
makeup I have a hypothesis that I
haven't checked that Fox News changed
their stylus in the last few months
because I noticed that the onair
personalities especially on the five I
noticed it the most suddenly went from
you know professionally dressed of
course to really well dressed did
anybody else notice
that it was sort of striking it happened
kind of overnight every like especially
the women I don't notice the men so much
because they wear boring clothes but the
women they all just their wardrobes just
like went up a level suddenly so good
news anyway uh why am I talking about
that all right here's some more
lies uh Michael there's a there's a
Michael Mo video going around that
reports to show Michael Moore giving a
full-throated endorsement to Trump that
is a fake video how many were fooled by
that how many of you think you saw a
Michael Moore video on X and said my God
I didn't realize he was totally
supporting Trump now did it get you yeah
it was a pretty good fake so here's how
it was done it's a rupar from 2016 so
it's not current it's 20
2016 and the and the rupar part of it is
they edit out at the end where he says
basically AG Trump he's terrible don't
vote for him but the first part he was
doing pacing as I often tell you you
should do for persuasion so it looked
like he was reading an opinion of
someone who was very Pro Trump so the
audience could understand how an
ordinary person could say Trump was on
their side so he read it with you know
the complete sincerity of the person who
wrote The Letter even though it
disagreed with him so that's pacing he
was agreeing with his audience that yeah
there is a reason we do fully understand
why somebody would support Trump but and
then he would give his reasons why it's
a bad idea but they cut out the part
where he where he changes and says it's
a bad idea so that was just a a fake
news but weirdly it was a true fake news
because the part that it did show was
based on a real person's opinion in a
real letter and it did very well point
out why real people support Trump so
it's fake news and a context but that
part of it was
actually um On
Target do you all do you all know the
Lincoln project it's a bunch of people
who used to be Republicans but now
they're just super anti-trump and they
raiseed tons of money and they make ads
anti-trump
ads and I don't know if any of you have
the same
feeling but when you see the people who
are the the principles of the the
Lincoln project you know the people who
are the founders do you have any like
visceral feeling about
them does anybody have a negative
feeling about
them I'm looking for some specific
words whenever I see them uh and by the
way I don't have any evidence of any
wrongdoing I'm just I'm just telling you
a feeling that this is not an accusation
but they look like sex offenders who
don't know what soap is am I
wrong like whenever I see them I go I I
you know there are no allegations I'm
not saying that they've done anything
wrong there's no evidence of that but
they have a Vibe of sex offenders who
don't
wash that's all I like I feel I can
smell them when I see them do you have
that feeling I don't get that from other
people even if they're you know if they
disagree with
[Laughter]
me all right anyway I'm not making any
accusations I'm just telling that they
have a Vibe about
them uh but they put out a new video in
which they're comparing Trump to Hitler
and it made me think don't you wonder
what the brainstorming meetings are like
at the Lincoln project like I have this
image in my head there's sitting around
the
table you know but they're not sitting
very close because you know the smell
and and one of them says hey hey I've
got an idea and everybody saids what is
it what is it we need some good ideas
and then one of the members at the table
says I'm just spitballing here but this
could work what if what if we do a
compilation video in which we suggest
that Trump is is like wait for it wait
for it
Hitler and there's an audible gasp at
the
table and they
say Maestro Maestro genius genius
Maestro
Eureka and did they say to themselves
I don't think anybody's thought of this
before this could
work they're really the dumbest
smelliest people in all of politics but
they're funny so now when I see their
ads I always
laugh and think there they go again and
I always laugh at the people give them
money I I can't imagine a worse use of
money you'd have to have a lot of money
to make that big sense yeah let's give
some money to the link project we have
no idea what kind of video they're going
to come up with surprise
us Hitler well that's a fresh
one well this is more of fake Biden
claims from the White House so Jonathan
tle is pointing out this White House
trick of making outrageously fake claims
and then when the correction comes well
it doesn't get much play do you remember
the story about the border patrol people
who were whipping the immigrants with
literally with whips and it turns out
nope they were just riding
horses it wasn't so much that they were
whipping immigrants it was more like
they were just people on horses and they
were using their horsey thing to keep
the horse in in
control uh but most people heard the
story but didn't hear the correction so
they still think it happened there's
another one like that there was a story
about uh Homeland security being chased
Away by you know the Texas authorities
and it caused them not to be able to
save a
drowning some Drowning immigrants and so
the immigrants drowned because Texas
government is so bad and they made the
federal government stand down and didn't
allow them to save the drowning people
well none of that was true nothing like
that happened there were to there were
some drownings so that part is true but
it had nothing to do with anybody
preventing anybody from doing anything
they they didn't even have the timing
right it was happening before any of
this so this is another story do you
remember the
correction
no no you probably remember the story
but not the correction so what would be
the incentive for a government not to
lie I I feel like lying is so
incentivized that they'd be crazy to
tell the truth what would be the point
of it might as well
lie well speaking of lying
Putin uh is talking about us elections
said he he's a good troublemaker you
know yeah you have to appreciate his
troublemaking ways so Putin said uh I
guess translated in English it would say
in the United States previous elections
were falsified through postal voting
they bought ballots for $10 filled them
out and threw them into mailboxes
without any supervision from observers
and that's it Putin said without
providing any EV
idence now the funny part is that you
know Putin's an ex KGB guy and he knows
exactly how to get under the skin of
Americans and and that was it that's how
you get under the skin of
America so yeah I I think uh at least
half of
America according to BS at least half of
America agrees with him directionally
not necessarily that the only problem
was mail in ballots but directionally I
think people assume the elections have
been stolen so I I'm going to say it
directly I don't have any evidence about
2020 but I would be amazed if we've had
any Fair elections in my lifetime I'd be
really surprised I don't think there's
any way to know for sure but why would
there be fair
elections if you if you understand how
the world works you have to assume that
the bad people are doing everything they
can to gain control
all the time and they're not going to
fail every time eventually one of their
secret plays the game control through I
don't know the CIA or the FBI or you
know a secret Coalition of whatever it's
going to work eventually because because
nobody will ever stop trying it's too
much of a payoff to stop
trying so you have to figure that over
some amount of time eventually our
system would be owned by bad bad actors
it's almost guaranteed we have we have a
system that money buys too
much if if you can buy influence with
money of course the system is rigged how
could it not be maybe not in an illegal
way it could be that the rigging is just
owning the news sources all you would
need to rig an election is to own the
sources of news you don't need anything
else right so we act as though uh owning
and funding and promoting fake news we
act like that's completely legal so
that's not rigging of course it's
rigging yeah if you if you look at CNN
and MSNBC they're not even trying to be
news you know after the Iowa caucuses
not not even
a not even a a wave at ethics I mean
basically they just walk right right
into full propaganda
mode because
they can
yeah so yeah fake is fake news the
biggest problem in the country yes it is
yeah probably is because it drives every
other problem all of other problems
would be solvable if we understood what
the problem was it's only because we
don't know what it is that we're not
solving all right uh Eric Weinstein
posted a serious question is the
Democratic Party of the United States
going to to rely so heavily on January 6
that it never does any
self-examination as to why so many
Americans are still voting for
Trump no do you know what their
self-examination is let me do a Democrat
self-examination
huh let's see Trump has all of these uh
indictments he's been accused of so many
improprieties and yet he's still wildly
popular how do we explain it let's do
some
self-examination uh-huh uh-huh okay it
looks like it looks like the problem is
Mega
extremism and probably
racism uhhuh yeah it turns out the
problem is entirely on the other side
there's no fault on this side yeah I'm
examining as hard as I can and I don't
see anything on our side because we
we're good people and the other side are
morons and C criminals and so there's my
self-examination that's the way
everybody does it you know I'd love to
say that's just the Democrats that's
that's basically every
person that's every person yeah yeah you
know if you happen to be on the side
that's right it doesn't sound stupid it
only sounds stupid when it's obvious
you're on the wrong side I mean you
literally
have Democrats arguing in favor of
ISM you don't have to be a genius to
know that's the wrong
side right I mean they act like they're
not but they're clearly promoting racism
as hard as possible so it said just
sounds funny when you know that they're
they're doing everything they can to
make things worse but they don't know it
maybe maybe they
do uh here's some more news if you can
call it that uh this is also more some
more fake news so I saw Chuck kesto
posted breaking now mutant coronav virus
strain that attacks the brain has 100%
kill rate in mice created by Chinese
scientists as they admit there's a risk
it spills over to humans that's
right China is working on a Corona virus
type mutant
virus that kills 100% of the mice it
in which
suggests that it might don't know for
sure might be able to kill 100% of the
people that's in and the problem would
be you
know uh if it got
out that sounds pretty bad right now
here's the fake news part of it
Community note
says that the headline is misleading not
the check not the Chuck cesto part but
the headline uh is that the virus drain
U mutated from a virus that was found in
Malaysia in 2017
and the reason they're testing it is to
basically be in you know better shape in
case it did spill over so the idea is
that the virus already
existed and if they test it better they
can have a better idea how to stop it
now that doesn't mean it isn't a deadly
virus and if it gets out we're all dead
that's still true so you know Chuck
Clo's uh point about it is accurate
directionally the only thing that needs
a tweak here is that it wasn't created
by Chinese
scientists it already existed but they
do have it in the lab so it sounds worse
if you think they created it it sounds
less worse if you know they're studying
it to try to you avoid it as a problem
which would be rational but we don't
trust anything coming out of China so
who knows what's
true
my talking about the fact that Biden met
with Larry think at Black Rock in 2019
19 when he was when Biden was deciding
whether to run and so the story goes
that black rock gave
a we got the 34 Minute glitch yeah great
and The Story Goes we don't know what
happened in the meeting of course unless
we were there but reportedly Black Rock
gave a a positive you know we're here to
help kind of message Biden took it as a
green light and went now the interesting
part because everything is connected to
everything else is that black rock was a
big uh had a big financial interest in
Ukraine and there was talk that this is
the speculative part where I can't tell
you what's true I can only tell you what
people are
asserting is the most likely true thing
so the assertion
is that the whole effort with black rock
was to
get Russia out of the energy business
and get the United States big companies
into the energy business in Europe not
only so Putin didn't have you know
financial leverage on Europe but also so
American companies could make a whole
lot of money because it turns out if
they could have that business instead of
Russia it's an enormous amount of money
so Black Rock would be sort of favoring
Biden Biden would favor defending
Ukraine if America could continue owning
Ukraine like it tried to because America
was behind the you know the whole uh
current situation there
um that uh there would be a reason for
American companies to rape Ukraine of
its resources for many years to come and
it would be good for America and then
also the politicians in America could go
wet their beak in big old corrupt
Ukraine and make big amounts of money
and nobody would know so does so the the
allegation um the allegation is that
Ukraine was always a big old money money
grabbing situation it was money grabbing
to take business away from
Russia which has a strategic advantage
of course but also money grabbing to
insert American companies and probably
politicians in there in the dirtiest
most corrupt place in the world
where they could all get rich at our
expense and Ukraine's expense
especially so I don't know if that's an
accurate description of it but it sure
sounds like it how many of you would say
that sounds to you like the most
accurate
description and and by the way this
appears to have been going on forever
yeah I see in the comments I don't think
this is a brand new situation I I think
this is the way America has operated for
forever and then
further Mike Ben uh talks about the
color revolutions do you know how many
countries the United States has
overthrown with secret coups and what
they call a color Revolution where you
get all the people to protest until the
government
changes I think there's over
40 yeah 40 or
more and we're watching the the same
technique now this is Mike Ben's uh
Insight we're watching the Democrats put
together the same technique in America
to make sure that the Republicans have
no power going forward so it's basically
um the idea is that the protests are all
already being set up in case Trump
wins and that there will literally be a
coup in which they're trying to get the
military to ignore Trump get the
protesters to take over the street
and and essentially run a coup should
Trump
win and I you know this is one of those
allegations
where I don't know it's it's a big
allegation but yet you can see it
yourself so I think what's going to
happen is Major protests uh if Trump
wins
and but I wonder aren't we smarter now
if you were if you were a republican
wouldn't you just get out of the way and
call it the way you see it say here's
the color Revolution is on Don't Panic
don't let them overthrow anything just
let their energy run out they're going
to destroy mostly Democratic cities
which are basically gone anyway so let
them go just get out of the way so the
the last thing I would do is go all
Kyle um and bring a gun you know don't
don't arm up and go to the city and
think you're going to stop the
protesting just get out of the way just
get out of the way now you should be
armed at home in case they come to your
house you definitely want to be armed at
home if you couldn't do so
legally yeah the revolution will be
televised so the fact that we can
predict it and call it
out might be
helpful it's hard to run an OP when the
people you're running the op on have
called out your plays in advance that's
why they do it I mean that's why Mike
Benz is doing it he's calling it out in
advance so when they do it you can say
well you can see this right just watch
it then you know what's happening the
problem is not knowing what's
happening or As Trump would
say 90% of the problems are fake
news right the the news will cover it
like it's a legitimate series of
protests because of course everybody's
angry at Trump being Hitler that's how
the news will cover it that's not
true that will be part of the color
Revolution because what you know once
the Democrats own the Press they get the
organized people to
March they try to put some suppression
on the military to make sure the
military doesn't get
involved that's a coup what else would
you call it yeah so that's
happening um do you remember that story
about all the forest fires in Canada
last year and Chau said it was climate
change you remember that
news well uh Quebec man has pled guilty
to setting 14 forest fires yes it was
exactly what you thought somebody was
setting forest
fires
um
yeah that's that's the whole story it
was
arson yep now how many of you thought
those were natural forest
fires did any of you think those were
they just just a big old coincidental
natural
forests even lightning didn't explain it
because it was too it was too like
obviously human
patterned so yes there's a fake news
Well Fortune Magazine is uh reporting
that Dei backlash has companies quietly
changing their programs to avoid
lawsuits do you think that's a thing do
you think lawsuits will change
Dei I don't know I don't know maybe I
mean if companies have trouble getting
Insurance good remember it's always
about insurance insurance is the only
thing that predicts because that's
that's what it does Insurance literally
predicts but they put their money on it
that's why it's legitimate so if a
company that has a Dei group starts
getting
sued the insurance company that might
you know potentially be on the line for
paying those uh payments are going to
stop insuring
them I wouldn't insure anybody for
lawsuits about
discrimination if there were if you had
a Dei
group do you agree if you are an
insurance company and you are insuring
against lawsuits for discrimination
which is the thing you can get that
insurance I wouldn't insure anybody if
they had a Dei group because that
guarantees problems now the big
companies probably don't need that kind
of insurance because they are what's
called self-insured meaning they could
afford it if they got sued they don't
need insurance so it won't work for the
biggest companies I assume they don't
have that kind of insurance because they
would wouldn't need it
anyway they would need it but they have
money to cover it so they don't need
insurance per
se but I have a theory uh I saw the
nness account showed the uh group
picture of the United Airlines Dei
office and let's just say there were no
white people in that
picture they appeared to be all black or
uh or brown enough that I couldn't tell
the difference
now I finally had an insult in an
Insight that's going to make you laugh
are you ready for this you're going to
be mad that you didn't think of it so
you're a big company and you want to
prove that you're hiring uh let's just
keep it simple you want to prove you're
hiring enough black employees especially
to good jobs right it doesn't count if
you're hiring janitors you you want to
hire to good
professional high paying jobs so you can
say you're doing your job for diversity
so you form a Dei
group have you noticed the Dei groups
seem weirdly
overstaffed anybody notice that like the
the number of people who are on the Dei
staff is weirdly high like you think
wouldn't two be
enough two people couldn't do it but the
groups are like really big
groups do you see it yet
the Dei group itself counts as a
diversity higher every person who goes
into the Dei group is a high- paid
executive that that company can say yes
we're doing so well with diversity we've
hired 10 new uh executive level black
employees and we're pretty happy about
it and all 10 will be in the worthless
Dei group that doesn't do anything you
useful but they have inflated
salaries and as long as they exist and
you can keep adding to them you can say
that your de hiring is on fire it's like
oh my God we hired 20 highly capable uh
black employees to really good paying
jobs nice professional jobs and we're
quite proud of that so what kind of jobs
did they
take
engineering um about you know hi like
finance jobs right
they're well where are they um they're
really all in the Dei
group that's a real thing that's
actually happening I'm not making this
up there were 12 people in this Dei
group do you think United M do you think
the United Airlines did not claim those
12 hires as 12 good executive hires of
course they
did
it's such a scam it's just ridiculous
all right let's talk about
V and Trump so V and Trump are appearing
together V did a powerful speech uh Pro
Trump and Trump had him up there and uh
people were chanting you V for vice
president and V said he's actually sort
of considering it you know not that it's
been offered but he's he said you know
if if Trump would agree with him on
several things he thinks are important
that that might be in a conversation so
the things that V thinks are important
for him to be part of the administration
should it be a trump Administration is
he's got opposition to digital currency
he doesn't like that expensive FBI
headquarters that Trump is flexible
about and he wants to pardon the Sange
there might have been more but those are
three that I saw so V is negotiating
behind the scenes to
see if Trump's policies are compatible
enough on some of the details that he'd
be comfortable not having to change his
opinions if he joins the the team I
guess now that doesn't mean he would
join as vice president necessarily but
Trump did say quote he'll be working
with us for a long time so they do seem
to have some
agreement now how many of you saw them
appear together and give me in the
comments your first impression first
impression of trump plus v go first
impression did it work didn't work uh
I'll just read you comments yes loved it
energy A Plus loved it loved it totally
worked uh yes yes yes yes yes yes mixed
somebody said mixed
interesting uh fatherly worked for me
Trump light um
allies um okay so almost all of you are
very Pro about this now you know I
endorsed VI for president and you know
that you know I like Trump's skills as
well so you're probably saying to
yourself Scott you must think this is a
you know a Dream
Team I'm not there honestly I'm not
there first of all V might be too strong
a player for the vice
presidency unless it was a Clinton Gore
kind of situation in which Clinton was
perfectly happy to say that Gore was
more than a partner he was more than a
vice president he was like in the
important meetings he had a portfolio of
things he was working on that were
important uh you could imagine you could
imagine V having a like a real portfolio
of
power but does that work with
Trump is Trump likely to give his vice
president more Glory than himself let's
say he gave v a really good portfolio
and then V nailed it and everybody was
talking about it and then people start
saying you know what gosh he's so good
at vice president H don't you think I
don't know maybe going to write an
article about maybe we got this
backwards you may maybe if aake should
have been the president because look at
how well he did as vice president do you
think Trump could live with that do you
think he'd be happy with aake
overshadowing him it's a
possibility all right now by itself i'
I've told you that one of the things
that people don't understand about Trump
is he really really likes smart people
and if he's going to get along with
anybody it will be because they're smart
even if they
disagree I mean he Trump is just
addicted to smart I mean it's is
practically his theme in life yeah and
loyalty smart and
loyal and effective he loves
it so on the intellectual level the is
very much Trump's
catnip and vice versa right so they are
each other's catnip that I think but I'm
going to give v a little advice and I'm
going to give you maybe a little uh
education on
persuasion did you see the back slapping
and the you know the arm on the
shoulder all right the you cannot
dominate Trump in public do not
physically dominate him in public that
you can't do that don't do that anymore
did you all saw it
right yeah Trump does it and he can get
away with it he he physically dominates
people you know he'll be the one who
Pats you on the back so hard that your
body moves like boom boom boom he'll be
the one who does the handshake first and
pulls your arm in and makes you look
like you're you know you don't have to
shake hands Trump is the king
of physical
persuasion V actually turned around
while he was you V was talking turned
around to chump to Trump and put his
hand on his shoulder on the top of his
shoulder you don't do
that you do you don't do that first of
all you don't do it to your running
partner never but you don't do
it to the guy who used to be president
and probably will
be that's just the flat out mistake and
by the way Trump did not look
comfortable when it happened I mean you
can't read minds but that was the
impression I got I also noticed did
anybody else notice that while V was
talking when he was saying things that
Trump liked Trump was visibly
smiling did you notice the smile go
away you saw it didn't you Trump
literally stopped smiling I forget what
the topic was that's less important
yeah he visibly stopped smiling at one
point do you see it I'm not so sure that
vice president is the right play because
that's going to put them at odds a
little too often and they're both too
strong you know there's a long tradition
of making sure your vice president is
weaker than you and like I said Gore was
the one exception that work that
well I don't know
that I don't know that Trump is designed
to be that kind of a
leader I think he's designed to be
number one but the problem is so is v v
is designed to be number one two number
ones is a
problem now what V does have working for
him is that he doesn't ever have to run
against Trump again you know Trump will
be done after this so they're not
competitors and V seems like a natural
eror parent so that's
good um I also worry that V would get
destroyed in the process of just being
that close to Trump sort of a Mike Pence
destruction kind of thing so I
worry that um it's a pro yeah I worry
that um it's
unrecoverable partly because of the way
the news would treat it you know so I
would not necessarily recommend to
aake that he take that
job um I definitely want to see him in
the administration do we all agree on
that I mean if there's any job in the
administration he wants and he wants him
more than vice
president I feel like you know what what
is it he couldn't do I was thinking
about all the all the jobs in government
you know the top jobs the cabinet
positions and the secretaries of this
and that I thought name one couldn't do
I couldn't come up with
one yeah I mean they they put the
secretary of agriculture as just you
know usually a donor or something so
they don't really need you know the top
people in the world I mean what does PE
Buddha judge know about
Transportation right so you could put
vake in almost any of those cabinet
positions he would learn their entire
function in a week maybe a day and then
he would would improve it almost
anything would
work so you better clamp down on the
body language because it's just not that
doesn't
work actually say St Clair was saying
that
therapy is overrated Elon Musk said the
same thing I say the same thing what's
your ratio of how often therapy helps
I'm going to say
20% I I think there are and even
Sinclair said that uh you know she used
it successfully with some postpartum
depression stuff and there are emergency
kind of situations where you you just
you just need somebody else somebody's
got to help you I think 20% now 20% is
high enough that I'd try it you know
like if I thought I needed something and
I didn't know what else to do 20% is
definitely high enough to try it if you
could afford it but just be
aware
they really don't make money if they
heal you you know if you stop going to
therapy they don't make money anymore
that model just doesn't
work all right Jack Jack Smith
prosecutor Got U I can say a word I've
never said in public a word I've never
said out loud I've read and I know what
I what it means but uh like me I'll bet
you've never said this word out loud
Jack Smith was
excoriated he was
excoriated according to the news um so
what he did was he had asked Twitter to
give him access to Trump's private
messages and Twitter complied because
they had to it was a warrant and they
were instructed that they couldn't tell
Trump that his private messages had been
penetrated
and a uh some judges just said um he has
executive privilege you can't do that
and they slapped him down and excoriated
him yes he got excoriated have I
mentioned that he was
excoriated
yeah and uh B basically the court had
no they weren't giving him anything that
basically he just violated presidential
privacy which we all think is a good
idea to have privacy if you're president
and the course just said
nope but he
won won
what I'm seeing some dissent in the
comments the
case all right
so I will confess the following all the
uh legal
stuff oh we got the messages somebody
says yeah he already got the messages
right so yeah I suppose he won in the
sense that he got the messages but I
don't know if he can use them in a legal
sense if he got them but he can't use
them did he win so I don't know the ins
announce of this but it's all sketchy
and bad Walgreens is closing their
fourth location in Boston in a black
area of
rockbury and the uh the residents are
quite mad at
Walgreens do I need to say any more
about
that they're mad at
Walgreens cuz Walgreens is closing
because there's too much shoplifting so
they're really mad at
Walgreens what what else is there to say
about that story
really well here's what I
say you should not live anywhere that
Walgreens is not willing to
live
is that fair if you live where the
Walgreens is running
away get get get the out of there
get get the away if Walgreens is
afraid you should get away get
away all right there's
a uh Biden's got a campaign ad where he
says you know I'm the only person who
can defeat Donald
Trump I'm the only one who can defeat
him I love that the Democrats have
completely given up on running on policy
and man and
Leadership it's just purely personal now
uh I don't like Donald Trump you don't
like Donald Trump we don't like Donald
Trump let's do something about it
they're not even pretending that this is
about anything but
Trump is so weak and hilarious
well the Wall Street journals uh dumping
on Dei in government uh a an attorney
named Mr Toth in Austin is writing in
the Wall Street Journal that uh the
federal requirements that if you're a
sub you're a contractor for the
government you have to have a certain
amount of diversity he says that's
clearly illegal and could easily be sued
out of
existence I don't know about that it's
lasted a long time but the fact that the
Wall Street Journal is reporting that
Dei and well they're allowing somebody
to write an article saying that uh Dei
could
be um could be eliminated by
lawsuits because lawsuits get stuff done
I don't know if there'll be any lawsuits
on that it seems like there would have
been
already but who
knows um I love how Biden has turned an
election into a hate crime
like every time I I see Biden now I just
hear the monster truck
thing
extreme Mega don't you doesn't it now
just sound like a joke it doesn't seem
funny I mean it doesn't seem serious at
all it's not it's not like they're even
trying extreme Mega it doesn't even like
that's
it yeah you're going to attack the
country and I have this question
if if we're all big about
self-identifying I can self-identify as
lgbtq or anything else I can
self-identify my gender I can
self-identify my
race but the only thing I can't
self-identify is Extreme
Mega why is that the exception why do
you get to tell me I'm extreme
Mega where's my self identity can you
tell me I'm black and then I have to go
through life as black because you told
me I am no can you tell me I'm gay if I
don't think I'm gay no can you tell me
I'm a woman if I think I'm a
man no so self-identifying is fine and
encouraged except if you're extreme Mega
who by the way I've never met extreme
Mega have you ever met any extreme magas
I see a lot of people put it in their
profile because I think it's funny
and it is funny but Extreme Mega it's
the only thing you can't
self-identify and indeed people only do
it because it's
funny all right here are things that I
believe should disqualify any candidate
for
president there's lots more you could
add to the list but these should
definitely be on the list you should be
disqualified for PR president if you
claim one gender is better at being
president that's got to be
disqualifying I mean Hillary Clinton
said women are better Nikki hilly said
she'd be better because she's a woman
that's got to be disqualifying it's just
got to be you know um if you have a Dei
website on your campaign uh if there's a
page about Dei promoting it on your
campaign that's got to be disqualifying
I'm thinking of Dean Phillips here that
bill Amman who doesn't like Dei is
promoting but he believes that Dean that
Dean Phillips will learn through
education that Dei is actually bad in
practice DO you believe
that do you believe that Dean Phillips
could remain a Democrat and get rid of
his Dei statement and come out against
it of course not there's not even the
slightest chance of that there's not any
chance of that I mean he might quietly
remove the page but he's not going to
come out against thei and remain a
Republican or remain a Democrat can't do
it so that's crazy um if your Campaign
theme is if your campaign is built
around demonizing one part of the
public I think you should be
disqualified if if Trump was
saying uh that the you know one part of
the Democrats were uh dangerous and
maybe they should be jailed
how can you possibly support that but
that's what's happening on the other
side the when they say extreme Mega they
are suggesting that maybe violence or
jail would be the right
solution now they don't say it but it's
What I Hear do you I mean it feels like
a threat of jail or violence because
we're extreme Mega like terrorists you
know that white supremacy terrorism that
they keep telling us about
um how
about uh if you think white supremacists
are the top National Terror threat or or
top threat let's say not Terror threat
but top threat that should be
disqualifying right they should be how
about if you think the border is
controlled if you're willing to say the
border is
controlled you should not be allowed to
be
president now what uh leera says and I
think other Democrats say is that the
problem with the border is the law
because the law says if you claim Asylum
that we have to treat you like it's
serious even if we know it's not now can
you explain to me why we don't change
that law so the the Democrats seem to
not like it and you know the Republicans
don't like
it all right so it's an immigration law
that neither Democrats or Republicans
like but we're still going to do
it there's only one
explanation there's only one explanation
it's got to be
corruption there is no other
explanation you tell me tell me any
other explanation why both both parties
would know that the law is a is garbage
and it still
happens I can't think of any of
isn't uh China is still in the Doom Loop
apparently they lost 2 million well
their population dropped by 2
million uh which is in the past year
which is more than twice as much as 2022
so not only is their population
declining but it's declining at a
increasing rate of
decline wow how much of that is because
their citizens don't have sperm
it's mostly economic though right
because they just can't afford to have
kids um and they had that one one child
policy for too long all right
uh so it looks like China is a bad place
to invest uh let's talk about
Yemen I guess our special forces the
seals uh intercepted a boatload full of
missiles heading to
Yemen um and now that uh now that Biden
has reversed his policy and it looks
like he's going to make the hoodies a
terrorist group again just like Trump
did I asked the question do you think
Biden
will uh reverse all of his policies back
to Trump's policies in alphabetical
order or is there some other order he's
going to do it maybe just as headlines
come up oh that's a problem I better
reverse that
quick
yeah um I've Got a Feeling uh there'll
be a lot more reversals to the
Trump
situation well here's a uh let's see if
you can solve this question Tony blinkin
still pushing the and Biden still
pushing a two-state solution for Israel
where the Palestinians would have their
own State living in harmony next to
Israel because that's what would happen
right if you had two
states they would live in harmony what
why what
they I don't see a problem all you need
is the two states Am I Wrong problem
solved what what am I missing oh the
part about one side wants all the other
side
dead yeah and gone more gone than dead I
think they care about gone more than
they care about
dead so how do you fix that
here's what I think I don't think the
Biden Administration and Tony blinkin
are serious even a little bit I do not
believe that the Democrats or any part
of the American government seriously
thinks a two-state solution has any
possibility of
working certainly Israel doesn't seem to
think it at least most of them now why
would they say it if there's no chance
that could possibly
work it's because they have
to yeah they have they have so many
people who would want to hear that that
they just have to say it but as long as
they know it can't happen because it's
not up to us it's up to Israel and you
know where they're at as long as it
can't happen we can play a good cop so I
think the two-state solution is nothing
but us playing good cop so Israel can
play the bad cop and we look like good
people or something so I'm sure Israel I
think I'm not I don't know how sure I am
but I think Israel understands that
America is just playing it for public
opinion because there are enough uh
anti-israel prop Palestinian people at
least in the Democrat Party that they
just don't want to start a fight with
them so blinkin will go over there and
pretend like a two-state solution is
possible and then it won't
happen how's it going to end oh I will
tell you how it's going to
end here's what it's going to be well on
day one Israel will say it's not really
practical to have the two states because
they don't yet have a functioning
government and an education system and
infrastructure so once we get the basics
set up we'll have this 20-year
transition plan maybe without the
20-year part we'll have this transition
plan where we totally totally won't have
a second state yeah and Israel is going
to say all right just work with us it's
got to be a one-state solution for a
while while we get everything in place
then when everything's in place it would
be Our intention to have a two-state
solution so then the United States gets
to say yes we pressured Israel into a
two-state solution they agreed to a
two-state solution but of course nothing
happens immediately so first you have to
get some stability first you have to
feed the people who are starving which
is a lot of them first you have to you
know figure out you know how to fix
what's wrong and you know decrease Hamas
and it's just going to take some time
you know things don't happen overnight
it's just going to take some time so if
you'll bear with us we'll we'll start
with a one state Plus Solution you know
one state plus working on the second
state but you just got to give us some
time and then time will go by and if
Israel is smart they will say we're
going to have to have some objective
standards to know when it's safe to go
full two state and they'll say something
like if we can get the number of Terror
attacks below three per year I don't
know I don't know what a reasonable
number is uh then then that will
activate our two state next step and
then that will just never
happen all they have to do all they have
to do Israel is say we we totally wanted
second state we're ready to go as soon
as it meets these criteria and they're
perfectly reasonable criteria stop
trying to kill us all you know that sort
of thing they're never going to meet the
criteria so so the United States could
be happy that they tried and they could
even claim success hey we got a
two-state solution you got to wait for
it but we totally got that solution then
in a while if you just
wait that's where it has to
[Applause]
go well John kusac apparently has ended
his career by he's being accused of
being
anti-semitic I don't know if that's true
he's accused of it but that's the end of
his career
right how could John kusac ever be an
actor in
Hollywood yeah he started out being
antitrump and that was pretty
popular but how in the world is he ever
going to work in Hollywood he has as
much chance of working as Hollywood as I
do
zero
zero all right and uh just an
announcement I'm going to start blocking
all the commenters on
X who use the word they and the who in
in quotes cu are trying to cleverly say
but Scott don't you know that all the
problems in the world are because of
they and I say they who you know Scott
they and I say you mean the world
economic Forum no Scott go deeper go
deeper who's behind the world economic
Forum I don't know who are they well
they are all
Jewish and then I say what would be
their names you know they but name one
no they they who the who you just say it
out loud Scott but who the rosch
Childs like who do you think is running
things let me let me suggest to all the
the they
people that do you think there wouldn't
be a
whistleblower do you think we could go
decades knowing that that uh Jews are on
both sides of even whether Israel should
exist as a state there are conservative
Jews there are you know liberal Jews or
Jews in the middle there's a Jew on
every side of every question that
matters about
anything except you know they're all
against the Holocaust so here's my
question do you really think we could
get to
2024 and we've got a whistleblower from
everything from well everything really
we've got a whistleblower from
everything including UFOs and they don't
even exist according to me so you don't
think there would be one whistleblower
ever who would tell you you know what it
is they they have meetings and here are
the names of them and here's what they
agre not ever not a not a single time
there's ever been a whistleblower said
yeah I was in the meeting oh yeah
they're planning not ever
just just ask
yourself how could it how could there
never be a
whistleblower is that is that really
possible I don't think
so I don't think so you know eventually
it all comes out remember when we were
said remember when I said uh could it be
true that the entire medical community
could tell you that vaccinations are a
good idea when they don't know
and and what did I say I said that feels
it feels
unlikely that the entire medical
community but that was pretty much the
case it was pretty much the case that
the entire medical community had enough
common financial interest that they in
fact went along yeah now but to my point
in the long run have they changed their
mind and do we have better information
yes yes in the long run there were
whistleblowers plenty the real
information or at least competing
information came out and so in just four
years what was apparently the best
hidden conspiracy ever is completely
transparent now would you agree that in
four years we did in fact find out what
lies were being told right the for
almost everything else in a few years
years often not the same year but in a
few years you do find out that Russia
collusion was fake in a few years it
didn't take that long but you believe
that for what uh decade after decade
there's that you believe there's been
this massive you know Jewish conspiracy

these secret people behind the the the
news are all so well

make all the decisions and it's to
destroy the world yeah no nobody's ever
like got a whiff of it nobody ever heard
about it

position they didn't reason themselves
into and I don't think the I don't think
that they is a position you reasoned
yourself
into and monkey man who's my biggest
