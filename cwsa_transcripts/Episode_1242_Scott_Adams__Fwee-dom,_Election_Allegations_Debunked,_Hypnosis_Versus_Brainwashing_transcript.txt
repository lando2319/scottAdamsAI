well look at that
hey there we are looks like technology
is working
sort of sorta kinda hey everybody come
on in
it's time it's time for coffee with
scott adams
yeah it's the best time of the day every
single time and i'm at a secret location
i'll tell you about that in a moment but
if you'd like to enjoy
this episode of coffee with scott adams
which
remind me is it the best part of the day
that's right yeah it is
best part of the day and all you need to
maximize it
is a copper mug or a glass of tanker
jealous or steiner candy jugger flask a
vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day the
thing makes everything better than
simultaneous sip it happens now go
that's good well let me tell you what's
going on here i
uh christina and i decided that
you know i've been working hard been
doing two or three jobs here
every day since the pandemic locked up
and i thought damn it i've got to get
something like a little vacation maybe
three days out of town and so what we
decided to do was
uh we would go to uh the snow country
decided to go to utah specifically park
city
now park city is a pretty cool place in
the winter it's just
beautiful place and restaurants and you
can walk around so we found a place
we found a resort that was uh in park
city perfect
location for the winter and we decided
that the things we like
would be a nice nice view you know big
vista view
and a summer suite you know i i don't
have a lot of luxury
wants in my life but once or twice a
year i like to go to a place that's way
more expensive and nice than
i would normally want to go to just
because i like the view
maybe if it's a winter place i like the
fireplace the snow
the walking great idea right
so things didn't go exactly
exactly as i planned so we got here
yesterday
and uh there's not much snow
so it's a snow destination without all
the snow
but that's okay because i still like you
know sitting by the fireplace with
christina and
looking at the view and you know and we
also
one of the main things we look for is 24
hour
room service because i i might start
work at 4 00 a.m
christine likes to eat dinner sometimes
at midnight
get a snack so it's one of our main
things 24 hour
so we found the place that was in park
city they told us they have 24 hour
room service we got in writing so we we
know
and here's what happened let me show you
let me show you my view
so remember this is a a very expensive
luxury suite all right so i'm not going
to tell you the name of the resort
because i don't think it's important
but here's my view can you see that
it's kind of lovely isn't it yeah that's
the view at night
because there are no lights or any kind
of illumination outside the window
so from 4pm to just about
20 minutes ago that was the entire view
a little a little black window
now you're saying to yourself oh of
course everybody
you know if it's night time of course
there's not going to be a view
so i'll show you the view that i paid a
enormous amount of money for here it is
it's a view can you see it it's the side
of a uh hellscape winter mountain
with nothing else but like dead brush
there's my view so we didn't get the
snow we wanted
but you know i i can i can put up with
some
inconveniences right and we didn't get
the view we wanted
and really the main reason i would go to
a place like this is for the view
but at least we get you know the
fireplace
well when i say we got a fireplace i
don't mean an actual
thing that had fire inside a building
it was more like a ornamental decoration
in the side of a wall that if you saw
the photos in the
on the website it looked like a
fireplace but it doesn't produce any
fire or warmth or anything like that
it's just a
sort of a decoration so instead of
watching the beautiful snow and my
wonderful vista
while sitting by the fireplace i'm
looking at a postage stamp of a
hellscape
while sitting next to a thing that looks
like a fireplace in the photo
but isn't now that's okay
because i'm not the kind of guy who
complains because
as long as we've got each other and
24-hour room service we'll make
we'll make something out of it right
well they don't have 24-hour room
service turns out
they have room service that ends at 9 30
at night
which is approximately two hours before
christina gets hungry
not ideal so we didn't get the
food we wanted the view we wanted the
fireplace
and there's no not much in the way of
snow in snow country
but at least we're in park city and if
you know about park city
it's a pretty cool place now when i say
we're in park city
i mean that the website where we found
this resort and this is a very famous
high-end resort
said it's in park city so we went there
and what they meant i guess we should
have asked more questions
when they say it's in park city what
they mean technically
is 19 miles from park city
in a town i've never heard of
so my idea of walking outside
and walking through the beautiful park
city
it's harder than it would be because i'd
have to walk
19 miles to begin my walk in park city
so we're uh we're checking out in a few
hours
so my my three-day vacation probably the
only time i'll
you know get out of town in uh
i don't know maybe in six months or nine
months
uh we basically my vacation is flying
here
wearing a mask all day not being able to
breathe
getting here looking at a postage stamp
of a dark window
and then flying home so that's my
vacation
but on the good side
it's also really expensive so
you got that all right enough about me
that's not why you came here
i just wanted you to feel the
the pain of being me for a moment uh
really i shouldn't complain i mean the
fact that i could even
get out of my house is something i
shouldn't complain about all right let's
talk about georgia the votes
i guess the vote's happening in georgia
here's my prediction
if it's true that the presidential race
was
stolen and i would say that's not proven
certainly not proven but lots of
allegations
if the national election was stolen then
certainly the senate elections will be
stolen
so if you see that democrats win both
seats
i feel like i'd have a lot of questions
so i don't think you can make a
prediction about the outcome
the way you normally would or you'd say
hmm
who do i think gets the most votes
because i don't think this
one is about votes if we've learned
anything
the will of the people has almost
nothing to do with an election
the things that matter are what rule
changes happened
what lawyers did what which courts said
what
who got out the vote whose advertisement
was the most
cleverly misleading so it's basically
a whole bunch of tricks and legal stuff
and lying and manipulation
and fake news and collectively all of
that mischief
is who determines who's president and
who determines who's senator
so the idea that uh
somebody said how's the coffee here not
good
at least it's consistent um
and how would i know i haven't been able
to order it so i've been using
i've been using the little uh little
espresso thing in the room
um anyway so we'll see what happens in
georgia
if it's two democrats that win i got
questions
um did you did you hear about that big
health care
consortium that was uh it was a
consortium
where they were trying to figure out how
to make health care costs
lower and it was amazon and berkshire
hathaway and jp morgan got together
well they just disbanded it so that
whole thing
that whole thing that i thought had
great potential it's like wow
if if these three entities amazon
berkshire and jp morgan if the three of
those companies
can't figure out how to penetrate this
healthcare cost
problem and make us a better system i
mean if they can't do it
i don't think it can be done so
they disbanded turns out it can't be
done
turns out it can't be done and the the
reason that they gave is that
although they created a consortium
in the in the most perfect dilbert world
they decided not to work together after
they created the consortium so all three
of them
just went off and did their own thing
and then they compared and they said
well we're
doing this we're doing that not really
the same things and so they just said
why are we a consortium we're not even
like coordinating so they just said yeah
screw it
now here's the funny part about it what
is the
single biggest problem with fixing
healthcare
well you might say to yourself it's you
know
money and bad congress and all that but
i would say that the base problem
is it's complicated that's the biggest
problem
as soon as you start digging into it it
just it's just
turtles all the way down and you know
endless complication
so no matter how well-meaning you are
and no matter how qualified you
are it's just impenetrable it's just too
big
too complicated so even if you could
figure out what to do
how would you ever communicate it
imagine you were the smartest person in
the world and
you did figure out how to fix healthcare
could you explain it to anybody
no because it'd be too complicated and
nobody would be able to
understand it much less vote on it much
less fix it
so in order to fix this thing
which had a base problem of complexity
i should have seen this coming their
solution to all this complexity was to
create
an entity of three big corporations
which
a little complicated individually
on top of having to work together which
is a little
complicated on top of a complication as
a way to solve a complicated
situation can you imagine the meetings
the meetings would have to be eight
hours long just to get to the first
you know item on the list because of all
the all the background context here's
what you need
to know who's doing what it's just
impenetrable so i'm not surprised that
using complexity
to try to simplify something didn't work
it could be a good deliberate comic of
that and maybe there will
there might be all right here's the most
interesting question of a biden
potential presidency what happens and
i've asked this before but it's
endlessly
fascinating to me because there are some
things you can predict
and some things that just defy
prediction
so what's going to happen with a biden
presidency
which has as it's one of its most core
basic components one of the strongest
parts
of you know what a biden you know
view of the world is is letting
immigrants in
and not putting kids in cages and
you know being as a open country as we
can to immigration
now i think most people agree you know
in the general
concept that immigration is good if you
do it the right way
and nothing is good if you do it the
wrong way are we all on the same page
with that
if you do if you do immigration in a
good way
it's good if you do it all wrong
not so good so it's not immigration is
good or bad it's just how you do it
and so
what's going to happen when the caravans
who naturally will see weakness in biden
and they'll say he's going to let us in
what happens when all the caravans show
up now it's already started right and
you're seeing
lots of them bunching at the border and
border border security is doing what it
can but it's still a presidency
of trump right so today
is still trump's people doing trump
stuff to keep the borders secure
but what happens on day one of biden
what does day one look like wouldn't
every caravan in the world say
well i don't think we'll ever have a
better time
so we should see massive caravans
coming over as soon as the weather and
you know the
the inauguration have happened you know
the weather's got to be good enough i
guess
i would imagine the winter is a good
time to do it so maybe it's the perfect
time to do it
i don't know but how do you see this
going
because let's say there are two
possibilities that i can see
one is that immigration grows and grows
and grows and expands
because nothing's stopping it and it
just gets out of control in one year
and millions of people walk across the
border that's one way it could go
and that would be at least consistent
with what biden and the democrats have
been saying
that you can't keep people out just
because you're being mean
if they have a reason to want to be here
that's good enough
you know i'm exaggerating a little bit
but that would be the
the democrat compared to the
system is you know difference in
permissibility
so what happens if biden goes the other
way
and says hey i'm no super progressive
we've got to have some border security
because he said things like that
what happens if he tries to stop it
how can he stop it without force
or without building a border wall what
in the world is going to happen
because one of the things could happen
is the complete destruction of the
democratic party
how many let me put it into a a formula
is is it not true wouldn't you say this
is true
there is a number of immigrants who
might come come across the border
in a biden administration
some number would be okay meaning that
biden would still be able to explain it
away even if it
you know was big and people didn't like
it and they were complaining
that'd still be something he could
handle right and
people are unhappy about lots of things
but there is a theoretical number of
immigrants
that makes the democratic party
disappear
now not in the sense that the people
coming across wouldn't vote democrat
but what would be the point of the party
if they just opened the border
could they ever get elected again so
let me put it down to this there is some
number of immigrants
which is not up to us if we're not
tightly controlling the border it's up
to the immigrants
how many come there is some number that
will make voting democrat
ridiculous because as some number it
destroys the country
as some smaller number it helps the
country does everybody agree with that
by the way
is there anybody who would argue with
the the general statement
that there's some amount of immigration
done right that's absolutely good for
the country
i would say essential it's beyond good
immigration is essential there's no i
don't think you work around that
if you want a good country but there's
some number that would be too much
does anybody disagree with that that
there's some number that would be too
much
are we going to hit it the too much and
then what happens
we'll find out all right
um there's a big story that's just sort
of a fun story about
camel harris and the story goes that she
allegedly
plagiarized a story that martin luther
king told in a playboy interview in the
60s
and the the version that i guess martin
luther king told
was about some toddler kind of kid being
asked
why i think it was she was marching in a
freedom thing when
it's just a little kid who doesn't know
what they're doing and the little kid
said something like
feed him without knowing even how to
pronounce the word
the story was that she knew she needed
it the freedom is so basic
that even a child knows they need it
before they can even pronounce the word
pretty good story and then i guess
kamela harris's version is that she was
the girl
and she was in a march and she was asked
why are you there and she said not feed
them but
freedom and and
then she completed the story the same
way she couldn't say the word but she
already knew
it was essential now
would you say that was plagiarism
maybe here's my best guess
since we'll never know exactly we'll
never know if she read it and said yeah
i think i'll just use that
here's my guess my guess is she read it
once
and then formed a false memory
in which she actually believed she said
it
so uh there are maybe three different
explanations one is she
knew it was plagiarized and just lied i
don't think that's very likely actually
because it would just i don't know there
wouldn't be enough benefit for the story
if you knew you stole it it just
wouldn't be enough benefit
cost ratios it'd be a dumb thing to do
and it could be that it was true right
can you rule out the possibility that it
actually happened
no you actually can't rule out that
possibility
um but it sounds a little you know too
on the nose right could happen
so i'd go with false memory and one of
the things that people
don't realize the general public is that
what percentage of your memories are
false let me ask you this how many of
your memories from let's say
age all given age from age 20
and younger so however old you are now
if you're over 20
think about every memory you had from
age 20
to your first memory what percentage of
those
would you say are actual relatively
accurate memories
and what percentage of them are some
kind of weird
mash-up of fake memories
what's your guess would you say ten
percent fake memories and ninety percent
true
um i don't know if anybody knows the
answer that my
personal view is informed by you know
my hypnosis background it which is that
is closer to
more than 50 and when i say that more
than 50
are false memories i don't mean that you
didn't have that birthday and you didn't
get that pony
you know some of those things so that
the basics might be right
but a whole bunch of the stuff about the
context and the timing and
who is actually there and what you said
or who said what to whom
all of that's fake so something like 90
of your memories are artificial
things that literally didn't happen that
you remember
as if they did happen now like i said
the the big stuff did happen
you know you you really had a you really
had a little brother
you really had a family you know that
stuff
so that's what i think probably false
memory not much of a story except
freedom is a funny word it makes a good
meme i'm seeing a lot of
backwards thinking in the news here's
what backwards thinking
is forward thinking goes like this
i've got some data i use my sense of
reason to interpret the data and then i
come to a conclusion that's forward
thinking backwards thinking is you start
with a conclusion
and then you figure out what your
rationalization was to get there
and then you cherry-pick the data to fit
your rationalization
so that's backwards thinking the average
person
can't tell the difference between
forward thinking
and backwards thinking that's why you
learn when you learn hypnosis
first thing you learn basically is that
the average person doesn't know
when they're thinking forwards or
backwards
think about how big a problem that is
the average person can't tell
i'm looking at articles that you know
there's a george will article
uh criticizing ted cruz and republicans
for challenging the election now the
people who are doing this and i won't
pick on george will in particular
but anybody who's saying that ted cruz
is violating his oath of office
to serve the people or that he's uh
assaulting the constitution
by challenging this etc keep in mind
the only thing he asked for is a 10-day
audit
which is quite reasonable to ask for no
matter what they find
you would agree that we'd like to be
more confident in the outcome
so ted cruz is asking this completely
reasonable thing
can you look at the data and then look
at the data and use the reasoning and
come to a conclusion
george will and others write articles
and criticize them
with backwards thinking now what ted
cruz is doing is forward thinking
he says we don't have enough data we'd
like you to do an audit and then we'll
have data
then we'll assign reason and then we'll
have conclusions
his critics say we already know it was a
fair election
they start with a conclusion we know it
was fair
so therefore you must be crazy that's
the rationalization
or you must be attacking the
constitution or you must be
some kind of a cult member for the
president or you're dumb
those are the rationalizations thinking
backwards
and then you go back to the cherry
picked data now the cherry pick data is
if there are let's say 12 different
accusations of election fraud
you pick six of them that definitely
were not real
and you just talk about them so that's
backwards thinking the complete cycle
and you can see the difference right now
how many people
would read an article by george will and
realize
that it was literally backwards thinking
started with the conclusion
and worked backwards through the
rationalization all the way to the
cherry pick data
not many people i would bet not more
than
i don't know 5 out of 100 would know
that they had seen backwards thinking
they would imagine they saw forward
thinking they wouldn't know the
difference
and that's scary if you think about it
speaking of that we'll get more about
that in a moment so
the wall street journal says that the
new york stock exchange decided
after deciding to de-list a number of
chinese telecom companies
because they're too associated with the
chinese communist party you
and therefore the military and because
the telecom
equipment can be used for spying
among other reasons they want to de-list
them but the real reason for e-listing
is that they don't follow the same
uh reporting requirements as other
companies
so that decision has been
reversed according to the wall street
journal and that now they're not going
to be delisted
after they got together and talked about
it now i would
say the wall street journal may be not
reporting the news
exactly the way the the facts
would suggest because when i read the
actual article
it didn't sound to me like the way to
describe it was that they had
uh how they say it basically reversed
their decision
it sounds like what they're doing is
still thinking about it and they just
delayed the decision
so i think that we don't know what the
decision will be it looked like they
just said wait a minute we talked to
some people
we have to hold off until we know a
little bit more
so i don't know that was reversed it
might be just thinking about it
because i think they probably want to do
it all right here's everything that's
wrong with
the news and this applies to every topic
in the news in politics anyway probably
science as well
it goes like this the new york times has
a story
about a top election official in georgia
who systematically debunked this that's
their own phrase
so from the new york times they say that
gabriel sterling a top
election official in georgia
systematically debunked
president trump's false claims of voter
fraud in a news conference
so president trump on that uh phone call
that got leaked the audio that many of
you heard
he was talking to the uh the officials
at georgia and he was telling them all
of the
allegations that he was aware of or at
least some of them
of election fraud and he listed some
specifics
now the new york times says that this
official
from georgia held the news conference
and systematically debunked
what the president alleged so we're done
right
is there anything else to say the
president made some
claims the official who's closest to the
data
gave a news conference and he one by one
he debunked the claims
according to the new york times so
so that's the news and now you're
informed
right well there's one thing that the
new york times did not include
the response to the debunks
because do you think that when the
debunking happened
that the debunker listed everything that
the president said
or do you think maybe he debunked the
ones that are easy to debunk
and just maybe didn't mention the others
do you think that could have happened
did the did the new york times report
that when he debunked them he debunked
everything that the president said
i don't believe that they said
everything i believe they listed the
things he debunked
but wouldn't you want the story to say
and that is
everything that the president alleged
because i don't know if it was
i feel like they might have jerry picked
see the pattern yet start with a
conclusion
work backwards to the rationalization
and then the last step of backwards
thinking
you cherry pick the data so you pick the
ones that you can debunk
now i told you before this that i heard
the president's allegations
and even i knew that the ones i heard
were either mostly or all already you
know
falsified so i didn't think they were
necessarily real
but i also think that there are some
strong claims
still out there and this is where i
think the president
is underserved by his advisors i feel
like people are just afraid to tell them
the truth
so if you're listening mr president
would you just insist that your advisors
tell you
what these allegations you know tell you
that they've been debunked
or at least tell you that they've been
addressed so you know what the other
argument is that doesn't mean debunked
and that's actually my next point what
do you know
in any topic if the following things
happened
somebody makes a claim and somebody else
says this is my debunk of your claim
and that's it you're done and the two
people never talk or interact
there's a claim and then there's the
debunking claim
what have you learned exactly nothing
no information you have there because if
all you have is the claim and the
counter claim
you don't have anything you really have
literally nothing
but your brain doesn't think so your
brain says well that's a lot
because you know what your brain does
your brain says if you like the claim
the debunking is crazy if you didn't
like the claim that debunking sounds
pretty pretty solid doesn't it
pretty good so when you hear somebody
debunk and then that's it there's no
there's no interplay and
you know checking on people's
assumptions and making sure you're
talking about the same thing
you are seeing fake news so in the new
york times your paper of record
tells you that the the claims have been
quote their actual language
systematically debunked that is not news
here's what news would have looked like
systematically addressed
systematically responded to
right now wouldn't you say that would be
news
it's news that the president made a
claim and here are the claims
and it would be news that somebody who
is close to the data
addressed some of them
i don't know if it was all of them was
it all of them
i don't think so and some of them were
addressed by just saying
that didn't happen would you call that a
debunk
let me debunk um the claim that
uh that joe biden was elected president
watch me do it i'm gonna do it with the
same journalistic
integrity as the new york times and the
same authority
as the officials in georgia here's my
debunk
didn't happen didn't happen
are we good now did it happen
that's it now that's not news
that somebody just says something didn't
happen
news would be i made a claim somebody
said it didn't happen the person who
made the claim says
here's why i said it happened and they
talk about the evidence it's good or
it's bad
you talk about the context you make sure
you're on the same page
are you really talking about the same
thing well then that would be news
and i would like to hear that but here's
a claim and here's the debunk
that's propaganda let me say that again
anytime you see in the news it doesn't
matter if it's left leading news
or right-leaning news
if you see it's just a claim and a
debunk that's propaganda
every time it's just propaganda news
would be more of a conversation all
right
so here are some some of the debunks
they offered and the ones that i'll
agree with you remember the famous video
of
the the worker in georgia i forget which
county
and the video seemed to show that they
were sending people away
and then they took out the the secret
hidden ballots from under the table
that were in regular suitcases pretty
sketchy huh regular suitcases
why would you put a ballot in a regular
suitcase
but of course nothing like that happened
so when i watched when i watched the
video and it's the same video you all
watched
we watched the same video most of you
said
there it is it's right there there's the
fraud you can see it with your own eyes
and i watched the same video and said
nope
i don't see any of it absolutely none of
it
i see nothing there that even makes me a
little suspicious
here was the explanation the official
explanation
that the workers decided to quit
counting for the night
and they had all decided to quit but
when the news came down to the state
that they were going to quit
counting the state said you can't quit
counting
go back to work because these need to be
counted don't go home
so the people who thought they were
quitting counting had already
sent home the people who didn't need to
do anything while the rest of them were
cleaning up
and then when everybody else was gone
the news comes in oh you got to keep
counting
i know there were no observers i'm
telling you
how there were no observers that all of
the people thought that they were going
to all go home
but before they all went home the call
came in to keep counting
so the observers had gone home the rest
of them said oh crap we thought we were
going home
but now we're gonna have to take out
those ballots that we had stored safely
in official ballot boxes with the tape
over it so you know whether it's been
opened
and they put them under the tables so
you know
probably part of the process and they
took them out and they were not regular
suitcases they were official ballot
things that just happened to be on
wheelies
for that very thing
hold on you're lying somebody says you
claimed you said
hold on the official story you believed
was that the shredders left
and the media followed that the
shredders left and the media followed
i'm saying the same thing
i'm saying that a whole bunch of people
left because
they thought that their role there was
done
is that different that the people were
told to leave and then they did
the news people thought that they were
done so they left
i think that's the same as what i said
somebody's accusing me of lying
there was something about a busted pipe
that was just maybe a toilet overflowed
that really happened but it didn't have
much of an impact on the counting they
just delayed for a little while
so here's the thing the state has an
explanation
and they say that they reviewed the tape
from beginning to end and there wasn't
anything on there that wasn't exactly
what they know
is legitimate except that
by accident when they thought they were
all going to go home
the observers and the press left and
they didn't call them back
you know they'd already gone home so
should those votes be counted if they
were not observed i think you'd make
that
you could make that argument i think
that would be a strong argument
actually but that was the explanation
given and what i saw on the
video didn't look like anything
except people just working here's what
else they said there was no triple
counting by the reprocessing
if there had been they would have picked
it up in the
the recount and no problem with these
so-called pristine ballots you know the
ballots are usually
folded when they're mailed but
apparently there were somebody sited a
lot of ballots that didn't have any fold
in them
which would suggest they were fake but
apparently there are legitimate reasons
why there are unfolded ballots
you don't need to know the details but
the official people say
no there are both folded ones and
unfolded ones the unfolded ones are
because
military blah blah blah is the wrong
size they have to transform it onto
something else
doesn't matter the details but there are
unfolded ballasts that are normal
how about um the shredders
so there's report that ballots were
being shredded
but that was just not true there was
shredding but it was the
i guess just the envelopes or something
that doesn't matter
so that was they claimed that wasn't
false uh there's claims about lots of
people using the same address
why is that a problem i'm not even sure
why that's a problem
now the the implication is that lots of
people at the same address
is a smoking gun for fake voters
but apparently most of them are let's
say there's a big
apartment building and so they just
have the same address as just the
apartments or
there are cases where i think homeless
people would use
some homeless facility or some kind of
you know place
as a common address because they're
homeless
now i don't have a problem with a
homeless person
using a fake address for their address
even if the law says they can't in my
opinion that would be one thing i
wouldn't want the court to even look at
why can't a homeless person vote why do
you need an
address like why how is that fair to a
homeless person
they should be able to just use any
address
and vote as long as they're real people
real citizens why not
so here's my point so the i'm not saying
that the
explanations i'm giving you are accurate
i'm saying that we have a situation
there were claims there were counter
claims
i don't know if they addressed all the
claims that's another problem
but we can't tell which one is true i
would say
in these cases the the debunks or
alleged debunks
sound stronger but there are some strong
claims out there the statistical claims
are very strong
so the statistical claims that say the
odds of this or that happening are so
remote
that you know fraud had to have happened
but the problem is
if you're the state and you're in charge
of the election
and somebody comes to you with a
statistical argument
what do you do about it you're in charge
of the election
and somebody says these statistics show
that there was
a mischief well you can do a recount
but what if the recount matches the
original count
because i think that actually happened
right at least to recount in some places
so if it matches and you're in charge of
the election
what the hell else are you going to do
so i think the problem with these
statistical arguments
are that it might be very persuasive to
you and it might be persuasive to me
but what can the people in charge of the
elections do about that
you can't really throw out the election
because a statistic
statistician said it looked unlikely
um then you have the claim from uh
jovan hutton pulitzer he's the
the technical guy that i talked about
and then people couldn't find the link
to it
so i've tweeted him again today you'll
find him in my twitter feed
if you want to find the technical person
who says that you can get into the
voting
systems there are a number of different
devices for
for i guess you know counting and voting
and stuff
and so there it's not like there's one
machine it's like a
connected machines and he said that he
can get into them and the wi-fi is open
the official state response is that it's
not
so what do you know so what is the news
so there's a claim by a technical person
that you can get into them
and that he did that he did
and he actually showed you a screen
print where you can show you know the
address the wi-fi
was it the i don't know what you call it
the wi-fi long code
that shows he had access to it i mean
i'm not a i'm not technical enough
that i would know if that proved
anything but certainly he has something
he's willing to show
everybody none of it's secret so so he's
made a claim and he says
i can show you that you can get into
those systems and change votes
here's my question would that show up in
a recount
i guess i have a general question which
is
how many claims of fraud of the various
flavors of claims
how many of them would be detected by a
recount
versus would they just be recounting
ballots that weren't
legitimate and just counting it a second
time does a recount capture
only some kinds of fraud or does it
capture everything that could be
captured
i don't know i would think it wouldn't
capture all of them
would it because because if you read the
news it's almost as if
when you have a recount we're supposed
to believe that all fraud has been
eliminated as a possibility
does that not feel like what the news is
telling you
that if a recount that that is good
that matches or close enough to the
original vote that you could say oh we
did a recount
so there you go but a recount is not
exactly an
audit is it i'm seeing that in the
comments right
and audit would be more comprehensive i
would think an
audit would go get all the way into the
code of the
the voting machines and you know how
they're networked and all that stuff
but let's say here's here's the part
i've got this
you know uh black hole of lack of
knowledge
suppose somebody hacked into the voting
machines and changed the vote
would it would a recount discover that
because does and here's my question when
you vote on a voting machine
does it create a paper ballot or does it
just go
digitally all the way to the the final
database
because if it goes digitally to the
final database
then what good is counting ballots
that's just the
the mail-ins right so so i feel like
when anybody says that things have been
debunked
i don't know that they've even looked
into it so
the first trick of the fake news is if
there are 12
claims the claimants have made a
gigantic mistake
because if you know you know if they
make 12 claims
you're going to have at least six that
aren't true so what are the people on
the other side going to say
well they're not going to address the
six strong claims
they don't have to because they get to
say what they say and then walk away
it's a press conference there's no other
expert at the press conference
they just get to say what they say and
walk away debunk 6 out of 12 and we're
done
so if you come with 12 claims and 6 of
them
are weak you've done a really bad job
the president has done a really bad job
of persuasion really bad on on the
election and fraud stuff
because he's going with a laundry list
filled with known pretty much debunked
stuff
even that i would say is you know
reasonably certainly debunked
now does it matter how many things on
the list are debunked
would that tell you that the 12th thing
is not true
nope no correlation there could be a
hundred things debunked
doesn't mean 101 is also not true
there's no correlation
i suppose it could be but hypothetically
there could not be
so uh yeah recount is not an audit
so the fake news i believe is creating a
situation in which the
uh under-informed consumer which is most
consumers
will believe that the vote was audited
slash
recounted which i don't believe would be
a true statement
there have been some recounts in some
places certainly not what i did
and that all of the claims of fraud have
been debunked
and that's just not true here
here's a specific claim from this uh
jovan hutton pulitzer and i haven't seen
any debunk of that of you
the the georgia guy who talked about it
he didn't talk
he didn't mention it so
president trump was saying on his
recorded phone call that he wasn't even
talking about the dominion and software
stuff
because he thought the ballot stuff was
strong enough but
um maybe not so we'll see
all right um
there's a here's a micro lesson
so i'm going to start a micro lesson and
i'll probably ask my assistant to
cut this piece out and put it on the
locals platform
so if you like to see my micro lessons
on everything from persuasion to
improving your life to understanding
reality better and all that
that's on subscription platform
so sometimes when i do a longer
periscope but there's a lesson
embedded in it i'll just pick out the
lesson so that you can just see those
separately on locals
here's a micro lesson on hypnosis not
how to do hypnosis but a specific
question that people have been asking me
and the question is this can you use
hypnosis to get somebody to do something
that they don't want to do now when i
interviewed
nikki klein who was involved with the
nexium
organization which the news calls a cult
but that's an opinion not a not an
objective statement
when i was talking to her i said during
the interview that in my opinion
you can't have to you cannot hypnotize
people to do things that they don't want
to do
meaning that are deeply against their
you know ethical or moral or
self-interest
and um a lot of people disagreed and
there was a
gentleman uh eric hundley h-u-n-l-e-y
if you want to google him he's got a
youtube channel in which he
meant he brings up this point and he
talks about
the different opinions from a couple of
other professional
hypnotists who say the opposite they
they say yeah you know under the right
circumstances
you can hypnotize people to do pretty
much anything
now why is it that i say you can't and
to other
professional hypnotists you know even
more qualified than me
because they do it professionally why
would they say you can
but i say you can't well the difference
has is more to do with definitions than
with disagreeing
about the facts if you dug into each of
the individual facts
that the other two hypnotists claim to
be true i will also agree they're true
but we're only we're only differing on
definition and here's the problem
when you tell me can you make somebody
do something they don't want to do
with hypnosis i have limited my
definition of hypnosis
to a subject and a hypnotist
who are trying to do the same thing in
other words the subject wants to let's
say conquer a fear
and the hypnotist wants to help them do
that that's your normal subject
hypnotist situation now under that
situation
by definition the hypnotist is only
doing things
that the person wants they want to get
over their fear
so when i call it hypnosis
i mean a willing situation in which the
subject and the hypnotist are going for
the same objective
so it's more of a definition thing now
could the hypnotist plant unwanted
suggestions
and get somebody to do something that
they didn't want to do
yes they could could
could somebody who's not a hypnotist use
the same
tools of persuasion and get somebody to
do something that they really
didn't want to do and the answer is
yes in fact you see that happen every
single day
that would be called let's say uh
pre-suasion
like you prime somebody and then they
think they made up their own mind but
they don't know they were primed
that's a thing it's a book pre-suasion
uh
how about the the written by
childini gel diddy also wrote influence
before he wrote pre-suasion influence is
exactly a book about how people are
influenced
and don't know that they didn't make up
their own mind
so you can show that people think
they're making up their own mind but
they're actually just influenced
so is that somebody making somebody do
something they didn't want to do
how about advertising how about
propaganda about the fake news
about selling how about marketing have
been negotiating
every one of those things gets you to do
something
you didn't want to do so if you ask me
can you make somebody do something you
that they didn't want to do
with hypnosis i say how about just get
rid of the word hypnosis
can you get people to do things they
didn't want to do
by talking to them or you know exposing
them to
you know stimulation the answer is yeah
all of these things do it advertising
does it marketing
negotiating all of them let me make it
even simpler
let's say you planned to get some work
done today and you were going to work
hard and today was going to be a real
good work day
and your best friend calls you and says
hey it's a great day do you want to golf
and you say no i had today you today was
going to be work
i'm not going to golf i'm going to work
and then your friend is like
it's not going to be this good every day
you know and you could
you could work tomorrow and that work
will still be there
and by the way you promised me that you
would golf with me the next time it was
a good day
and then finally you say
all right let's just go golf
so is that an example of you being
hypnotized
to go golf instead of work
and the answer is yes yes it is that is
an example of you being hypnotized
but you wouldn't call it that you simply
used a tool of hypnosis
which is directly asking for something
maybe
you know comparing it to something else
using the the concept of shortage it's
like ah there won't be many great days
uh reciprocity i did this favor for you
why don't you golf with me you know you
can imagine a whole bunch of techniques
of hypnosis
but they're just a conversation it's
just you and your friend talking
would you ever say that your friend
forced you to do something
you didn't want to do or would you say
no i did what i want to do
i simply changed my mind about what it
was i wanted to do
that's probably how you would filter it
you'd say no i just
i did what i want to do i just changed
my mind about what i wanted to do
or did you because you wouldn't have
changed your mind without that friend
saying and doing the right things that
friend
hypnotized you against your will
because your will was not to go golfing
and you did so this opens up an
interesting question about
free will i would say that as a person
who does not believe that free will
is a real thing it's just you know an
imaginary concept
and that we are we are all just subject
to physics
and whatever inputs are happening in the
chemistry of my brain
it's only going to go one way because
physics doesn't have
options i mean in in the sense that
matters to this conversation
so if my brain is going to do what my
brain does and it gets
one set of inputs that change what i
want would you say that i've done what i
didn't want
or would you just say i changed what i
wanted
so when it looks as if i am disagreeing
with those other cartoons
i'm sorry other hypnotists
not really and here's one difference
if you asked me could you get people to
do something that they don't want to do
i might shade my answer so that you
don't think you can
and a little of that is being ethical
because i don't want to tell you what
you really could do
because you might go do it and it might
not be
for the better better uh you know
betterment of the world so i'm not sure
that it would be healthy for the world
for hypnotists to say oh yeah you can
get people to do
things they don't want to do it's true
but you don't need any
hypnosis to do that you just need
persuasion
and that doesn't require a trance or you
know you're getting sleepy or any of
that
so there's my answer if you don't
believe in free will the question is
is useless anyway and if you believe
that all forms of
persuasions can get people to change
their mind about what they want
so dennis asks this question so
you're okay with lying uh
did something like that come out of my
mouth
that was okay with lying i don't believe
i said that
so um
there's your micro lesson on hypnosis
yes somebody's saying in the comments
right here uh tim
says have i been hypnotized to listen
every morning and the answer is yes
unambiguously yes and the simultaneous
sip
is overt i'm not hiding anything this is
completely transparent
i tell you why i'm doing it i do it
because it makes you addicted
it gives you a visual and you know
sensory trigger so you remember if you
liked it last time it
primes you like it this time if you like
the beverage
i'm making you pair a beverage you like
with some content
the the brands eventually merge so am i
hypnotizing you
to enjoy the simultaneous yes yes
but do you feel manipulated or do you
feel as if i'm making you do something
you don't want to do
because if i change your mind
and then you do want to do it what is
that
well since i don't believe in free will
it's just what it is it just
is a thing that happened that's all it
is all right
i believe i didn't have anything else to
say so we're going to end here
and thank you for listening and i will
talk to you
tomorrow
all right periscopes off it's just you
and me here on youtube for a moment
uh we constantly reevaluated our
decisions that's right
so what happens if you just change your
mind
how do you know why uh
most important thing that you've seen in
the last four years is to treat uh
journalists as politicians that's right
yeah there's there's no there's not much
real journalism anymore
you know glenn greenwald does it
but there's not a lot of few not a lot
of people doing the real stuff
um is body language the same as mind
reading
not not as a scientific basis and i
think it does
uh comment on the crossfire about lauren
southern i haven't watched that yet
all right that's all i got for now i'll
talk to you tomorrow i gotta travel
see you later
