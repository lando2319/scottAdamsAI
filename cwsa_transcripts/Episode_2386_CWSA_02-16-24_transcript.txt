[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human
civilization um man do we have a fun day
today of news I mean it's not fun if
your name is noal that's we'll get to
that but uh for the rest of you if you'd
like to take this experience up to
levels that you can not even understand
with your human brains all you need for
that is a cuper m a glass of tanker
chalis Stein a canteen Jugger flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid ey like coffee and join
me now for the unparallel pleasure of
the dopamine here the day the thing that
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous siping happens now
go ah I was sipping off the drags but
they were good drags as it turns
out well will I get to the big stories
yes I will we'll talk about funny and
we'll talk about naalii and we'll talk
about Tucker and all that stuff but
first some pallet uh
cleansers um there there's a report
today in one publication saying that
people are returning their apple Vision
Pro goggles because they give them
headaches and Ice Rin and they're heavy
and somebody even bursts a blood vessel
now do you think that's true or do you
think this is marketing by
meta you think it's true there were
there were days when I would I remember
when I was young I would have read a
story like that and I was said to myself
huh uh maybe I won't get that product
because there's somebody saying that you
know they're returning them and it hurts
them but in today's world I say to
myself do they have a big competitor who
has an enormous influence on other
organizations yes they do Meta Meta
would like you to buy their version of
this and not the Apple Vision Pro so do
I have any evidence to suggest that meta
is behind this story that is
conveniently planted in the Press I
don't but I definitely don't believe
it because we live in a world where this
would be a normal marketing thing to do
to you plant a fake story in the Press
I'm not saying they did that but it
would be such a routine ordinary thing
to do no I don't believe this story it
might be true but I don't believe it
there's a story that 77% of Young
Americans are too fat mentally ill on
drugs or more to join the military
according to the Pentagon
77% of Young Americans to Fat mental ill
on drugs
h well okay
um does that
matter the here here's the weird thing
you say to yourself well obviously yeah
you don't want soldiers who can't carry
a backpack or a gun of course it matters
but does it matter if most of your
military will soon be people wearing the
Apple Vision Pro goggles or possibly the
metag goggles and just steering a drone
or a robot on the battlefield because
I'm pretty sure you could be pretty fat
mentally ill and still get that job
done it might not
matter it might actually not matter
we're right at the cusp of where having
fit soldiers probably doesn't make any
difference at all are you watching the
Ukraine uh Russia War atll uh here
here's a story you haven't
heard uh Russia is winning because their
soldiers are uh stronger and fitter less
fat and more mentally
capable nope because it turns out that
the soldiers don't have much to do with
the war the soldiers are the people you
kill until one side says no I'm tired of
you killing this one kind of person of
mine well we're not killing your women
all right all right keep going but
you're killing all our young people are
young people who are the future no we're
not killing anybody who's the future you
got plenty of in you'll be fine so I'm
not even sure that I accept the premise
that our military needs to be
fit um you know beyond beyond the
Special Forces obviously they've got to
be super fit but the average person is
just there to be a
Target most of the military exists to be
a target for the other side so dying is
their primary function they're just
hoping the other side dies at a higher
rate so that they give out faster
yeah so all right here's my favorite oh
that's not my favorite because we got so
many fun stories you know Rachel
LaVine in our government uh a trans um
person is uh gave it did a little video
in which uh Rachel said that climate
change is having a disproportionate
effect on the physical and mental health
of black
communities all right let me get R
you've got a trans
person saying that the black community
is disproportionately affected by
climate
change this might be the
final uh
intersectional uh
destination you know you've heard about
intersectional theory that there would
be let's say for example somebody who is
both black and lgbtq for example and
that would be you know two two bits of
discrimination that they might be up
against instead of just one but now the
news has gone
intersectional when you've got your your
your trans people talking about climate
change hurting black communities the
most I think you can just ignore all of
that I don't even know what to do with
that what do I even do with that that
the the level of absurdity is just so
far off the
charts it's crazy all right um You might
be aware that uh few days ago there was
a New York City video of people in the
30s running around and looking all
healthy and thin and I made a comment on
that that it looked like our food our
current food sources are
poisoned now if 77% of Young Americans
are too fat uh and also mentally ill run
drugs but a lot of that's the food
source so do you think that our food
source and the poisoning thereof of it's
deeply unhealthy does that have an
impact on uh Homeland
Security
apparently if you believe that our
military has to be able to run and carry
things and be healthy yes yes so I get a
big response uh there were 7 million
views ultimately last time I checked
might be higher uh Elon Musk weighed in
commented on it that probably gave it a
boost then Bill lman weighed in also
noting that our food supply is really
questionable and at the same time tuer
Carlson's over there in Russia showing
us videos he made while well he's not
there now but showing videos he made in
Russia when he interviewed Putin showing
that their food is uh cheap and
plentiful over there and they don't have
GMO stuff stuff
so that's just sort of a context thing
but then uh RFK Jr I think it was day
before yesterday or yesterday uh posted
a a big thing talking about uh our food
supply is basically
poison now that's some that's some big
names who on the same day were willing
to say um we can't ignore our food
supply there's something deeply wrong
with it
clearly there's something deeply deeply
wrong with our food supply I think it's
poison I mean I don't think that's even
not intentional poison but effectively
poison all right so we'll see if that
turns into anything if it does that
would be an example of the xplatform
really making a difference because if it
if it makes this a higher priority that
would be really good for the
country all right uh John Stewart's
getting blasted Ed by some democrats for
his quote B
sideris in other words uh Sean
Stewart uh you think GMO is another hoax
somebody says could be
um apparently the Democrats don't like
it when John Stewart goes after both
sides because he's been off the air so
long that going after both sides doesn't
seem like the right thing to do
anymore
so poor John Stewart we'll see if he can
break through I do like his
bothsidesism and I would say that he
would know you know he would be morally
bankrupt if he were not bull cider ISM a
little bit so I'm I'm still GNA vote for
him uh let's let's say I still support
his uh show I haven't watched it yet but
I I plan to and if he keeps going after
both both sides and keeps making
Democrats angry and maybe makes
Republicans angry at the same
time I would be pretty happy with that
so keep going John Stewart let's see
what you can do too early to say yes no
thumbs up thumbs down but I like where
he's
heading there is a huge AI breakthrough
that many of you will say to yourselves
I don't even think that's a big thing at
all I thought we could already do that
but we really couldn't so Rowan CH young
who's got a great um posts on X about AI
almost every day uh it says Google
Google just uh dropped their Gemini Pro
1.5 that's their next version of AI and
it has a million token contact
strength now that doesn't mean anything
to you but apparently it's just an
enormous move ahead such that you can
the model can Now understand entire
books full movies and podcast series all
in one go
so in theory I could just say look at
all of my
podcasts and this new Google AI would
just look at all of them and know
everything I've ever
said everything I've ever written I
could just tell to look at my book look
at this book and in like a second it's
going to know my whole book and be able
to talk about it intelligently
forever all
right so apparently this surpasses all
other chat Bots now at the same time
there's a um what was it called sora a a
new version of uh new movie making Ai
and you can talk into reality of the
movie now that only does like a minute
or something or it does small chunks but
obviously that will turn into entire
movies pretty soon but here's what is
obvious to me so I I have a book or two
that I would like to turn into movies
God's debris and I'm waiting for the
moment I can you know just have an AI
and talk it into existence because what
I'd like to do is just feed the entire
book into an AI and say make it a
movie because it's all there all the
descriptions the scenes now it might
make it into a movie that I didn't
imagine in other words it could change
the scenery in a way that wasn't in my
mind and then I could just say hey redo
that but but make the scenery you know
more darker and for boing or something
and it would just be a new movie well
everything else would be the same
now I don't think we're going to get
there at least for a long time I don't
think the movie that I don't think AI is
going to produce a movie that you would
watch just the way it cranks it out I
think you're going to need a director
slash um
producer whose job is it to know how to
manipulate
AI because there and probably there will
be more than one one AI needed for every
project so if there is somebody who has
already learned enough about Ai and I
don't know if the tools are quite there
but maybe another month they will be um
I might be in I might be in the market
to hire a producer or a director
somebody would say I will spend one
month uh using AI tools to turn this
into a movie so we'll
see it's close uh Stephen King is real
mad at Elon Musk and he wrote uh dear
Elon uh Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter
Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter
Twitter Twitter Twitter and so on and
then he closes it off with your
need to put your personal brand on
everything now I said to
myself I was trying to imagine Stephen
King looking at the news and saying to
himself hm let's see look at the news
all the stories in the news you know
what the thing that bothers me the most
is a guy spent $44 billion and then
wanted to change the name of the thing
you bought so that we didn't confuse it
with the past thing which was piece of
 and apparently totally
biased and was a a violation of free
speech I wonder why it changed the
name but Elon made some reference to
maybe Stephen King was drinking
something and I would like to give you
this advice which I've given you many
times if you see somebody acting like
this like Stephen King was acting assume
they're drunk and just call them out for
being drunk uh which I did you I just
said I assume you're drunk and in my
experience they all stop
immediately because he probably was
drunk I mean I'm only basing that based
on the output not on any other knowledge
it looks drunk to me so why not just
assume that's what it
is because if you assume he's drunk your
your mind is completely calmed because
you go oh I don't even need to respond
to that he's just drunk and the number
of times I've asked my trolls if they're
drunk and they just completely go silent
which is unusual for a troll you know if
somebody with a big account engages them
then they get all excited and they come
in their pants and they have to tell all
the friends and they make screenshots
and then they they usually start with
this screenshot that
says I I guess I guess this person with
a big account had nothing else to do
today except respond to me you know and
they're all really happy that they got a
response that's what a real trolled us
but I'm I swear if you you should try it
yourself just ask them if they're
drinking and it will just
stop it's like the best trick
ever all all right we are going to talk
about funny Willis how many of you were
transfixed and stuck to your screen
watching the uh the uh the what would
you call it the cor case was it a
proceeding what would be the right name
for it a court
proceeding um so they're trying to
decide if funny the da who's going after
Trump in Georgia fton County uh if she
should be uh removed from the case and
the IT centers around whether she uh
hired her boyfriend and overpaid him and
then she repaid him with um trips and
whether she reimbursed him for those
trips or not and whether she lied about
the beginning of the um the thing now
she lied in some official document we
don't know that for sure but if she lied
that'd be a big problem because she's
going after Trump for similar kinds of
stuff so here are the
following um observations number one
even
MSNBC one of their legal analysts uh
said that uh she probably will be
disqualified because she allegedly lied
to the
court and it's epic and it's Monumental
so this is an MSNBC person and uh and
there probably game over and she'll be
disqualified so correct me if I'm wrong
this is the most dangerous of the Trump
legal jeopardies and it looks like at
the very least it will be delayed until
after the election making it a moot
point yeah it looks like Trump is
winning as hard as you could win at the
moment in fact Trump has never had a
better two weeks in his
life so uh I'm seeing in the comments
that turly says no would that be that
there's a possibility that
um that it won't be delayed or that she
won't be removed from the
case I'll look into that afterward and
so I've told you before that anytime
Jonathan
Turley has an opinion on a big legal
case I just stop what I'm doing and I
assume he's right and if I said anything
different I'd try to correct it yeah so
he's all he's all over this and I'll
talk about him in a moment so here are
the some of the things people are saying
number one there's a story that says she
was wearing her dress
backwards now I'm told in the comments
this morning that that's not true and
that it's a different dress than the one
found out online in which the the little
uh thing you tie would be in the
back uh so it the dress online does look
exactly like her dress backwards in my
opinion so I don't know if it's I don't
know if it's true yeah I don't know if
it's true so it's funny
though and then somebody else says her
uh she had American flag pin that was
backwards or something I don't know if
any of that's
true but I will tell you that she had a
bad case of liar
face I've told you what liar face
is liar
face um is when your eyes don't match
your mouth now I've said before that
it's when you're smiling in a way that
doesn't match the eye but it's anytime
the the mouth and the eyes don't match
so did you see her eyes when she came
out to the stand the the the wide open
eyes and then the
frown so she her eyes were super
open but her frown didn't match her
eyes it's really obvious I'll show you
the picture actually if I didn't show
you this
already so look
at now the reason I do this is so you
can recognize it in other people so this
this is not even about funny it's just
so you can recognize it right can you
see it I'll show you on each platform so
look at the eyes then look at the mouth
that there there's some kind of in
congruity between the eyes and the
mouth and when you see that and by the
way she doesn't always have it that's
that's not her normal resting face if it
were a normal resting face it wouldn't
mean anything it's it's the face she
adopted for this situation that's what
makes it mean
something so she's got a bad case of
liar face um some people are saying that
she's bombastic and unlikable and uh
she's basically making yourself look
like not a sympathetic character some
say but the New York Times says opposite
it says that she's the funny is finding
out what many black women have found and
you've got a a bunch of men white men in
wool suits who are trying to attack this
beautiful creature uh in her glowing
Ruby outfit or whatever color it is
that's actually what the New York Times
was
writing I swear to God that is a real
thing that
happened it's hard to know what I'm
joking because the news is so absurd at
this
point so anyway she she apparently uh
was doing stupid things for somebody who
knows the law because she kept
volunteering too much and then she also
acted uh she acted belligerent and you
know in a way that you might expect a
judge would find her in contempt because
she was a little bit a little bit too uh
let's say uh pushing back a little too
hard compared to what you would expect
in the
courtroom now did you know that the
judge in the case uh used to work work
for her did you know that how many knew
that the
judge the judge actually worked for
her yeah now imagine if you didn't know
that how many times have I told you that
if the only thing you know is what the
news reports of what happened you don't
know
anything what happened doesn't tell you
a thing the only thing that matters is
who and who they're connected to that
tells you everything
so um some say that the judge who used
to work for
her uh let's say where did you work for
uh previously worked for district
attorney fols for uh almost four
years now just think about the fact that
you didn't know that some of you did
know that but what if you didn't
wouldn't it look completely different
now one of the questions is why wasn't
he being tougher
onor I have three
theories for that number one uh he knew
he was being televised the judge and he
didn't want to you know put too heavy
hand on it because it would look like
maybe he was influencing the outcome if
he if he was too tough on anybody maybe
so maybe it had only to do with the fact
that it was public and it was
high-profile so yeah if you look at for
example in NBA game basketball you might
see a lot of uh
smaller U smaller fowls get called but
then they get in the playoffs or the
finals and the the refs will what they
say let them play in other words the
things that might have been fowls before
they they'll be less likely to call them
because they just want to play like just
you know let's give us a show just play
so it could be that because it was
public the judge was just going to let
him play and not call as many fowls
maybe I don't know enough about that
world but I'll put that out there as a
hypothesis the other hypothesis is the
obvious
one a skinny white guy cannot uh be
tough with a black woman if anybody's
watching or even if they're
not right now remember I said the other
day that uh it's just a basic universal
truth that white men are afraid of black
women
period I don't know about anybody else I
don't know if black men are afraid of
black women but I know that black women
do have a privileged um place in society
in the sense that so many people are
afraid of them literally afraid that
they they they just have a little more
flexibility a little more freedom to do
things and get away with
it now some of it is because of being
female would you agree that a female can
get away with worse behavior let's say
during an arrest you know let's say if a
cop pulled over a female and the female
resisted the cop would be
like there's not a lot of danger
involved here so probably wouldn't treat
it the same as if it were male who are
actually dangerous so females you know
you're going to get treated differently
um and then being black and female
probably gives you some
intersectional defense as well but I'm
going to add a third hypothesis that
maybe has nothing to do with race maybe
has nothing to do with
female and here here this one's my
better
hypothesis um I've told you this one
before it's the it's the uh Indian
elephant trainer theory of persuasion
the Indian elephant trainer so this
imagines there's a over in India there's
an elephant trainer and the reason that
the little 100 pound Indian trainer can
beat the crap out of a full-grown
elephant and like just hit it with a
stick and the full grown elephant will
be like oh okay I'll do what you want
don't worry oh fine fine now that
elephant could just turn around and
stomp that guy to death could pick him
up with a trunk and use him as a hammer
but it doesn't and the reason it doesn't
is that it was trained as a baby that
this person can hurt you it doesn't
realize it grew up
so you can train something when it's
young to not know that it has the power
when it's
older the judge used to work for fonnie
for four years how do you think how do
you think fonnie treated that that
lawyer when he was a lawyer do you think
that what you see on the stand is
completely only because she's in this
specific situation or are we seeing
something about her combative
personality is it possible that she
abused him for four years and that by
the time he got to be a judge he was
like the elephant who had grown up but
she had beat him as a baby elephant for
so long that by the time he was a giant
elephant a judge and he had control over
her he didn't quite know
it because he seems to be acting like
she's in
charge is that what you say if you watch
it's a little bit like she's in charge
and others have have observed why does
it act like she's in charge like she's
just offering her own testimony and
saying things that uh you as a witness
you're not supposed to do but she's
getting away with
it so it could be three things it could
be a little bit because it's in public
could be a little bit in in meaning that
he's just letting them play he's not
calling fowls he just wants to get
through it could be that
could be that uh he just can't go hard
against a black woman who has a
high-paying job in America today could
be totally that could be this is the way
he is all the time we don't know right
we don't know the we don't know the
context the context might be that if you
were in the courtroom with this judge in
any other case maybe it would look the
same so let's not assume he's acting
differently because I you don't know
that right you don't know if he's acting
differently so to be fair to the judge
might be just the way he is all the time
and it might work just fine maybe he
gets good results I don't even know if
there's anything wrong with it U but the
other possibility is that the Indian
elephant trainer and that's the one I
would put my money on actually all right
what else is happening
uh apparently uh lawyers pay for lots of
things in
cash so what of the story parts of the
uh defense I guess you if you could say
F's defense
is that when she and her boyfriend
traveled um she would reimburse him so
there might be there might be records of
him paying for some part of the trip say
the hotel or something but she would
reimburse him with cash so that there
wouldn't be any not not so there would
be no record she's saying she did
reimburse him with cash and therefore
there would be no record of it and she
was asked if there would be a record of
her withdrawing the money and she she
was clever enough to indicate that maybe
she wouldn't be withdrawing the same
amounts in other words there's no reason
that the amount you withdraw would ever
match the amount you gave to
somebody because you would withdraw more
than you're going to give to any one
person right and you might withdraw it
several times and then just give a bunch
of it to somebody so you wouldn't really
be able to line up the
withdrawals from how much you gave
away except that she said she had a
habit of keeping up to $99,000 in
cash what what is your ATM withdrawal
level
limit it's like $800 or a
thousand so if you in order to build up
enough cash to pay for an overseas
vacation how many times would you have
to go to the
ATM probably
several unless unless you did it at the
desk
um so would there be records of that
I don't know that we'll ever
check so let me ask you this how many of
you bring cash on foreign trips the
reason she gave is that you could
negotiate with the locals with cash and
get better
deals uh I've well I brought cash right
the most cash I've ever brought on a
vacation um this would be AA a vacation
with four people like a
family so as the person paying the bills
for the entire family for a let's say
Mexican you know Cabo vacation
definitely not more than
$1,000 not more than a thousand for a
family of four and and that's that's a
high-end vacation you know at a staying
at a nice place now is she really
telling us that she would
travel to these somewhat more dangerous
places without thousands of dollarss in
cash
really I don't think anybody does that
and then her uh her alleged lover there
um said that it was not unusual for
people to pay his law firm with large
amounts of cash like actual dollar
bills does that sound real there's not a
single part of this that sounds honest
so I mean even if they do have massive
amounts of cash is it's not for legal
stuff it's to conceal
something so I was just trying to uh
imagine what it must be like to be
Trump because he must be glued to this
thing Trump is winning so hard he is
winning so hard because she's coming off
as a liar and a
crook and he's just sitting home
watching the biggest thing will probably
be delayed
Etc so I could not enjoy this more I
can't wait I don't know if her dress is
on backwards but it's a fun little
detail to add to it probably not I
suppose if I had to if I had to bet on
it I would bet her dress is not on
backwards but I love the story I love
the story by the way speaking of
dangerous foreign places um my my
neighbor just got robbed house was
broken into last last night so last
night while I was sitting in my house my
neighbor's house the the upstairs uh
balcony door was kicked in and his house
was robbed while he was at the gym
that's the second time my neighbors have
been hit by I'm sorry uh the second time
my neighbors have been hit in the past
year by what looks like an organized
Central American gang or South American
yep
so do you think they'll get me next now
keep in mind our neighborhood is
bristling with security cameras so every
person who comes in and out we have
their license plate so today we're you
know reorganizing and everybody's
checking their checking their cameras
and yeah if we can narrow down the time
the hard part is just narrow down the
time if we can get it within an hour
we'll probably have five different
angles of the
car yeah but it's narrowing down the
time that was the problem in this
now in my case I have very visible
security
cameras um if I could give you one piece
of advice if you have security cameras
don't make them like little invisible
things they should be right in the
driveway like like my main camera is
literally looking right at you from the
driveway if you walk anywhere around the
house you're going to look right at a
camera right I'm I'm watching you at the
same time every time so and and by the
way I have two I have two security
systems so if one was down the other one
would get you two video security systems
you're never going to get the other one
you'll never find it so I got one hidden
and one
visible plus my neighbors have cameras
on my front
yard so so I've got at
least I don't even know how many cameras
around my house but it's a lot and if
you got inside my house and you made a
bad calculation and I was in there at
the same time it will be a fight to the
death just so you
know if you get inside my house it's
going to be to the death I just just
want everybody to know there will be no
survivors um might be me who gets killed
but I'm definitely not going to take
that as a as a friendly
visit
okay uh let's see what else is going on
um ABC News uh this was a surprising
headline it said that uh now it's coming
from ABC
News who generally you don't assume
would be Trump friendly right you don't
think of them as Republican friendly but
look at this headline uh ABC news said
that the the economies in the red states
do much better than the economies in the
other
states and they actually reported that
now are you
surprised yeah are you surprised that
that lately and this is like recent news
that they say the best performing States
voted in favor of trump according to a
ABC News
analysis so are you surprised that they
would cover the news Straight Like That
without any
spin well of course that didn't
happen so they talked to an economist to
explain it and here's how The Economist
explained that the red states were
having better recently recently they
were doing
better he said it was because people
like warm
weather so they were moving to the warm
States that's an economist an economist
said it was the
weather now what the economist didn't
mention
is wasn't it always warmer in Florida
than New
York do we remember a time when that was
reversed oh I remember when I lived in
New York we wouldn't go to Florida
because it was too cold down there in
the
winter um is there anybody at ABC News
who could call out the economist for
noting that the weather's not really
ever
changed but wait there's
more turns out that the power of the red
States is really centralized the
economic power it's because they have
blue City ities within the red States so
it's the blue cities that are driving
the rest of the red state to look good
plus the
weather plus the
weather
yeah do you remember do you remember
when you thought the news was
real does anybody remember
that I was trying to think when it was I
realized that none of the news is real I
mean it was definitely
2016 but even before that I thought
before that I thought the news
was I maybe sometimes wrong but that's
really all I thought about it I didn't
know that it was just absolutely
completely fake I mean this is just the
fakest news you've ever seen they find
good news for republicans and they they
just torture the news until it says
something bad about
Republicans all
right um yeah we'll talk about
only
so um Putin's biggest critic who is
still alive because apparently being
Putin's biggest critic is not good for
your life expectancy there's a long list
of his critics who've suspiciously died
they have trouble falling off the
balconies so one of the reason that I
know uh that my neighbors were not
robbed by Russians is that uh they got
on the balcony and kicked in the door
and got out but none of them fell off
the balcony and died so we can we can be
sure they were not Putin critics because
they never would have got near that
balcony because that's pretty deadly to
a
Critic so uh so novaldi was allegedly uh
seemingly healthy you know the day
before he died there's some video of him
doing a testimony from jail he looked
alive then and they say he just went for
a walk in his prison yard and fell over
and died because that happens all the
time so everybody assumes that Putin had
him murdered right in front of the world
as a as a message to the rest of his
critics which I think they received my
guess is the rest of his critics message
received message received now uh what
are the responses to this well
representative Eric swell from my area
he said uh Putin murders navali the same
week Donald Trump invites Russia to
invade Europe and mega Mike Johnson the
speaker blocks a to Ukraine this isn't a
coincidence it's the green light Putin
has been
given that's right because Putin is
responding to the guy who isn't the
president of the United
States
that is just funny
just
funny uh I responded to swalwell's post
with my own and I said uh it was uh
clever for Putin to kill his critic in
prison while the January Sixers are
still incarcerated and Biden is trying
to jail
Trump America will have to sit this one
out we have no moral
Authority we also have no leader unless
it's Jill there Jill in
charge so let me say this as just as
clearly as I possibly
can I'm not a big fan of Putin's
murdering people I do believe he has
murdered people I'm not a fan of
anything else he's doing in particular
although I do believe tuer Carlson when
he says that if you buy a cheeseburger
in Moscow it's priced quite
reasonably I think I can hold both of
those thoughts let's see if I can do it
um
cheeseburgers very
affordable but
also uh Putin brutal dictator how can
those two things both be
true oh I'm trying to combine them but
my brain is exploding how can I possibly
think that food could be affordable at
the same time there's a murderous
dictator it's hard but I can do
it uh but let me say this clearly as
possible um I do not believe that
America has any moral Authority that
would make us better than murdering your
critic in
jail we are literally trying to kill our
critics in jail we meaning the Biden
Administration they are literally using
lawfare to T take people's freedom away
they are literally using the government
to take our freedom of speech away they
are literally using the government to
take our Second Amendment rights away no
we're not even a little bit not even a
little bit better than that morally not
morally and ethically now we might be
better economically you know maybe our
military is a little bit better stuff
like
that and you we we might have a whole
bunch of advantages for example it's
still it's still better to criticize the
government if you're in America than in
Russia that can be true let's see if I
can hold those two thoughts in my head
watch this now this will Amaze Democrats
that I can do
this we are abusing people for their
free speech and trying to limit it in
the United States with the government
using the social networks as part of
their you know non-government mechanism
to do it hold that in my head at the
same
time we're still better than Russia oh
oh how do I combine those two thoughts
they're so
different I'm doing it I'm doing it
right now now watch this combined no
problem I wake up every day and wonder
if the Biden Administration will put me
in jail for trumped up
charges really like
literally if I went to Russia would I be
afraid Snowden seems to be doing
okay Tucker didn't seem to have any
problems now I'm only joking a little
bit here I'm not going to move to Russia
because I don't think it's really safer
but we have no
moral no moral
justification we we cannot say that
we're better than this we are not better
than this we're exactly this and let me
ask you this if we assume the obvious
that Putin gave the order to kill him
and it was now do you think it had to do
with our political
situation of course it
cuz Putin is pretty freaking smart no
matter what else he is oh let me see if
I can hold the two thoughts uh he's a
brutal
dictator but he's also smart oh how
could they possibly be true at the same
time watch me do it I'm doing it right
now yes if I were going to murder my
critic in jail and let everybody in the
world know I murdered my critic in jail
I would do it while the Biden
Administration is trying to put Trump in
prison while the January Sixers are in
prison while they're trying to put uh
Peter Navaro in
prison no we're not better than this we
are this the reason Putin can do this
right in in front of you is because
he knows we're the same and it's
obvious all
right
um and it also calls into question who's
in charge
um so let let so you don't if you don't
think we're the same let me just read
you some news stories right this is not
even an argument about the same point
this is just the next thing that was
written on my
notes so just hold in your mind that in
Russia they kill their critics
totally different than America right so
now let me read just a coincidental of
the next story on my
list uh the Biden Administration is
going to give Nikki Hy Secret Service
protection but not RFK
Jr do you do you get it
now do you understand now is is there
any any questions they're doing this
right in front of us
now Putin
presumably murdered his critic in prison
and let everybody know he did it there's
nothing was hidden the Biden
Administration is creating a situation
of where RFK Jr is literally at risk of
being
murdered and they're doing it right in
front of you by giving probably Nikki Hy
Secret Service protection and in the
past they've given protection to people
in RFK Jr's
situation there's no other way
to interpret that is there is there a
second way to understand this story I
don't believe there is I believe this is
literally just
Naval they're they're trying to Naval
RFK Jr but just make it look like it's a
little more
accidental but it's pretty
intentional there was this would also
allow the CIA to murder him directly
like his uh
Uncle
allegedly yeah let me say that again
just so it didn't sound like an
afterthought by not giving him Secret
Service
protection it allows our CIA to murder
him as we believe they murdered his
uncle and if you heard that a a gunman
killed RFK Jr God forbid I don't want to
I don't want to think that into
existence do you think that we would
find
him nope
nope if anything happens to RFK Jr the
most predictable thing is that we won't
know who did it we might know who did it
but not
officially that situation is now fully
in
effect the CIA can literally kill RFK Jr
if he becomes more of a threat than he
is and they can just make the case go
away by saying we can't find the guy who
did it now if RFK Jr had Secret Service
protection do you think that they would
be able to murder him and be just as
confident that they could get completely
away with it it'd be harder because that
would be a lot more people would have to
be in on the plot and far less
likely so yes I believe this is exactly
what it looks like I don't believe
there's like any extra story that goes
along with this it's exactly what it
looks like Biden trying to murder his
opponent just like Nel
Nal well uh speaking of Jonathan Charle
he's talking about how uh uh President
Joe Biden said that the special counsil
Robert her had been the one to ask Joe
Biden if he knew the date of the death
of his son Bo now Joe Biden got real mad
and came out said how the how in the
hell you know does he dare raise that um
and made it seem like a big deal that he
would even be asked that question we now
know that he did not ask that question
and that Joe Biden himself volunteered
the
topic uh and couldn't remember the date
and
that when he went in public to say that
the her report was wrong he lied about
what was in
there very very directly on a key point
you know about his memory so so either
he didn't remember what happened at the
testimony or he did remember and he lied
in front of the public about
it wow and as toley says uh if it is
true meaning that uh Biden is the one
who brought it up not the her people if
it is true this is not something that
the White House can simply correct with
a few brackets uh rewrites the corrected
version would read quote how in the hell
dare could I raise that when I raised
the question I thought to myself it
wasn't any of their damn business in
other words you can't say there's just
like a word that was wrong in
that basically you're going to have to
admit that he either doesn't remember
what
happened knew it those was the only two
choices
left well now that you know the uh full
Network that happened um we now know
through
Michael shellenberger reporting in Matt
taibe and remind me of the third
reporter Who's name I is less familiar
to me Alex uh gutch Alex gutch thank you
for that God I love being
live it's so good being fact checked
live like you really can't compare that
it's really amazing it's better than
having like a producer looks stuff up
because I can ask any question and
there's somebody in the audience who
gives me an immediate answer it's so
cool
anyway uh we know from their reporting
that uh the
CIA um in order I guess it was a must
have been an Obama approved Clinton
approved plan were going to get their
allies in other countries to spy on 26
specific Trump uh staff campaign people
and then packaged that up as something
suspicious so that then America would
have the legal precedent to look into it
as well and literally spy on the
campaign so Trump was right from the
Geto that they were literally colluding
to spy on his campaign probably one of
the top things the Democrats used to say
he was crazy and chaotic and dangerous
is that he was claiming he'd been spied
on when in fact he'd been spied on and
we know now know the
details
now there's also indication that maybe
the uh that Ukraine was one of the
countries used to spy on the Trump
staffers in other words Ukraine which
was already in the full control of the
CIA by then we just used a separate
country to act like it was a different
country when it never was it was just
our country that we were controlling to
act like something came from another
country so that we could act like that
was the presedent for us to be involved
legally in other words for America to
spy on the same
people wow we know that the CIA has
performed about 80 different coups in
other countries now there's a suggestion
that the point of the maralago raid was
to find a binder which um would explain
this entire collusion
situation now let me go back to the
Putin thing Putin uh allegedly and
probably murdered a
Critic in prison in front of the entire
world while we all
watched that's
bad uh just for Eric sell and some of
the other people I'm I'm labeling that
bad I want to be clear about that
murdering your critic in jail I don't
like it at all so I want I want to be no
ambiguity about that that that's bad
don't do it
even if it makes the cheeseburgers
cheaper Still Still I say don't do it
that's where my moral ethical line is I
don't care how cheap the cheeseburgers
are according to darker Carlson no
murdering your critic in jail in front
of the world bad it's
bad now let's compare that because we
like to uh we like to rank things by
their moral and ethical um qualities so
let's compare that to what uh Biden
Obama John Brennan the CIA and Hillary
Clinton did a massive campaign to create
a fake
um a fake predicate for investigating
Americans all
illegal and to do that they may have had
a binder that had all the details that
they tried to steal back and now they're
trying to put Russia or no now now
they're trying to put Trump in jail and
the January Sixers are all in jail so
that they could call it an Insurrection
when obviously they were trying to
correct a rigged election in their
view so who's the good
guy we're a lot better than Putin are we
huh we're so much better than Putin
no now how do you process the fact that
John Brenan is a free man
how do you process
that it answered all the
questions he's either running the
country John Brennan or he works for
whoever it
does I think you say that with some
certainty now because he'd already be in
jail with with the stuff that we already
know with what we already know there
would either be a massive investigation
of him or or he would be in
jail but nothing like that's happening
and you know it won't at least under the
current Administration right is there
anybody thinks that if you assume that
all the new reporting is correct and I
think it
is there's no risk he'll go to jail and
I think you found your man he's either
the man literally running the country
which is a possibility I don't think
it's the top possibility I I think the
top possibility is he's working for
somebody whoever that is is running the
country because if they can protect John
Brennan they are running the
country If This Were Russia there's only
one person who could do
that
right there's only one person in Russia
that could do that it would be
Putin nobody else could do
that so you just watch
uh the longer we go with no uh legal
ramifications for Hillary Clinton John
Brennan
Clapper uh you know you could argue that
Biden and Obama have some special
situation being
president but we're just going to ignore
all of that
right yeah I don't know about Comey
Comey might have
been Comey might be some kind of hybrid
weird situation I don't know exactly
what what his deal
was all right um and now CNN is
reporting that because the news cycle is
going so poorly um that a former FBI
informant who uh is being charged with
lying about Biden's role in uh in a
Ukrainian business the one you know
barisma so apparently uh comr and the
Republicans had said they had a x FBI
informant who said he had Direct
information that brisma was bribing um
Hunter and now he's been arrested by the
FBI for
lying so this allows the CNN to suggest
that the entire Biden took a bribe story
has been
destroyed but they will not report as
prominently they might report it but not
as prominently that the case does not
depend on that one guy that there is so
much evidence that you could take that
one guy out doesn't make that much
difference it would have been really
convenient to have such a good witness
if it were true but you could take him
out
now do you believe that the FBI is
acting legally and ethically and that
they have strong information that is
reliable that this individual lied about
what he
saw
maybe I mean trusting a Russian to not
lie would be you
know you're really going out on a limb
if you're going to believe the Russian
guy who was an FBI informant so he's a
very low credibility kind of character
who's had some issues before however in
this specific situation and giving the
full context of Badness by our own
country um I think there's at least a
coin flip chance that the FBI is
arresting to suppress his
story is that fair I think it's a coin
flip my my my take is that maybe he lied
and maybe he didn't and the FBI knows it
and they're arresting him anyway just to
take him out of the story and to change
The Narrative of the
story I would love to live in a country
where if the FBI arrests somebody you
think to yourself whoa there must be
some good evidence they did a
crime we're not in that country
absolutely not yeah having them arrest
somebody for purely political reasons
completely within the realm of
possibility now let me tell you
why do you think that the
FBI informed comr and his
associates uh or anybody in congress
that the person they were using as a
source uh they knew he
lied why didn't they
just say that now arresting him you
maybe they needed to not tip him off
because they waited till they came to
the US to arrest him so maybe they just
didn't want to tip him off but don't you
think that it would be the job of the
FBI to tell the the Congressional group
investigating that their main witness
was lying and the FBI knew it because
they had some kind of information that
you and I haven't seen why would they
arrest him
first none of that does that does that
track for you because it means they've
known for a while keep in mind that they
had to wait for him to come to the
United States to arrest
him which
suggests that for some time they've
known he was lying they knew
specifically why they had evidence he
was lying and that was not presented to
comr comr didn't hear about it until he
got arrested what's that tell
you well it tells you that there's
nobody dedicated to finding out the
truth that's for damn sure yeah you you
can you can rule out people are trying
to get to the bottom of what really
happened nothing like that's
happening uh although I think comr would
like to get to the bottom of it if it's
as dirty as he
thinks all right
um
so that's a it's a real good play by the
media because that the story of brisma
and the bidens is also complicated that
if you can get some lion pundits like a
like a Adam Schiff or a swell to go on
TV and just say well their witness was
just arrested by the FBI for lying what
would Democrats say about the entire
story they would say it must be a fake
story because that one guy just you one
part of a mass amount of information but
that one guy got arrested and they're
going to say that means the whole story
is false because that one guy
lied that's going to work by the way a
as a play for confusing Democrats who
don't get real news that would work
that's a really good play nicely done
nicely done in an evil
way um imagine being a Democrat right
now and watching the news and not being
on the
xplatform would that be
weird you wouldn't know what's going on
the literally the only place in the
world you can find the news that gives
you any context about any of these
stories is on X it's the only place now
so what do Democrats believe Democrats
have to be told that X is no longer a
free speech platform and there's just a
bunch of Mega
people because otherwise they might be
exposed to the you know the other side
of the
story now I'm going to ask this question
I've asked before but I got more
thinking about it um I get almost no
interaction with Democrats on X and
that's completely different from what it
looked like before Elon Musk took
over so did all of the Democrats go to
threads and yet threads is
unsuccessful it can't be that did
was there some change in the
algorithm so that Democrats never come
into contact with my posts so they don't
comment
maybe maybe because if the algorithm fed
me things they thought I wanted to see
it might reasonably give me more things
that agree with me uh and less things
that don't that's possible however I
have another theory that a massive
amount of the so-called Democrats that I
was uh wrestling with for the last
several years online were not
real that they were just they were just
Bots and trolls and paid probably so it
could be that Elon did a better job of
getting rid of the Bots and the
trolls and that they were never real in
the first place but I don't think so
because they sure looked real I mean
some of them looked like
Bots here's my other possibility I've
been told and I guess I need to fact
check on this I've been told that
Democrats employees some kind of a block
list is that a thing can you Mass block
everybody who is a person that it is a
thing why have I never seen that feature
does that feature exist within X or do
you have to use a third party to do
that and Is that
real it's an outside service but how
could they do it that you give them your
password so you must give them access to
your account right
because I've noticed that a lot of
stories that seem to have Democrats
weighing in are blocked to me meaning I
can't see the Democrat
quote am I on a mass
blocklist and and so have the Democrats
found a way to prevent other Democrats
from seeing the other side of the
story I think that might be happening I
don't know for sure so I need a fact
check on that and that's all they would
need you could go on X and be there all
day long as long as you made sure you
didn't accidentally see any real
news if you used the
blocklist that's pretty clever I don't
know if that's true so it's a I'm going
to say it's rumored and some of you are
saying it's true but I don't see
sources all right
um
so Thomas Massie reminds us uh about the
VAC the so-called vaccinations
that we got and he reminds us that uh
they kept having to change the
definition of a vaccination every time
we found out it didn't do what they said
so at first it didn't stop the spread so
they had to change vaccination so it
didn't say that and then they apparently
there wasn't good enough information
that had stopped the severity so they
had to back off on that uh I think I'm
getting this right I'm not sure if I'm
getting it right but just think about
the total amount of that
happened to the American citizens during
the
pandemic oh yeah RFK Jr just won a
massive uh case lawsuit about how the
truth about uh covid was various Co
things was suppressed by the government
working with social media companies so
um I'm not smart enough to know but some
observers are saying this is a gigantic
thing that we now have a court case
which demonstrates the government worked
with social media to deny the public
useful information about their
health let me say that again we now have
a
court validated
truth thanks to RFK Jr's lawsuit that
says that the government worked with
social media companies to deny the
public useful information about their
own
Health now let's compare that to uh
Putin killing his critic in
jail which is
worse that's easy we worse those are not
even close yeah the the suppression of
free speech in the context of useful
information about your health denying us
useful information about our
health for over 300 million
people versus killing one guy in jail
terrible oh let me hold on hold on let
me let me see if I could hold them both
in my mind uh uh it's terrible to deny
uh millions of people useful information
is true about their
health but wait it's also bad to kill
your critic in jail how could those both
be true at the same
time okay I'm doing it I'm holding them
both in my mind Look At Me Do
It
um okay
so yeah just remember the
pandemic
anyway um Seth Dylan uh CEO of the
Babylon B had an interesting
post yesterday and he notes that Thomas
Soul famous uh famous black economist uh
I hate that I have to put black in that
sentence but unfortunately the context
sort of requires it can we ever get to
the point where you could just say
Thomas
Soul like one of the most brilliant
people you know alive he's still alive
he's super old anyway so sethan says
Thomas recounted a story about a young
black man who wanted to join the Air
Force and become a pilot but he never
applied because he figured they
discriminate against him he didn't know
race-based discrimination was unlawful
or that black men had a long history of
being Air Force
pilots so will noted that this young
man's false belief about racism did him
more harm in terms of blocking off
Pathways to success than any actual
racism okay that's the kind of
observation which is why I should say
you should know who the hell Thomas so
is right he he's basically the black
mark Twain of
economists he's the black Mark Twain of
economists and what I mean by that is he
has that uh Warren Buffett ability to
tell you something useful and
interesting in a you a very concise way
but make you remember it because of the
way he said
it that's the important part A lot of
people have made similar observations to
Thomas S but when he says it he's got
that Mark Dwayne Warren Buffett
little extra Tang on it and it makes you
remember it so you can quote it so so
what he says becomes viral because of
the genius of the way he puts it you
know just like Warren Buffett
does now uh Dr Daryl
Scott you might know as a big Trump
supporter um and a black Pastor um he
says if that story is true it was an
individual mindset not a collective one
all he had to do was ask
someone and it's true all he had to do
is ask
someone but do you think it's also true
that um it's not a collective mindset
that it's not a a
general understanding among the black
community I asked uh Dr Gerald Scott I
haven't seen an answer this is not a
rhetorical question this is an actual
question for my own education does the
black community generally know they have
a huge hiring advantage in America today
because I don't see an indication of it
what do you think do do you think if you
pulled um black Americans just stop them
on the street and say are you aware you
you'd ask the question differently but
just for our purposes are you aware that
being black is a huge advantage in
hiring and both in government and in any
large organization or company how many
would say oh yeah I know
that
yeah Mark Lamont Hill says I spew racist
hogwash Mark lont Hill it's good to have
enemies like
that I'm not going to kill him in a
Russian prisoner prison I'd rather have
him keep saying silly stuff about me
anyway I would love to know the answer
to that question because I don't believe
that today the average person black
person knows they have a huge hiring um
Advantage now let me tell a story that's
related to this in a fascinating way uh
there's a young black man named Clifton
Duncan who is doing a GoFundMe
fundraiser to do a play uh about Thomas
Soul's
life now how good an idea is
that a play about Thomas so's
life right now remember uh the beauty of
it is that Thomas Soul's own
words would form you know the bones of
an excellent play because everything he
says is so interesting and you just you
wrap that in a story I'm totally going
to watch that play or I might wait for
the digital version but
so so Clifton does his uh his
fundraiser and I see it and I go huh um
Clifton Duncan's a serious really smart
smart guy and he has he has exactly the
right background skills to to pull it
off so he he has the ability to
execute and then he compare then he
combined his ability to execute with an
awesome idea like a really good idea one
one of the best I've ever seen on a
GoFundMe actually it's a perfect use for
it so I said to myself well it's the
right
person it's the right yeah I'm going to
talk about that yeah it's the right
person and it's the right product
and so he puts that up there and how did
he do so how do you do when you've got
the right person the right product and
here's the important part Clifton Duncan
did not say well if I asked for money
you know they're going to discriminate
against me and I won't get any so he
asked for I think $23,000 or something
he thought that would you know Kickstart
it last I checked he was up to
$63,000 um I donated
um and I never
donate I never do the Gund base but this
is one of those rare cases where this
would be so good for
civilization for American civilization
this would be such a positive thing that
God yes that's worth a 100 bucks I'll
put a 100 bucks into that so I
did now compare
that to how other people act
so here's a young black man who built up
his skills and then without thinking
that he would be discriminated he simply
did the thing that makes
sense and then he made a killing what's
it up to
now yeah
$63,000 so he's over subscribed you know
by
triple um that's the way to do it that
is the way to do it and this is dovet
Tales into my large message which
believe it or not is the thing that got
me
canceled so what I what I'm describing
now is the uh let's say the more polite
version of what got me canceled so let
me explain what got me cancelled and
you'll see it's the same same story but
I said it in the most offensive
way I think if you live in a world where
you're dividing people by race and
dividing them against each other and
you're telling one group that the other
group is their
oppressors and they that they are the
victims of them that would necessarily
cause you to act in a certain way that
might not be to your
advantage what I was trying to say is if
you keep up that not only will we not
help you we being anybody who's not a
black American not only will we not not
help you we will get the away from
you as far as we can which is good
advice in every situation not about
black people don't get me wrong the
advice is to get away from people who
have it in for you if somebody is being
trained Through official government and
corporate training that you're the
problem you don't want to be near that
you should go wherever that's not the
case go to another country another state
another Corporation you know another
town but you need to get away from it
because you it's too big to fix you know
you're not going to individually fix it
you know you're not going to
individually get Dei out of your
corporation nobody can do that so you
need to protect yourself and get the
 away from any of that
influence what I advise as a smarter
technique is
strategy if you're if you're a black
American and you got trapped in the Dei
victim oppressor model you're not going
anywhere the the only chance you have is
to be a grifter and write a book
complaining about racism but if you're
if you're in that victim oppressor
mentality uh you're probably not going
to try to become an airline pilot or Air
Force pilot as the Thomas Soul anecdote
from Seth Dylan tells us
and I have a real question uh for Dr
Daryl Scott about how how well
understood it is that simply going and
getting the you know for a good job if
you're educated and you've got the
skills is going to work every time it'll
work every time it's just a huge path to
success so what I say is you should
employ
strategy not
whining whining might even be you know
appropriate in a lot of cases there
might be lots of cases indeed in the
real world in which something unfair
happened to you and people look like you
that's real I do believe that a systemic
racism exists that's a real thing it's
just that if you if you give it too much
respect you're screwing yourself and the
rest of the country at the same time
don't screw yourself do what's good for
you what's good for you is to ignore
that
 even if you think it's true
that whether it's true or not you should
ignore because that's a bad strategy the
right strategy is to get a quality
education network with as many people as
you can and try a bunch of things that
individually maybe they don't work but
you keep trying a number of things who
did I just
describe Clifton Duncan right so he uh
got a good education and exactly the
thing he wants to do he's tried a number
of things he's looking looking still
looking for his big head he's a young
guy um I think this could be it I feel
good about this one and if it isn't what
do you think he's going to do probably
try some more things probably Network
some more right but his Network got him
um three times the amount of U pro
probably his networking more than any
one thing got him uh three times the
amount he asked for in the
GoFundMe if he goes to make this movie
will he be discriminated against because
he's a black man nope absolutely not if
he makes a quality you know play about
Thomas Soul who every white and black
person should be paying attention to
because he's awesome will people say I'm
not going to go to that show because a
black guy made it no no Clifton Duncan
will succeed whether it's this or what
comes after um because he does all the
right things his strategy
is on point now your strategy doesn't
work day one that doesn't work for
anybody but if he keeps pushing if he
just does what he does now and keeps
pushing he he's in in a really
competitive
field but even within that
field i' bet on I bet $100 on him so so
I literally bet on him all right
um and that ladies and gentlemen um
is all I needed to
say um and that's the greatest show
you've ever going to see today I feel
like I left s on some news because there
was so much news that I even got up
