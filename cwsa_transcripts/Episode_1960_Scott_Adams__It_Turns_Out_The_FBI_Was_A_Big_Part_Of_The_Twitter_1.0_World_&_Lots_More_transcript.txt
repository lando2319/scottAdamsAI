good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and let
me tell you
there has never been a finer thing
that's ever happened and if you'd like
to take this up to levels here to you
for unimaginable
all you need is a cupboard Magna glassa
tanker chalices Diner canteen drug or
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
the other day the thing makes everything
better
it's called the simultaneous but it
happens now go
oh
if you were going to do a national
advertising campaign
in support of the simultaneous sip what
would be your slogan go
slogans
has to rhyme has to be fast has to get
to the point
don't miss this don't miss the Sip
don't skip this up
they'll skip this up
doe skip this up yeah you can't you
can't top that
all right let's talk about some things
um a couple things happened in my
neighborhood
uh you heard the other day that there
was a huge breakthrough at the Lawrence
Livermore lab just down the road for me
so it's e-bike riding distance for me
and they you already heard this they
they cracked uh Fusion they actually did
a fusion experiment that created more
energy than it used to do the experiment
a gigantic step in the maybe maybe one
of the greatest
scientific breakthroughs of all time of
all time that's just right down the road
for me
the other thing that happened was early
this morning there was an earthquake
an earthquake in where I live
Bay Area it was like a little bit under
a four
so yeah you know you got the earthquake
and the
gigantic nuclear fusion experiment
roughly in the same place
well I did want to tell you this but a
black hole is formed in in Livermore
California it's small it's only about
this big so far it has only sucked most
of Main Street into it
I think we'll be fine don't panic
not really
not really
parody it's parody
how many of you believe that Klaus
Schwab once said someday you'll load
nothing and be happy
how many believe that is something that
actually happened in your actual world
yes
have you ever tried to Google it
I've ever tried to find him saying that
uh anybody you should try doing that
just for fun
see if you can find the most famous
quote in all of in all of the right
leading world
nope do you know why you can't find it
because it never happened
do you know what did happen
so there's something like it that
happened
and that's that's how that all got
started and I if you want to know I just
tweeted the link to an article that
explains where that rumor came from
and you can you can see for yourself so
it appears to come from a uh an opinion
piece that was on the world economic
Forum website
so the first thing that's true
is that this this there's something like
that opinion that was in reality in
truth part of the world economic Forum
website I think
so it was associated with Klaus
but you have you'd have to read the
context the context is not we want to do
this for you it was more like
this is what we foresee might happen
isn't as bad as it looks you know that
sort of thing it was an opinion piece it
wasn't somebody saying hey let's take
away all your property rights something
like that
now
does anybody would you have a problem
if you knew it was an opinion piece
they would say more like well this stuff
is already going to happen for example
the existence of uber
allowed at least one person I know who
had plenty of money to not own a car
and I remember talking to him and he
would say I don't need to own a car now
because where I live Uber is just always
available and it's just easier and I
thought to myself well there you go
perfect example there's someone who
doesn't own a car who easily could is
rich
but he doesn't own a car and he's
happier
and that that's basically the essence of
the article
is that the free market would create
situations in which you optionally could
own something or not and if you decide
not to you might be happier
do you know what I was thinking about
all yesterday
is how much I don't want to own a car
all yesterday
because I own I own an auto Mill I don't
know if you've heard one of these
there's a I drive something called a
Christmas tree
have you seen one of those
it's a Christmas tree and it's like a
it's like an automobile
it has a steering wheel it has uh tires
that often are inflated those tires
often have the proper amount of
inflation but otherwise on the inside
there's this thing in front of you like
an electric panel that is lit up like a
Christmas tree so it's usually telling
me this is broken and that's broken and
you better get service and your tires
are flat
and so when I get in my car the
Christmas tree comes on and I feel
festive I feel very festive but
as I was walking three miles to pick up
my car with my flat tire yesterday it
was being serviced
um I got home and of course the the
parking assistance doesn't work which is
why I ran my car into the side of my
garage door
because I was waiting for that little
light to say you're getting a little
close to the edge of your your door
and when that little thing goes on I'm
going to stop
well it wasn't working
so I just took out part of my garage
door and my car this is about a five
thousand dollar expense
because
BMWs don't have good electrical systems
I'm just going to say that
I once bought a brand new BMW the one
two two cars before this one
and the entire electrical system failed
as I drove off the lot
as my car literally as I pulled out from
the lot brand new car
the entire the entire electrical system
of the car failed it was still running
but there was no electrical just the
whole thing failed
you know just sort of back up back onto
the lot
now
how many of you have heard me tell the
story about my weird association with
electrical and mechanical objects that
it's a theme my entire life which I talk
about all the time I I can make street
lights stop
by walking under them
I've done it a lot you know things just
don't work around me electrically it's
just it's just a it's a very consistent
thing so my automobiles always have and
so I wanted to ask this question
um 95 of the time I drive any automobile
that's mine my own car
there's a there's a warning light on on
the panel
how many of you would say the same that
95 percent of the time you drive your
car
there's a warning light on 95 of the
time
I'm saying a few yeses yeah
yep yeses now the reason is
it would be a full-time job
the the one that's broken now is this
PDC light or something that tells you if
you're close to something when you're
parking
that that warning light has been on
for months
have I fixed it yes of course I've taken
it in twice and when I take it home it
stops working now every time I turn it
on I have to clear the error before I
can you know use my panel and stuff
every time
now let me ask you this how many things
in your life are there that you know if
you took an hour you could fix it but
you never have an hour
so you accumulate all of these things
that you're just temporarily making that
bother you
like for the last several days I drove
on a flat tire
that I knew was flat
why I didn't have an hour I just didn't
have an hour and my whole life is full
of things like you know driving on a
flat tire
totally normal for me because you know
do you know how many problems I have
with my computer
my lights my Plumbing my whole house
almost all of it is a little bit broken
all of it every one of those would take
an hour to fix but if I did everything
it would be like thousands of hours I
don't have that kind of time so I so I
live in a world where everything's
broken
everything's broken everything I own is
broken all of it a little bit
now you know what would solve that
problem
does anybody know how to solve that
problem of owning just a lot of
that's broken all the time
say it say it
thank you
you don't want to be great if I didn't
own anything
then I'd be happy
[Laughter]
I'm not joking
I'm not joking at all
the the idea that not owning things
would make you happy is something you
might not understand unless you own
enough stuff
if you own enough stuff you don't like
it
if you don't own stuff you really want
more stuff don't you if you if you're
struggling
the whole time you're thinking I wish I
had more stuff nice nicer home better
car
right it doesn't make you happier it
really doesn't I mean I still prefer it
but it doesn't get you close to Happy
you got to do other stuff for that all
right let's talk about Aaron rupar has
he been has rupar been brought back on
Twitter yet it looked like musk had he
ran a pole about when to bring back the
people he had just banned and I think
the poll said bring him back and I
believe I saw it just a few minutes ago
that he was going to do that
um so anyway rupar has given some
interviews
and his defense for why what he did
which was referring to Facebook still
having information on musk's airplanes
location
his argument is that that wasn't so bad
and it didn't really endanger musk
because all he did was make it much much
easier for somebody to hurt Musk
and his point is that if somebody wanted
to
they could still work a little harder to
hurt musk and his family
but all he did was make it a little
easier and more convenient to hurt them
and that shouldn't be wrong
that sounded like a pretty good argument
well let me tell you my opinion
independent of whether he should have
been banned for his tweet
most people would say you know there's
an argument both ways but independent of
whether the first tweet was bannable
his response
to why he thought that tweet was okay
should ban him for life
do you want to have any association with
somebody who says no I only put your
family at a little bit of risk which I
decided would be appropriate for you I
would like to take on was a
right-leading misinformation site
did anybody see them ban doesn't seem
like YouTube always with me when
maybe it's because I swore I don't know
it's possible
anyway it could be a coincidence
but
um do you remember that the FBI was
warning Twitter
that the
that when rupar was spraying the fine
people hoax as he frequently does that
that would influence the elections do
you remember the FBI tried to get Aaron
rupar removed from Twitter for spreading
the fine people hoax which was such a
defining moment in American history that
Biden actually based his entire campaign
on it but luckily luckily the FBI was
watching and they wouldn't want the
election to be you know affected by a
hoax so the FBI immediately reported to
Twitter and then Twitter uh removed all
of the all of the references to the Fine
people hoax because that would affect no
that didn't happen of course not
not one of those things happened
the entire hoax quiz of now what 20
 I think they're like 20
hoaxes do you think the FBI
targeted or tag any of those hoaxes
of course not because Earl there were a
left left leading hoaxes none now if you
ask the FBI would they say oh no the
things we're concerned about would be
election misinformation such as what day
the election is so a number of the
examples were people who were joking
that the election was on Wednesday
right maybe they were joking but maybe
not now I don't mind if those get banned
or at least you know temporarily I don't
have any problem with that who do you no
I get I get a free speech and all that
blah blah blah but do you have any
problem with the social media Network
uh Banning misinformation about the day
of voting
maybe a you know a one-week ban or
something right or maybe even put a
notice on it put a notice on it this is
this is fake
something like that but I don't I don't
really have a problem with that I don't
have a problem if Twitter handles it
with a notice I don't have a problem if
they suppress it I don't have a problem
if they I think I would I wouldn't I
wouldn't favor a band for life
because I think it's just trolls messing
around like this is not quite that level
but I would definitely act on it I don't
think that would be inappropriate
because that goes right to the heart of
democracy right or the Republic it goes
right to the heart of it you got to show
up on the right day right so I'd be okay
with that
as long as I didn't you know put anybody
in jail for it or anything
but they did more than that didn't they
the evidence suggests that they were
Banning funny memes that didn't have any
informational value really
so
do we know for sure that the FBI
was in no way involved in anything
useful
can we say that
because even if they were doing
something for their own team it didn't
seem to be doing that
the accounts that they were targeting
were all these minor unimportant
accounts
the who knows if they had any effect at
all and I'm sure that whatever rumors
they were trying to stop they didn't
stop at all
do you think can you name a rumor that
the FBI tried to stop
that you haven't heard
anybody is there any rumor that the FBI
tried to stop based on the files we
don't know everything they did did they
stop any rumor
I don't think so
so why were they there
you know what a lot of it looked like is
just a bureaucracy doing what a
bureaucracy does don't you think there
are a lot of people in the FBI
who are not qualified to do field work
what do you think dude do you think
there's anybody at the whole FBI who
might be
let's say unqualified to be in the field
doing important work like catching
counterfeiters and
terrorists probably now what would you
do with somebody
who some you didn't want to get rid of
them
but they didn't have the ability to do
field work
can you think of any kind of assignment
which would be a way to just
Park somebody useless
hey Bob
here's your new assignment
and you won't need your gun for this
if you wouldn't mind maybe you could
leave your gun locked in the bosses safe
oh it'll be there anytime you want it
but we don't think
you should have a gun right now
however if I get a job for you
how would you like to watch Twitter all
day
and then write memos about stuff you
don't like
and I'd say
I do that for fun
that's pretty much you described my
entire entertainment day
looking at Twitter and bitching about
 I didn't like oh there's some
I didn't like
hey how about I make that your job wait
am I hearing this right
it's going to be my job
to ship post about Twitter except it's
even could be better than tweeting what
I don't like I could go directly to
Twitter management and tell them to get
rid of it seriously and that's my job
that's my job
let me see if I understand this
I'm not getting this I'm not getting
this I'm confused
you're also going to give me money for
this
yes yes we're going to pay you money
to read Twitter
and complain about you don't like
I'm not getting it I'm not getting it
there's there's a trick here right what
what is the trick what's the trick
you also get excellent employee benefits
I don't get it
I don't know there's something you're
not telling me it's too good to be true
so the first thing we need to all agree
on
can you take my lead on this as the
creator of Dilbert do I have enough
credibility to make the following
statement
they weren't sending their best
any disagreement
they weren't sending their best
that's got to be part of the story
has anybody mentioned that yet
it's got to be a huge part of the story
imagine this take any large organization
it could be government could be the FBI
could be Congress it could be any
business it could be Apple computer
let's say you took Apple computer some
of the I would imagine some of the
finest employees
ever selected for a major business would
you agree
would you agree they have very high
standards it's very hard to get a job at
Apple the finest employees in the land
at Apple now imagine if you had some way
to identify the 10 percent or less let's
say the one percent of Apple employees
who are not good because there's always
some right you can find the worst
employees at Apple now let's collect
them all together and put them on the
same project
how would that go
remember there are Apple employees is
some of the best in the world but for
this one project you did somehow scour
the organization to find the worst one
percent of the employees they're all
working on the same project
that's what the Twitter files was it was
a bunch of FBI people who were not
qualified for real work
doing some of the most important work in
the country because we didn't know how
important it was at the time now I
didn't really see anything that they uh
that they went after that mattered to me
did you
did you see anything that the FBI banned
that you or the country would have been
better off if it had been
fully expressed
I didn't see an example did you
so I think it didn't matter I think the
bigger story is that it doesn't matter
how many of the worst employees you
throw at something nothing happens
in the end nothing really happens it was
just a bunch of employees doing stuff
but nothing really
that they didn't change the world they
didn't change the election they didn't
support the election they didn't protect
the election they didn't protect the
country they didn't support Twitter they
didn't they didn't protect the public
actually nothing happened it was just 80
bad employees bitching about Twitter and
making the Twitter making the Twitter
employees really busy
I'll tell I'll tell you what I didn't
see
a finely oiled deep State plot
didn't see that
and Matt taivi uh also explains it in
his own words better it's not so much
that there's a deep state with some kind
of a organized structure that's that's
you know moving the puppet strings it's
just a bunch of bureaucracy
with people who have often common
opinions but it's basically just A Rat's
Nest of bureaucracy doing whatever the
rats nest can do and basically that's it
so basically the FBI 80 FBI
people working with Twitter Was A Rat's
Nest of no particular importance
now
the fact that as far as I know
it didn't change anything
does that mean I'm okay with it
I hope my audience is the ones who can
handle Nuance you know I hope I've
filtered you well enough that you can
right I'm completely against it
I'm completely against the FBI having a
you know practically a permanent role at
Twitter completely against it but the
fact is it probably didn't make any
difference
any disagreement or or let me say
nothing has been reported yet
where it made any difference at all
did it
you say it did but would you agree
there's no evidence
if you're saying you you think you did I
won't disagree I'm just saying there's
no evidence to that right
Hunter's laptop was Hunter's laptop
because of these 80 FBI no the 80 FBI
employees were not the cause of the
hunter laptop I believe that came from
actual management and you know a
conversation so it did come from the FBI
but but if the only thing that was
happening was those 80 people reporting
stuff probably wouldn't have happened
because I think it was just 80 employees
bitching about stuff
we don't know but anyway you're let's
agree on this here here's our point of
agreement
uh I think nothing's been demonstrated
that was bad you think maybe it has
but we both agree that whether it has or
has not been demonstrated by the
information we have you can't let it
stand
it's not a it's not a situation we can
tolerate right because the the potential
for abuse is so obvious
the the fact that the fact that maybe
there's no direct evidence that I've
seen personally doesn't really mean much
you can't have a situation with that
much exposure
that that's a clean easy decision
and musk is making the right one I'm
sure
all right here's the dog not barking
if you took everything you saw about the
FBI as I said I don't think it matters
much except maybe that laptop story
which I think would have happened in any
situation
but
what's the biggest thing you're still
wondering about Twitter suppression not
counting not counting the uh coveted
stuff now Kevin covet what's the biggest
remaining question you have about what
was really happening at Twitter go
something that hasn't been addressed
uh we heard a little bit about the yeah
we do have questions about the underage
stuff you're right
here's here's what it is to me
I still don't know the answer
to whether an account like mine and
specifically mind those like it who have
no strikes against them
why were we Shadow banned and who made
that decision and were we could it be
confirmed so the first question is could
it be confirmed that I was ever Shadow
banned I mean it looks like it in every
every way but I still need confirmation
could be some other explanation
so number one why don't we know
how is it possible that I don't know the
answer to that at this point
this is the biggest question
because the the accounts that the FBI
tagged to get rid of were small accounts
of no impact
I'm not a small account of no impact
I actually move
probably tens of thousands of votes
and I got Shadow banned
so if somebody shot abandoned me and
they did it if they did it by name as in
I'm on a list if that happened there's
no evidence of that but if that happened
what would be the reason that I would be
Shadow about there's only one reason
because I have no strikes right I have
no strikes so the only reason it would
be political
there couldn't be another reason a guy
I've given nobody any reason otherwise
so
question number one am I shadowband
if I am who did it
and if somebody did it
why
and when would be interesting too right
now correct me if I'm wrong
knowing if I got Shadow banned and
people like me so I'll say let's say a
certain event
people who can actually move the dial
I'm not talking about just people who
are users the people you know can move
the dial you know the the Ben Shapiro
right can Ben Shapiro move the dial in
politics yes yes he can if he was Shadow
banned that's a big deal
a big big deal would you agree
no I don't know they do a shadow band I
have no direct evidence of that but if
he was
he also I believe he had Dan bongino
um
but now this is interesting Dan bongino
was
um
called out by name as somebody who was
Shadow banned
but I think they also had a a specific
reason or was it or not give me give me
a fact check
what did the Dan bongino Case
there was a topic he was talking about
they didn't like right
but was the topic
did that give them any any justification
even weasel justification
because I'm wondering why he was called
out and some so many other big
right-leading accounts were not
it was masks was it yeah
all right so we heard some anecdotes but
why would why would Dan bongino be uh
you can tell me that those accounts did
or did not get a shadow banned that's
the whole story
am I wrong
that's the whole story everything we've
seen that so far is just like
it's like the teaser to the story or
something it's
uh yes you're wrong but but tell me why
ch right so I know there's several
people were confirmed
but I believe that there was some excuse
in each of those cases right
that weather whether it was a good
excuse or not they had some like reason
to act I don't think that's the whole
story my question is did people like me
get picked up by the algorithm without
doing anything that anybody detected as
a problem
because if the algorithm was just saying
oh you tweeted if I tweeted bongino
three times do you think the algorithm
would have started suppressing me just
automatically
why wouldn't it
why wouldn't it right if they're gonna
if they're gonna ban anybody who's
boosting them isn't that automatic
it would be automatic I would think
uh Panchito said Epstein didn't Clinton
himself
all right
um
but I'm not seeing a direct
I'm noticing a direct uh refutation or
agreement with me well I want to say
that because I want to know if I'm on
the right track true or false that the
part we don't know
is the big part
yes or no
am I misreading this
okay a few people say yes right
and and did you feel that you were being
distracted
and you missed that story like I'm
wondering did you miss that because we
we've all done put our attention on
these little you know sparkling objects
but so far the sparkly objects have all
been smallish
you know of great concern
because they have the potential to be
biggish so that that's why you have
maximum concern even if the examples so
far are not fully expressed as as bad
but the other thing is already fully
expressed
right if in fact people like my account
were Shadow banned don't know that but
if they were that would be a fully
expressed
plot
the other stuff is just stuff that could
have been bad but it's a good thing we
stopped it when we did the other stuff
is what actually happened if it happened
all right too much on that
um
all right would you like your head to
totally explode
this is just a question
let's see if I can make all of your
heads explode
there were 80 FBI employees looking at
content on Twitter that is now confirmed
how many FBI agents were continuously
monitoring Tick Tock and reporting to
tick tocks management what things should
be removed
you don't know dear it might be
it might be now it might be that the FBI
is monitoring tick tock
and it might be that they are reporting
things
but we might expect that Tick Tock would
not necessarily respond or Tick Tock
might respond Tick Tock might respond to
the ones that are just really clean like
this is misinformation I I can imagine
that Tick Tock would take down a a video
that said the wrong day to vote
I can imagine that I can imagine FBI FBI
telling Tick Tock to take it down and I
can imagine Tick Tock knowing that
that's not where the the big win is for
China
the like the China isn't playing small
ball
they're not like oh I'll start this
little rumor and that'll cause some
chaos it's not it's not a small ball
if China wants to weaponize tick tock
it's going to be through the the major
persuasion in general you know telling
you to go crazy on climate change if
they think it's not going to help you
that sort of thing so it would be a
whole topic persuasion that's the danger
so I wouldn't be surprised if FBI is in
fact watching Tick Tock and in fact
reporting things that look bad and maybe
Tick Tock is taking some of them down
maybe but wouldn't you like to know
it feels like a really important thing
to know now if I'm saying Angela
laughing at me now if you say Scott
Scott
you know they're not
you could be right you could be right
I don't know
but we'll see it's a big story I don't
know why we don't know the answer to it
um
have I ever mentioned to you that
analogies
are the best way to know that you won a
debate
so and but I feel like I've never
explained why
and I've had so much confusion about
that I'm going to try it again
analogies have two functions
one of them is good
and I support it
the other one is ridiculous and I don't
but if you just say they're all
analogies then you miss that distinction
here's a good analogy
I'm going to try to explain this thing
called a zebra that you've never heard
of because you're from another planet
but somehow you've already learned what
a horse is
right so I'm going to do a quick
definition of a zebra are you remember a
horse imagine a horse not just remember
now imagine it's white and black stripes
it's a little genetically different from
a horse but that's basically I could
that's the idea
that's a good use of an analogy why
because all I did was quickly bring you
up to speed
on something that would have taken
longer to explain
okay and you would all agree with that
as a good use of analogy right
good use now it was a bad use of an
analogy
a bad use is that the the logic of or
the situation you want analogy can be
ported over to the other one
it's not you can't Port logic from one
analogy to the other well if it's true
in this unrelated story it must also be
true over here
now you notice none of that is the case
with my zebra horse thing
the zebra horse thing everybody
everybody everybody would hear and say
oh thank you I I understand the zebra
better now right
that everybody okay so far the zebra one
gives nobody anything to complain about
when it's done that that is a complete
perfect approach
now I'm going to show you a bad analogy
and I'll explain to you why it's the end
of the conversation
again here's the I'm going to put some
ground rules here this is not a
conversation about whether masks should
be used
we're all anti-mask
we're all anti-mask let's not talk about
that right but I'm going to talk about
something related to it then that's the
related to a part that's important we
don't want any mask mandates
let's not talk about that
but in the conversation I had with a
woman who was talking about
whether the initial viral load made any
difference so that was a conversation
um and what do you think by the way just
check in with you do you believe that if
you were exposed to more virus initially
that you would get sicker what do you
think what's your current understanding
of that
so
um like everything the science is not as
good as you would like but there is a
preprint
there's at least one preprint that says
that people who who lived in a house was
somebody who had coveted
so
in the conversation uh somebody jumped
into the conversation with this analogy
in the analogy was this because I've
been making the argument that any kind
of a barrier
makes a difference
it just might not be enough difference
to be worth it
so for example right like lesson one one
one percent
that's all that's my entire argument
right there
there's no such thing as a barrier that
doesn't have work right so I'm going to
put up a chain link fence chain link
fence how does that do for the hurricane
Bingo gotcha
gotcha
analogy has made you look like a chimp
so I guess we're done here right
I I don't think you would even detect
the toe
so my critic has a good point doesn't he
right
have you ever go sideways and up and
down and that's the argument for why
masks don't work right because the stuff
gets out if it's a poorly fitted mask it
gets out anyway right
so I said this walk up to that fence and
blow on it
if your air goes sideways
and up and down
then it it'll stop a hurricane
if you give me a chain-lick fence
they'll do the same thing as a mask
which is it redirects some of the air
sideways and up yes if your chain link
fence can do that it would stop a
hurricane
right
so now now you say to me Scott you're
arguing like the details of an imaginary
situation with a hurricane you're
wasting your time
exactly
exactly that's the point as soon as you
talk about an analogy you're in a
different conversation
it's just a different conversation
it tells you nothing about the one
you're talking about right so remember
if it's like the zebra it's a good
analogy it just said something that
everybody understands and agrees with
there's no debate on the zebra
but as soon as you get to chain link
fence and hurricane
that's just a different conversation
because your mask is not a chain link
fence you know all the Dynamics are
different there's nothing you can learn
from that you'll just end up debating
the details
anyway
after this long conversation with a
woman who was a subject matter expert on
masks uh I did what I should have done
the first minute which was
because the problems seem to be a logic
problem
and not a um knowledge problem
so right away I was like
we're losing the audio on YouTube so
right away as soon as as soon as the
conversation happened I kept thinking
why is it why is it it's almost like I'm
talking to somebody who doesn't
understand reason and logic
yeah she's an author she's a writer
and so I was talking to I was having a
science conversation with an author
and it went exactly the way you think it
would
exactly the way you think it would I I
couldn't even
and in the end it ended up being just a
logic disagreement and not a factual
disagreement at all although she would
disagree with that do you know why she
would disagree with my characterization
of what it was
she's a writer
anyway the most consistent pattern in
all of social media is that people who
are writers for a living
and I'm guilty
uh
are very unlikely to have logical
arguments on science and stuff like that
it's just the wrong it's the wrong group
have you ever seen me disagree with
engineers
on Twitter
I'm just curious have you ever seen me
having a like those of you who follow me
on Twitter have you ever seen me have an
extended disagreement with an engineer
on Twitter
nope
nope do you know why
because they're trained largely the same
way I am which is how to look at the
costs and the benefits and make sure you
didn't leave anything out let everybody
who's treated the same way you can have
a pretty quick conversation with because
even if you disagree what happens if I
disagree with an engineer
it takes 10 seconds to work it out
because like I say this I say this show
me your link oh
okay we're done
yeah conversations with Engineers are
just yes no is it logical oh okay yeah
so now I I am exaggerating of course
Engineers can disagree as well but their
disagreement is a completely different
type the disagreement with a writer or
an artist
you're never really even talking about
the same thing it's like you're just
trying to model the water into a
sculpture or just it's water it's
nothing you can do with it
with an engineer at least it's an actual
disagreement so you can work it out
um
what do you think of the United States
deciding to arm Taiwan much more
aggressively than we've done before and
given them much better weapons so they
can defend against China good idea or
bad
good idea or bad
I don't know
yeah yeah this one there's no way to
there's no way to game it the only thing
you can know for sure
is that the decision will always go in
the direction of
we'll always go in the direction of
follow the money yeah
yeah you could predict it
so here's the part that I don't know how
to predict
if Taiwan and Mainland China got into an
actual serious War where China had
decided you know we're just going to end
this
would that be good or bad
for arms manufacturers in America
you say good
I don't know because because that was a
tough one because it would be good in
terms of maybe immediate orders for
products so that part we could agree on
it would definitely boost orders
but remember the people who are
operating in their own self-interest
still have to live in the world
so there's no arms manufacturer who's
going to start a nuclear war
to sell more arms
because that's so clearly not in
anybody's interest including the the
arms dealers because they would they
would be dead just like everybody else
so I think the arms dealers have to play
a game where they have the maximum
amount of conflict
short of a nuclear confrontation
now I think that they went as close to
the line with Ukraine and Russia as
anybody should ever go
agree
right they went closer to the line than
most of us would have said would have
been prudent
and here's the problem
you see the problem
so far
they got away with it
that's a problem
the the experience in Ukraine is that
Russia so far
is backing down from nuclear use
that is the most dangerous
situation we could ever be in because
that allows those same arms
manufacturers to say you know you create
Taiwan will be fine too
what would that be
an analogy
that would be an analogy
there's no reason no reason to think
that because Ukraine is so far not
sparked a nuclear war that anything we
did involving Taiwan and China would
would turn out the same
that is a big wrong assumption that
somehow those would be similar
the the Ukraine war you can never
anticipate the real ripple effect of
what a war does because sometimes you
you know you create new technologies
because of the war and it's like great
at least that part of it and sometimes
there's some lingering thing like you
know the end of World War One
some would say maybe you could debate
this but some would say the way we
handle the end of world war one wasn't
good news because it basically created
the scenes of World War II
so
um I've got a feeling that the Ukraine
situation is really going to screw
things up for Taiwan I don't know how
but I hate that we're going to be
informed by one thing
to handle a separate thing
China needs taiwan's chips
but you know if they thought they could
conquer Taiwan in a month
they would have their chips they just
have to rebuild just don't bomb the chip
factories China would just have to not
bomb the chip factories and if they
thought they could gain control in a
month they'd be fine
yes we're
we're pronouncing zebra not zebra
I'm getting a disagreement that zebra
should be zebra
now I don't know what country you're
from
with your zebras
but in America damn it they're zebras
zebras Australia British we don't know
all right
[Applause]
um
so that was been a few days since
Trump's nft successes and I wonder if
there are more people like me who had a
Covington kids initial
reaction remember the Covington kids
hoax when you saw the first
um uh deceptively edited videos my my
first response was God I hate that kid
freaking jerk you know just like being a
jerk to this guy in public I hated that
kid and then you see the full video
nothing like that happened
completely opposite of what the
deceptive video was yeah it was a
rhubarb video and
and I think that happened to me with
Trump's nft
would you like me to admit I was wrong
because I hear that I never do that
there's a rumor that I never admit when
I'm wrong
have you heard that rumor it's
widespread and yeah the funny thing is
Nobody Does it more often than I do I
I'm going to say that in the world
nobody has consistently admitted when
they're wrong more often than I do
would you agree if you watch me you
probably say us all right here's where I
was wrong my first reaction to the nft
release especially since he teased as a
major announcement was oh my God he's
done
he's so done
like there's just nothing
there's nothing I can say good about
this it's just done he's just cashing in
it's just done now you saw that was my
first response right can you confirm
that was my first response okay
I was totally wrong
let me say With No Reservations
sometimes sometimes you say you hear me
say stuff like well I was wrong but you
know really I was right if you looked at
it this way you know that's what I say
about
Ukraine for example yes I was wrong when
I said uh Putin wouldn't attack but I
was really right in a way because of the
reason I said he wouldn't attack is
because it wouldn't work it would go
poorly and that part I got right
so usually you see me saying well I was
wrong but not really completely wrong
this time
totally wrong
there's nothing I can say about this I
just want you I want you to accept my
complete wrongness on this with No
Reservations
this was a good idea
that worked out well
here's why it worked out well
number one is sold out
and it was like a breathtakingly
successful fundraiser right for the
amount of work he put into it which was
one video probably and maybe he reviewed
it or something so he did maybe
probably one hour of total work
and probably netted we don't know two to
four million dollars or something for
like an hour
whoever did better than that
right the best fundraiser ever done and
he owns that now
right would you agree
that for the the bang for the buck was
that not
the best fundraising
ever done now some of you say you did a
license deal which means that he doesn't
get the the full amount of that but even
as a license deal
it would be tremendous
tremendous so I don't know what
percentage he gets we don't know that
all right now here's the other reason
that it wasn't the disaster it looked
like
he followed up quickly once there was a
lot of energy around him he was getting
a lot of attention he followed up
quickly with a very strong campaign
video about Free Speech which was free
money basically he said exactly what his
base wanted him to say
and he said it well
you said it's wrong and I didn't see
anything wrong with it like I liked
every bit of it now who knows if he
could execute but what he said was
perfect
so here he so here he takes what I
thought was this big mistake but it
created energy
and then
here's why I'm embarrassed that I didn't
see this coming
he's an energy monster
we created all this nft negative energy
and he just gathered it up
and then it put it behind the release of
his free speech video
now who knows how much was planned
you know it could be that they sped up
their free speech video faster than he
planned to get it in the same space with
the nft thing because maybe it wasn't
going as well as he thought but I don't
know if it was planned or or he just
found a way to snatch Victory from the
jaws of defeat but he had a good week
am I wrong
I think it was one of Trump's best weeks
because Trump is being Vindicated
on you know all the F all the Twitter
stuff
totally Vindicated so he's Vindicated in
seeing that the the system was rigged
against him and especially because it's
the FBI
because the FBI in this story just makes
Trump look more and more like he was
always the victim and more and more like
he was right the whole time even though
it's a slightly you know off-trump story
it's still everything is connected so I
think he had one of the best weeks ever
now do you think it's a mistake
when an 80 year old
releases an nft go
when age is a question
and Trump releases an nft
do you see this play
it's brilliant
it's brilliant
do you know who's not going to release
an nft
Biden
do you know why
he's too old he's too old
yeah he wouldn't know what it was he
wouldn't be able to tell you what it was
you know if somebody asked him about it
he wouldn't be able to explain it
but Trump does licensing for a living
Trump knows what it is
do you think that Biden could explain to
you what an nft is he just stopped
saying what's an nft nope nope do you
think that Trump could
yes yes now Trump maybe can't give you
the details of what a blockchain is or
maybe you can you know maybe you can
give you the big picture that it's like
a it's a public record that nobody can
change like maybe he knows that that
would be the only important part
but think think about the persuasion
that is related to Trump embracing a
modern technology that even most of the
public is not familiar with most of the
public is not even familiar with nfts
and he's he basically just tied his 76
year old brand to the most current
happening young technology and then
and then
made it the most successful one lately
has anybody had a successful nft better
than this one because the nft Market's
garbage right it's falling apart and he
still had a successful one because by
the way the value has risen the value of
the ownership of one of those has risen
you could resell it for more
that's completely successful
so I think you're missing the the best
part of the play the best part of the
play is that young them down he young
them down when he's running maybe
against you know the oldest potential
candidate
he educated the masses that nfts are
like trading cards exactly
that's exactly what he did right I'll
bet you there's a whole segment of the
population who goes oh I get it they're
digital they're like trading cards and
the first thing they ask is why can't I
just make my own copy and then somebody
says well something about the blockchain
you go okay I don't need to understand
that but I get it
all right
um
and also I didn't mind that he was
pitching a a product because he's a
salesperson
isn't Trump the ultimate salesperson
which is what he calls himself
he basically says I'm you know I'm going
to try to sell the country I sell stuff
and then he goes and he sells stuff for
his campaign I don't know to me it was
right on brand
the perfect uh Trump brand
I say
is when he creates all this attention
even negative attention but when it all
Settles you say to yourself oh that was
a lot better than I expected right how
often do you see that pattern where you
think he's really stepped in it now and
when the the dust clears you're like oh
that wasn't so bad after all
right
question I see that uh Jordan Peterson
is warning that Western countries that a
totalitarian social credit system is
coming to their societies uh in a highly
probable way so Jordan Peterson says
it's highly probable we'll have a
totalitarian social credit system agree
or disagree highly highly probable
yes or no
so who already has one
what country already or countries
already have right now China is the one
we know of is anybody else doing it is
there any other country on earth besides
China
you say the UK but I don't believe so
that might be just for vaccines right
now
I mean there's talk about vaccine
passports but in terms of a like total
social credit system
nobody else is doing it right so you're
saying Canada
but not a full credit system they're
doing things that look like they're
moving in that direction right
all right here's here's my preliminary
take
preliminary take number one
uh there are a lot of things that are
not social tracking systems that rhyme
with it and feel like it and it feels
like it's in a domain I think you have
to treat them differently right
I believe that in the United States and
there's no way to prove this because I
know there's plenty of pattern
recognition that goes against it but in
my opinion in the United States if we
had implemented
and I'm not arguing we should have I'm
not pro passport but if we had do you
think that we would not as a public been
able to get rid of it do you think once
once it was in there it would just take
root and it would just expand to a total
full system
so a lot of you say yes that's that's
exactly what the government does when
the government starts a program and
never stops it right
that that's that's the pattern because
the government always wants more power
and if they get your money they never
say we don't need it anymore so whatever
grows just keeps growing all right this
is where we disagree
I'm not going to say that your reasoning
is flawed
it's not you do not have flawed
reasoning because your reasoning is
based on pattern
the pattern is well established
would you agree it's a well-established
pattern that this is exactly the sort of
thing you don't want to trust your
government with
right but here's where I disagree
if it were unimportant they could
certainly get away with it if we weren't
watching and stuff
but I think that the United States and I
won't speak for other Western countries
but I think the United States wouldn't
put up with it
so I don't I think you need a
totalitarian government to do it
and I think we don't have one
I think the base requirement of a social
credit system is a totalitarian
government and we don't have one
now does that mean the government would
not try to implement it no I'm not
saying that
definitely the government would try to
get away with anything it could
but I don't think the citizens would
allow it
right I don't think so
and it might be you know there might be
a
you can imagine a number of ways that
would work
all right here here's one way
Embrace and amplify
all you'd have to do is say if you're
going to give us a social credit system
we want to be able to track the social
credit system of Congress
and that's the end of it
that's the end of it because there's no
way the Congress could uh impose social
tracking on the public and say we're
exempt
let me say this as clearly as possible
if Congress ever said we're going to put
a social tracking system on the public
that will not apply to us in Congress
I will be with you to take over the the
Capitol building
I I will join an insurrection
I I will look to throw overthrow the
government of the United States if they
were to do that
that's why they won't do it
that's why I feel safe
because that that's that's a red line of
red lines I mean no no you're not going
to treat us
as second-class Citizens while you're
exempt from your own Rule and do you
think that they would say all right well
we don't like it applying to us in
Congress but it's so beneficial we're
going to apply it to the the people
nope nope there's no way that would
happen there's no way Congress would
allow that to happen to themselves
and I think every one of you would
confirm if they were going to if they
tried to impose that on us the public
and make themselves exempt
we will sweep them out of office with
whatever means necessary
violence is allowed
violence is allowed under that condition
so I'm not recommending any violence in
any current situation the the whole
context is we will never be in that
situation so in case you're monitoring
me on YouTube for inciting violence no
this is the opposite of inciting
violence I'm saying there's no
possibility of inciting violence because
the United States will never get to that
point because Congress will never imply
it impose it on themselves
that's it
so can I be sure
that my predicted future is more
accurate than those of you who have
pattern recognition which is operating
quite well right now your pattern
recognition is on point because if you
say this looks familiar
you're right
but you know what else it would be
you know what pattern recognition is
what's another word for pattern
recognition
an analogy yeah your pattern recognition
they're all analogies it happened in
this other case completely different
case so I think it'll happen with this
one
you're not wrong
you're not wrong
that pattern is a very well established
pattern but the trouble is if you if you
don't look for what's different about
each situation you might imagine that
the pattern can work in every situation
where it might be a pattern that is
limited to some kind of domain you have
to look at the specifics that's why
analogies fail right
you reciprocate this thank you
would you would you stipulate that
untrue that I'm that I'm right will you
stipulate that patterns are really
analogies and if you don't look at the
specific situation you don't really know
what's going to go on
many many of you uh just love your
pattern recognition and will never
change
it works most of the time
all right
so I'm not terribly worried about that
but it's not it's not a zero musk said
maybe yesterday morning or the day
before that the coup de gras
was still coming
was the
was the coup de gras what we saw about
the FBI or is there something we haven't
seen yet
does anybody know
uh you're just guessing though right
you're guessing it's the covered files
or you're guessing it's it's fouchy but
you're only guessing right
yeah takuda Cuda Grace
all right but we think it's still coming
I guess I guess there's still a question
whether there's something big coming or
not all right is there anything else
that's coming
anything else I missed at least today
are you all having trouble on YouTube
dead seed buffering
yeah it looks like the YouTube sheet is
to do that now keep in mind um
now
can you hear me at least
can you hear me on YouTube
give me give me a yes or no can you hear
me
because I can't tell if they could have
audio they're all talking but they're
not
they're not responding to me so I think
that they can't hear me
oh it's good now
all right
um
so you should know that can I just
let me do a quick check so I've got two
feeds going on two new iPads both of
them on the same Wi-Fi the the locals
feed is working perfectly right or or
are you having troubles on this one as
well
oh they are well I'm getting opposite
some say yes some say no
okay the sound is good
yeah I'm getting different responses so
I don't think it's my Wi-Fi
would you agree it's not my Wi-Fi
because people are getting different
outcomes and I have the same Wi-Fi for
everybody of course
so it's it's not not in my end
it can't be
um and it's not localized
it's not localized just to YouTube
so it might have something to do with
just traffic or something
I don't know so I guess that's another
mystery now uh do you assume that what
we found out about the FBI and Twitter
do you assume that the FBI has uh equal
operations in the other platforms
do you think Google and YouTube and
Facebook all have
their FBI
teams of course
of course of course
is there
is there any chance they don't
like why wouldn't they now the only way
I could see that making sense is if they
imagined that Twitter was
sort of the the tale that Wags a dog and
if you get Twitter right everything else
ends up right but I doubt it because a
bureaucracy would never ignore Facebook
with it could you imagine the FBI
bureaucracy all right we're going to put
80 people into Twitter but Facebook said
no so we won't have anything over there
that doesn't sound like anything that
happens in the real world does it
because who doesn't take a meeting with
the FBI
if the FBI says we want a meeting with
you in your business
and they and you're not in trouble
you're not in trouble they want to work
with you
to make your job better
who doesn't take that meeting
everybody takes that meeting
everybody because they're just offering
you a service we have some information
we can help you monitor the bad people
and the election interference we'll do
it for free
you just have to give us a little like
access or something
who would say no to that nobody
nobody would say no to them
this is the same argument I make about
Don Jr's famous meeting with those
russian-related people in in the last
election the first election
for Trump the everybody would take that
meeting it was just downstairs
and and sure they promised something
they didn't have which was some dirt on
Hillary are you telling me that if you
were part of a major campaign and
somebody that you knew it's not a
stranger it's somebody you know
personally somebody you know personally
says I have something that will change
everything some dirt on Hillary all you
have to do is come down two floors and
sit in this room for five minutes you
have it all a hundred percent of the
world takes that meeting
now if something came up in the meeting
there was like a national security
concern should they alert the FBI after
the meeting well yes no that didn't
happen it was just a sort of a nothing
meaning but
you don't alert the FBI first
that's stupid
because there's no indication of a crime
why do you get the FBI involved when
there's no indication of a crime there's
just somebody who says they know
something and most people are lying when
they say that I mean usually it's
hyperbole usually it's not what they say
first you listen
does anybody disagree with that
first you listen and then you decide
does that sound sketchy if it does then
the second thing you do is call it the
FBI and everybody acts like you should
have been the other way around
like immediately calling the FBI for
what
for what the guy you now wants to talk
to you
all right
um
soccer ball with a microphone what
yeah you have to pass the bill to see
what's in it
she bet with Fusion GPS before and after
the meeting is that true
I never heard that
yeah I saw the memes about Sam Brenton
stealing uh Santa's bag that was pretty
funny
trailers on the border I don't know
about that
all right
thank you for saying I'm correct
yeah the Omnibus Bill I don't know that
bores me budgeting
don't forget Jack doesn't know anything
flower girl says all right are you
surprised that we've reached this point
in the process about looking into the
Twitter files where Jack is still not
implicated directly
you know we're at that point right
did anybody besides me say this would
happen
that we would get to all the way to here
and there's no direct information
whatsoever
that Jack was directly involved in
anything bad
now you could argue you should have
known right that's a separate argument
yeah the argument of whether he should
have known
totally good argument
right and and by the way I'm I imagine
he would agree with that
I don't know but I think if you ask Jack
you know was it like your job should you
have known what was going on you know in
Greater detail he probably would say yes
probably say yes because he's been
pretty transparent about everything I
think
you say he knew but there's no there's
no evidence to that in fact the evidence
strongly suggests the opposite
strongly suggests
you disagreed
well I'm only talking about what the
evidence is not what the truth is
the truth maybe you never know but the
evidence suggests exactly what I
predicted I mean I had exactly zero
people agreeing with me
I'm not wrong about that right I think
zero people agreed with me when I said I
don't think he was involved directly
right zero people
now I could still be wrong you know
tomorrow we could find out something
where I'm wrong but the fact that we got
this far
with my hypothesis that he wasn't
involved still active it's still a good
hypothesis this far end
that's surprising
to some of you
yeah the simplest explanation you're
right
Scott doesn't know what evidence is
you think that's the problem
um
well for those of you who are saying I
hear you saying that you know Jack was a
bad manager blah blah blah because he
didn't do it
but let me give you a different frame on
this
Jack's management of Twitter did not did
not uh begin and end with his role as
CEO it continues now if you expand your
frame Jack Managed IT properly by
selling it to or sporting the sale to
Musk because selling it to musk was what
solved the problem and Jack said that
directly
he said he's the right person to do this
and I think that Jack knew that it would
require devastating the company
to fix it like you couldn't tweak it it
wasn't like displaying a few employees
and moving some people around like you
you had to you had to like take it out
by his roots and I think that Jack
probably knew musk well enough or at
least his operating
um
methods to know that musk could
potentially root it out at the you know
at the Grassroots and just pull it out
of the ground but it was hard for the
existing CEO to do anything like that
there's a long history of when you need
to do major layoffs and major
restructure you usually bring in a new
person
that's usually the way that's the right
way to do it because the person who's
there has personal relationships that is
going to influence whether you can do
the hard stuff right the person who's
been working there has too many personal
Stakes people they put in a position
they don't want to fire their friend
that sort of thing so
if you say that Jack didn't do his job
while he was in the job
I would argue that that is refuted by
the fact that he supported bringing Musk
which had to be very directly related to
figuring out what was going on in a more
aggressive way
so I feel like he maybe did
did what was right
to compensate for what problems had
grown up during his his reign
objective Jack knew that uh Jack knew
that uh Twitter was full of leftists and
the the effect of that was to
um to bias their operation
remember he was very he was very clear
about that
no he's never argued that Twitter was a
fair arbiter you know that right Jack
has never said Twitter is operating the
way I wanted to operate everything's
Fair he never said that he actually
agreed with the critics
that that Twitter was operating like a
left-leaning organization instead of a
you know just a platform
you said it directly
uh you said Jack didn't know Twitter was
actively throttling conservatives
correct
and and I still say that
because the examples given are
individuals
there's still not a that's the the dog
not barking the part we still don't know
is if people like me
were banned just for political reasons
now we know there's a bias which is that
people are Banning people for sketchy
reasons that really you suspect might be
political am I right
so the there's the gray area but I think
Jack fully accepted that the gray area
was exactly what you thought it was
that if you're staffed with leftists
even though what they're trying to do is
just the right thing like get rid of bad
information and stuff it will end up
being
focused on on conservatives
I I feel like he was fully transparent
about that
right it's not my job to defend him
but I'm just telling you what I saw
so the part that he has denied
is this is the part I said has not been
demonstrated
that they had a policy or a
programmatic you know policy I guess an
algorithm that would ban people like me
who had no strikes as far as I know
there was no conversation about me
so did I get scooped up in some kind of
bit so that's that's the part that he I
think he says no to and we do not have
evidence of it so far
I mean to me it seems
highly probable we will but so far not
and if we haven't seen it yet it means
Musk either hasn't seen it or for some
reason needs to know more or something
but that does suggest that you could be
the head of the organization and not
know exactly how that algorithm got
tweaked
um
yeah we all agree with the buck stops at
the top right right nobody nobody's
arguing responsibility
you get that right
the responsibility is who's in charge it
doesn't matter if they knew or didn't
know it's that's just the way it has to
work but I think Jack would agree with
that I mean I don't know but everything
suggests he would agree with you on that
that it was his responsibility
um
uh you say if Jack didn't drill down
from the answers that's unbelievable
let me fact check you on that
Jack personally contacted me you know a
few years ago
when I was complaining that it was a
shadow band
he personally introduced me to Dell
somebody whose job it was to work in
that area
I personally worked with her
and quickly determined that she was the
problem
and that she knew exactly what was going
on because she sort of started ghosting
me when I got too close
now the fact that he connected me with
her
suggests that he couldn't penetrate her
barrier any more than I did
now he could have fired her but that's
why you need a you need a musk somebody
who just says that's not an answer
you're fired
right I I feel like
Jack was more of a well I'm not getting
the answer I want but I'll try harder
maybe I'll see if if Scott talking to
you gets the answer
you know he was like he was like working
around the edges
but but to say that he didn't drill down
is inaccurate because I actually was
part of a process of trying to drill
down it's just I had I had an employee
wall you know a lower level employee it
was just a brick wall
but don't you think he hit the same
brick wall
let's say he had drilled down with her
all right Dell
Scott has this complaint
and she would say I see no evidence that
that's happening
then what does he say well look harder
okay
I'll look for a week I'll get back to
you yep I looked for a week nothing
there
what does Jack do fire her
he can't because he doesn't know if
there's nothing there
right he doesn't know
so all he knows is what his employees
tell him
and when do employees ever tell the
truth to the CEO
hardly ever right every everybody's
shading things when they tell the CEO
they're telling them what they think is
going to be good for them to hear
yeah
no if somebody says I looked and there's
nothing there
how do you fire them unless you know
there's something there
and how could he
it was it was a much harder problem than
you think the only way to solve it was
mass firings
the only way I I don't think any level
of management excellence
could have been replaced keep the same
keep the same employees in place and
then get to the bottom of it that wasn't
going to happen
you needed completely new people in
there some of them and I'm sure musk has
done that by now
yeah the fact that Elon called Twitter a
crime scene
I don't know how literal that is but
certainly feels right
uh
uh okay that's a long comment
all right
uh Tulsa gabbard and Tucker Carlson I
didn't see that
is Jack not technical yes but that's not
going to help you
being technical you know doesn't mean
he's gonna go scour the algorithm on his
own
if he's the CEO
all right
that's all for now YouTube thanks for
joining sorry about your bad connection
maybe better tomorrow
bye for now
