good morning ladies and gentlemen
welcome to the best thing that's ever
going to happen to you
and
some people call it coffee with scott
adams other people
simply call it coffee with scott adams
turns out they all agree i don't know
maybe everything's coming together
but how would you like to take it up a
notch i know you're that kind of people
would you ever settle
for simply being brilliant and unusually
sexy would you no
no not this audience
no maybe some other audience cnn's
audience for example they might settle
might settle for being
dull and unattractive
but not this group
no
you started sexy you started smarter
than average and watch what happens when
you take a copper margaret glass a
tanker tells to sign the canteen junior
flask the vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's the dopamine hit of the
day it's the thing that makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and
watch it do its thing go
i have to come down from that quite a
high
well there's another
poltergeist sighting
you've probably heard of the rash of
poltergeist
we had one poltergeist who was
apparently operating an suv
caused the suv to run into people
and and guns have been firing by
themselves and here's another one so the
governor of new york just announced
she said last night a shot from an
illegal gun
took the life of a police officer
now that's very tragic
we should not lose sight of
that but we don't want to ignore the
fact that
a bullet and a gun
apparently colluded with each other
in which case the
if i'm reading between the lines
correctly the bullet decided sort of on
its own
to fly out of the gun
uh the gun being harmless in this case
it was more like the bullet making a
decision
and the free will of the bullet caused
it to fly out of the gun
and apparently into the body of a person
who tragically died
so
um i feel like they buried the lead on
this story if you know what i mean
they're talking about it like a tragedy
and of course you know that is
but
i don't think you can ignore
that bullets and guns are colluding
can we i don't think we can no
rasmus nader poll uh
just came out they were asking among
other things how fair is the economy to
black and hispanic voters
how many of youth what percentage would
you guess before i tell you
i think that it's somewhat or
or more than somewhat unfair
for black and hispanics what percent
said is unfair
for black and hispanics
25 stop it
stop it
the answer is 48
so 48 thought things are not fair
in terms of the economy specifically
now here's the question
uh
why was there no question for white
people
rasmussen why was there no similar
question for white people
how would white people answer that
question
i don't know
do you
because it might be 48
i'm not even sure it would be different
would it
because if you ask anybody
hey is whatever group you belong to
being discriminated against what do half
of the people say all the time
yes it doesn't doesn't matter what group
it is
all right all of you left-handed
elbonians
let me ask you do you think the economy
is
stacked against you
48 yes
yeah i think that economy is stacked
against the left-handed obonians of
which i am one
so
uh i'm always wary of this kind of
question because i don't think we're in
a point where you can leave out white
people from their own question
i think this needs to be how many white
people think that they are disadvantaged
it might not be 48 it would be a lot
higher than you think
um
there's a new documentary called a coup
in plain sight which is
a january 6 kind of thing trying to turn
the or at least harden the narrative not
turn it but hard in the narrative
that it was a coup attempt
it was in plain sight we have all the
evidence now that they were
the
trump administration was
trying to put together some
counterfeit
documents to get
fake electors
seated to steal the election
so that's the way they frame it
let me tell you one way to know a fake
narrative
here's how you know
they assume people's
intentions and they assume them the dumb
way
now it is true that you do have to kind
of make assumptions about other people's
intentions just just to operate in life
but we're not very good at it
right
and
if you make it if you make an assumption
about some of these intentions
that are let's say obvious
there's not much to argue about for
example what is your intention
for having a job
well i can't read your mind
but it probably has something to do with
making money
am i right
did i get that from many of you
watch me read your minds the reason you
have a job
is to make money
probably right so if you're reading
somebody's mind
and it's the most obvious explanation
you're you're unreasonably strong
territory even though you could be wrong
you could be wrong
but what happens if you read somebody's
mind
and you choose the least likely
explanation
that's a sign of a fake narrative
right here's an example
uh the narrative for the january 6 is
that the trump administration
intended
to overthrow a legal election and stage
a coup
is that possible
could that have been their internal
thinking because there's no
documentation to that effect but could
it have been their internal thinking
that the election was fair
but they wanted to overthrow it
it's possible
right we live in a world where it just
seems like everything's possible these
days
so it's possible
now compare the possibility of that
to the other the other option
the other option is that they thought it
was actually a fraudulent election
and they thought that they were saving
the election
which which is more likely
is it more likely that people who lose
an election they thought they would win
remember there's no i don't think
there's any question that trump thought
he would win
right it looked like it was heading in
that direction
and there's no question that he's the
kind of person who never believes he
lost
we'd all agree with that that doesn't
take too much brain mind reading because
there's those just normal assumptions
about people right nobody likes to lose
he probably thought he was going to win
pretty reasonable right
but
isn't it more reasonable to assume that
he actually thought he lost and
something needs to be checked
that is a completely ordinary assumption
completely ordinary that somebody would
suspect something wrong happened because
it looked like it
if it looked like it uh i don't know
probably 70 million people thought that
something looked fishy wouldn't you say
is that a good number 70 million people
probably thought you know
i might accept the outcome but i'm not
sure that's i'm not sure that was
exactly fair
now they might be right or they might be
wrong
i'm not giving you an opinion of what
happened i'm telling you that
half the country thought there was a
problem or something like that 30
perhaps
so if the president was in the 30
percent and you would expect he would be
to think there was some problem with the
election
that is in every way the opposite of
their narrative
so to make an assumption
that feeds the narrative they have to
make the least likely assumption about
what they were thinking
the least likely assumption
is that people working for trump thought
they were doing an actual coup
because it would be obvious
they all
everything that they wrote down they
probably thought would be found
eventually right so who's going to run a
coup
like and remember these are not
we're not talking about jay guevara here
right we're talking about nerds and
suits
you know if you had like revolutionaries
you know if colin kaepernick was there
in the government you'd say oh possibly
a revolutionary
he might take it a little further you
know he would be on the other side of
course but just using him as an example
of an extremist
well he's not an extremist
let me take that back
not an extremist at all but just
somebody who would be more or less a
counter-culturally
provocative
maybe i can say it that way
but the people who are allegedly
in charge of this coup in plain sight
are just nerds and suits
like the least likely person
who would risk their entire life and
freedom
to like forge a document that somebody's
gonna find out for sure
or probably
so yeah yeah they're larping that's
that's a good i feel like they were
all trying to be on the team and support
the team do what they could and maybe
throw a hail mary
but i would suspect the most likely
explanation is they actually thought
something was wrong
and they were trying to find some way to
fix it and couldn't they couldn't find
any way to do it they would
pass their own internal standards for
what's legal and safe enough i guess
all right
apparently olympic sponsors are sort of
in hiding
what we normally expect about this time
when it's getting close to the olympics
you expect the big sponsors to start
bragging about their sponsorship
remember how that always used to be when
the olympics were upcoming all the
sponsors would say proud sponsor of the
2022 olympics
well it turns out that visa coca-cola
and others are just going silent on it
just maybe not mentioning it
how would you like to be in charge of
advertising and publicity for your
fortune 500 company
and your ceo calls you in and says
uh i understand we put
um 80 million dollars into advertising
for the olympics that's right that's
right
and
so far what you're doing is
staying really silent
that's right because we don't want to
don't associate with the olympics all
right hold on
we put 80 million dollars into the
olympics
to associate with the olympics
but what you're telling me now is that
we've spent the 80 million dollars but
our best play
is to try to get as much distance as we
can from the olympics
that's where we are
so
uh and apparently there are a bunch of
omicron breakouts with people
who were going to work at the olympics
so china's having a pretty big omicron
problem surprise
but the athletes themselves who are in
quote the bubble i guess they create an
impenetrable bubble and once you're on
the inside nobody else can get in
so the athletes seem to be clear so far
but the uh that's if you've got
three dozen people with omicron
in in the general vicinity of the
olympics
how in the world are they going to keep
the omicron from sweeping through the
attendees how in the world is that going
to happen
i can't imagine that this isn't anything
but a disaster
why are we not talking about the
olympics as what it is a gigantic health
crisis
and a publicity coup for uh china
i mean that's all it is at this point
youtube cut my stream no they didn't
you're still watching it
um
so that's happening yes 72 positive
cases of covet
among the people who are going to work
on the olympics 72 that's the 72 cases
of omicron
um
wake up scott
72 cases and there's no way they're
going to stop it all right so fauci did
a review on cnn so even cnn is is on the
skeptical side of why are we still
or at least it looks like they're
transitioning to hey why aren't we an
endemic already out of the pandemic
and they asked fouchy
uh cnn said i think it was anderson
cooper why should people with natural
immunity still be forced to take the
vaccine
and fall she said quote i don't have a
really firm answer to you on that
what
what
isn't he the guy with the firm answer on
that
uh but he went on to say that we don't
know if
the natural immunity will be enduring
the way the vaccinations aren't
wait what
so we don't know if the natural immunity
will last
so we don't know if it's as good as the
vaccinations that definitely don't last
trying to understand this again
we're not confident about the vex the
natural immunity
because we don't know how long it will
last
and that's the important thing
to compare to the vaccinations that we
know don't last
okay now i get that we would we would
like to have more information
but
couldn't we wait for that
you know if it turns out that six months
from now the natural immunity wasn't
what we hoped it would be
couldn't we just change our minds
and by the way
if it's six months from now we're
probably you know
away from the problem pretty far anyway
so
um i think fauci is
um he's on pretty pretty thin ice there
now i was going to come up with a name
for this effect
but it goes like this
in the old days
the science scientists
would manage the science
and then it would be a whole different
group of people who would manage public
reactions you know public relations
so that we that would be politicians and
pr people and stuff like that
but what happened to the pandemic
inversion
during the pandemic the scientists
started managing public opinion
am i right
who managed the science
when the scientists abandoned science to
become public relations people and
basically to manipulate us into
into a certain thing who what happened
to the guardians of science when they
became pr people
do you know who became the scientists
you did
you did
you had to do your own
i don't want to use the f word
unnecessarily
you had to become the scientist
they made the public become scientists
because the scientists turned into
pr people and brainwashers
now of course you know
there's no universal statement that's
true for all things and all people
but generally speaking am i wrong
am i wrong that the scientists became
pr people
and then the public had to become
scientists
which is not a good look
right
and how did the public do
when the public became the scientists
how do we do
not as bad as you would think
i think yeah i think the public had tons
of wrong ideas
tons of wrong ideas
but weirdly i think it would have ended
up
not that far away from where science
took us
right the actual practical difference of
our different beliefs many of which were
fake
uh even if we pursued our fake
understanding of the world we would have
been about the same place probably i
don't know
so it's hard to know because there's no
way to compare that
maybe we need what i would call
untouchable doctors
do you remember the movie the
untouchables what that was about
the problem was that you couldn't use
loc back in you know early history of
the united states you couldn't use local
law enforcement to stop the
big organized gangs
because the organized gangs had too much
money
so they would bribe enough police
officers that
that the regular police couldn't do
anything
so the government had to send in a
special group of people who just didn't
have any local connections
and so they were unbribable yeah elliot
ness in particular
and
uh it wasn't until you had unbribable
law enforcement that they could make a
dent
now we have this situation where we
don't trust our doctors
because we we imagine
i don't know how true this is
but we all imagine
that big pharma can influence at least
the hospitals
and then the hospitals can influence the
doctors because the doctors want to keep
their hospital privileges etc
so don't we need untouchable doctors
don't we need doctors who are not
beholden to anyone for whatever reason
they don't need research money they
don't need
hospital privileges
they don't even need customers they've
already made their money
we actually not rogues
see i don't trust the rogues
because the rogues have a
they have a benefit
that they can achieve even if they're
wrong
that's not a good look
so you don't want people to be able to
benefit by being wrong
and the rogues definitely benefit by
being wrong because they get the
attention etc then nobody will remember
they were wrong and they'll be famous
long after so even if they're wrong
their business model still works to be a
rogue so i don't trust the rogue model
what you need is some people who are
rogues before the problem
you see what i'm saying you need some
people who already were outside the
control of the system before you even
had a question to give them and then you
give them the question you don't want
them signing up to be rogues on their
own
right you want to have an established
group of untouchables
anyway think about that a wharton
professor
uh asked people in wharton class
what did they think was the average
income of americans but i don't think
average is good because the billionaires
skew it so i'd rather say median so the
the income at which there are as many
people above that line as there are
below what would you imagine is the
median income in america for one person
one job
numbers please
i'll tell you the number in a moment
i'm seeing guesses on locals from in the
40s and 50s 35
area
35 45
you're actually very well informed
i don't know how many of you googled it
yeah you're all actually you're all in
the right area
yeah you're roughly in the right area
that's correct the answer is uh 34 000.
now that's the median
so if you guessed you know
30s to 50s you're in the right area at
least
but here's the punch line 25 percent of
the students
believe that the average income not
median but average was over a hundred
thousand
a quarter of the class in this elite
institution a quarter of them
believed that the average income was
over a hundred thousand per year in
america
yeah 25 rule
yeah the 25 rule works
it works so often it's hilarious
um
wow but most of you got the right answer
so you're better than the
the wharton kids on that
so cnn is complaining about uh
the the rally yesterday so there's a
rally against the mandates in d.c and
cnn's take on it is that there were too
many references to nazism
and
robert kennedy jr apparently
compared the vaccine policies in the u.s
to a totalitarian state
and made an anne frank
can i give you a little media advice
now many of you have not taken what's
called media training
which i have
which is how not to do things like this
in public
they teach you how not to do this i
can't give you the whole media training
course
right now
but i'm gonna i'm gonna simplify it to
just one
pro tip
that you can bank on
one thing that i think you can generally
consider
there would always be a good idea
in terms of public speaking
don't compare anything to anne frank
comparing things to the holocaust is
ridiculous enough
but the moment you throw anne in the mix
you've gone too far
[Laughter]
here's you
yours too far and there's anne hello ann
i'm over here too far
too far
do you know what is the correct
way to make an anne frank reference when
you're not
not
talking about the holocaust itself
never
how about never
how about the right time to invoke anne
frank is never
how about never ever
how about that time you think you found
an exception and this is the one time
that maybe anne frank is no no
don't do it
how about if the story is about with
somebody named anne frank coincidentally
and what if this person who's also
coincidentally named anne frank was also
hiding in an attic
against the vaccine mandates
what if there was somebody literally
named anne frank hiding literally in her
attic in the united states because she
was afraid of the
vaccine mandate
police can you make an anne frank
reference then
no
no
i just told you there's no exceptions
you do not make
an ann frank reference no matter what
ever ever
so that's your media training for today
don't do that
all right but it's ironic that cnn would
be the one complaining about it because
they're the ones who use holocaust
references just continually
so a hypocrisy award goes to cnn
so just as we're saying to ourselves you
know i think maybe we're on the cusp
of our mandates being lifted the la
school district in its attempt to make
their students the stupidest students in
the whole world
have decided that cloth masks are not
good enough and every student will have
to wear
non-cloth masks that have a nose wire
you know that little thing that you
form fitted around your nose
including participating in athletic
activities
so if you're going to go for a run
outdoors
you need a really tight-fitting mask
if you want to go for a run
outdoors
now let me guess
what group of people
would have been behind this maybe
scientists
so do you think that the scientists were
following the science
and that the school district is
following the scientists who are
following the scientists or is it
possible that this has more to do with
narrative and pr
and manipulation and
so once again we have this question
who are the scientists
in this case
well i would say the scientists in this
case unfortunately are the parents of
these children
who should be
basically tearing apart the offices of
the
la school district they should be taking
their furniture
and throwing it on the lawn
and they're just leaving
that would be the perfect protest
just just go into whatever the student
lounge is
you know the teacher's lounge
of every school
and he's probably not locked during the
day just walk in in force
take all the furniture out of the
teacher's lounge and just throw it into
the lawn
just throw it in the parking lot and
then just leave
and just leave don't even you don't even
have to leave it make a statement
right by the way i'm not suggesting this
because you would get arrested but we're
sort of at that point
where
i don't want to break anything and i
don't hurt anybody right no violence no
violence no violence but if we just went
into every la school district and just
said look we gotta we got 400 parents
here so just get out of the way
just go into the teachers lounge take
every every stick of furniture every
item in it and just put it in the
parking lot and then leave
don't even say a thing
just leave
do you think that would make national
news
i think you would i think you would
exactly somebody just said child abuse
once it becomes child abuse
we can go into the school and put all
your furniture in the parking lot
because that's not even close to child
abuse
right that's not even close
all right um i finally figured out a
solution to this whole russia ukraine
thing
and it's not negotiating i thought
yesterday that would be the solution but
um there's a more obvious one
i think biden should put kamala harris
in charge of the ukraine border
and
i say this because biden says she's made
she's done a good job on the mexican
border with the united states and if you
can do that good job on such an
intractable problem i mean think about
it
how many people have tried to solve the
border problem
with mexico and kamala harris according
to biden
is doing a great job
so
i don't think you ignore that so i think
kamala harris has proven that she can
find the root causes of border problems
and solve them so she should find the go
find the root cause
it could be that she needs to build up
manufacturing in russia
something like that
but put her on the job she can handle
this
you know i've been saying that i i think
our play is that we need to get russia
on our side
and sort of pull them away from china
but
apparently it's too late
it seems to be too late
because i didn't know this but can
somebody do a fact check is it true that
russia
china and iran did joint military
military what do you call it tests
they did didn't they
yeah so if they're already doing
military drills together
um
it's kind of too late
it's too late
and
here's a question that i wonder is putin
already a chinese puppet
because if he's not already a chinese
puppet
he will be
am i right because the their uh their
trade has
you know it's doubled since not that
long ago so russian and chinese trade is
like crazy
they know they need each other because
they're both sort of anti-america
so it makes sense
and you would think that by now china
has figured out some way to put pressure
on putin economically
some way
so it seems to me that over time
you know the big chinese octopus is
going to
get control of russia just because it's
adjacent and they have to
because china wants to control
everything that's adjacent right
everything in their neighborhood
so they probably want to control russia
more than they want to control us
well that's probably not true
but
is it a coincidence that ukraine and
taiwan are heating up at the same time
do you think that is two independent
decisions
in which both russia and china said you
know this would be a good time
and that just happened to be the same
time
or do you think that they simply talked
and said you know if you do this i'll do
this and did they talk as peers
was it was it peer to
or did president xi
tell putin to make some noise in ukraine
because you know
it looks
it looks exactly like what it would look
like if putin were already under she's
controlled
doesn't it
now remember you heard the uh head of
the german navy who got an equator got
fired or whatever basically got fired
for saying that we should get closer to
russia and pull them away from china
and
uh it was a navy chief
it is definitely looking
like china already controls russia
and remember the navy chief said that
what putin wants is respect
how much respect will
putin get when he is rebranded as she's
puppet
and if we started pointing out that
every time putin acts it seems to be in
china's best interest
what happens then
hey putin every time you act um it seems
to be in china's best interest are you
basically she's because that's
what it looks like
yeah she's
so
i don't know if that would have any
impact on russia wanting to
get away from china but it can't be good
for putin to look like
he's working for china because it does
look like it i'm not saying that's the
case
but it looks like it
all right so do you think that there's a
wag to dog thing happening here
meaning
meaning that the media and the
government are working together to to
come up with a war because it's good for
the government and good for the media
well here are some things happening and
you decide so
we've i guess the u.s is pulling some of
its staff out of the ukraine embassy
which is what you would do in
anticipation of an invasion
so do you think that we really needed to
pull our staff out of the embassy it's
probably just good form i imagine it's
just makes sense
um
weird comments okay
so and then the uh of course the legacy
media is a warning of invasion
does it look like an invasion to you
because i've seen other other media say
that the build-up is since april and it
doesn't really look like an invasion and
then some people say oh total invasion
looks like an invasion that's going to
happen any minute but it seems to me
that
all of the signaling to the public
is a wag the dog stuff like get ready
for war
there's a good reason for war so get
ready for the good reasons for war but
there aren't any good reasons at least
for the united
almost st
outcome in
by 2024
it looks like all the smart people are
saying that republicans will have full
control
because it looks like they're going to
sweep 2024 and get control of congress
say the smart people that's not me
predicting but you know all the smart
people say that and it looks like
whoever runs against a democrat would
probably win i think desantis would just
destroy
biden
so
what do democrats do
when they see that business as usual
will put them out of power
what would they do
they would have to do something
they would change the
change the equation change the narrative
and i can only see one thing that they
could possibly do to maintain power
to start a war
now i'm not saying that's what they're
doing
i'm saying that when people understand
what their best
option is
they don't have to consciously make a
decision to do it
because their brain will do the rest
their brain will just talk them into it
being a good idea
so the people who would be wagging the
dog wouldn't all of them necessarily
know that they're doing a scheme
they might just get caught up in it and
start to believe their own their own
lies
so i do think that we're in the process
of talking ourselves into war
for no real benefit beyond democrats
consolidating
let's say support by being in a war i
can't think of any other benefit
except democrat power
so
watch watch your brain washing
levels here because they're going to go
hard at you
now this uh does open up an opportunity
though to uh
avoid a kinetic war with actual bullets
and i had a suggestion i'm just going to
put this out there
another way to avoid war with russia
would be to have our cyber units uh
attack
instead of our military
while they're part of the military but
instead of shooting bullets we should do
a cyber attack not on russia that would
be crazy but rather a cyber attack on
our own polling companies
the internal political polling companies
because if we can if we can hack into
our polling companies
and we can artificially raise the
democrats um polling numbers
if we can raise the democrat polling
numbers then we can avoid war i think
because if they think their numbers look
good
they won't start a war
only if the numbers look bad
so i think i think our cyber
security people could maybe fix us just
they just have to hack all of our
internal polling companies
you can't tell when i'm kidding can you
how many of you have been fooled by
something i said that you thought was
serious only to find out later
not so much
parody in reality
starting to merge
can't tell you can't tell did any
bubbles burst today i don't think so
i don't think so
all right um
i zoned out can you repeat it
that's my that's my favorite comment so
far
i zoned out can you repeat that
all right how many people think the long
coven is real
let me give you i'm just going to take
your temperature here
how many people think long covet is real
uh getting a lot of no's on the locals
platform
a lot of no's
um
i think it's real only in the sense that
people recover from things at different
rates
i don't think is real isn't permanent
here's my second question
how good are we how good are we
at predicting the long-term
health impact of vaccinations
because remember you can't test the
long-term until the long-term gets here
and it hasn't
but how good are we at predicting
potential problems
but where how long ago was the last time
we had
a long-term problem that we didn't catch
in short-term testing how often does
that happen
if you look at all meds
yeah maybe we just don't know that's
right but if you looked at all meds what
do we know yeah thalidomide is the
famous one and what year was the little
mine
uh i won't look it up so somebody will
tell me the year tell me the year of
thalidomides 60s
50s and 60s okay
where are we
scientifically and medically compared to
the 50s and 60s it's just worlds
difference right so in the 50s or 60s we
got caught off guard with this the
little bite stuff
uh what are the odds that we would get
caught off guard in
2022 do we do we still have is are we
still blind to the future in the same
way
or
is there something about the nature of
vaccinations and the nature of the body
where you can kind of know in advance
pretty well what the long-term effects
are gonna be
so so that's a big a hole in my somebody
says zantac
uh did zantac have long-term bad effects
was that what you're saying i don't know
the story
there i don't want to say that because
that would be i don't i don't want to
libel some company just because i'm
seeing a comment here so i don't know
anything about zantac
okay so yeah mrna is a new tech and
that's sort of why i'm asking the
question it are we so smart that we
could look at a new technology platform
mrna
and and know that that
is very unlikely to have long-term
effects can we know that
so
my current thinking is i'm devaluing
a long covet as a problem
i think it's real
but it looks like just some people
recovering more slowly and you know i
imagine i could survive recovering more
slowly if i had to
so
yeah there's still a lot of stuff we
don't know here
now
question
um
is the country moving in the right
direction or the wrong direction on
opening up
because i i feel like
anecdotally at least california is not
looking like it's going to open up
if i had to guess we're going to be last
i think
partly because our infection rate is
through the roof compared to other
places
right direction do you think
well i think
i think other places are going to head
in the right direction i just think
california is not going to hit the
february 1 date and i'm going to be
really really unhappy about that you
know it would be a great way to end the
the
mandates
take advantage of the fact that people
believe anything
or let's say let's say you could get 30
of the public to believe just anything
all right would you agree with me first
of all that that's a thing
totally a thing
you can get 30 of the public to believe
anything well 25 at least
right how many people would it take to
break the mandates
you know if 25
walk into every business without a mask
the business will be overwhelmed
how hard would it be to start the rumor
that february 1st is actually the date
the mandates drop
so that 25
of people show up everywhere
everywhere
as if they thought the mandates were
over
it probably would be doable now i don't
think it'd be doable just by me but you
know the the things that really
get ingrained in people
happen somewhat uh let's say organically
i don't know if you could just make up a
thing and then make 30
of the people believe it
unless you had the whole legacy media on
your side then you could do it easily
but for one person
you could actually
maybe
suppose you started a meme
that convinced 25 of the people that it
was an official policy that the mandates
were over on february 1st
how many people would believe it and
just show up without a mask and not even
have one
let me give you an anecdote
so i told you that the county next to me
you know which i i go to about as much
as my own county because it's right next
to me
um
they require vaccine passports
i heard a story yesterday from a young
woman who shall remain anonymous
and the young woman said that she went
with a group of people
to this restaurant that required the
vaccine passports and although she is
vaccinated she did not have her passport
because she did not anticipate the
difference in the other county so the
restaurant host said okay we need your
passports
so all the other members of a fairly
large party
took out their passwords and showed it
and then the one member said oh i don't
have it. so what was what was going to
happen
how do you think it worked out one
didn't have the passport
and the others did
were they
did they say oh sorry
this one person won't be able to join
you
and also by the way didn't have a ride
home
so this one person will just have to
take uber home
or sit in the lobby or something do you
think that's what happened or do you
think
everybody in the party
said well
you know too bad it's friday night i
guess you could have an empty table
and then they all left
do you think that happened
what do you think happened
let me give you
my impression of the hostess
okay you all have your passports except
this one person
in discord yeah go go ahead
that's what happened
right we're at the we're at the point
where people are just going to make
their own decisions
why
because who are the scientists
who are the scientists
we are
unfortunately our site our actual
scientific community abandoned us
if we had had rapid testing when we knew
we would
then i would say wow our scientific
community they're working well with the
government they're getting stuff done
but they didn't
in fact there was pushback against rapid
tests which we now know were exactly
right
push back against natural immunity
i mean
how many times do the experts have to be
wrong
and the public have to be right
sometimes by luck
but
still turn out to be right
yeah you're unfortunately you're the
scientist so i think uh i think a lot of
restaurants are going to act that way
they're just going to say
well i don't know now that would be an
interesting way to
now first of all let me say that
restaurants are the
softest target
because even in the restaurant you you
know
if you have to have a mask you just
walk past the uh
the hostess
you know what if i go up to you to use
the restroom
in a restaurant where they require
masking
technically i should put on my mask to
use the restroom right
because i got up from the table
a lot of people don't so it's fairly
common that people don't put on the mask
to go the restroom but
i like i like to uh i like to comply and
say you at the same time
maybe that's just me
do you ever do that
did you
comp you comply in the most ridiculous
way
so when i stand up to
uh go to the restroom i'll i actually
just hold the mask up in front of my
face
like this
and just walk past the staff and just
laugh at
him because it's ridiculous
if somebody says they do the same yeah i
just laugh at them like got my mask
and nobody's going to stop you
i mean why would they there's no
difference in risk at all so i think
mocking it out of existence is maybe
have i ever told you the power of
mocking
it's pretty powerful
we're at the point
where you know i don't think you could i
didn't think it made total sense to mock
somebody
from you know being afraid of delta
but i don't mind mocking somebody for
being afraid of omicron
in the age of vaccinations anyway i
think mocking could maybe get us over
the edge
so
if you see an opportunity for some
gentle mocking
so he says your wife wouldn't let you do
that sure she would
i've just used my hand over my mouth
yeah just walk into a restaurant like
this
um i'm sorry we need bass well i have a
mask
it's right here
no i'm sorry you need a certain kind of
mass i don't think so
no i don't believe that there's a
requirement on certain kind of masks
i'm pretty sure that this is a mask
and then they say no
i'm sure there's a requirement well can
you show me that code
because uh unless there's a code and you
know
put a sock over your hand
and put a sock over your hands and cover
your mouth
yeah they're universally illegal i i get
that
i've used a paper towel at the grocery
store
have you ever just used a rubber band
and a paper towel has anybody done that
before
a napkin
how about take the napkin and just like
hold it in your mouth
so it's just like
wait i'm going to do this
i think i can do a demo
we're just going to bathroom
now i'm just going to about i'm working
on them
i'm bored i'm fine
no i i comply with all the mandates
all the mandates
all the mandates
i comply with
because i'm a complier
a lot of people will they would say
you know i don't want to comply with the
mandates but i comply
and if you don't comply
i would call you a
vaccine denier for one
possibly a pandemic denier
but
i think that instead of making our masks
better and better
we should make them worse and worse
as a protest
just see how many see if you can get
into a business that requires mass by
doing this
just to see what happens
and and have a conversation with the
proprietor before you you know reach in
and get your real mask because you
probably want to bring your real one
with you just in case
just go into a store looking like this
and if somebody stops you you say
oh i i didn't realize
that their basket requirements were that
specific
do you have some written requirements
about the mass because i think i am
asked and then the person would say
you're obviously not masked
because look at all that you know
there's all these holes in the side to
which i say
well that's the same with the cloth mask
correct me if i'm wrong but i think the
cloth masks also
exhaust from all the edges and
i mean you're not trying to stop the air
you're just
trying to filter it a little bit right
so
this would be my new mask technique
when i go into
places after february 1st
and i think
i think you could all get behind this
and see
i would like to end today's
broadcast with a magic trick
some of you have seen this
i think i learned this from
from the amazing somebody
but
it's just a normal
normal tissue
and scene
that's all i have for today
so i will see you
tomorrow
