good morning everybody
and welcome
to an experience
that will last you a lifetime
and it's called coffee with scott adams
and it's the best thing that's ever been
done anywhere i think everyone agrees
you can hear them talking about it now
hear them yeah i think you do and all
you need to make this special experience
a higher level potentially
divine
all you need is a cup of bugger glass a
tanker chelsea's diamond canteen junk or
flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure it's the
dopamine hit of the day
it's called the simultaneous sip
and it happens now go
well
i'll tell you my my system for
checking the sound without the trolls
interfering is working
perfectly
and uh i know paul always says don't
thank me it hurts the flow but thank you
paul because you fixed my flow
um
here's a story
rasmussen had a poll
and they said that s people if biden's
policies increased inflation
and 64 percent of respondents likely
voters there
said yes that biden's policies increased
inflation
can you guess what percentage of the
public
what percentage of the public
answered that biden's policies did not
increase inflation can you
wow you are good guessers
almost every person got this one right
and and whoever guessed 24 percent let
me call hold on for a second
so i have to call out shadow
for guessing 24
now you knew that the answer was 25
but you were smart enough to know i was
probably rounding
and if you got it right
it would look impressive
because it was pretty clever guess
but if you got it wrong everybody would
forget immediately
so in terms of in terms of how to play
this in the comment game
your comment game is very strong shadow
answer is unfortunately exactly 25
percent
but the 24 guess
was excellent strategy
good game theory there
and
87 percent of people said inflation in
the rasmussen poll said inflation will
be important in congressional elections
do you know what it means when 87 say
inflation will be important and also
that biden has increased inflation if
you put those together what does it mean
what will it mean
somebody says the red wave
republicans will sweep into office
except
accept
there's one other phenomenon
which will fight against that
it goes like this
people like their own representatives
people like their incumbents
so i think all you know as usual all the
incumbents will get reelected so it has
more to do with how many empty you know
how many vacant seats there are my
understanding is there'll be far more
vacant democrat seats is that still the
case
the prediction is still for far more
vacant democracies right
i think that was the latest i read but
that could change at any time now the
other factor
the other factor is
uh
 happens
if there's one thing that you can
guarantee
is that between now and the and the
midterm elections
there'll be some
and you know it could be anything from
a recording of biden saying he'll he
likes to grab women by the
who knows what
could be something in ukraine that could
be
anything
i mean there's so many things that could
happen between now and election day
that
i feel as if
making a congressional
prediction
is just kind of dicey but i'm going to
do it anyway so in this case i agree
with the
majority
so i agree with the pundits
that i think the republicans will take
control of both houses
and i believe in 2024 they'll take
control of the presidency
most likely
i would say i'm a little more confident
of the congressional part just because
it's closer
and i'm less confident of the presidency
part
because trump is such a wild card
you throw trump into any situation
you're like i don't know
anything could happen
but if he ends up being the candidate if
he wins in the primaries
then i would say uh
because it's trump
the other side could unleash any kind of
attack
and it might work
so
for example you know the russia
collusion thing
kind of almost worked right
the you know the
hunter's
laptop story
the press made that go away just at the
right time
so we do know that the press can create
a narrative
that the public will believe so it
doesn't even it wouldn't even matter if
trump did something
you know ultra provocative i mean
everything he does but if he did
something like a little extra extra
provocative if that seems
impossible he doesn't even need to do
that
because the press will concoct something
a narrative
that will you know fit the democrat
plan
and their public will believe it
so it's pretty hard to
predict how much narrative they could
create
about what
between now and 2024.
um
somebody saying trump as president with
desantis as vice president oh god that
would be a package wouldn't it
you know i hadn't actually i'd never
considered that as
uh
like a realistic possibility until
literally just just this moment all
right let's think that through
have you heard anybody speculate about
that package i think i think i haven't
really considered it
because i see both of them as as the
presidential candidate
which is kind of ideal
what's the one thing you're worried
about with trump
his age right
so
where biden tried to solve his age
problem with kamal harris
that was literally the worst decision
anybody ever made
maybe it helped him get elected i don't
know
maybe she checked enough boxes that
the the demographics of it worked out
but but you really don't look at biden
and say to yourself oh he's we're in
good shape if the number one
has to check out early
but imagine trump
imagine trump saying something that only
trump can say
i'm in perfect shape at the moment
but i totally understand
that at a certain age you want a back-up
plan
i'm going to give you the best backup
plan
anybody ever gave anybody
and he could actually make that sell
because desantis would be the best
backup plan
because he also might be the best
president
yeah honestly we don't know
i mean nobody's smart enough to know
that another
another you know run of trump would
necessarily be better or worse than a
first run of desantis
there's no way to know that
but
he but trump could definitely sell
that the number two position is so solid
that you don't have to worry about it
now if trump even went
wanted to go further
and i i don't know that this would be
compatible with his personality
but it would be a great strategy
he could say for example i'll tell you
what
i'll guarantee that i'll have a public
cognitive test in other words it'll be
made public after the fact
once every
six months
or once a year or or on request by my
the white house physician
let's say on request maybe that's
smarter as long as people trust the
white house physician
um or how about this
how about he he hires a democrat
as the white house physician
why not
right
why not
just imagine it i mean we'll just work
through it i don't this doesn't seem
likely to me so i'm not going to predict
it or anything like that
but just imagine it
imagine trump saying here's my
proposition
desantis is my number two
white house physician i'm going to pick
a democrat
and the democrat can test me anytime
anytime they want
because i acknowledge that as a certain
at a certain age
this is just a good system
so what trump could sell
is a better system
it wouldn't even be personal
so he doesn't even have to make it about
himself
he could say you know wouldn't you be
happier if this system were in place
right now
wouldn't you like biden to have a
republican doctor
who is doing a cognitive test whenever
that republican doctor
deems it necessary and then makes it
public
and and if it's a negative result there
might be you know some double testing
requirement
but if the tests hold up
then the vice president is sort of
somewhat automatically
you know assumed to step up
why not
now
again everything has to be
a personality fit
and i'm not sure that that would fit
trump's personality because i don't
think he'd like to even
suggest
any weakness in his
in his future so i don't know that that
would even be the best strategy
but it's a strategy
and it would be very disarming
wouldn't it
because after people went through the
biden experience even the democrats are
saying
i'm a little worried that age is having
an impact
am i right
i would i think that most
not most but let's say democrats who are
paying attention
are at least concerned about their own
their own candidate's
age
it would be really clever for trump to
just suggest a system
that i think could be an enduring system
over a certain age
make sure that the white house doctor is
the other party
null hypothesis asks
can you talk to greg guffeld
about sending me a signed photo of
himself
uh greg
we've got a request here from a null
hypothesis
who gives me no contact information
whatsoever but
i know greg you're good at guessing
so he does have an address
and he does have a real name
we don't know what it is
but i think it's reasonable for you to
take a shot at it
so
you know pick an address pick a name you
might get lucky
uh there's a new technology i saw in a
mashable tweet
in which you get a little earbud
that's a
near instant universal translator
what
now of course this sort of thing has
been worked on for a long time but
apparently the how yeah like a babel
fish
but
apparently the
claimed technology
so i'll just say claimed
is that it can translate 40 different
languages
with a half second delay
do you believe that
do you think the technology is there yet
40 different languages with a whole
bunch of different
accents within each
and a half second delay
so that you could have a real-time
conversation with somebody in a language
that you don't speak
i
i feel like it's inevitable it will
exist
yeah it's inevitable it will exist i
don't know if we're there yet i mean
there might be a little hyperbole here i
don't know
and rooms are noisy and you've got lots
of you know
ambient noise problems etc
but
um we're getting there
speaking of that
uh here's a little uh lesson
for success
this will be the fastest little lesson
for success it's an example of a talent
stack
it's the simplest example i could think
of
and
i'm gonna give you the example to show
how two talents
which are fairly approachable you know
talents that an ordinary person can
learn
when you add it to
another talent if you pick the right two
talents
they make you unique and that makes your
market value higher and then you can get
jobs and there's a job that uh i wasn't
terribly aware of until recently
a medical translator
so somebody who's sort of on call for a
hospital let's say or a doctor
to come in on contract the insurance
probably pays for it and to be the
translator in the room
as let's say somebody who only speaks
spanish or only speaks chinese
is getting service
now
i guess
i haven't looked into it maybe one of
you can tell me right now while we're on
on some but somebody will know the
answer to this
a translator in that medical context
or or sign language somebody says yeah
a translator in that context probably
gets paid pretty well don't they
wouldn't you say they probably get paid
pretty well
um so wouldn't you
imagine combining the following skills
you let's say you already learned the
spanish on top of your normal language
english or vice versa so you can be a
translator
but on top of that you've also made a
study of the medical words most commonly
used wherever you're going to be
translating so you can translate like
obscure
medical terms because even the regular
translator couldn't do that because they
have never heard those terms
so and then then let's say you combined
that with uh you the sign language
so you can work with the deaf as well
how hard would it be to learn
let's say you'd already learned spanish
a little bit
if you already had spanish
and english how hard would it be to add
medical terminology
and sign language
imagine going in for the job as a
medical translator and you bring that
package it's it's pretty
um
yeah i mean it might take you a few
years to get up to speed now this
assumes that you're already pretty good
at spanish in english
but anyway the only reason i mention
this is not to suggest that any of you
enter this field
it's it's sort of a really clean example
of how to make an exceptional life and
of ordinary talents you just have to
pick the ordinaries that work together
well to make you unique everybody get
that
if you want to explain to someone else
how to succeed
and you want to give them the most base
case
simple thing
use that example
because the hardest part about
explaining a talent stack is that when
you you when you talk about it
generically
people can't quite connect to it but
that example is so clean
if you remember it it'll really help you
explain it to other people so then you
can become the uh the people who make
other people successful
how many of you have made other people
successful
by telling them something you learned
from me
has that happened
i'm actually curious about that
um
all right so so i'm just looking at the
comments a lot of people are saying yes
a lot of people are saying yes holy
so apparently um
apparently this content
travels
that's good news i didn't know that
actually you know i i i've never really
thought about it that much but it seems
that people can explain the com the
content
some aspects of the content
well enough that it travels
i'll be damned
i teach systems over goals all the time
wow
how weird is it
that it seems uh it seems highly likely
at this point
that the the thing i'll be remembered
for is not dilbert
do you know how weird that is
then if you if you fast forward to i
don't know 20 years from now whatever uh
some people will still remember dilbert
but i'll be far more famous for the
talent stack stuff and the systems over
goals
not even close
because the systems over goals and the
talent stack stuff
are like civilization transformable
concepts
i mean
uh they always existed
but just articulating them allows people
to pick them up better
so i mean it's the articulating that i
did i guess
wow
it's kind of blowing me away looking at
the comments now on youtube you can't
see the
subscribers over at locals but i'm
seeing a just a continuous stream of
people who have taught other people
those concepts
with success
meaning that the other people actually
visibly succeeded
wow
all right um
have i told you before how life
suspiciously mirrors movies
and i'm not sure if it's because we
think in movie terms so we just apply
that filter to things or if there's
something fundamental
such as we're living in a simulation in
which our plots are being given to us
and then then somebody's observing how
we operate
um and
it just seems to me that the simulation
if we live in the simulation
is about a month away from presenting
the following star a storyline
now i'm not going to predict this i'm
just saying that if we live in a
simulated reality that
mirrors
what movies do
we're about 30 days away from the
following thing happening
which is learning that the pandemic
started at a ukrainian laboratory
funded by hunter biden and the formula
for the antidote is in one of his many
still lost laptops
you can almost see the movie forming in
your head
can't you and then and the search is
and there's going to be a key part of
the movie where
07 or somebody's called in
and it's explained to him all right
you know this happened the this hunter
biden was funding these labs by the way
if you're joining late none of this is
real just talk about a fictional plot
um the hundred biden funded these
ukrainian
bio labs
and uh and then at some point another
character will say
all right and the antidote is on that
lost laptop
and the person explaining it will say
laptops
and then double07 will say all right two
laptops you know do we know where both
of the laptops might be
and then the boss says
not two
he had a real problem losing laptops we
believe there are seven
and then the plot that the whole plot is
to try to find all seven of the missing
laptops
you know sort of like so
sort of like thanos's
three rings or gemstones or whatever it
was
and they'd have to like
figure out uh
hunter biden's like depraved
activities and go to all the worst
places in the world to
retrieve the laptops
so they'd have to be going into the like
the darkest brothels
in the
in the
in the most dangerous parts of the world
[Laughter]
are you telling me
are you telling me this would be a great
freaking movie
uh imagine
you're learning about what hunter did
but only by going into the places where
his laptops can be found so so you have
to each enter each of these environments
to find out how wild it was and hunter
biden's never there
it's like so the movie never shows him
it just shows the aftermath or or or the
trouble he caused or the the village he
burned down or something
yeah it's a little like the hangover
movie right
all good movies borrow from other movies
well the pandemic's no laughing matter
except when it is
um so had you been curious about whether
it was true or not that four russian
generals have been
four right russian generals had been
killed by the ukrainians which would be
like a surprisingly large number
well general petraeus thinks it's true
you know he thinks that at least three
of them are solidly confirmed
and
here's how he explained it if you didn't
see this on cnn
and by the way cnn is doing a real good
job
you know since i criticize them often
i'll give them i'll give them credit
where credit is due
and i think they're doing a real good
job of having generals on explaining
what's happening there
that you know with standing next to the
map and pointing to stuff it's actually
really good i'm i'm kind of impressed
and petraeus especially is doing a good
job and so he says here's what's going
on
that these long convoys
their command and control breaks down
because the ukrainians can jam or turn
off all their communications
so it turns out the ukrainians are
dominating
the electronic warfare
didn't see that coming did you
i did
i mean indirectly i did because my
prediction was that russia would not
have
an easy time
because the ukrainians would have access
to um basically the best nato or
american technology
so somehow
they're they're jamming enough
now part of it is the russians don't
have good
um
protected communications somehow that
that got taken out and they're stealing
cell phones from the locals just to
communicate with back home and with
their own units i guess which again
makes them targets
so i guess at some point
because the russians don't have good
they also don't have initiative
that when the convoy stops
the problem of whatever stopped it
doesn't get fixed
until the general who's somewhere back
in the convoy
goes up to the front to figure out
what's the trouble and make some
decisions
and he can't do it by phone because
they've cut off his communications
so the general personally
has to move from wherever is a more
protected position to the front of the
convoy
and do you know it's waiting for him at
the front of the convoy
sniper
so they make
all they have to do is stop the convoy
and turn off communications
so if you stop the convoy and turn off
communications within the convoy itself
the general is going to have to reveal
himself because they don't have good
they don't have good lower management
within the ranks
if they had good lower management you'd
have some officers up front making local
decisions and solving the problems
much in the way maybe the general would
have
but they won't move without the general
in the russian army according to
petraeus is that true i don't know seems
like he'd know i mean it seems like
you'd know
but i don't trust anything these days
and uh do you believe that the
ukrainians have these talented snipers
maybe i mean i suppose they've been
training for a long time
so i can't confirm anything that
petraeus says about anything but it
would be interesting
to know that that was a strategy and it
further suggests that the ukrainians are
just operating on a higher strategic
level
does that seem to be consistently true
there are anti-sniper snipers
somebody says not correct but i don't
know which what they're talking about
yeah it's hard to get
a lot of trained snipers isn't it i i
didn't know you could create too many
snipers
but then again how many do you need
right
if you had six good snipers you'd
probably get four generals by now if
that if that technique i described
actually
produces results
you'd think the generals would learn to
wear the outfit of a private
when they're visiting the front of the
lines
do you think the generals actually dress
as a general when they get out of their
truck
i'll bet they do
unless there's some kind of facial
recognition thing going on apparently
clear view is operating over there at
least for the ukrainian side
so um by the way that's an interesting
story i haven't seen anywhere
clear view the controversial facial
recognition company
um is apparently going big or at least
they're participating in some
substantial way in ukraine and i think
it's because the ukrainians are going to
need to have facial recognition to
figure out who's russian who's ukrainian
at some point
so
uh
you know wars change things and war may
have made a big difference to their
business model all right
um
i saw a jack possabic tweet about a poll
of canadians
and i talked to vaccinated and
unvaccinated people and asked them a
question that nothing to do with either
those things
it had to do with uh russian sanctions
and they were trying to find out if
vaccinated people
had a different opinion about russia and
sanctions than unvaccinated
now i don't know why
but the conclusion is that the people
who are unvaccinated
don't want to go hard on russia or
probably just don't even want to be
involved in any way including sanctions
whereas the people who are vaccinated
are strong on russian
sanctions they really want those russian
sanctions economic sanctions
now
do you think that do you think this
correlation is real first of all
do you think that
because the correlation was super strong
i don't have the exact numbers it was
like really strong it was like 80 to you
know 20. i mean real big difference
so there are two ways to
at least two ways to interpret it i
don't know which one's true so one way
would be
that the people who don't want
vaccinations
don't trust the government to do
anything
so it wouldn't matter what two topics
you were talking about
you'd say would you like the government
to no
no stop i do not want the government to
do anything
i don't want the government to force me
to get a vaccination
i don't trust the government when they
say they're safe i don't want the
government to attack another country
because i don't think that they'll do a
good job of that and it's probably no
reason whatsoever i don't want them to
sanction russia sanction russia because
i don't want them to do anything
everything they do is wrong just stop
doing everything
so
is that an irrational
worldview
it's not my worldview
so i don't share that worldview
but i definitely respect it
do you do you have opinions like that
where
you're you're clearly you disagree with
somebody's opinion on any topic
but when you hear that other opinion you
say you know
that's not my opinion
but i definitely respect it
there must be a lot of people who are in
favor of abortion
but when they hear the other topic you
know the other side about you know
sanctity of life and stuff don't you
think there are a lot of people who say
you know
personally i might be in favor of
abortion but
i gotta admit
i do respect the other opinion
that's it's kind of uh it's unusual
isn't it
usually we don't respect either the pin
the people who have the opinion or the
opinion itself but there are a few cases
where you can you can respect the other
opinion and this is one of them the
people who say just don't give the
government any power they'll just abuse
it and do everything wrong
they're at least partly right at the
very least
they're very right-ish you know they're
more right than wrong it's just
are there exceptions that are worth
looking into and i say yes but as a
world view as a starting point
if your starting point is don't give
them any power
but somebody can make a convincing
enough argument let's say national
defense in which you should anyway
and that's kind of a healthy situation
right you want people who are totally
resistant to the government getting any
power
they are very productive citizens
let me put it this way
would you want to live in a world
in which at least 20 percent of the
public wasn't automatically opposed to
the government getting any power
whatsoever
i i kind of like living in that world
you know i don't want to use the word
heroes
to cavalierly
but the people who say the government is
bad all the time and you've got to watch
every single thing they do don't trust
anything don't give them a dime don't
let them make any decisions
those people are very very productive
citizens
sorry josh too many fairies
so anyway it's the same thing i say
about the
conservative worldview in general
somebody asked me about it recently
because i prefer
spending time with people who have a
certain worldview
weirdly even when i disagree with this
sometimes
weirdly
right
so
you know you most of you know that uh on
social stuff
i'm way left to bernie
but if you ask me do you all have like a
good world view that works
that creates you know good children and
makes society work of course you do
you got a great you got a great thing
going if if if i could do it
i would be religious
because i observe it's a really good
system i just for whatever reason my
brain isn't wired to
to be a believer
uh but if it were
i think i'd be happier
because the people who are wired that
way seem to be plenty happy i mean
relative to other people i think the
science says it and i think observation
bears down as well
so
um what did that have to do with biden
and venezuela well nothing but
is it weird to you that
the biden administration is looking to
buy oil from venezuela
who is as you know not exactly the most
trustworthy uh
country and not exactly our ally
and worse yet if you didn't know this
venezuelan
crude oil is
uh do you say heavy or dirty what's the
right word
but
it's worse for the environment
than is
most other oil that we're using
it's heavy so somebody's saying heavy is
the right word
high in sulfur i'm being told
so the point is
that biden could
allow or at least encourage
more domestic oil production
and we would create um
fairly
let's say
more benign nothing's benign let's say
safer
we would produce a safer energy
than venezuela
and we would make the money
and then we'd have this robust industry
but rather than making the united states
more wealthy
and the environment safer
two things that the president has vowed
to do
he's decided to make venezuela richer
and to make
the environment worse
and
none of those things are an
interpretation
am i right
i mean this i give opinions here
but that's not an opinion
he's literally saying my dollars will go
to venezuela instead of the united
states and he's literally choosing the
most polluting option
when there's a perfect substitute
available
now
to be fair
to be fair
lots of times people like me
ignore that time has any element or
variable in this
so let me not do that
it could be
that if we're talking about the next you
know 60 days
that we've got to do some
kind of out of the box things just to
keep the lights on
and it may be that if we're talking
about 60 days we just need to get any
oil we can anywhere we can
uh but if you're talking about what's it
look like in a year
then you think that domestic production
would be the obvious way to go
but
here's the political calculation i think
momentum matters
so if biden is trying to go green in the
long run any reversal in that is going
to be harder harder again to reverse the
reversal
so he may want to say he might he might
say it's easier to turn off venezuela
than it is to turn off american oil
production again
you already got enough trouble for doing
it once
he doesn't want to ramp it up to have to
ramp it down again when things return to
normal
so it could be
that
the venezuela option makes sense for the
the short term and it's easier to just
turn it off because you don't care
um
so it might not be crazy but i haven't
heard the argument
so here's the thing if you haven't heard
the argument for it
you must assume the worst
can can i establish the standard for
politics
it's the standard for which i thought
obama should have been impeached
uh i'll take you back many years to
obama administration
he got into office by saying he was um
open-minded about weed
and he wasn't going to go after weed
weed stuff but as president he reversed
it and started to go hard after
dispensaries in california
that were legal in california but not
under federal law
so he did exactly the opposite of what
he said he would do
without explaining it
it's the without explaining it part that
i say should should have been
impeachable i mean i don't know if
that's you know technically impeachable
but in terms of what what is the right
thing to do
if you change your policy
or even if you create a new policy and
you refuse to explain why
you should be fired
if you if you do something i don't like
and it doesn't turn out well
well i i might not think you deserve to
get fired
because i do understand that all of our
leaders
trump included
they're all going to make mistakes
that's just sort of baked in right
you're not going to look at the one
mistake unless it's
so egregious but typically you have to
look at the whole package because they
make some mistakes and they do some good
stuff if you don't look at it at all
you're just being ridiculous
so
um
the fact that biden has not explained to
us
why he would
pursue the venezuelan oil is a real
problem
but it might be
that the policy itself actually makes
sense
and i don't think it's too strong a
a standard
to say that if your administration won't
give you their argument
they should be fired
does anybody disagree with that
if you had an employee
who wouldn't tell you why he was doing
stuff
you do fire their ass right away it
wouldn't matter if they did a good job
right
you just say okay that doesn't work
chain of command boom
yeah
so
um
so everybody's waiting for some kind of
uh breakthrough in the ukraine situation
to get a peace deal
and
i think the peace deal is rather easy
rather easy
and here's here's all you'd have to do
and by the way if you didn't know this
if you want major breakthroughs in
international
thorny situations
you should talk to cartoonists who do
live streams
because man do we have a good track
record of fixing international events
but here's what i it looks like an easy
situation so let me just
explain the situation and you can see
why it's so easy
so the only thing we need to end the war
in ukraine
all right so this is the only thing you
need we'll just keep it simple you don't
need all the details
this is all it would take to end the war
in ukraine
all you need is a some kind of totally
unenforceable peace deal
between the two least trustworthy
entities on the planet
both of whom apparently believe they're
winning
and for whom uh losing means death
so
um how hard could it be under that
situation
for the parties involved to uh come up
with a deal
uh
well
it might be hard
but
i'm gonna explain to you how trump
might make it work or at least would
make a better attempt at it nobody knows
what would work
it goes like this and i this will be my
new uh
segment called wwtd
what would trump do what would trump do
well the first thing trump would have
done is he would be
um unpredictable am i right
and i am seeing smart pundits say
that when biden said we're definitely
not gonna you know put any troops
against russia
that russia knew exactly what the the
worst case scenario was
and it wasn't bad enough to stop them
from invading so it was basically
permission
now number one
would trump have been predictable and
said under no situation
will we act militarily
don't know
but we do know that his signature
persuasion which he said
out loud and often was to be
unpredictable
so it seems unlikely that he would go
against his you know primary
method which he bragged about all the
time
so i think first of all he would be
unpredictable that would be good
um but the other thing that would be
trumpian
is a carrot and stick approach
and here i'll give you an example and
then we'll generalize it to ukraine
i told you about a co-worker i used to
work with
who would not only um
yell at people if they didn't help her
so if somebody if she needed help from
somebody else in in the in the company
and they were not as responsive as she
wanted she would go right to their boss
and just trash them like crazy
i mean really really trash
and and she would do it instantly the
minute you didn't give her what she
wanted
and everybody knew that
so she had she had a uh
a mutually assured destruction thing
that was really powerful but that was
only half of the technique
and this is what trump gets right
the other half of the technique was if
you gave her what she wanted
she would go to your boss and say you
need a promotion and a raise
reliably
she would go to your boss and say man
working with this person has been such a
joy do you understand what a good
employee you have i mean you should
really retain this person i i'd hate for
this person to leave you know you really
ought to think about a promotion and
now that kind of stuff really does have
an effect on a boss does it not
because she was very convincing and
credible in her own in her own right
because she was very effective
so here's the technique it's not good
enough to threaten
you have to paint a picture of what the
worst case is
versus the alternative
and and make sure that people know
that it could be very bad but here's the
trumpian part
it doesn't have to just go back to
normal
it's not it's not a question between
being normal and being really bad
it's the choice of being really bad or
why not really good
what what would stop you from being
getting everything you want
a trumpian offer would look like north
korea
hey not only do we have no reason to be
enemies but
let me show you a little slideshow
about how we can invest in north korea
and how we could be
in the future economically bound to each
other and
mutually beneficial
he actually did that now what does that
do to your brain
if you're a kim jong-un
it broke the frame
so that's the technique breaking the
frame if somebody's locked in a frame of
you're my enemy
you really can't get out of that
i mean you can't solve it within the
frame
because you can't make a deal with an
enemy so he changed the frame to
enemy
hell i'll invest in you
nobody invested in their enemy
so the fact that he had put some work
into looking at what an investment would
look like
and he was somebody you knew could do
business with anybody
i mean that's one of trump's advantages
right
he can do business with anybody saudi
arabia yeah khashoggi
yeah
we'll let that slide
so he was credible i mean even before
saudi arabia he was credible as a
business person who could make a deal
basically
so
uh let's take that back to the ukraine
situation
so far what putin has been offered
see if i'm wrong
so far what putin has been offered is
humiliating defeat
or
conquering a country and having so much
trouble holding it
and being sanctioned forever
i mean basically
two bad choices
and we're wanting him to do something
that we want him to do
by giving him two bad choices
how does that work
how does that work
um
here's what a trumpian and again i'm not
going to say trump would do this i just
use him as a handy reference point right
a reference point of somebody who would
make
a creative a creative negotiating deal
the first thing trump would do is shake
the box
just change some variables somehow
somehow i mean the ukrainians changed
the variable by holding on as long as
they did
but one of the things you could do is
put more things into the offer
so right now we're saying you know
ukraine russia
sanctions that's sort of the whole
package
but probably some positive things you
could put in there
you could probably paint a picture
of an upside
imagine you said
let's just take this as an example and
i'm not saying this would work you know
we're just talking through the concept
here
suppose
as the pundits are saying that one of
the things russia wants is this land
bridge
so that russia itself is connected all
the way to the black sea and you can see
why they would want that
now how much does anybody else care
in the other country
if russia has a good economic
path to the black sea
is that is that really something we care
about
or
shouldn't everybody have a good a good
uh transportation system
like why why are we afraid of their
transportation system
i feel like that's a little unconfident
on our parts now i get that if they're
an evil empire you don't want their
economy to get bigger
but if you wanted a a negotiating point
that understands everybody's going to
have to give up something
here's what a deal would look like
okay russia
tell us what your economic interests are
and that's the deal we'll make
tell us what your economic interests are
period and that's the deal we'll make
now you also
in return for this stuff you're probably
going to have to figure out how to
protect ukraine
without putting military in there that's
probably going to have to be part of the
deal
how hard would it be for us to promise
that ukraine will be a
so-called neutral country and not a nato
country
i think we could promise that
you know why
because we could always change our mind
right
why would we hold back on a promise
when we would get something for it that
would be enormous
and we wouldn't give up anything because
we could just change our mind in the
future if the situation changed
um
so i think that
the the nato part is the most solvable
part
you just say you'll do it and if events
change and you need to change your mind
and you need to make them nato then you
do it
but i like this concept of creating
neutral countries
because
the whole idea of an industrialized
military power invading a neighbor
that really has to stop with this
that really
this needs to be the last one of those
which is kind of why
i think ukraine is doing the world a big
favor
by making it so impractical
to attack your neighbor with tanks
i think they may stop future wars
assuming they prevail
so i would love to see the united states
first of all produce two gdp predictions
one if putin stays in power
which presumes sanctions stay in and one
if he doesn't
and so we should be able to show to the
russian people
two graphs
putin in power
you all make money
putin i'm sorry putin in power you you
lose money
putin santa power
you're up eight percent or whatever it
is
and
i think
that there should be a sweetener to the
offer so it'd be something like
all right we'll
we'll make a serious effort to make
ukraine neutral whatever that means
but there's probably a way to
protect them in a neutral
context
but what happens if russia says yeah
we'll keep our hands off them then they
start doing their bribery and cyber
attacks and
you know the other underhanded stuff
well then you say okay if you do that
stuff
then the nato question's back on the
table
so you just say to russia absolutely we
will totally promise ukraine will never
go into nato
as long as they're not actively under
attack
and that includes cyber
right now i don't think there's anything
that would stop russia from cyber
attacks
but you can at least you could at least
tell them that that gives you a trigger
to to change your mind about nato
so you always have the out because
they're always going to be cyber
attacking you or you can always say they
were
you have you have the easiest out of
that promise anybody ever had
and then i think you should promise them
a land bridge
but not necessarily
through annexation
if you're willing to make ukraine
neutral
why do you need to own the land bridge
right
neutrality by definition means the
russians can drive there with just show
their passport and say hey i'm
taking this truck across the land bridge
to
the black sea
so it seems to me that neutrality if
somebody could define one that could
work
something you could work with
but i think you want to promise the
upside too so they might need the land
bridge they might need the
demilitarization
uh they definitely need putin to look
like you won
right
now
here's the thing
what time is it by the way
okay
i don't know if the united states
wants any scenario that allows putin to
stay in power what do you think
because it's not like we know who would
replace him
it seems pretty iffy
i think we would rather contain him than
replace him is that right
what do you think i mean we don't have
an explicit
stated policy about that because we
wouldn't say that out loud
what do you say do you say contain him
or replace him what is the
what is the
u.s
secret goal not what they can say in
public
contain replace okay we're all over the
board here
all right your opinions are all over the
board
meaning i don't know
i'm not even sure what the american plan
is but i i'm not so sure we're not
better off trying to squash them
by the way all the people who say that
economic sanctions don't work
here is my argument to you
everything doesn't work until it does
uh human flight in an airplane
didn't work
until it did
right
fusion
has never worked
but it looks like it might
so there are lots of things that never
worked until they did and it's because
the technology usually is changes to the
point where the impossible becomes
possible
electric cars flying you know flying
cars
that's all going to be possible
you just have to wait until
it's ready
and my
contribution to this is that we've never
been so
economically connected and we've never
had so much ability to communicate
because of the internet
so at this point we may have reached a
point where for the first time
economic sanctions could be a kill shot
in a way that they never could have been
before or
or
it might be in the future but we're not
there yet
so this is an interesting test because
if this takes putin out
it would be the first time an economic
sanction
or sanctions
took out a leader am i right hey is
there are there any historians here who
can answer that question
has any uh
has any leader been taken out
through economic sanctions alone
meaning that their own people took him
out because they couldn't stand it
karjar
south africa
would you say south africa as an example
but that took 20 years right
or 30.
i don't know my south african history
yeah i guess i guess south africa would
be
a case the czars of russia somebody says
i don't know i guess i don't know enough
about my history but um it would be an
interesting turning point in
civilization if economic sanctions took
him out now here's the other possibility
of the possibility is that
china and russia and
saudi arabia get together and they
start trading in the wan instead of the
dollar
and then suddenly
there's like two separate
you know economic systems a dollar-based
one and the one-based one
and here's what i say
isn't that going to happen anyway
it kind of has to happen doesn't it
because china is just going to be
too big
for anybody to say no to their currency
um let me ask this question
isn't the only thing that makes currency
valuable is if there's somebody who will
take it
am i right
there's nothing else
the one thing that makes any currency or
any crypto valuable
is that you have some assurance that
somebody will take it now doesn't the
size of china itself
guarantee that there's always a market
for the one or doesn't it work that way
yeah
yeah you could have a degree in
economics and still be totally lost if
you're a little bit outside your
your channel
um
it seems to me that there's no way to
avoid at least a second currency
the one
so i don't know if i don't know if it
makes any difference because it was
going to happen anyway maybe
maybe it speeds it up
or maybe that just maybe just every
currency will be
transferable i don't exactly understand
do you
why is it that you have to buy oil in
dollars
is there any reason for that is it
because we assume it's not going to
fluctuate as much is that the
is that is that the only reason
because i think that alone could be
solved if fluctuation is the only
problem it seems like you could solve it
just contractually
yeah yeah we're the most stable economy
so you just assume that the dollar will
stay valuable and have a market forever
i don't know that seems pretty solvable
i i think china looks pretty china's
going to be around right
saudi arabia is going to be around for a
while
all right um
what do you think about uh running out
of food because of the ukrainian
wheat situation
well i uh tweeted an article
by
aaron smith
he had a blog there he seemed to know
what he was talking about and he was
looking at the wheat situation in
ukraine and russia
and his take
uh bottom line is that um even if we
lose a ton of wheat
well more than a ton obviously but a
uh
let's say
a lot of wheat
if we lose a lot of wheat
his argument and he goes to the numbers
to make his case
is that it wouldn't be that big a deal
do you believe that
and his argument basically
is that we've had droughts
that have had this much impact in the
past
so basically if you're having a you know
a 10
um
hit on wheat
that's not that different
than hits we've had in the past for
various natural reasons
so i mean imagine if we had droughts at
the same time as the ukraine thing would
be twice as bad of course
but
yeah it looks it looks like the price of
wheat will go up
but there also will be substitutes
and i ask you this
um
do we even need wheat
is wheat even
necessary
like i'm not even sure people need any
of it do they
i wonder if one of the changes will be
that we'll come up with a substitute
that's just better
i mean i
a lot of us we can't live without bread
i know what you mean like just the
pleasure of eating bread is kind of
awesome
but
yeah i mean rice is the obvious uh
replacement
quinoa
i mean quinoa is even more obvious
now nothing's going to happen yet
there's nothing you can do in america
that would be fast enough to make a
difference
so apparently the idea of you know
quickly growing more wheat in america so
we'll have some next year that doesn't
really hold up life's not really
practical in a sort of a one year period
chickpeas
i don't know everything that i see has a
a potential upside i guess i'm
feeling optimistic but uh i think
you could argue that wheat is one of the
biggest health problems in the world
all right am i going to get demonetized
for saying that
let me soften that so i don't get
demonetized
um
is the world healthier or less healthy
without
wheat now it might be that the problem
is that that's all
the low income poor people can afford so
you just have to have it
maybe
but it seems to me
that aren't we better off without wheat
i don't know
are we
i i do i do eat big bagels you're right
but at least i have some aiken
what is this somebody says all
right
well that's happening
um
i saw a picture of trump that was on
twitter
and i had to ask if it was a fake
picture
because he looked he looked uh
50 years old
now the things that look obviously to
have changed or it looks like he's lost
weight
but his face instead of
being wrinkly
it actually looks younger
so i'm going to say
he may have lost weight
but he may have done a little bit
of work on his face probably not surgery
but i think that yeah not botox but i
think uh can't you put in fillers and
stuff
maybe fillers
i don't know all the technology but i
doubt it was a facelift i feel like we
would have known that he couldn't hide
that could he
anyway uh it looks like he even changed
his haircut a little bit so it looks you
know a little bit more
like other people's haircuts so
yeah the lighting was good
i don't know maybe photoshopped a little
bit
but um
i had heard from
i've heard from people who have talked
to him recently
that he he looks great
has anybody had the same experience does
anybody know anybody
who has seen him recently
and said he looks great
besides losing weight
yeah
maybe less stress yeah less stress
might be a lazy oh it could be a laser
treatment it doesn't have to be fillers
yeah it could be that
but
he also might be aging backwards we
cannot
eliminate that possibility
all right ladies and gentlemen
i believe i've delivered the best
entertainment
that you didn't pay for
and
although some of you did and
i'm pretty sure we've solved almost all
of the problems
if there's anything i missed let me know
i'm going to be working on a micro
lesson on how to deliver a compliment
without sounding creepy
so only the subscribers on locals will
see that
along with the 200 plus other micro
lessons that will change your life
by the way if you learn to give a
sincere compliment that doesn't sound
weird
it's a really powerful power
it's a powerful power
that's the best kind of power to have
the powerful kind
i'm still working on my book yes i am i
am so mostly i'm at the phase of uh
compiling what the
each of the chapters will be
and then
mostly over the summer i'm going to be
pounding out the chapters i think
uh that's right the micro lessons are
worth the cost loan
effective way to fix social anxieties
uh the dale carnegie course
yeah
um dale carnegie
teaches you how to
talk to strangers
now you have to get the right course
they have a number of courses so you'd
have to ask which one it is they changed
the titles
but uh oh somebody says toastmasters too
yeah so basically
the way you can fix social anxiety
is by
training so it turns out it's it's a
learnable skill far more learnable than
a lot of things
there are lots of things that you you
can't really change about yourself
but your skill at dealing with complete
strangers and talking to them and stuff
like that that is completely skill based
you think it's not but it is
all right um i need to go
and i will talk to you
later
