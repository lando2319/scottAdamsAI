team in which i'm going to give you a
lesson on
writing a world-class comic strip
in real time so i'm going to do
something that
i don't know has ever been done and
i'm probably going to quickly find out
why it's never been done
maybe it's a bad idea so the idea is
that i'm going to be taking some
suggestions
uh both from the comments here and also
i've got open uh chat on the locals
platform
where subscribers to my community
are making suggestions about what kind
of a comic topic i should write about
so what's going to happen is this live
stream will be
kind of long and slow in the sense that
you're going to watch in real time
the process from beginning to end of
coming up with a comic idea and running
it through the
the filter or the formulas if you will
that
the cartoonists sort of have in their
head and how to then translate that into
an actual joke
i'm not going to do the drawing today
drawing would be
separate lessons this will just be how
to write
a tight little comic strip
so i wasn't planning on doing a
simultaneous sip but
as it turns out one of the things i
wanted to talk about
is environment so the first part of this
lesson
is how to get your environment right in
my case
if i don't have a warm beverage i'm
thinking about it the whole time so a
lot of what you're doing
as a cartoonist or writer is creating a
situation where you're removing all the
other things you would be thinking about
let's take the simultaneous sip and then
i'll tell you about those you ready
do you have your copper mug or vessel
go
oh that's good so
the first thing the writer needs to do
is find the the physical
situation that is most conducive to
writing
now if you don't think that's important
you'll never be a professional writer
because getting the physicality of
writing
just right is the difference between
being able to do it well
and not it's that big a difference in my
case i'll tell you my routine but it
would be
individual to each person
i'm literally in my pajamas with a
with a little jacket on here because
temperature and
physical comfort are really really
important
nothing is more comfortable than pajamas
and
first thing in the morning is when i'm
most
mentally capable of writing humor
so i've tried to do it at any other time
of the day it's always better in the
morning
don't know why doesn't have to be a
reason it's just the right energy
for me most writers have the same
experience by the way
that early morning or for some of them
late late at night which
kind of becomes early morning is when
they write best
so that's the same with me another tip
is uh
i can't write with my shoes on
don't know why i'm not saying that that
would apply to you but try it
if my shoes are on i just don't write as
well
so i always write barefoot but again
that's individual
and i also make sure that my feet are
flat on something and my legs are not
crossed that's my dog
making i'm live streaming snickers
she just doesn't understand um and i
contend
that if you get your physical condition
right and you're not like
laying back on a bed or or relaxing on a
couch
because those things trigger you
physically into a relaxed
state that's not the state you want to
be in
when you're trying to reach your peak
thinking
capability you want to be in a physical
position
which is compatible with peak mental
capability
and that's easy sitting upright with
good posture
feet squarely on something whether it's
a footstool or the ground
and looking straight ahead because if
somebody said
all right your life depends on you
solving this
puzzle your life depends on it
and you know you're getting ready to
hear the puzzle
what position would you be in right if
your life depended on it
would you be all right i like to i like
to relax when i hear my
life and death puzzles ah all right go
probably not right you would sit upright
with your
feet square on the ground you would you
would have good posture and you would
say
what and you would be really clear that
your body language
and your mental state had to be aligned
it would be life and death and you do it
right
if you're writing and you're not
operating as close as possible to your
peak mental performance it really shows
the difference between being completely
on your game
and being just a little bit off when
you're riding
is the difference between being
commercial and not commercial
it's a big difference all right so i put
on the jacket really just to show you
that you have to get your temperature
right
it's physically as soft all of my
clothing is soft
so i've got all of my my physical stuff
done i made sure that if i
needed to use the the restroom i've done
it
if if i have any hunger
i snack first but you do you do
something with protein
eat some peanuts or protein bar
but don't use some carbs especially
simple carbs
because those simple carbs will turn
into sugar pretty quickly
and they will bring down your energy and
your brain will get more relaxed
which is good in its own way but you
won't be able to write as well
so the food you put in in you right
around the time you write
uh how much sleep you got even the
amount of light
let me show you my room is right now
the curtains are down and i'm using
artificial light indirectly now part of
this
is for the benefit of the cameras you
know so i can control the light
but i also control the light
to control my mental state i told you i
write best early in the morning
i write best before the light comes up
and there's something about the light
that makes me not want to be sitting at
a computer
if i see natural light through a window
i want to go outside it's just a natural
impulse
so sometimes and this works well for me
i have blackout shades so that if i
really really need to force myself to do
some
creative work i can make sort of an
artificial morning that lasts a little
bit
a little bit longer which is what i'm
doing right now
all right so here's the process i'm
going to be taking
suggestions for a workplace or even
remote work
themed comic i'm going to be reading
them
from the locals platform from my
subscribers there
and then i'll tell you how to run them
through the humor
formula now the humor formula
uh we'll go over this first is something
i invented
years ago when i discovered that there
was a pattern to what made things
funny as i was a new cartoonist i was
trying to figure out
now why is something funny and something
isn't have you ever wondered that
why are some things funny and most
people will say well it's
a surprise not really
right i'm surprised can be part of part
of what makes something work
but it's not like the the key to what
makes something funny
the key as far as i can tell is to use
at least
two of these six dimensions of humor now
i came up with these six dimensions just
by
observation and pattern recognition some
years ago
but you'll find that this formula holds
every single time
and you'll as soon as you hear this for
the first time
your first reaction will be okay i can
see what you're saying
but that's not going to be true every
time
somebody writes humor that it's not
funny unless they have two of these six
elements
that can't be true every time but it is
every time no exceptions you will see
people attempt
to write humor with one dimension and it
might even get published
but you're not going to laugh if it only
has one
all right let me tell you say a little
bit about what the dimensions are
and by the way the more dimensions you
have
the funnier it's going to be and that
that rule is
pretty much guaranteed so
cute usually means children and animals
so that's why comic strips have lots of
little kids
and lots of cute animals you know
kittens and cats and tigers
especially clever just means that there
was some kind of a
solution that uh is sort of laughably
clever as in it's almost crazy enough to
work
it's so bizarre how did somebody think
of that that solution
or it looks like a solution but it isn't
quite
but it's clever so it's a clever
solution
you'll you'll know these when you see
them naughty of course is any
um sex or bathroom reference those are
obvious
bizarre is any two things that don't
belong together
gary larson famously would have talking
animals
now because animals don't talk that's
bizarre
so putting a bizarre element in the
comic gives you one dimension now he
also had to have at least one more
dimension and always did
usually two or three recognizable means
that the situation
in the joke is one that you've been in
and you say to yourself
oh yeah i've been there i'm gonna have
to yell at my dog every now and then now
she's going into this loud snoring
routine
um so the dilbert comic is built on this
factor the recognizable part so i
usually start with something that you
would have
experienced yourself usually at work
cruel is anything bad happening to
anybody especially if it's done
intentionally by somebody else
so watch me go through the formula i'm
going to take now some suggestions
from um
so andrew says i love your naivety
i have no idea what you're talking about
but i've got a feeling that you're not
liked at parties
all right so here are some suggestions
coming in on locals.com
my subscription platform
do something on the guy getting ready to
retire
so people who are ready to retire are
funny because if they act selfishly
there's a lot to work with there so i'll
just give you some
some suggestions and then when one pops
out
um i'll i'll tell you which one we're
going to turn into a comic
now the thing that you're looking for
now is if the
fodder itself just the setup makes you
laugh
this is a really really key point if
you're trying to write a comic about
some real situation well it doesn't even
have to be real but if there's a
situation
that you're considering for a comic
it's not going to be you won't be able
to turn it into a joke
unless it makes you laugh before the
joke is there
very important if the situation doesn't
make you laugh
the joke or the punchline won't so you
gotta start with it being funny
and watch how that plays out as i read
through the some of these ideas
here's another suggestion the work
annual party to be held online
bring your own attendance is mandatory
now now that does make me laugh
that people would take this in-person
tradition of getting together to you
know have some
partying with the staff and turn it into
an online
thing that people would absolutely hate
so if there's anybody who likes getting
together and drinking with their
co-workers
which is a thing people do like that
often
even those people are not going to like
the absurdity of
of having a drink with your computer
screen and wishing you were doing
anything else
about that all right so as soon as you
hear that idea
i haven't added any joke to it right but
didn't you kind of get a little a little
reflex that was oh that's absurd
so absurdity is what we're looking for
not hypocrisy hypocrisy people
who are new to trying to write humor
will write jokes that are aha
and the hypocrisy i said i wasn't going
to do this
but then i did that that's the
that's the level of humor you'll see on
a bad sitcom
or somebody who's new to it so look for
absurdity
that you can draw out that's already
funny just by its absurdity
don't look for somebody who says one
thing and does the other
that's just too easy all right
um somebody said i've spent more time on
robin hood that's
that's the app for trading i spent more
time on robinhood during the meetings
and i care to admit
my camera on this a second idea
suggestion is that my camera is broken
so no video calls
have any of you yet experienced the
person
who is probably lying to you saying that
their camera doesn't work so they can't
do a video call
have you had that yet because that's a
thing right
it's a whole new thing to lie about
all right um
let's take this one and uh turn it into
our example all right
so the suggestion is is somebody lying
about their video camera
being available and let's say that's the
the starting point
that i wanna i wanna build a comic on
so that's the fodder the first step i do
is figure out which characters
are in the story so which of the dilbert
characters
would be kind of weasely and either be
the person who is claiming that their
camera is broken
so that would be wally for example but
wally wouldn't really care if you saw
him or not
so it's not a perfect fit uh who else in
the dilbert universe would
lie well first of all lie so the boss
would but
he wouldn't he wouldn't be the kind of
person who would
lie about his camera being broken so who
would do that
well in the dilbert universe there's no
perfect person who fits that
dog bert would lie but all the people
who are liars in the dilbert universe
also wouldn't care if the video was on
so
it's not a perfect fit
so here's how i would solve this so so i
would solve it
by having one of my main characters
talking to somebody who's not a regular
character
so it's just somebody lying so i'm going
to say that the person who's doing the
lying
is not a regular character but the
person who's responding to it is
now who is the person in the dilbert
universe the cast of characters
who you would want to put in an awkward
social situation
who would be the the fish out of water
uh character who when there's sort of a
new social situation
if you're good at those things you can
navigate it but if you're not good at
social navigation
anything new is a little puts you off
your game
yeah dilbert the title character so
imagine dilbert being presented with
uh somebody saying by text oh i can't do
a video call
because um my camera is broken
and dilbert's an engineer what would he
say
right so you you're already laughing
because all i did was put the
the fish out of the water so as
long as you have a situation that is a
not a good
fit usually something funny is happening
so
here the the lack of fit is that dilbert
doesn't know how to
navigate social lies
somebody with a better social instinct
when they hear my camera is broken
they don't believe it they just figure
the person who doesn't want to be on
camera
for whatever reason but dilbert would
not assume it's a social lie
because he doesn't have that that
instinct so he would either try to offer
to fix it
or he would um yeah
he would claim it was a lie for example
if you said to me my camera is broken
here's the first thing
i would think how
often does a camera get broken
how many of you have an ipad or a device
or let's say a laptop or something in
which the camera has ever
worked but now it doesn't
does that come up a lot
i don't know if i've ever seen it now
certainly if you drop your camera i
suppose you could break it if it's a
separate camera or something
but you know dilbert would automatically
assume it was a lie
because this statistical likelihood
would be so low that the camera was
broken
and that he might also be an engineer
about it and
try to suggest how to fix it which would
be exactly the wrong response
because it was just a social lie and
then the person would have to like
extend the lie
now the next decision i'd have to make
is whether this is a topic for a
sunday comic which has um in my case
eight panels
so i can tell more of a story with a
story arc it could have you know
beginning middle and end
whereas if it's just a three panel daily
strip
i've i've gotta hit the setup and the
joke right away
because i've just got three panels so
which is which do you think that would
fit better into
as i was talking through it i could see
that the
interplay between dilbert and somebody
who was lying to him
but he wasn't picking up that it was a
social lie
would be funny so i probably default to
making a sunday comic
because it's the him questioning the
person
and then the person having to get
further into the lie
and dilbert not realizing it while the
audience does
so that would be the example now let's
see how that would fit
with the six dimensions of humor
so what i'd be going for is recognizable
which is you if you haven't had somebody
yet
tell you that their camera doesn't work
you probably will
and you know it but it also is uh
recognizable enough
from related social situations where
somebody says
i'm late because traffic didn't work or
i would have returned your call but my
my phone battery died right
so you recognize it even if it hasn't
happened to you it's like just so
universal you know somebody's gonna lie
about that
so you got one right away now what would
be the
um the other thing to put into it i've
got no
cue characters so i don't have anything
to work with there's no animal here and
there's no kid
there's um i haven't thought yet of a
clever solution and i'm not sure it
needs one but
it might include dilbert giving some
ideas about using another device or
something but that's not that clever
so probably nothing to work with there
there's nothing automatically naughty
about it
so if you can avoid the naughty one do
it
you'll have far more far more
audience sorry about the dog snoring
there far more
audience if you leave out any kind of
naughty stuff
so i like to do naughty stuff because i
like it and there's an audience for it
and it does make me laugh
but it's not good if you want to be a
commercial artist
in any kind of a mainstream setting like
a newspaper
if you want to be the uh the edgy
naughty person
from the first moment in other words
that's your brand
well then go for it but that's that's
your brand and that makes sense
uh bizarre
bizarre is things that don't fit
together
you know it would be like a talking
animal uh
and this is close to bizarre if you have
the situation of dilbert
talking to somebody on vinnie or well
texting them i guess they would be
and uh he would not understand that it's
an obvious
social lie that somebody says their
camera is broken that's why they can't
do a video call
so you'd have that but probably the
the one that is best to work with is
cruel
so what what i would want is for
something bad to happen to somebody
and for uh yeah
and uh for many of us
the reason that this triggers a laugh is
that we recognize in ourselves
that little bit of evil that we try to
hide from the public
one of the reasons that the far side was
such a successful cartoon
is that bad things would be happening to
people and you would laugh
and you would think to yourself okay i'm
laughing at something really bad
happening to somebody
am i a bad person maybe i am
and you would have this whole
conversation with yourself
about whether you're a bad person for
laughing at something bad happening to
somebody in the comic
so uh so the far side used this kind of
comic level you know low-level cruelty
to great effect so i would probably try
to
um since i only have one strong
dimension
which is you might recognize the
situation i've got to i've got to force
one of these others into it
through the writing and the ones that
work the best would be
it's a little bit bizarre because
dilbert is not
getting the the social part so he's a
fish out of water
but i'm going to try to see if i can
steer it towards something cruel
so in other words either something bad
happens to dilbert
or something bad happens to the person
who's telling the lie
now which would be funnier would it be
funnier
if the liar has something bad happen to
them or
dilbert has something bad happen to him
what do you think
which would be funnier
i feel like it might work either way so
i'd probably default
to whichever way the just the joke works
better
all right so um i would probably
want the yeah i'm saying in the comments
people want to see the liar
get their comeuppance yeah i think my my
instinct is going the same way
so because the liar is a liar
and dilbert is the star of the show and
he's a sympathetic character
so dilbert is created to be somebody
that you don't dislike
you know you you appreciate his naivete
and you you you appreciate that he's
sort of a
trusting person even though it doesn't
work for him
so you would want the liar to be the one
that got penalized that would feel a
little better right
all right so now we've got the the rest
of the formula
so we got the the situation a person
lies about their camera not working
you've got the decision about uh
who the characters are so since none of
my characters have quite that
personality
you know it's just going to be some
stranger on the video
or potential video and then dilbert is
the character who would most
um be at odds with that situation
so he's a fish out of water but he's
also the star of the comic
and he gets the most attention when he's
in there so he's the obvious choice
as the other person and now uh
we've got the natural tension of the
fish out of water
and the person telling a lie but the
fish out of water doesn't know it's a
lie so he's trying to solve it
and then what does the fish out of water
do
uh thank you and
so we wanted some cruelty here
so what would look like cruelty
now one of probably one way i would go
is that the per
so as as frustrated as dilbert might be
because he sees this problem that's
either a lie or seems easy to solve
because he's an engineer the other
person might be just as mad at dilbert
for pressing this thing when it should
be obvious it's just a social lie
so i think we'll have dilbert you know
drilling on him
until he snaps and
uh in in the dilbert comic it's always
funny to me when somebody snaps
because that also is uh bizarre
so when when any of the dilbert
characters like
get too exasperated their hair stands up
and their their jaws separate and they
shout and they sweat profusely and they
shake and stuff
so so that alone gives you like a little
visual thing
but you want somebody to be so
exasperated
that is cruel and
so the way this would go you know that's
so now we've developed kind of
the full story arc that there's the liar
who says my camera doesn't work there's
dilbert who keeps pressing it about you
know how to fix it or how likely
that is to actually be true and
then you have the guy like getting
really exasperated
because he uh dilbert doesn't get it
that it's supposed to be a lie
he flips out and that's the cruel part
but the exact choice of words is what
will make this work
or not work now let me tell you about
choice of words
the good key advice for choice of words
is if you're trying to be funny
you want short crisp
direct sentences very similar to the way
that you would do business writing
a direct crisp sentence
because you don't want people to get
lost in the words
you've got an idea you're sending them
and you're controlling the timing
of your joke by how long the sentence is
if your sentence is too long they've
forgotten
what the setup was if it's too short
it'll just look stubby
just just feel too short there's always
some ideal length
for for any sentence in a joke setup
right and you have to pay attention to
that
um so
those are the basics uh and you want to
uh
pick words that are less commonly used i
like to call them scrabble words
words that might have a k sound or a q
sound because they're funnier
i i do this test with audiences
if you don't believe that some words are
funnier than others
let me give you a choice of two words
and tell me here in the comments which
one is funnier
and they're just two ordinary words that
mean roughly the same thing
but one of them is funnier the two words
are
either pull or yank
they roughly mean the same thing right
yank you get a little sense of more
action i guess but a hundred percent of
people who hear that
look at the comments a hundred percent
of humans will say yank
there's almost nothing that you will get
that much
100 agreement on from human beings
human beings just don't agree this much
but i could ask the same question to
a thousand audiences of a thousand
apiece
and every person in every audience who
is native english speaker
was a yank and maybe every every
non-native
speaker would say it because it's the
sound of the word itself
so when you're writing you might write
your first
first draft with with pull
and then you look at your sentence and
you say that's just kind of dead
it just sort of lays there so you think
all right which words can i substitute
with just
little punchier words and you say oh
that word pull
i'm going to change that to yank and you
don't want to change
all of the the words in the sentence to
the clever version
just just say one word from pole to yank
will turn the sentence from just laying
there
into a perfectly good setup for a laugh
and you can do that with the other
sentences as well could just you just go
back
and re-edit your writing and say all
right that was the boring way to say
that word
what's the interesting way the the way
that immediately gets your attention
the way that makes you think of that
that person
or that character or that stereotype or
that annoying person
and then here's the uh here's the
maybe the final layer if you will
for writing now this applies a little
bit more to long form
you know if you're writing a an article
or a book
but writing has a rhythm that is like
percussion and if you get the percussion
of the sentence right
it's much more pleasing and the reader
will enjoy it without
knowing why they will just know that
they enjoyed the experience
they'll just think you did everything
right they won't know that one of the
things you did right
was the percussion of the sentence
meaning that the
letters that have the the sharp sounds
or the
i guess whatever sounds like the k sound
the t sound
um a d if you have them placed just
right
your writing actually has a almost a
beat
and if you don't it could flow
[Music]
or it could be too stochatic
static is that a word staccatic where it
would be too much
so by the time you get to that level in
your writing
where you're worried about the beat
you've probably done everything else
right
we hope staccato thank you that's the
word
uh staccato
uh and not the word that sounds a little
bit like it
somebody says the word is gen saki all
right
so here so if you join me from the
beginning you saw the entire process
the thought process that nobody ever
shows you
i would i would do the boring part which
is to try to create the actual sentences
um but that really is a whole bunch of
writing and rewriting
et cetera i think it's good enough that
you saw the whole process
and that might be the first time
um maybe ever
that a professional writer wrote
something in front of you
because it's really hard to write when
people are watching
one of the advantages i have is that you
know comic strips are
not much writing now somebody's saying
it's stochatic
static all right well whatever that word
is
you know what i'm talking about um
in fact to give you a an idea of
that writing technique when i do the
simultaneous sip
and my morning show um
and what i say the unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day that's
those are sentences that are designed
for uh
the beat the unparalleled pleasure
and dope being hit of the day you hear
the beat
unparalleled pleasure dopamine hit of
the day
that is intentional
all right i'm going to end here and i
will
talk to you tomorrow
