of you mothers
and to the people who impregnated them
you'll we'll get to you later
but uh mothers
today is your day
and if you'd like to take
and well really it's going to be an
amazing day for you anyway
but if you want to take it up another
level
do you think it was even possible
it is all you need is a copper mug or a
gossip tanker tells a steiner canteen
joker flask a vessel of any kind and
when i say a vessel of any kind
i don't mean a womb
every other kind
but fill it with your favorite liquid i
like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
it's the dopamine the other day it's the
thing that makes everything better
especially mother's day
it's called the simultaneous sip and
it's going to connect
mothers with their children all over the
world
go
ah
yeah
all right
so
now you mothers
let's uh let's talk about what else is
going on
did you ever feel as though mother's day
is the main attraction
and father's day
father's day feels like a consolation
prize
am i the only one
sort of like there's a gold medal
and then you just skip silver
go straight to straight to bronze
or copper
but to be fair
to be fair
just because you had seven minutes of
bliss and impregnated somebody
i'm not sure you get a holiday for that
i'm i'm not sure that that deserves too
much but on top of that there are also
incredible
fathers and i guess they get a day too
well president biden had a uh
interesting tweet he said the
unemployment rate now stands at 3.6
percent which is amazing he says the
fastest decline in unemployment to start
a president's term ever recorded
now that's an interesting way to look at
it
some would say
some would say well you know that has
more to do with the fact that you were
the president when the pandemic started
winding down and things reopened
that's not exactly because of your keen
economic policy
but we have to look at this in context
the way president biden may measure
stuff
this is an accurate way to measure it uh
he gets credit for things which
some would say were going to happen
anyway or just sort of existed before
he was president you know the situation
if you would
but at least he's consistent
because he he analyzes everything with
the same kind of approach for example
when joe biden measures his penis
he starts from the ass
and that he includes the entire pelvic
area
up to the uh
the freedom and then all the way the tip
and
by his measurement it's a foot long
and
you know on one hand you'd say well
that's not the way i would have done it
i wouldn't i wouldn't count the ass part
up through the pelvis
i would have said that was already there
i always say well that's that's not
that's not really on point really
that's
sort of slightly off topic
but it's the joe biden measurement
system and
as long as he's consistent i'm fine with
it
last night there was a uh a brutal fight
and somebody got hurt badly
no it's not about crime it's
entertainment sports
so there was a big ufc competition in
which
one individual beat another one until
the the one they called the loser had
something called brain damage
i sue i mean
i'm i'm not a doctor but i think if your
head gets pounded enough by somebody
who's a professional head pounder
probably probably causes a little uh
a little long coven if you know what i
mean
i think he got a little long cover that
night
but you know if you're not
someone who watches this sport ufc
fighting
you don't really know how dangerous it
was
i was looking at some of the the photos
and i honestly i was kind of shocked
like i knew it was a sort of a brutal
sport
but i didn't know how dangerous it was i
mean here's what i saw when i just
looked at the photos after
number one neither of them had a face
mask
neither one
it seemed reckless to me
uh number two
um i watched uh or at least i looked at
all of the photos and read stories about
it and still
still i'm completely unaware of either
their
sexual orientations or their pronouns
and i don't think that's a safe
situation for either of them
so between the lack of face masks the
confusion or
lack of clarity over pronouns
as well as
complete silence on their sexual
orientation which i feel is important
i don't know how i can enjoy a sport
without knowing exactly how everybody
identifies
um so it's a dangerous situation
and if that wasn't the end of the danger
the the person that was named the winner
of the event
the winner of the event
got a big spike in testosterone
now i don't know if you know that's a
thing
but when the winners of competitions
are measured you can they actually have
higher testosterone so being a winner
jacks up your testosterone and that
could be dangerous
there's a report that the winner went
home to his i don't know if it's a wife
or a girlfriend
or some kind of birthing person
but he is reportedly he had uh quite an
insurrection
so he had a
he had a raging insurrection and we know
those are dangerous to the country to
the republic
speaking of mules um the movie
dinesh d'souza's movie 2000 mules
is getting the ap and politifact to
treatment
do you know what the politifact and ap
fact-checking treatment is
well
i suppose that's a subjective question
some would say
this is how you know what's true
you look at the fact checkers
the ap and politifact and you'd say well
if they say it's true it's true if they
say it's not true it's probably not true
that's what they're for right
so
you should not be surprised
to learn that
the ap and politifact have decided that
the allegations that there might have
been some impropriety in the 2020
election
um they are they're saying that the
methodology was flawed
and that the cell phone data which i
guess i haven't seen it yet but
apparently that's
uh important part of the movie
that the cell the location data is not
accurate enough to know who did what
so the analysis is flawed
now i would probably want a little more
detail than
that
because one imagines there might be a
counterpoint to their point
as in the experts who came up with us in
the first place might say
no it was it was actually good enough
for this
because there's no other way to explain
what happened maybe i mean i don't know
but one assumes that
there's almost always a counter argument
right
but the politifact people have uh
have uh
said that that's uh
they've debunked according to them
which makes me want to watch it even
more apparently it's on the locals
platform if you're a subscriber dinesh
d'souza
it's on rumble and now is that right
in the comments somebody will tell you
where to see it
probably a variety of places by now
um
so here's uh
here's the statement on i think it was
on the twitter page that summarized the
fact checkers
you said the election was secure and
there's no evidence of widespread fraud
that's an interesting sentence isn't it
the election was secure
and there is no evidence of widespread
fraud
wait a minute
so those are two thoughts are they
related
number one the action the election was
secure let's take that as an independent
statement
and the second part of the sentence
there is no evidence of widespread fraud
are they trying to sell us the lack of
evidence
as proof
that nothing happened
is this sentence really trying to tell
us they proved a negative
that by not finding something they
proved it doesn't exist
is that the fact check that you would
rely on
this is a fact check which has embedded
in it
proof that they're not really serious
about anything
because you can't prove something didn't
happen
by not finding it
right
there's
i can prove there's not a a penny in my
drawer
watch me prove it
you don't think i can do it
i'm going to prove that that drawer
behind me has no penny in it not
actually i'll go further than that i'll
prove that it has no coins or dollar
bills or any kind of currency whatsoever
watch me prove it right now
done
done
i just proved that there's no coins or
any kind of money in that drawer back
there did you see me do it
well i showed you clearly that i did not
provide any evidence that there were
coins in the drawer
did you see any evidence of coins
no
therefore
logically
logically
logically if i could
make this connection
logically
because i didn't look in the drawer
i believe that's proof
of the non-existence
of the coins
and that's how it's done
and scene
um
here's an interesting timing for a story
i think i mentioned this before but it's
the timing that makes it interesting
you you all know about the uh
keith renery situation he was the head
of nexium
a self-improvement organization this
something called a cult
especially the sub-category of people
who had formed a separate organization
in which there were sexual things
of all of all things part of what he
went to jail for he's in jail right now
is a alleged encounter with a underaged
girl
but there are counter-allegations
a former fbi forensic examiner says hey
these photos or at least some of the
evidence
was clearly faked
so there's a possibility that law
enforcement
faked some
evidence and put somebody in jail
now here's the interesting thing
suppose yeah he wasn't he was convicted
he's in jail right now
suppose this had been 20 years ago
and you heard that law enforcement had
this evidence and it looked like good
evidence you'd probably say to yourself
something like
wow that guy is guilty
but what do you say in 2022
because the timing of this the
questioning of whether law enforcement
of some type i don't know who was
allegedly planted evidence
it's a lot easier to believe today isn't
it
think of the timing of this it's sort of
the perfect timing for this
claim
it just fits perfectly into what you're
all waking up to which is wait a minute
it seems as though our intelligence
agencies have quite
quite obviously lied to us the fbi is
sketchy
you know you're not you're not trusting
anything anymore right any form of
authority
so there was a time when i would have
said uh what are the odds that this is
fake evidence and you know he was
convicted on fake evidence
but now i'd say
i don't know 50 50. right good because
we don't really have any way of knowing
there's nothing that we know that would
confirm it or or disconfirm it
so
i feel like this is a jump ball at this
point
because the odds of the law enforcement
being the ones who are guilty
seems at least equal to the odds that
keith renery is guilty
wouldn't you say
do you find any is there any
objective or logical reason to believe
that the people accusing him of the
crime
are more
let's say honest than the person they
accused of the crime
there's no reason to believe it
unfortunately unfortunately these are
two entities
of which you couldn't really believe
either one of them
that's a sort of a tie
anyway
keep an eye on that
here's some twitter features i'd like to
see
i'd like to see an off topic button
so right now you can retweet things and
you can like things
but wouldn't it be nice if you have the
option of uh marking a comment
not the original tweet but just the
comment to the tweet
as
off topic
now the off topic stuff
is often useful and good to see
so i but i would love to be able to sort
the off topic stuff
to the bottom
because often let me give you an example
the other day i asked the question
and
maybe 95 of the responses were not on
point to the question
but it would have been really useful to
me if they had been
now what i'd love to do is say okay
you know i don't mind that there are
responses that are off topic
because those are often very good you
know they they inform you of something
you didn't know about
gives you some context or whatever but
it might be a little off topic so i
still want to see the off topic stuff i
just want an option
to sort the on topic stuff at the top so
if you have an ability to mark things as
off-topic
you wouldn't necessarily be
criticizing them
it's not a criticism it's just a
clarification
this is an off-topic comment
doesn't mean it's a bad
so i'd like to see that
i also like to see a some kind of a
context button
now i call them buttons but i'm
completely aware
that the simpler the interface the more
successful it's going to be
so i know that you can't just add
buttons every time you have an idea
it'll clutter things up so i'm aware of
that so this is more of a brainstorming
exercise of you know what sort of things
you might want
the other is a context button
because we've got this problem of fake
news
and trolls etc but wouldn't you love it
if somebody added some context that was
good
and then other users could say hey
that's good context
doesn't mean it's true doesn't mean it
you know
that it's the final word or anything
it's just good context
so people could click it and flag it and
then you can say okay here's the tweet
and then maybe sort to the top of the
comments
any context that would give you some
better understanding
because the context ends up being the
the fact check right
probably eighty percent of the time just
adding context
completely changes the story like the
uh the joe biden measurement of
you know how quickly the jobs came back
after the pandemic
well the context is it was coming back
from a pandemic
so every story has that kind of thing
add the context
all right uh speaking of twitter
apparently elon musk has announced he
plans to
get rid of a thousand twitter staff
uh quinn tuple the revenue and get 69
million users paying three dollars a
month i guess those would be business
users i i think he said
casual users will remain free
but uh
so let's take me as an example
i assume
i don't know am i a business user
i i would call myself a business user
right
because what i do is
it's monetized so this i guess i'd be a
business user um
if you if you ask me to pay three
dollars a month
of which you know half of it gets
written off on my taxes
so it's a dollar fifty a month out of my
pocket
to do what i do to support my entire
business model
yeah of course of course
you first of all i literally wouldn't
notice i was paying it
and then he's got
he'd have
69 million people
paying three dollars a month
so 69 million times three times 12 is
give me the price give me the result of
that
69 million people times three dollars a
month times 12 months is how much a year
208 million
so he would add 200 million a year to
the revenue
with these with these changes
get rid of a thousand twitter staff
which is
i do mean the math what would it what
would one twitter staff person cost
these days
after benefits
two hundred thousand a year
so what's a thousand times uh two
hundred 000.
all right so already he's he's
identifying
you know
some fairly substantial places he can
cut costs and also make money
so the context here is i think somebody
said but i don't have a confirmation of
this they have 7 500 employees
so a thousand out of 7 500 would be a
substantial chunk
but i have to think the marketing
department is
is a big part of that
right
all right
so we'll keep an eye on that
this amber turd trial
is just getting more and more weird but
there's also a simulation alert here so
you you just have to listen to some of
the audios
of not only their private conversations
but the testimony in court
and listen to amber heard try to act
as though she was the victim
as though she were the victim
and
it is shocking and i don't know how much
of this is confirmation bias on my part
but she sounds to me exactly like a
really bad actor
who is lying
it's not even good acting
which is the weird part you'd expect at
least some professional acting there
but
she seems more and more like a monster
if we are to believe what's coming out
of the trial
allegedly
and i'm not saying that uh you know
johnny depp necessarily has you know no
no character flaws or never did anything
wrong i don't know but she's definitely
a monster and i'll say again that what
johnny depp is doing for the rest of the
world
is a serious
benefit
you know and
this is you know she's even debunked the
them not debunked but
think of what she's done to the me too
movement
by such a high-profile fake thing
this just sets it back
you know
whatever was good from the metoo
movement you know the original idea and
whatever that led to
uh this certainly takes a big chunk out
of that
so amber turd has got to be one of the
worst human beings that we've seen in a
long time
but here's the part that caught my
attention
if this is true
i don't know i'm not sure i saw a good
source for this i did not see a good
source of this
but apparently
uh they had a couple of dogs together
and amber got custody of both dogs
and one of the dogs was actually johnny
depp's dog
so she got custody of his dog
well i mean i guess it
it
it raises the question what makes it his
dog versus their dog
so there might be some ambiguity there
but here's the part that caught my
attention
johnny depp's dog
is named
do you know the answer to this
boo
b-o-o as in a ghost goes boo
what
i i my whole week has been filled with
you know
as most of you probably heard my cat
named boo
um passed away this week
and i've never heard of any other animal
named boo
i've told you that one of the evidences
of you know obviously not a proof of any
kind but one of the things that feels
like evidence we live in a simulation
is that we keep seeing all this code
reuse
like what are the odds that there would
be two
major stories about a pet
pet actually in two different ways
losing a pet named boo
really
what were the odds on that
it feels
feels low
uh anyway
let me tell you another story of
why i think the uh
the the simulation is is
is revealing itself
so the other day i bought some
solar powered lights that do some
accents for your yard
so they collect the light during the day
and they're just little discs
and you can stick them in the ground or
just set them on something and so i was
real curious to see how they worked
so i put them on a
low sitting wall
you know on part of my property
and
i i waited until the sun went down
and i was kind of excited because i
thought oh if this works i might you
know the backyard's gonna look kind of
cool
so i wait until it's dark and i go out
and all of the lights have been
collected up and put in a pile
now it turns out that the one time
in my entire life and i actually
calculated how many days i've lived in
this home it's something like
4 400 days
there was one day out of 4 400 days
that i wanted to use the top of that
little wall
which was exactly the one and only one
day though it turned out to be two
in which
my gardener needed to do something that
required him access to the top of that
little wall
never before
as far as i know never before have they
done any work that affected the top of
the wall
the top of the wall
and the wall wasn't even part of
anything that was happening
it's just they needed access to the
entire top of that little wall
one chance out of
two to four thousand depending on
whether you uh count the second day that
they needed access
now
i said to myself what
why are these coincidences
were streaming at me as such you know
what seems to be higher frequency
well the most obvious reason would be
confirmation bias
selective memory right all the normal
things but it certainly is a mind-blower
when you see stuff like this like two
animals named boo that people lost and
they're both like big stories in my life
in the same week
weird
um
so the protesters are at uh the
supreme court justices houses the the
right leading ones who are presumed to
be voting to end reverse weight or
overturn it
and i guess antifa has been spun up
again
so now antifa went from
protesting to save black lives to
protesting to end as many as possible
and apparently as long as they're paid
they'll go either way
now if you think that was an opinion on
my personal opinion on what abortion is
it's not
i try to keep my personal opinion of
abortion
completely to myself
if you think you're seeing it in my
jokes or my contacts or my references
you're not going to find it
right because i'm very serious about
keeping myself out of that conversation
i think other people should should have
a greater voice and i'm not one of them
so
uh if women work it out i'm okay with
what women decide on abortion
and if you want to be part of that
that's fine with me too
but keep me out of it
um
please
so i'm watching this and you know jack
posabic was mentioning this on twitter
that apparently it's illegal in every
state
to protest at a judge's house
because it would influence the you know
potentially influence the case
but yet it's happening
and every single person there is subject
to arrest i would think but there won't
be any rest i don't think
i think they will simply be allowed
to violate the law in a substantial way
publicly transparently
and the people in charge are going to
say well
we sort of like them violating the law
because we're on the same side as the
law breakers in this case
and
it's just going to make you crazy
now again i'm not giving you an opinion
giving you my opinion on abortion that's
not even the topic here for me the topic
is how in the world do you let people
break the law
in in the most
and this is not even i'm not even
talking about like technically breaking
the law
this is right exactly in the heart of
what the law
was trying to stop from happening
it's not like a weird you know corner of
the law or you know something you could
interpret as being against the law it's
exactly against the law it's exactly
specifically
exactly what the law says don't do
don't stand in front of the judge's
house
and protest just don't do that it's
totally illegal
how much is your head going to explode
when none of that is prosecuted and the
january 6 people
ones who are not accused of violent
stuff
are in jail
still right it's just going to feel
weird
and not in a good way
but that's what's happening
one wonders if that this would be
effective
i can't imagine it being effective can
you
do you imagine that any of those people
who have the stones to be
you know judges
i mean don't you have to be
pretty damn brave to even
go through the uh
you know the the lower level judging
to become a supreme court judge
i mean i i feel as if you're talking
about some of the bravest citizens
so i don't see them changing their vote
do you
what do you think
now i do i do imagine that they could be
influenced by the larger public opinion
but i don't think that i don't think
they're going to be influenced by the
people in their lawn
i don't think they will
now
you what's the best news about that
i i just basically described the
strongest part of our republic with
complete confidence
the part that support that supports all
the rest
the supreme court the supreme court is
still the one thing
that even when you know the goes
down and this is pretty serious stuff
that there are you know dangerous
looking people surrounding their
yeah there's always danger when there's
a crowd let's just say that
and i
my my confidence that the
the justices will not be influenced by
it
is
somewhat absolute
somewhat absolute i don't think there'll
be influence at all
now
um
if they are if we don't get if the vote
doesn't come out the way we think
or the way the first draft indicated
then you're going to wonder if they got
influenced
and that would be a really good question
but i'm not expecting it to happen
and i do think that as long as the
supreme court has the credibility
then it still has
the republic's gonna hold together
and uh even with all the assaults on of
their credibility in every way
i think they're still holding i feel
like the supreme court is still
with all of the things that
you could say about them and even even
after an unpopular vote whichever way it
goes
i feel as if they're gonna still hold on
and that they'll not just hold on
they'll be solid
i think the supreme court will stay
solid that's the feeling
i don't think that these assaults on its
integrity
are anything but a glancing blow
so that's the good news
all right
um
i got a tweet today from marwan uh el
nakabib
and he's reading a book that came out
that i wrote that came out in 1997. he
said i'm reading your dilbert future
book published in 1997.
and then he complimented me on it and
they said i'm not i'm not really sure if
you're really good at predicting the
future
a time traveler from the future
or freakishly good at programming the
simulation
so just be aware that there's a book i
wrote in 1997 that was
full of predictions
and that there's somebody reading it now
who's
kind of blown away at how accurate they
are
i don't know which ones he was
responding to exactly now they're not
all accurate
some of them
were more humorous and
and some of them just didn't happen
but
um
you might uh you might want to take a
look at that if you're interested in
predictions
now
what do you think
for those of you who agree with the
statement that i'm good at predicting
some of you would disagree with that but
for those of you who do think so
do you think it's because i'm good at
predicting
am i a time traveler from the future
or am i programming the simulation
go
or or is it just an illusion and i'm not
good at predicting which it would be
which is the one i'd vote for
all of the above good at predicting
where's the evidence
good question
uh you some say i'm influencing it
good at predicting
yeah i'm not sure it's one thing
it's a few things
one is that if you predict enough things
if you predict that some things will be
debunked
you're almost always right you just have
to wait long enough
so here's one of the tricks i use it's
totally a trick
right this is just a trick
when i wrote the book i said to myself
you know what
i'll bet i could throw a dart at any
topic
and say that it will be debunked in my
lifetime
and if i just
live long enough it will be
and you'd be amazed how many things that
you think
are true now did you not think were true
30 years ago 20 years ago depending on
how old you are a lot right
so you can you can randomly pick things
and say oh that will be debunked so that
was one of the tricks i used
i randomly picked a few things and said
this will be debunked
now there's some things that were more
like 50 50 bets
and if you remember the ones i got right
and you probably would especially if
they're weird
you might forget the ones i got wrong
and that would give me the impression i
had a better track record
right so it's not it's not one thing
it's probably a variety of things some
said that i influence things so they're
not really predictions it's something i
caused to happen
i i can tell you with
a fair amount of confidence
but i can't prove it
but a fair amount of confidence that
there are some things
that fit into that
frame
there are a few things that i probably
had some influence on while predicting
them at the same time
and i'm not sure i mean there's no way
to confirm that that made a difference
the the other thing is uh
studying economics
since my background is you know degree
in economics and mba and i worked in
business for a long time if you have
that filter on things or that's part of
your talent stack
then that gives you an ability to
predict
because the future generally follows the
money
so if you know how business models work
and business works if you know how
especially if you understand the
insurance market
if you understand the insurance market
you can really predict things
because all the political people will be
asking about this or that or what should
be or what should not be
and then the insurance people are saying
well you can talk all day
but but i'm not going to ensure that
and then it's done
so if you understand
that insurance and business and follow
the money
and how business models work and how
competition works and how companies need
to cannibalize themselves and you know a
dozen other things
that you learn
in the in the study of economics it does
allow you to predict
now i'll tell you what you can't predict
well in a way you can you can't predict
individual company success
usually i feel as if apple might be an
exception
you know that's a strange exception
and some of those social media companies
might be exceptions
but generally you can't pick stocks
but you can predict that the average uh
you know the index will go up in any
20-year period you can be fairly
confident that that's going to happen
so
the other skill that helps you predict
is persuasion so if you understand
persuasion you could watch you know two
teams it could be two candidates or
whatever going up against each other and
you could say oh one is using good
technique
that's likely to work and the other one
doesn't have any technique
but people who don't study persuasion
might look might think it's a tie
they might say oh
it's two people just making claims that
the other one disagrees with
but if you can see the persuasion
because you studied it you you know the
techniques
then suddenly you can say oh i predict
that one's going to win because that's
where the persuasion is pointing
so
it's a whole bunch of different things
some of it's guessing some of us knowing
everything changes some of it is a 50 50
stuff that you get lucky on
some of it's probably
causing it
or i'm reprogramming the simulation
while you're watching
it's one of those things
well the war for reality is heating up
and it seems like that's going to be the
big battle for the next
i don't know rest of reality or the rest
of human kind we will be arguing about
what is literally real and it's gone
beyond
just what is fake news and what is not
fake news
um
so here's where we are
we finally understand as a species
and i'm talking about this year
things that we thought were true for
you know hundreds of years
this year we've decided those things
weren't ever true
number one
you can't predict anything too far in
advance
we finally understand that right that
life is not predictable and so if
there's some expert telling you what's
going to happen
we used to say well that's going to
happen better worry about it you should
still worry about it if it's a
prediction of doom
i'd take that pretty seriously and make
sure you don't have the doom
but we do understand in a way we never
understood before that you can't predict
things in a complicated world
that's a higher level of awareness
we understand now that experts are not
reliable
in a way we really didn't understand 20
years ago
right
that's a higher level of awareness
that the experts could be bought off or
just wrong or they could have their own
cognitive dissonance etc
we
we also know money distorts everything
we always knew it but we just see more
examples of it so it's more
clear some of us know that free will is
an illusion some of you are not there
yet
and of course the simulation theory
makes makes you think that everything
could be subjective and not real
uh the growth of psychedelics like
mushrooms for example it's allowing
people to see reality as subjective
in a way that we never did before like
at a higher rate than before
and i think we went from thinking that
the fake news is only on the other team
to understanding that fake news is the
only kind
that's a big difference
because we we had the comfort of
thinking the
your opponents whoever they were
politically were lying but your team
pretty much not
and now you have a better understanding
of that don't you now you've got a
little bit better understanding that the
lie can come from anywhere
including your side
and that's a whole higher level of
awareness and most of us are getting
there
and
it's probably good but it's a battle for
reality that's that's like nothing we've
ever seen
and i made a provocative claim that i'm
going to back up now
that the republic
you know america's system the republic
is held together by approximately 20
people
and that's it
and that if those 20 people were not
well intentioned
and very much wanted to hold the
republic together
that there would be trouble
and it's not 20 people who are
necessarily the ones you've ever heard
of or would know about
it's 20 people who just are really
influential
so let me ask you this if i if i were to
say name people you think are on the
list
you'd probably name some billionaires
right
you'd probably name elon musk you'd be
the obvious one
but here's a question that you might not
ask yourself
who influences elon musk
but you don't know that
do you
it's not one person
of course
i i imagine he gets his influence from a
variety of people how many of the
variety people who influence elon musk
do you think are on my list of 20 people
who are holding the whole republic
together
you know too much
about about quite a few of the top 20
have advised or at least are okay with
what elon musk is doing with twitter
let's say
so
sometimes you say to yourself oh i know
who the influential person is but you
don't
you don't
because there are probably people
influencing the influencers and
it's this whole web of people being
influenced
right now if there were a major like
let's say a war of the worlds kind of
hoax let's say there were a major hoax
that came onto the scene
it was just the kind that could really
just destroy the republic
and
you know if people believed it it would
just rip everything apart
would it work
well before the internet it might have
prior to the internet you could probably
sell anything to the public because the
the people who could um deprogram you
didn't have any access
so as long as you could control the
major media you controlled everything
so
there was no way to you know debunk
something but i would argue that today
if there was a story that hit the news
that was really dangerous and really
fake
that there would be about 20 people
who would squash that story
and you wouldn't know their names
now they're not 20 people who
necessarily work for the networks or
work for the social media companies i
mean 20 people who influence enough
people
yeah
so one of one of you is a little bit
ahead of you
if you don't understand mike cernovich's
influence
on the world
then this point will be completely lost
on you
he would be an obvious one
now who influences mike sotobich i don't
know
maybe nobody
you know maybe he's you know a singular
kind of personality
um
but he definitely influences the real
world in ways that i don't think the
public understands
and there are other people in that
category as well and here's what those
people the the hypothetical 20 do
here's how they influence everything
with better arguments
more persuasive
because if you were let's say let's say
you uh had some idea or plan or proposal
and you rolled it out
and
people
uh of let's say mike cernovich's
influence
just said this is terrible you got to
stop it you know kill this thing
how many of them would it take
to kill a national idea
fewer than 20
fewer than 20
because if the 20 people who influence
lots of other people who then influence
lots of other people who influence lots
of other people
if those people don't like it whatever
it is
whatever it is and they say it's
illogical or it won't work it just won't
happen i believe there are about 20
people who could stop any bad idea
not right away
but they can get it to stop
the one that's interesting is
nuclear energy
in my opinion what had happened is that
the people who didn't understand and
you know a variety of forces were were
killing the nuclear energy
business
but that there were probably 20 people
who decided that
we needed nuclear energy
and you might never know their names
but they sort of made it happen now you
know the famous ones you know michael
shellenberger you know mark schneider
you know people who are visible but who
influenced them
right and and how many people who were
let's say uh writing cover for them
how many people were laying down
suppressive fire to make it easier for
them to do what they were doing which is
get their message out
quite a few
quite a few i was one
right so i'm a prominent person who is
laying down just continuous suppressive
fire
you know just making sure that the
arguments were tight
that the
the non-essential parts of the argument
were
were uh dismissed
and then there's this sort of iterative
process
where as as all of us talk about it
the argument improves
right so you can see that there are
people who are just good at
persuasion
especially the ones who have studied it
have an outsized influence because
they're the ones who are equipping other
people with arguments
so once other people are equipped with
the better argument then that argument
lives on its own and can go off and do
its thing but i feel like there are
about 20 argument tuners
and maybe it's a different 20 for every
topic that would be a fair
interpretation
but there are about 20 people who look
at every topic and say you know
the way to look at this topic is x
and
the ones who are really good
at tweaking topics and framing things
you don't know how much influence they
have you just know that a lot of people
are saying the same stuff
that's all you know
is it it might be a rolling band to 20.
i'm not suggesting it's some kind of
permanent illuminati it's more like a
fluid group that's correct you know
people people adding in people leaving
depending on the topic somebody might be
in around
um
all right i'm just looking at your uh
the tipping point applied
yes yeah the tipping point is one of
those things that it's very invisible
and by the way that's another way to
make predictions
if if people see things as
straight line predictions as opposed to
tipping points
then they're really going to be lost
predicting
um
so so i'm seeing some names that people
are suggesting as the influencers but
remember by standard so if you say oh
there's a tv personality or whatever
are they are they the ones who are the
original
thoughts or are they being influenced as
well
so i i think there are some
some topics where you could always
predict how somebody's going to act but
there are some newer topics
in which there are a short number a
small number of people who frame them
let me give you a an example of how the
better framing
could win
so right now you get kicked off of uh
social media if you say there was
something wrong with the election right
2020 election because there's no no
evidence of widespread fraud
and but here's the uh
the the high level or high ground
maneuver
which you can say
and this is here's a persuasion tip uh
trick i talk about a lot in which you
embrace the other person's argument
but you embrace it too hard
you don't you don't change it because
that's unfair that would be the straw
man you embrace it exactly as it is
all right
um
and one of the arguments that you can do
that with is the election integrity
so the the election integrity argument
is that there was no evidence found
and and there were people looking for
evidence so there was no evidence found
and therefore you don't have to worry
about the elections
right here's another frame for that this
is the high ground you've heard this
before
here's what i say
you know it's kind of amazing
that 100 of our institutions that we
thought were reliable
except for
the election systems
a hundred percent of everything else has
been shown to be
untrustworthy
we don't trust our law enforcement we
don't trust intel we don't trust
democrats we don't trust republicans
we don't trust experts we don't draw
science
in a way we used to
we don't trust anything
but isn't it lucky
and aren't we fortunate
that there could be 50 separate
elections fairly substantial operations
well there's substantial operations not
fairly
substantial operations
run bipartisans
which is interesting
elections are always run by partisans
right
it's people who belong to a political
party
so the run is run by partisans the
people who have an incentive to cheat
it's not fully audited
ever
there are parts you can audit but you
can't fully audit it especially the
electronic parts
or at least we don't
so in a context where every other
institution organization
and leader is clearly lying to you
clearly
easy to prove
but all 50
partisan run
major operations
which are not even continuous operations
where you improve over time but rather
they're only every two years or so so
you know
you have to retrain everybody and
new people
and with all of that complication and
all of that difficulty
isn't it great
that all 50 of those partisan operations
with great incentive to cheat
and no full audits
isn't it lucky
that that all worked out fine
now that's the high ground in maneuver
so i'm literally agreeing with their
argument because that is irrigan the
argument is that everything's corrupt
and you can see it except that
got lucky wow
wow
now and what would be the reason that
the one thing they would most
you would imagine it would be the single
thing most susceptible to cheating
because people would want to do it so
badly
and yet
and yet with all the assaults that you
can imagine
hackers
partisans dirty tricksters and yet with
all of that with all that it was all
clean
it will be i mean minor problems of
course but nothing that would change the
result
so
imagine this imagine if if republicans
and trump
now this will never happen by the way
but imagine if it did
imagine if republicans took the
completely different approach and said
you know
you're right
every single thing in the world is
messed up except those elections
good job on the elections
all 50 of them the only organizations
that did their job this year
you should just mock it
mock it by agreeing with it you
literally agree with everything they say
just put it in context it's just the
only thing that was worked how about
that
surprise nobody saw it coming but aren't
we lucky
like george carlin said is that a
is that a george carlin thing
all right
it looks like we've done our job today
i believe that we have successfully
um filled more than 45 minutes now the
45 minute mark is important because
it's just about the amount of time that
you can get ready and put on your makeup
or get ready in the morning
and it's just about the right amount of
time to exercise
now those are two activities that you
don't want to be going back to your
device
and fast forwarding it through the
commercials
and this content if you didn't know it
there are two different ways to watch it
with no commercial breaks
number one
i i think watching it live on youtube is
no commercials right
can somebody confirm that is how it
works the recorded version has
commercials but not if you um belong to
the red
subscription service on youtube
or if you become a subscriber on locals
uh i simulcast it on both platforms and
locals never has commercials because
it's a subscription service
so
if you're looking to improve your
morning process either your exercise or
getting ready and you don't want to
continually stop to go and change your
source or change the channel
this is the content for you
did i sell it
i bet a lot of you use it because
there's no commercial breaks right
it just matches well with what you're
doing
am i right yeah i'm seeing yes is coming
through
all right
um
why did you almost skip commenting on
two thousand i've i've commented on two
thousand mules every day for four days
have you noticed that most of the most
of the criticisms i get
are from people who only know one one
little speck of
my opinions or what i've ever done in my
life
all right
i will watch it yes of course i will
watch it i promise you i'll watch it it
might be later this week but i'll
definitely watch it
you don't interact with the locals
community
what do you mean
i do every day literally
um
oh here's something exciting
this is the weirdest thing
for
let's see since the early 80s i've been
talking to friends about a business idea
i had
that needs to happen
i called it the capeteria
and it's for people who can't have their
own cat for whatever reason maybe
somebody in the household is allergic
but they want to go to a place that's
just a room full of cats
just sit in a room with a bunch of cats
which to me would be like awesome
you know to just relax i'm just going to
sit in the room with a bunch of cats
and
that business actually is in my local
mall
i took pictures of it
and
you know i know there's there's already
like cat cafes and japan and stuff so
it's already been done
but this
this one doesn't even have a cafe
um
why is my interface not working there we
go
and it's uh what's it called it's the
the mini cat town
so see if you can see this
so it's just a mall
all store called mini cap town and i
think it's five dollars for 15 minutes
and you go sit on the floor in there and
then a bunch of cats
who are up for adoption
the cats are up for adoption so i don't
know if this is only going to be a
spring thing when there's lots of
kittens
but
that's awesome
but
i'm going to show you something
that's the most awesome thing you've
ever seen
it's a walking dog
yes it's a walking dog
you ready for this
wait
okay
why why would a video
suddenly not play because i'm on a live
stream
what would cause that what would cause
my phone to not play a video this local
on my phone there's no connection
this is actually
what will cause that
there are only two buttons play and
pause and neither of them work
is that just because you're watching
what the hell is going on
all right here it is
there's a dog that walks on two feet
that's all
it just is so cute you can't stand it
that's all there is
and that ladies and gentlemen
as the completion of the youtube portion
of my presentation happy mother's day
i'll see you
tomorrow
