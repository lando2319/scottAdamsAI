hey everybody
welcome to coffee with scott adams
always the best part of your day
sometimes it's the best part of your
whole week and sometimes the best part
of the month
but it's going to be great it's going to
be great and all you need is
well a copper mug or glass up tanker
gels or starting a canteen jugger flask
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
have i ever mentioned that i really like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine ahead of the
day the thing that makes
everything better yeah it's called the
simultaneous
sip and it happens right now go
ah yeah
oh my goodness well i hear the olympics
runs anybody watching that
probably not seriously
in the comments are any of you watching
the olympics
and if you are why are you doing that
what would be the point of that for
entertainment
i just don't know why people watch it
let me cough it out today sorry about
that
so here's a question for you um you've
been following
the big lie the branded big lie
now that's what the anti-trump
anti-republican
folks are calling trump's claim and
other people's claim that the
2020 election was rigged it's a big lie
now here's the thing that's different
about the
big lie persuasion versus almost
anything else we
see and the difference is
that this one looks professional i've
told you that before right
but the big lie doesn't look like
something that just grew
organically and if maybe somebody used
it and other people said oh that sounds
good i'll use it too
maybe i wouldn't rule it out
but it's a little too professional
so it looks to me like some professional
persuader
um who had enough power to make
something happen
said just call it the big lie and that
will make it go away because
anybody who agrees with it will will be
a nazi
which is beautiful it's the same
strategy as antifa
antifa when they named themselves it was
a perfect name because
if you say well i'm against the people
who are against
fascists what does that make you
a fascist right how about black lives
matter
if you're opposed to black lives matter
well you're a racist it doesn't matter
why you're opposed
or what you're opposed to could be their
funding or whatever
but the name itself is is a trap
and the same technique is being used
with this big lie
if you brand something the big lie then
anybody who buys into it
there's a nazi because that's where you
know the
origin of the big lie comes from so
we've got this big professional thing
out there and i asked the question on
twitter
in my highly unscientific poll which
topic
best fits the description the big lie i
gave three
three options one is trump's uh claims
of election fraud
the other is the fine people hoax the
biden pushed
to get elected and the other is the that
the january 6th
riot was an insurrection
which of those is the big lie
not so clear is it think about the
damage that the fine people hoax did
that's really damaging think about
the fact that we're currently right in
the middle of a hoax
in which the entire left of the country
believes in the insurrection
was attempted with no weapons i mean no
weapons that would be
useful for an insurrection and
that is actually happening we're being
sold this big lie
that january 6 was an insurrection
that is the big lie right to me
this looks like the big lie but you
can't you can't say that because they
already took it
they are they already took that big lie
thing but do you remember what
uh trump did with the phrase fake news
he took the gun out of their hand and
flipped it around and he made fake news
the brand
for the people who were using it against
him and it worked fake news now
only means the left that you don't even
think of fox news
when you think of the term even though
you know it could apply to
any anything that's fake news but trump
just completely turned that brand
around could he do it with the big lie
well he can't
because he's shut out of the social
media machine
so he doesn't have the power to do that
at the moment
but i would think that everywhere you
saw the january 6th thing being called
an
insurrection if you were to start
referring to it as hashtag the big lie
then anybody who searched the hashtag
would find you calling out the
insurrection as
 maybe some reasons that you
gave so i think the public
could change this big lie branding into
something else um and that would be
interesting just see if you could do it
but for sure that's a profession i would
say there's a really high likelihood
i can't say 100 that this is
professional work
now somebody said to me on twitter
that there's no amount of persuasion
that could be applied
to the vaccination question that would
get
lots more people to get vaccinated and
the idea was
that it's because people have already
made up their mind
what do you think of that do you think
it's true
that because people have already made up
their mind about vaccinations and that
that part's probably true
most people have made up their minds but
do you think that therefore it would be
immune
to let's say a massive government
brainwashing operation do you think that
the people
the individuals could could hold off
a full-scale professional
persuasion i don't think so
i don't think you know how powerful
persuasion could be
when when applied to its maximum amount
because what we're used to is a bad
persuader trying to convince one person
of something and it doesn't work
so 99 of everything you see
that is somebody trying to persuade
somebody doesn't work
because they're not good at persuading
and like i said people make up their
minds and start to change them
but if a government wanted to change
your mind
with all the resources of a government
and let's say they got the social media
platforms on their side
could they change your mind now also
with a professional
so some whoever came up with the big lie
somebody who has that kind of skill
working with all the power of a
government
and all the power of social media you
don't think that they could make you do
any damn thing that they want
they could they could make the public
do almost anything
right they would just have to push hard
enough so it's really just
a question of how they wanted to push
and whether they had a professional
helping them and
that sort of thing but yeah you could
move anybody to do anything if you push
hard enough
because the the social media companies
and the news are essentially captured
so big well i'm not going to say your
name big
bad word floyd uh
he's saying scott is a sheep lol you
 idiot
first of all have a little bit of sense
about what i'm actually saying
so your hallucination doesn't
become your opinion
you don't know what my opinion is but
you've got a pretty strong opinion about
my opinion
which isn't even on the right
planet all right
so let me be really clear i don't care
if you get a vaccination
i don't care if you wear a mask and the
reason is i don't care if you
die
seriously i don't care if you die
can i be more clear about that i'm not
trying to make you wear a mask
i'm not trying to make you get
vaccinated because i don't care
about you
is that clear do you think you can hold
that in your brain
long enough to you know form a
reasonable opinion
come back to me when you're not such a
 idiot okay and then you can
leave another opinion
all right um
all right just looking at your comments
sir so
i suggested this and this is a
persuasion lesson
but i don't expect this to happen
but in knowing why it could work you're
going to learn something okay
so here's so here's your little lesson
on persuasion for today
if if the let's say the news industry
wanted to end the government wanted you
to get more vaccinated here's how they
could do it
they could just report the death rate
from coved
by political party
do you see it without me explaining why
that would work
because the first thing you might say to
yourself that's not going to make any
difference
the republicans know that they're less
vaccinated
and they know that if they're less
vaccinated and more of them die well
that was just the choice they made right
so why would that change anybody's mind
just to know the death rate of
the democrats versus the republicans
why would that be persuasive well let me
tell you why
here's a little trick of persuasion that
really comes from
the field of management whatever you
track is what you manage to
whatever you can track is what you will
manage to
this is just one of the reasons why
following the money
is such a good way to predict the future
or even predict the past in a sense to
find out what happened
people will will bias their decisions
toward things which can be measured
if something can be measured they will
pay more attention to it
they'll work toward making that number
better in whatever way
but if something is not measurable
or even not measured it doesn't even
have to be accurately measured
if nobody's measuring it nobody cares
nobody
nobody does anything about it um
but the moment you measure it people
start acting differently it's it's a
basic management concept now given the
tribalism
in politics of the united states if you
said here's how many democrats died as a
percentage of democrats
here's how many republicans died this
week from covet as a percentage of
republicans you wouldn't have to say
another thing about the vaccinations
you wouldn't now if it turns out let's
say
three possibilities one is that
republicans
are dying at a much higher rate because
they're less vaccinated
what would that cause other republicans
to do well you might not care about the
vaccination
but you're sure as not wanting your
team to lose
and what not wanting your team to lose
meaning not have
more republicans dying from preventable
illnesses you're going to change your
behavior
so you would actually do things to win
an argument that you wouldn't do to
protect your own life
let me say that again people will do
things to win an argument
to be right to be on the side that got
the good result
more importantly than they will save
their own life because we do reckless
stuff all the time
like every day people do reckless stuff
so that's just normal
but winning an argument people don't
walk away from an argument if they think
they could win
well maybe if i did get vaccinated
my team would have a little better
chance
so um and then also there's a
an interesting element to this which is
if we found out that
one political side
had a higher death rate it would almost
immediately turn into a voter
suppression question
let me ask you this is biden involved in
voter suppression
by recommending that everybody get a
vaccination
think about it biden recommends that
everybody gets a vaccination
is that voter suppression
it is because when a democrat says get
vaccinated it makes
republicans say well maybe not
am i right it's it's the the people just
have a natural aversion to what the
other team wants them to do
so in all likelihood biden
encouraging republicans to get
vaccinated
might cause fewer them to get vaccinated
because it sounds like a democrat idea
which would cause more republicans to
die which would be voter suppression
now i'm not saying that would be big
enough to make a difference but
you could imagine the argument um
all right here's a uh factoid let's
here's another persuasion and psychology
kind of a topic so max abrams
reports on twitter that i guess there
was a study that says the rate of
suicide attempts
appears to have been inversely related
to school closures
now what's the wouldn't you just imagine
that the school closures would cause
more suicides because the kids would be
depressed they wouldn't be with their
friends
couldn't do what they want to do don't
have a social life
you'd expect more suicides right but it
turns out it's the other way around
according to one study
that the people who went to school were
committing more suicides
than the people who were remote learning
does that make sense to you i saw claire
claire layman refer to it as
non-intuitive
i'm not so sure i'm not so sure you
shouldn't have expected that result
here's why
the kids who are doing remote learning
got closer to their families
wouldn't you say i mean maybe not every
family
but if you stay home all day and you
don't have the option of playing with
your friends
you end up getting a little closer to
family i would think
so i would think that would reduce
suicides
you're you're more supervised
you're closer to your family but also i
don't think people
quite realize the toxic
lethality of bullying the bullying
happens when you go to school doesn't it
and there's bullying online but i have
to think that the in-person stuff is the
bad stuff
and it's the bullying that caused people
to kill people
kill each other if if you take a loaner
and you say hey you loner how do you
feel they might say everybody else is
happy
but i'm a loaner so you know i need to
end things but what if the loaner knows
that everybody's a loaner
suddenly everybody's a loaner you're on
the same boat all those popular people
all the popular people they're loaners
during the pandemic
so i would think that that would also
make you feel
more like everybody else same boat
so i could think of a number of
mechanisms that would work on this
to make uh the remote learning safer
at least in terms of taking your own
life
not surprised at all all right here's
another surprise
so biden's got this proposed 3.5
trillion dollar infrastructure package
what do you think the economists say
about that pretty easy question right
we've already got some uh some we've got
a lot of debt pressure
we've got inflation pressure
from all the money that flowed in for
the pandemic stuff
so don't you think that economists could
at least get this question right
does the 3.5 trillion dollar
infrastructure package
increase inflation or decrease it
very basic you know if you went to
school for years to become an economist
i don't think it could be a more basic
question than this
and of course economists disagree
what here's everything that you need to
know
about economists the simplest
question in the world
they're disagreeing on do you know what
is the simplest question in the world
will adding 3.5 trillion dollars to the
economy
in spending increase inflation
now when i say it's the simplest
question i don't mean that i know the
answer
i've got a degree in economics i've got
an mba from a top school
i don't know the answer that's
everything you need to know about
economics
it's the simplest question and nobody
knows the answer
i mean a lot of people think they know
the answer but here's some of the
argument
now the argument where that it would
include
increase inflation is obvious because
you add a bunch of money into the
economy
and there's more money chasing the same
amount of goods and services
so those people just increase their
prices because they can get it
there's all this money here hey i'll
raise my prices somebody will pay it
so there's an obvious reason why the
inflation might go up
but what is the argument that it might
not how in the world can you make an
argument that it won't
inflate well turns out there is an
argument and the one part of the
argument is there's
there are tons of people who are
unemployed so they can just go back to
work
so the employees will not necessarily
put a uh
put pressure on on employers to raise
their
prices to raise their pay because if you
have
plenty of employees who could just go
back to work anytime they made
themselves available
then in the long run it should not put
pressure on wages and that should keep
inflation under control does that make
sense
and another part of the reason and this
part is just politics reasons
but i'll
put it out there anyway part of what
biden's package wants to do
is to create low-cost housing that
doesn't exist
and so part of the argument is hey all
these people who would have been
paying for more expensive housing will
now have low-cost housing
but there's no way that that's going to
happen fast and there's no way that
that's going to be
enough of a difference to be seen in the
economy as a whole
so i would say that's a reason
it's true
i mean building low-cost housing means
your housing costs
less i guess right all other things
being equal
but i don't think that's big enough to
make a difference so
what do you do when your experts
disagree
and the facts are not in dispute
because this is one of those rare
questions where
you have all the facts the only thing
you don't have is what happens in the
future
you know how much money you'd put in you
know how much is there you know what the
inflation is
you know what the gdp is you know what
the employment rate is you know all the
facts
so it's experts looking at the same damn
facts
and coming up with opposite conclusions
how good are your experts
no good at all apparently and
my my well-trained instinct
is that it has to increase inflation
but at the same time if you know
anything about economics
you know that your common sense about
what's going to happen next
doesn't mean much so you know my common
sense says yeah of course it has to be
inflation
how could there not be but i could be
wrong very easily
very easily could run
all right here's here's one of these
stories that is just
sort of a mind-blowing reminder
about how the world works
and i don't know if this is mind-blowing
just because the story involves me
so maybe you can judge whether it looks
mind-blowing from the outside
but you heard the story about the
so-called pegasus software
that some intelligence agencies in a lot
of different countries actually
are using to penetrate people's phones
and spy on their phones and one of the
people on the list was uh
ex-president of mexico philippe calderon
and by coincidence phillippe calderon
follows me on twitter
so i followed him on twitter when i
noticed it some time ago
and so i thought to myself i wonder
i wonder if this individual who is named
in this story
i wonder if it's true because sometimes
you know it could be fake news
so i thought well i'll just send a dm a
direct message
to the ex-president of mexico and i'll
just ask him myself
did you have this spyware on your phone
now just think about this i'm just
sitting here in my little office
in california and i see this major
international story with the
ex-president of mexico in it and i think
to myself
huh i think i'll ask him boo boo
so i sent a message i said do you think
the pegasus software got in your phone
i just saw the washington post report
saying you were on the list after
leaving office
and a few days later i get a private
message back
from the president ex-president of
mexico who confirms that
the yes he said yes i do it happened
now how how mind-blowing is it
that there are you know seven plus
whatever billion people in the world
i'm just sitting here in california and
i see a world
a world headline and i can just
pick up this device in my hand and i can
type a few things
and i'm talking to the one person and of
seven billion
to ask the exact question that i wanted
to ask
and the answers and it was the president
of mexico
am i right this is mind blowing now
i can't tell you how many times
something like this has happened
you know i'll do a i'll do a topic on
here and i'll check my dms and
somebody who would be quite famous is
weighing in on something
but i tell you it just makes me feel
like the world
is just not whatever it is that it looks
like
because you know that experiment in
physics
in which you i don't know you separate a
particle and you change the spin
wherever you are and the other half
changes at the same time
or some version of that it feels like
that it feels like i'm connected to
every story in the world
and that i can i can touch it if i want
i can't tell you how weird that is
um
yeah and there
there are two other themes that are
haunting me right now because there's
a couple things happening in my personal
life and so there's one company that
just keeps
coming up everywhere and there's one car
model that i always keep parking next to
it's just the weirdest thing because
both of them have some
relevance in my life right now so it
feels like i'm
unlike moving the simulation myself
all right um the biggest fake news story
in the country is about critical race
theory
and the fake news part is that
the people on the political right say
hey
stop that critical race theory teaching
because it's
it's racist itself and then the people
on the
left what do they say did they say
oh uh we'll we'll stop that right now
they just act like it isn't happening
they act like
critical race theory is the same as
teaching history
it's not no it's not an escalade but
that was a good guess
and every time i see this story i think
it was aoc was doing this trick
where somebody says should we teach
critical race theory and then they say
well of course you have to teach the
real history of the united states to the
children
who exactly was fighting against that so
the
the response to the the claims just have
nothing to do with the claims they just
they answer a whole different question
and somehow they get away with that the
news allows them to do that
because the dues does not publish useful
facts
it seems like there's a space
available in the news galaxy
don't you think there needs to be at
least one news
entity that just gives you context
so that every time you wade into a story
and you say to yourself hey
these people are saying critical race
theory is being taught
these other people are saying it's not
that's usually how the news
teaches it and then you don't know well
i just see two competing claims
but where's the news site that just
gives you the whatever statistics there
are it says yeah it's being taught here
or it's not
nobody would watch nobody would watch
if it were a news channel that's right
adam
but if it were a written website with
resources
then everybody who argued on social
media would have to link to it
so it would be basically a link farm
basically actually that maybe you call
it that called a link
farm where you take the best arguments
for every side
and you just organize them here are the
best arguments for why masks work
here are the best arguments for why they
don't
um i see somebody saying
tim cast does he have that there i have
not heard of anybody doing that
but i think in order to do it you would
have to show the best links on both
both sides if you only showed the links
that you think
are the answer to the question then you
just become a partisan
you have to show the best from both
sides i think otherwise
it's a waste
[Laughter]
in the comments on youtube somebody said
dealing with people like that
is why prussian bayonets were invented
okay
i would like to now give you some
television
viewing recommendations
if you're like me you've noticed that
television is terrible
and i don't know if it got worse or if
it's just the pandemic or my attention
span or what
but i'm going to give you the only
things that are worth watching on
television as far as i can tell
number one rick and morty
you got to try several episodes before
you can get in the feel
but the fourth the fourth season
is just beyond brilliant um i watched a
few of the early ones and i have to
admit
one of the characters was sort of gross
like i found it hard to watch
but one once you see the the whole arc
of where they've taken this thing
by the fourth year it's extraordinary it
is
visually better than anything i've ever
seen from an animated
show and it's uh smarter than anything
i've
seen in an animated show by far so i
believe it's on
hulu has it at the moment i don't know
what other platforms is on
now on the disney streaming network
here's another recommendation
and i was totally surprised that this
was good
loki loki so loki the goddamn mischief
from the
marvel universe he has now his own
spit-off and it's a
series now i i kind of like the loki
character in marvel
but i didn't really think he could hold
his own show
because i thought well i just don't know
there's enough to this
particular character to make a show but
here's what i didn't count on
the the actor who plays that part
is really good he's like a way better
actor
than i think comes out in the other
marvel movies so when they focus on him
and he gets to hold the scene and
and really be a complete character oh my
god he's so good
so it's worth watching yeah and owen
wilson plays
sort of the bad guy in that and watching
owen wilson play the bad guy
is really really good it's really good
so the writing is spectacular uh and the
you know the dialogue and stuff i don't
really like watching the superhero
films for the action because the action
is just a blur
of boring stuff you've seen before but
the dialogue is always funny
and loki is is very dialogue heavy
in a very good way yeah i think there
are only six episodes but they're
terrific
um now here's an anti-recommendation
scarlett johansson's film the black
widow is out
i tried to watch that
oh my god it's terrible and i
i tried to watch uh you know black
mirror the other day and
oh my god it's terrible it's terrible
and what i mean by that is it's slow
because our attention spans have all
changed
and it's just way too slow to watch like
a movie
but both the black widow and then the
um the black that's weird they're both
black something
but black mirror uh they both started
out by trying to make
the viewer feel terrible
now i guess that the point of it was if
they could make the viewer feel
terrible then maybe they can make you
feel good at the end and you'll feel the
difference and maybe that'll make you
happy or something
but i'm not down for any tv show or
movie that makes me feel terrible in the
first part of the movie
so that i'll have a better feeling later
if you think that's a good idea
i'd like to talk you out of it right now
here's why
i love star trek and star wars and those
kinds of films
because they don't do that those films
will have a you know a problem that
happens in the beginning of the movie
because all movies need a problem to
solve
but you don't really feel it in your
bones
you know you're watching a movie it's
like oh yeah some bad happened
things happened to people in the movie
it didn't affect me
but uh
but anyway yeah the star trek just feels
good from beginning to end
even when the characters are in trouble
they're cracking jokes and
it doesn't seem that bad
um so please give me more entertainment
that does not require me to feel bad
all right that is your recommendation
for today um i see people saying that
the
last kingdom is good that's about the
vikings i tried that but
i don't know i felt i could get through
it
um i hear on the comments here that the
the sci-fi show called the expanse is
even better than star trek
i would say they're both great the
expanse is great
and the thing i like about the sci-fi
stuff is that they bring you into a
world
so you feel yourself brought in i'm
seeing a recommendation for ted lasso
which won a bunch of awards
i understand and i'm definitely going to
try that
but i have not tried it yet so i'll let
you know
um yeah yeah watching norm mcdonald
clips on youtube is better than all of
that
i mean i i never get bored of that i
don't i can't tell you how many norm
mcdonald clips i've watched on youtube
you just you know set them up and it'll
recommend new ones
uh i could watch that all day all right
that's all i got for now
uh it's kind of a slow news day and i'm
going to do
a separately um i'm going to do a
video a little bit later that will be
available for everybody
and the topic is is china safe for
business
is china safe for business and let me
tell you what i'm going to do
persuasion wise just so you can follow
along
in my unique role as the dilbert guy
i have a weird credibility with business
people
so if i tell business people there's a
business process
that is people find that
credible
because for 30 years i've been
accurately calling out business
and so if i say it people say okay
that's
probably you're calling out some
 and one of the things um
one of the things that i can do because
of that weird role
is i can talk to people about the risk
of doing business in china
until it's unsafe to make a decision to
do
business in china so my credibility
can be part of that messaging in a way
that the random person
could not do as effectively so i'm going
to give you a little whiteboard
talk on why it's unsafe to do business
in china
and we'll see if we can move the needle
on that and
let's see if i'm still alive in a week
um
i should probably say this out loud i'm
not planning to kill myself
okay did you all hear that um
there may be some bad things happening
in my life from time to time
as as comes in any life but nothing like
that
so if if china tries to knock me off
um please complete the work for me
but i'll i'll get it going and
you know the funny thing about having
somebody kill your stepson
which is what china did by sending
fentanyl to mexico which i believe
got into my stepson and killed him
the thing about that experience is
if china killed me over this
you know if somehow they found a way to
get to me and just took me out
totally worth it like i i wouldn't even
care about that
because that alone would be a story so
um it's me against them and you don't
want to get in the battle with somebody
who doesn't mind dying
and that's what china has right now
they've got a battle with me and they're
in a battle of self-preservation
and i'm not i'm in a battle to take them
down
that's all i care about and if i if i go
at the same time
that's the way it goes so i would hate
to be them right now
they don't know what's coming for him
but you'll find out later when i give
you my whiteboard talk i hope you hope
you join me
and i'll talk to you
