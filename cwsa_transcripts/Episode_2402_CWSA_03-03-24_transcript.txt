[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human
civilization if you'd like to take this
experience up to levels that could only
be described as
Galactic well then all you need is a cup
or mug or glass a tankered sheler Stein
a canteen Jer flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure of the dopamine the
end of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called The Sim
thing you said but happens now
go oh H surprisingly
good how often does a surprise turn out
to be better than you thought have you
ever noticed
that that you don't often get surprised
with something that's better than you
thought
it's about a 3:1 ratio oh that's a
surprise 3: one I don't know why all
right here's something I don't think
I've said too often maybe never uh if
you don't subscribe to the Dilbert comic
which you can now only get by
subscription on the
xplatform or on locals at Scott adams.
locals where you get lots of other stuff
as well um you would miss today's um
today's Sunday
comic and I'm just going to tell you two
things about
it in the first panel Dilbert tells his
boss he wants to
transition that's the first thing I'm
going to tell you about it second thing
I'm going to tell you about it is it
might be the funniest thing I've ever
written it might be now you can judge
for yourself but it might be the
funniest thing I've ever written so look
at the comments if you don't believe me
the they're saying it right
now I saw a post on X saying the CNN was
considering canning Anderson Cooper and
Chris
Wallace is that true can I get a fact
check on that since what do they tell
you who they're considering firing that
doesn't sound true to me does
it like who who has that conversation
you
know we're we're really thinking hard
about getting of our top host I don't
know I'm got to put a big question mark
next to that one
yeah I'm going to say I don't believe it
yet if you want to see something that's
really funny I just po uh I just uh
reposted it it's a uh compilation of
Morning Joe talking about Trump in 2016
when they liked them and then it's a
quick cut to 2024 when they don't like
him oh you have to see it I don't think
there's anything that's ever been on TV
that's as entertaining as watching
moring Joe being normal and nice and
then flipping uh watching him in you
know deep
TDS I can't even explain it you just
have to see it yourself all right um SNL
was mocking Joe Biden for his lack of
vigor the
funniest the funniest line was
uh one of the characters said he had a
grandpa monkey
grip grandpa monkey
grip he and he can jump over walls and
he's so v he's so much full of
vigor so what does it tell you when CNL
SNL I just combined CNN and SNL but what
does it tell you when SNL is openly
mocking one of the candidates and
happens to be a
Democrat they're very done with him I
feel like they're very done with him
yeah and at least SNL has the
self-awareness to know even if they
prefer him as president you know they
know physically and mentally he's kind
of gone so that's I I give them credit
for being honest about that because they
didn't have to be you know we're in this
weird world where if they just
ignored that one president can barely
function they could have gotten away
with it it probably wouldn't have made
any difference to their numbers but they
played it straight and I appreciate
that there's a video of Sergey Bren one
of the founders of Google talking about
the uh new problems they have with her
racist um AI that shows everybody
looking black no matter what they were
and Sergey said uh yeah we messed up on
uh image
generation and he thought that the
reason that maybe they messed up was
wait for
it not enough
testing not enough
testing
now ah you know I'm no entrepreneur who
created the biggest company most
impressive company I don't know if it's
the biggest but most impressive company
in the world um
but
Sergey I don't think it was a testing
problem I think it tested just the way
they built it that's why they rolled it
out that's why I think and you know what
else it's not an image problem it's the
whole damn thing it's not an image
problem you want to find out if it's an
image problem or if it's just
broken try to Google
this uh crime by
demographic
do it just Google crime by demographic
group do you know what comes
up uh lots of stories about how black
people are the biggest victims of
crime so is that because they didn't
test it enough because you know some
people when they do that search
sometimes they're looking for who's the
biggest victims a crime so that's
totally
appropriate but other times they're
trying to figure out who's committing
the crimes
such as you know are migrants doing more
crimes are immigrants doing more crimes
is there any difference you know that
that we can identify and I'm not saying
there's a reason for it because that
gets into a racist territory but
certainly you should understand it and
and the demographic um nature of it is
part of understanding it even if you
know the reasons that you give to the
underlying
problem should be you know probably
deeper than the ones we give it
yeah no there's the Google is completely
broken and has nothing to do with
testing you know the way I interpret
that is if we tested it better we could
have gotten away with it and what I mean
by gotten away with it is making it
anti-white it was just a little bit too
anti-white so they didn't get away with
it that's really all there was if they
made it subtle like the the search
results I just mentioned if you weren't
looking for that search result you
wouldn't know that it's
completely illegitimate
basically um you wouldn't know
that but if you do any kind of searching
on anything that's a little bit
interesting you immediately find out the
whole thing is broken it doesn't give
you anything like anything like
interesting whatever you're looking for
it doesn't trust
you anyway no it's not a problem with
testing but it does suggest that maybe
they don't don't know how to fix it
there might be no way to fix it you know
some have suggested they have to fire
80% of their
staff and that's not going to happen so
now it looks unfixable interestingly
enough now here's a real
question is it possible that
AI could ever
replace Google as a search engine
because doesn't AI just sort of use
Google I mean you still need the basic
search engine and AI just sits on top of
it right so I don't think that AI can
replace
it um and does anybody have any you know
data that's not that's not corrupted
that way I don't know so I don't know I
I suppose that uh Google will continue
being the brain of the world now you're
completely aware that if Google decides
that the President should be X or Y they
they get to decide
right in our current system whoever
Google decides to make president they
just they could just change the
algorithm and make him president did you
know that now it might not work in this
specific case because Biden is just you
know disintegrating in front of us
that's that might be the special case
but if the election was supposed to be
close then Google
decides or mailin ballots decide the
only thing that doesn't decide for sure
is the
voters I think the only purpose for
voting is to create the illusion that it
was close so that whatever the bad guys
do to rig it it won't be so obvious it
was rigged so I think the only purpose
of voting at the moment is to hide the
rigging would you
agree well let's see what Tucker says um
Wall Street Apes had this post so Tucker
was talking about the CIA controlling
election and I'm just going to read his
whole four paragraph thing and I want to
see if this matches where you
are all right is this where you are in
understanding your world so Tucker says
the fact that CIA is playing uh is
playing in domestic politics and
actually has for a long time is shocking
you can't have that the reason I'm so
mad is I really believe in the idea of
representative government acknowledging
its imperfections but like I should have
have some say I live here I'm a citizen
the the fact that they would be
tampering with American democracy is so
outrageous to me and I don't know why is
only Glenn Greenwald mad about it now
that's what I say why why do I read
every
day Glenn Greenwall making claims about
you know the elections and not the
elections but just the government being
a sort of an intelligence asset
basically and nobody really fact checks
them have you noticed that nobody fact
checks them because it's
true there's nothing to fact check and
he can do it all day long and we just
act like it's just somebody
talking instead of the most important
thing happening in the world yeah the
Glen
who I'll talk about the octopus in a
second uh then he says uh uh blah blah
blah about Glenn greenwald's claims
about the CIA Tucker says I mean it's
confirmed it's not like a fever dream
that's what I keep saying we know it's
true and he goes it's real they played
it in the last election domestically and
I guess it shows how dumb I am because
they've been doing that for many years
the guy who took out uh mosad day lived
on my
street uh I'm one of the results CIA
officer what I don't know what that
means so I mean again I grew up around
this stuff but I never really thought I
never I never reached the obvious
conclusion which is that wait for it
here comes the obvious conclusion and
see if this sounds familiar to you the
obvious
conclusion which is that if the US
government subverts democracy in other
countries in the name of democracy it
will over time subvert democracy in my
country why wouldn't
it does that sound
familiar that's why I've been for a
while now if you create an entity who
become really good at overthrowing
countries and they do it 80 times in a
row successfully I don't know how many
in a row but 80 times
successfully they're going to overthrow
your country because they can and they
will come up with a
justification because they can they came
up with justifications for all the other
countries you know they don't do it
without some kind of cover story so all
they is a cover story that's the easiest
thing in the world oh the other one's a
dictator better overthrow the country
save
democracy yeah so um I
remember do do you remember when you
first realized that we didn't live in a
in a republic and maybe we hadn't for a
long time how how many of you remember
like the moment you said
oh this was never even
real in my lifetime I don't know if it
was ever real maybe when I was when I
was two maybe maybe during
Eisenhower maybe I don't
know but I don't feel that I live in
anything like a republic or a you know
Democratic Republic how many of you feel
like you're living in a republic like
it's it's actually the will of the
people and you know it's imperfect but
it's basically good yeah now I wonder if
any Republicans feel they're living in a
republic
anymore I don't
know yeah it it's it's weird that that
could change well I watched uh started
watching I haven't finished yet the uh
Netflix series a new series called The
Octopus murders and I can't I can't
entirely summarize it for you because
it's so complicated there are a lot of
names involved but that's part of the
story The Octopus is all the names
involved
so the basic idea is that there was some
guy that they think was CIA connected
who was doing all these Ops around the
world and one of them was he sort of
took over an Indian
reservation and then he used it for
illegal selling illegal drugs and
gambling uh to make some illegal money
and then started inviting in the US uh I
guess some arms
dealers that were working with the CIA
so they could do illegal arms stuff to
get I don't know they were going to give
the arms to the contas or something so
they used the Indian Reservation because
it's not America per se to do illegal
things that you couldn't do or you
wouldn't want to get caught if he did
somewhere else what's that sound
like that's
Ukraine it's just creating a place where
the CIA can operate with impunity to do
all the dirty stuff they need to do and
it's not in the United
States and so they're alleged that there
are many murders that um are associated
with the CIA and they're they're a
murderous bunch of drug dealing people
but here are the things which if this
stuff is true of course who knows I
believe there was there was a suggestion
that they wanted to use the Indian
reservation for a bioweapons
lab did I hear that right I was sort of
half falling asleep that so they're
going to use does this sound familiar
it's basically the Ukraine play and then
you can see that they've already tested
it so it must be common operation to
find the most Lawless
Place partner with the most dangerous
people sell
drugs to make dirty money that you can
use for whatever you're
doing it's all there so basically
everything you assumed about the CIA
everything you ever assumed about
Ukraine it's all their modeled as not
just I'm not going to say that they
practice there to do it in Ukraine what
I'm saying is it must be part of the the
toolbox of the trade to do exactly what
Ukraine is so it doesn't surprise you at
all yeah it's all
there all right so uh when when you see
that the uh cartels seem to have freedom
to bring drugs into this country and you
say to yourself I'm sure we could have
done more to stop it it's because we're
not stopping it you know I don't believe
that the border
patrol is working with the CIA to Lad
drugs in the country that's not
happening there there's no evidence that
I think the border patrol is trying to
stop it and wondering why they don't
have the right tools and why nobody's
helping him that's that's cuz somebody's
probably making money on
it
so you got that uh another story the
University of Florida um terminated all
of its Dei
people and now that's going to be
illegal it is illegal in Florida to
teach Dei in their schools now that's
still leaves the
corporations so it's not like a gigantic
win but but at least she got it out of
the corporations that's or you got out
the
schools now here's my
question imagine if you had taken up a
job a cubical job to be a Dei
professional and then you hear that
Florida decided that you you the person
in that job is too dangerous to even be
allowed to operate in the state state
schools cu that's what happened they
didn't say let's get rid of Dei because
it's not giving us benefit for the money
they didn't say that they said it's
dangerous that it makes things
worse imagine that's your
job your job as Dei and you just just
found out one of our biggest
states had a vote and decided is just
really bad for the state we got to get
ad made it
illegal how many other things are
illegal that basically are talking and
teaching you know Dei is a lot of
talking and
teaching it's kind of amazing and I was
trying to think what other jobs are
illegal in some states but not
others and I thought it too so you
couldn't be an abortion doctor where
abortions
illegal right abortionist uh you
couldn't have a weed
dispensary couldn't have a weed
dispensary
is there anything
else yeah not that they have anything in
common but um just imagine being in a
job that was some major State thought
about it hard and said you're bad for
the world or we're going to make you
illegal in our state oh prostitution
there's another one
yeah anyway so here's my question could
Trump ban Dei in the country by
executive
order could you ban
Dei
nationally in in corporations not just
government entities but
corporations could you ban it by
executive order now my understanding of
executive orders is very
thin but what I think it means usually
is there has to be some existing laws on
the
books or it would have to be you know
right within his job description somehow
I guess um he can only interpret
existing things is that right an
executive order is not a new law it's a
new way of interpreting some existing
law right so is there any existing law
that would allow somebody to do an EO EO
executive order that would ban it
nationally well would be oh a health
emergency there we go civil rights civil
rights
I would think civil rights would be
sufficient but I might have a better one
coming
up I'll make you wait for
it um well I won't make you wait for
it maybe I'll just skip right to
it
um I asked Google so you have to
question it whether uh you could sue
somebody
for
brainwashing is it illegal to brainwash
somebody that's kind of interesting
because where where's the dividing line
between just influencing and
brainwashing well I would say is this if
you're influencing somebody you know
just to vote for your candidate we
accept that that's good if you influence
somebody to buy your product we're okay
with that we don't call that
brainwashing but suppose you influence
somebody to do something that's clearly
damaging to them
personally what would that be called
well I would call that brainwashing and
I would think that that would be illegal
so if you're brainwashing somebody else
for your own benefit and there was no
benefit to the brainwash
person I would think that you're doing
something illegal so I looked it up and
uh let's see um it did say that there if
you inflict emotional abuse on people
yeah emotional
abuse could be the the the trigger for
the brainwashing being illegal if you
just brainwash somebody but they were
happy about it you're fine if you just
brain but if you brainwash them and
they're in great mental distress because
of it yeah that's that feels like you
actually attack them it's basically
assault and here's what I'd like to
see I'd love to see uh maybe Republicans
uh sue the DNC the Democrats and Sue the
Biden
Administration for brainwashing black
Americans into thinking they are
victims now here here's the
argument the argument is that we we know
very well that if you tell somebody
they're a victim they'll have a less
good life would you agree I I think 100%
of social science would agree that if
you tell somebody they're a victim you
know in the normal course of things I'm
not talking about somebody who's
literally a slave you could tell them
they're a victim maybe that's better
than not but in the normal course of you
know people just living and thriving in
in our society if you took one group of
them and you brainwash them into
believing they were the victims you
would be doing tremendous damage to
them personally
psychologically
economically socially you you could
actually decrease their ability to
reproduce literally because you know
let's say it you know causes them to
have some separation from the people
that they think are oppressing them and
maybe some of them would have married
some of those people in another the
world so you you can actually reduce
their ability to
reproduce their ability to you know
Thrive the ability to have a good job
now the whole point of Dei is if you
complain enough something good will
happen and that would be maybe the
defense maybe that would be the defense
hey something good will happen if we
complain enough but I'd like to see the
science I think the science would show
you that the conservatives who are black
in this country generally are
happier I I'll bet you could find that
in a poll there's your science do a poll
of conservative black Americans versus
your know liberal black Americans who do
you think would be
happier probably the ones who think they
can take their own fate into their own
hands the Republicans and make something
out of themselves even if there are
difficulties even if there is
discrimination that they can still
Thrive but if you thought you couldn't
Thrive because of all the Discrimination
you would be at a great psychological
economic disadvantage and now I don't
have any uh illusion that somebody could
win such a case but it would be the
greatest reframe of all
time the greatest reframe of all time
would be suing democrats for
brainwashing black
Americans into the worst situation they
could be in because of the
brainwashing all right and it has the
odd political quality of being true but
the the reframing of it would be amazing
you you could lose and win right you you
could lose the court case but you would
win by simply making it a thing that
people have to talk about that there
there is a difference between
persuading and
brainwashing right you know the
difference when you see it TDs is a
result of
brainwashing TDS did not happen on its
own that is your media brainwashing now
there might also be you know a CIA or
other intelligence agency involvement I
don't know if you could make that case
but you wouldn't need
to all right there's if you haven't seen
Trump mocking fonny Willis in his in his
latest uh rally
it's uh it's worth seeing he's pretty
darn funny about it he does he he does
say emotion I'll paraphrase but he was
talking about uh the boyfriend Wade uh
he so Trump said he was hired without
you know
experience the right kind of experience
in the law for the job he got from his
girlfriend but Trump says he had
experience of something else and then
Trump does his hand motion of like of
the sexual head
motion something no presidential
candidate has ever
done in the in the history of
presidential candidates nobody ever
stood in front of a crowd and did a and
did a humping each other hand motion
like how do you not love that like no
matter what you'll think of is politics
how do you not love
that anyway uh
he was very funny about that all right
uh Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut
says the crime surge for migrants is
100% made up it's a right-wing invention
he says violent crime is way down and
let me tell you he's using all capital
letters for way and down so it's a big
difference because if he didn't use the
capitals I would have read that this way
violent crime is way down you wouldn't
be impressed by that no but the way he's
written with the capitals the way I read
his violent crime is weigh
down and that's different makes you feel
completely
different he says the drop in urban
murders this year was the largest in the
nation's history and that the data shows
that migrants commit crimes at lower
rates than the people who were real
already here at lower
rates is that true
well it turns out you can prove anything
with
data that data has no value it really
doesn't is it's just blah blah blah my
data can can he make his case with
data do you think that do you think that
Chris Murphy if he just had an argument
with data could he make his case yes yes
the data is completely on his
side but is that therefore his narrative
is
correct
no because I'm pretty sure that one
extra death is a little bit too much so
his argument about the rate I think is
actually true
historically but you know what's not
true that migration today looks like
historical
migration you can't use the old data to
tell me what the new migrants are going
to do
now it might be the same but the data
won't tell you that because the data is
about a certain kind of migration from a
certain set of countries and those
people really really just wanted to work
and they didn't want to get
deported they didn't come here for
crime and they actually I believe have a
lower crime rate than population General
I
think I can use a fact check on that but
I think historically
people really want to stay off of law
enforcement's radar and just work so
they actually did have a lower crime
rate
um yeah so that could be true but it
could also be true that you know any
extra deaths or too much that's just a
different different way of looking at
the same
data now are we bringing in um the same
kind of IM migrants or immigrants that
we used to it looks like no there there
is certainly a suggestion that the
Venezuelan criminals got in of jail and
ran up here you know the very thing that
Trump said might happen actually
happened it looks like now if they're
entering the jails I would imagine that
there would be some locations where the
crime goes up maybe so be careful of
uh be careful of all the um assumptions
about data you can prove anything you
want with the data but I I do want to
give the uh the immigrants who are
already here um a little bit of
respect if you don't mind I about a
little bit of respect for the immigrants
who are here and just want to work and
just want to be
Americans I'm seeing some of you saying
no no respect
really no respect for somebody who loves
their God and their family and they're
in a bad situation and they're willing
to do what they need to make it right
and even though it's illegal to come
here what they want is to just make a
good legal life and contribute to the
country you don't respect
that because they broke a law to do
it interesting I would I would argue
that you've been deeply brainwashed for
that
opinion that that's not a that's not a
natural
opinion that's a that's a brainwashed
opinion I I hate to tell my own you know
we're we're all brainwashed by the way
including me we're all brainwashed maybe
in slightly different
ways but if you can't find it in
yourself to respect someone who came
from another country wanted to be
American wanted to work wanted to obey
all the laws after coming in illegal
illegally perhaps you can't you can't
find a way to respect that
really you don't have to like it by the
way it's it's a different argument if
you think we should close the border
that's separate I'm just saying that if
you're just looking at the people the
human beings they're human beings just
trying to get along now I'm I'm for very
strong borders and very tough vetting so
we're only letting in people who can
help us all right but that's a separate
conversation you you can still you can
still respect the
people right you're you're tough
graders you're very tough
graders yeah I don't know well so part
of it is I put myself in their
situation and I say to myself if I were
in some country and I knew that if I
took a risk I could get here and I could
you know make make something to myself
and I just want to follow the law
there's just this one law I'm going to
violate to get
here would I feel bad about
myself I don't think I would I think I
would respect my choice if it worked out
and my second generation was completely
legal and had a good life and went to
school so are are the is there anybody
here who would think it would be more
respectable to stay in your native
country and
starve versus breaking a law to try to
get to a new place how many of you think
it's more respectable to stay there and
let your family
starve I don't know I think you can
consider that we're all
brainwashed by the way that's that's a
really good mental
experiment don't assume it's the other
people the other people are definitely
brainwashed no doubt about that but if
your level of awareness is only the
other people are getting
brainwashed I I'm here to help you up to
the next level right I'm here to help
I'm not from the government I'm here I'm
actually here to help I would actually
like you to understand when it happens
to you if you only see it when it's
happening to somebody else that's you
know that's grade school that's easy I'm
trying to take you up to at least junior
college level where you can see it's
happening to you as well if you can't
see it happening to you you're really
going to be lost you have to know it's
happening to you it's very very
important all right um I know it's
uncomfortable to have that thought in
your
head uh Biden saying the border is
insecure because of
trump let's just talk about uh sort of
the theme I was getting
to that the level of gaslighting during
the election season is so of the chart
and I I don't
know I don't know if it's worse than
ever it feels like it is but maybe we
think that all the time I don't know so
how how much of a Gaslight is it to say
that Trump's the reason that the border
is
open I that's just
insane it's insane and the story that
theyve sold to I don't know at least
half of their own people is that if that
b if that Bill had passed the Border
would be closed
how how little would you have to know
about this situation to think that
that's
true you would have to know almost
nothing about the situation to to buy
that and the fact that Biden says it and
you know it's the standard line now
really does suggest that they know how
dumb their voters
are they're really playing their voters
for idiots right because there's lots
you could say that would be not exactly
what Trump says there's a whole bunch of
things you could say which is Trump
honestly says this we honestly say this
we think our thing is better they can't
do that all they can do is make up the
most absurd lie that Trump's responsible
for it now I do
believe that Trump said it would be
better for my election results if he
don't pass the Bill do you believe that
part do you believe that Trump ever did
say you know it'd be better off if we
don't pass it I believe he said that but
not the way they're interpreting it it
doesn't make sense to do a bad Bill if
it's also politically bad that's what I
heard the Bill's
bad but passing it would be twice as bad
it's two bad things the bill itself and
then the politics of passing it if they
could claim it worked or that it's going
to work any day
now so yeah uh I think Trump is
completely it's completely normal thing
to say this would be bad to pass this
politically but it's also just a bad
bill which we we
observe all right because it didn't
really address the core
problems
um here's the funniest
thing I I really don't think that
Democrats understand that uh that
replacement theory that they keep
complaining about you know um a lot of
people on the right keep saying hey
they're trying to replace us they're
going to try to replace us and they're
usually thinking uh I guess white
Republicans or something they're trying
to replace
us well you know how the future is
impossible to predict Ain that anything
yeah we just most things are just
unpredictable here's what I think might
be
happening the migrants might be
replacing us but only the the
Democrats I think the migrants are
replacing the
Democrats
and because what are how many of the
migrants have blue hair has anybody seen
the have you seen the thousands and
thousands of
migrants I look for the blue-haired
ones and I also I'm wondering how many
of them are
trans have you seen the numbers are are
you saying that no trans people are
coming across the border I feel like
that group should be carved down for
special
protection no trans no blue hair no
trans and uh are they rejecting religion
the people coming in or are they
embracing
it just the gas probably most of them at
least from Central Latin America are
certainly religious nature do they like
families yes
do they expect and want to work hard to
succeed
yes yeah you I don't think I don't think
we've quite
grasped uh the degree to which we've
refreshed the country and we don't know
it now again let me say I'm completely
against open
immigration we got to close the freaking
border and vet people but within the
vetting I'm very much uh a musk
perspective we probably need 50 million
migrants just to
survive not a
preference it might be requirement an
actual existential requirement that we
need 50
million now I know you don't like it and
I'm not crazy about it myself unless
they're
vetted if we vet them 50 million is
going to be really really good for the
country if we get the you know best
people from other countries Etc but I
don't think we can do that with Dei I
think as long as Dei is in place you're
not going to get the best people coming
to this country you it's definitely
going to be a little bit of a gating
factor I would
think
um all right so just keep an eye on it
and if I were the Republicans here's
what I would do I would create a do
might use AI that would give a very
maybe three or four point explanation of
what a Democrat is and what a republican
is and I would hand it out to every
migrant I could find now the news would
pick it up and they'd say look what
these damn white supremacists are doing
they're they're giving out these little
leaflets to everybody and it's telling
you what's the difference between a
Republican and a Democrat oh oh and then
they would talk about
it and then the other migrants would
hear about it in the news I don't know
if they're watching a lot of news but
let's say and it would just become a
frame because right now we're we're
allowing the Democrats you know all of
us collectively we're allowing the
Democrats to frame it as of course there
are Democrats and I do think that that
might be persuading people coming in
that they must be Democrats
if the only thing they hear is Democrats
saying hey we're the ones who let you in
be a
Democrat I'd probably sign up if I
didn't know anything else except the
Democrats want me here and the
Republicans are complaining I'd be a
Democrat if it's all I knew and I I'd
probably sign a paper if they put it in
front of me
Etc um yeah and the right the NGS are
probably saying bad things about
Republicans even before before they get
here so suppose somebody gets
here and you hand them a document says
if you're a republican you like God and
families and you no abortion what
whatever you think would get the the
migrant you know people on your
side but because you're the ones who
decide how to frame the other
side yeah you know you just frame them
in the worst possible way and
uh and probably that's enough I mean it
it it would certainly change the
equation in terms of how
enthusiastic were the Democrats about
bringing a new voters if I I think you
could get at least half of them to
register Republican with a little bit of
work yeah and then you use AI to
translate it into as many languages as
you need so if you keep the differences
between Democrat and Republican to let's
say four
items uh one will allow the government
to transition your child to another
gender without telling you just simple
stuff right um and if there's only let's
say four bullet points on each one you
could on one
document you could translate it into you
know 80% of the the languages they
use just use AI wouldn't take you but a
moment um Jonathan turle is talking
about these so-called enhanced sentences
so some of the the January 6 people got
enhanced meaning longer sentences
because there was an argument there was
something about it that made it extra
bad even within the field of crime that
they were alleged to have
committed but I didn't know this that
did you know that uh in a TV interview
at some point wasn't recently but
Justice official uh Michael Sherwin he
said quote our office wanted to ensure
that there was shock and awe meaning
that the sentences were extra stiff
shock and
awe um there was sh it worked because we
saw through the media post that people
were afraid to come back to DC because
they're like if we go there we're going
to get
charged we wanted to take out those
individuals that essentially were
thumbing their noses at the public for
what they
did does any of that sound like
justice
no no that's not even close I can't even
believe he said this out loud can you
believe somebody said that in public
that we charged them you know to make an
example of them
basically well that should be enough
reason to let them all out yeah yeah
have you have you asked yourself what
that day would look
like imagine a trump
Victory imagine he signs the you know
the the whatever document to free them
all and imagine you actually watch the
video of all of them leaving
jail just just hold that in your
mind you just see them all just
streaming out of
jail yeah that if I wouldn't care about
anything else in this election but
that that's the one thing you got to get
right or I don't care about anything
else don't even want to live here if
they stay in jail I don't even want to
live in this country you got to get that
right then we'll talk about taxes and
you know
immigration Wars and stuff very
important but not as important as
this not as important as freeing those
political prisoners that's my number
one that's my number one and and if you
told me um Trump is a a rapist and he
continues to rape people every day I'd
still support him because of just that
one thing there's nothing you could tell
me about
Trump you know whether it's true or not
true that would make me not be willing
to free those prisoners if he's the only
one willing to do
it if nobody else is willing to do it
he's your man and I don't care what else
you say is he a
felon do you think I care do you think
do you think I care if he gets convicted
no I care that he lets the January 6
people out of jail do you think I care
that he didn't do enough about
fenadol I do care but it wouldn't make
any difference in my vote because nobody
else is doing anything either and I
think it's obvious that we want that to
happen we meaning whoever actually runs
the country has decided that they're
that that's an acceptable expense of
lives yeah no there's nothing you can
tell me about
Trump that would make any difference to
my support of him as long as the January
6 is are in jail nothing else matters in
fact if I were running for president I
wouldn't even say anything else I just
say you know what you know what I will
do for president you've already seen it
I'm going to let these guys out in jail
now that would probably only work for
the Republicans right so it probably
wouldn't let him get elected you the
Democrats would say ah you
insurrectionist but yeah if you're if
you on the political right and you put
anything above that
issue I don't know how you do it but
what what is a higher issue than people
who have your opinion being put in
jail that's basically what's happening
there's nothing higher than that
nothing
all right
um you know you thought that Fortran was
an old computer language from the 70s
does anybody remember
Fortran well now there's a new name for
it and wokeness is telling us about a
family that has four children and
they're all TR all four all four kids
are trans
yeah uh let's see let's calculate the
odds odds having one trans kid one in
3,000 according to end
wokeness uh the odds of having four all
four it's not just four but it's all
four 100% it's uh let's see do the math
3,000 to the fourth power that'd be one
187
billion so there's this video of the
very proud parents oh my God are they
proud that they reverse the genders of
all of their
children all four of
them and they're beaming with pride and
they made a video because they're so
proud they'd like you to share in their
Glory
yeah and that's
legal now let's show this story to the
uh the migrants and say
hey if you vote Democrat you can have
this too we can reverse the genders of
all of your children and here's the good
part we don't even have to check in with
you we can do it while they're at
school
literally all right um over 73% of
registered voters think Biden is too old
including 56% of
Democrats and it's a new poll but it's
in line with other polls
and I love the fact that the Democrats
are still pretending there's nothing
wrong we're getting closer and closer to
that Monty Python skit aren't
we that parro is
dead no it's
not now why isn't that more of a
meme all right I challenge you I want
you to find the Monty Python dead parrot
sketch and I want you to use AI to
replace the parrot's head with Joe
Biden's head can do that for me it's all
I ask today just use Ai and do that skit
but it's got to be Biden's head as the
little parrot who's dead well he's dead
no he's
not
now uh I here's a thing that I I think
Trump has figured out which is things
are so absurd that mockery is the only
right answer like defending yourself
would be just stupid
you should just mock how insanely stupid
it is and how they're playing you for
stupid because they're really playing
you for stupid seriously playing you for
stupid all right uh there's a New York
Times Sienna
poll that I think it was Molly Hemingway
was or somebody was I think it was Molly
was pointing out that uh in the past has
been a little skewed Pro
Biden so you'd expect their poll to show
Biden in the best possible
light if they were acting the way
they've acted
before but instead they're showing Trump
would beat Biden 48 to
43 which is pretty healthy margin
because at one point you know I think
they had the same poll you know in Prior
prior election 2020 uh they had a uh
they had Biden up by
14 now of course the final vote was
nothing like that but at the final vote
they still had him up by
nine they had him up by nine on Election
Day all right so you know that they're
seemingly we don't know because we can't
read minds but seemingly they just seem
to be a political pole that is in the
bag for Biden but even they have given
up it looks like a 19point swing since
that you know the biggest biggest sport
they ever showed for Biden 19p Point
swing
so how do you
explain that he's still
there yeah isn't it super obvious that
he can't win under normal
circumstances now here's what's really
fun if it's true as Tucker says that the
elections are all fake and they've been
maybe fake for a long time and that the
CIA or whoever it is can uh control them
any way they want you know for in a
variety of ways they can change laws
about you know the mailing votes they
can they can get Google to be more
biased you there probably A Million Ways
they can do things uh and maybe even
directly with the vote but we don't have
any proof of that um a lot of strong
suspicions and an inability to check by
the way if there's ever
question and the and you're not allowed
to
check you just assume that the election
is rigged so my understanding is that
there's now a still a room full of
ballots that some people said were fake
that the judge simply just doesn't rule
on it to rule whether they can open the
door and look at them now in my opinion
there were there's no way there's still
a bunch of evidence in a room that
hasn't been removed I don't think
there's any chance that that room has
something in it but the fact that they
won't unlock it that's I would consider
that proof that the election is rigged
would
you what what do you consider
proof you know you got your scientific
proof but that doesn't really apply
you've got your legal courtroom proof
but it's not being handled by the court
the courts ignoring it if the cor had
ruled and opened that door in Georgia I
guess is and then we looked you know
maybe there's something there maybe
there isn't but then we would say well
at least the court is doing its Court
thing but if the court refuses to let
you
look just yeah your working assumption
should be oh that's
proof if they won't let you
check that's proof and I think that
should be the
standard so likewise on January 6 the
fact there was so much resistance to
Simply taking a little time to make
sure that's not scientific proof it's
not legal proof but on a working basis
for a citizen trying to understand
what's true that's proof yeah if your
government won't show you something
about an election that's proof it was
rigged I I I think that's a reasonable
definition in the realm of Elections as
to what proof actually means what the
word mean because remember a scientific
proof and a legal proof they're not the
same we use the word
proof different a a math proof is not
the same as a science
proof and a legal proof is not the same
as a math proof or a science proof three
different proofs I believe there is also
a political
proof a political proof is we're not
going to show you even though it's right
here it's right behind behind this door
but we're not going to open it for you
and we're not going to give you a reason
why we won't show
you that's a political
proof anybody
disagree refusing to show you something
that can be shown to you because it's
not
proprietary that's a proof so if you say
it's been proved and you say this is how
I is how I Define it whenever there's a
lack of
transparency from the government
have I ever said this
before citizens are innocent until
proven guilty you don't want to change
that but governments are not citizens
they're entities The Entity is always
guilty until they prove they're not
because all entities will be corrupt if
you can't check everybody knows that if
there's any entity that you can't check
what's going on and there's money
involved or
power of course are
corrupt it's only
transparency it's only
transparency that protects you there's
nothing else not a single other thing
but
transparency we don't have it for the
election and so it was rigged you don't
have to wonder about it that and and by
the way I believe that that standard of
what I'm calling proof you know here I'm
defining my own terms I believe it's as
rigorous as at least the scientific
proof is certainly as
rigorous as a political proof I would I
will not go so far as to say it's as
rigorous as a math proof right that's
hard to beat but certainly science and
the courts are a little bit subjective
even if they try not to be
so yeah you can you can be a little bit
subjective and still make it a proof
there's a standard for that
all right and of course mailin ballots
is pretty much proof of rigging if if if
there's a a a push for mailin ballots
that doesn't seem to fit the situation
like like the need for it is not
demonstrated that that's proof of fraud
in my in my
opinion all right uh the same poll I
think it was that shows Trump winning
Hispanics well
there's a
poll in the real world the United States
in
20124 that has
Trump handily
ahead 46 to
40 with Hispanic
voters now actually yeah with voters
it's not even just Hispanics it's voters
is that
possible let let me make a
prediction I'm going to make the most
radical prediction but I'm not going to
I'm not going to predict it as a
certainty for the first time ever and
only because of the special situation
with Biden falling apart and the Border
being open under that weird special
situation
Trump could win the black vote
outright I'm not going to predict that
as in like a
certainty but it it is on the table now
at the moment it's not close at the
moment it's not close and and by the way
he doesn't have any chance of winning
black women so let me modify that I
believe that Trump could win black men
outright
he doesn't have a chance with black
women you're forgetting the election is
already
decided but let's say in the
polling right let's just say in the
polling I I think you're right that the
actual election is uh almost certainly
certain to be
rigged because I think they always have
been
um but I I think the polling on Election
Day could show that he's winning with
black
men I feel he's one story
away you know one good narrative away
he's not there he doesn't have a
narrative that could make that happen
but you know what he does
have what's he had what what does he
have this time that he never had
before
yeah this time
he's got a
vake this time he's got a
vake and it's really sort of a messaging
challenge right so he's got the
best messaging person of all
time and you know we we laugh about the
sneakers um the sneakers is not nothing
it's not
nothing yeah it's funny that you was so
on the nose it sounds like you know
trying too hard or something but somehow
he pulled it off he actually pulled it
off and here's what I think you're
missing when Trump introduces sneakers
the Democrats say ah he's
pandering is he or is he showing he
understands a segment of the world in a
way that the Democrats
missed I think it shows an
understanding of Black
America yeah on a level that we haven't
seen and I don't mean you know I like
sneakers they like sneakers not that
simple I I think there's a deeper thing
with the the status of
Footwear you know I've heard other
people say um if you can't afford to
have a mansion you know you could have a
little status in your Footwear or your
your your bag you know so it's something
like
that yeah and the Hillary with the H
sauce was just that felt like pandering
but there's something about Trump and
the golden
snakers and the fact that they were huge
success that I'm not even sure I
understand but I feel like that's
there's something deeper than pandering
that's going on there that feels
like feels like understanding some d
dnamic that maybe I don't
understand likewise when Trump says that
his his legal problems could help him
with black voters and then the Democrats
say you racist are you saying that black
people are defined by the legal system
and of course it's nothing like that
it's just do you believe the system is
rigged against
you if you feel like the system is just
obviously right in everybody's face
rigged against you you're going to have
a little bit of feeling of solidarity
with somebody who's also feeling the
system rigged against them can you think
of an example like
that yeah you just saw one I just gave
you one I just told you that my
top political thing is freeing the
January 6
people do you think I would have been
there do you think I would have been
there beaten up a cop destroying
property nope nope no am I am I relating
to the January 6 people because hey I'm
an insurrectionist and they're
insurrectionist
nope am I relating to them because it's
obvious that they were targeted for
being white
mostly yes that's how I relate to them I
relate to them as someone who's been
targeted unfairly by the
system and I relate to that now let's
say let's change all their uh
ethnicities it's mostly mostly white
people in January 6 jail suppose they
were all black how would I feel about it
then would I would I be able to relate
I'd be like ah different problem than my
situation nope same same if if thousands
of black let's say Republicans
had been locked up it's still my number
one
topic because I would still relate to it
I would still relate to it the the color
of their
skin honestly I don't think I thought
once in until today I don't think I
thought once about the fact that the
January Sixers were mostly white they're
not all white they're not all white but
mostly it just wasn't you know that
wasn't the point of compar
the point of comparison is living in a
country where that can happen I don't
want it to happen to them I don't want
it to happen to anybody black ever and I
don't want it to happen to me so that's
that's my point of you know if um you
know if if it ever came down to like a a
physical
Revolution I want on my side the people
who think like
me I don't need on my side the people
look like me I want them to think like
me right then you're on my team you know
when things get
dangerous all
right
um so here's another thing we could mock
so the bid Administration is uh limiting
the natural gas production I guess in
this country but not so much the
drilling of the oil which is interesting
I don't know how they explain it but the
idea is that uh you know Natural Gas
um you know you could find some
substitutes say the green people but
then the Lesser green people say gas is
cleaner than whatever else you're using
at the moment so why wouldn't you use
the cleaner alternative well it turns
out that that analysis is not very
straightforward because when you're
looking at substitutions you can never
know exactly who substitutes what for
what so it's not entirely clear
that limiting natural gas even helps you
for
CO2 because limiting that people might
substitute something worse but they also
might substitute something better and it
might be different in a different
country right so somebody might try
harder to do solar um but somebody else
might just say well I better burn coal
because I don't have time to build me a
solar plant so economists can't really
sort this one out
um I think it's an easy
one I think you sell you sell the uh
natural gas until you got a better
idea to me it seems straightforward but
I would take it from let's say a pure
manager
perspective you know if you knew at the
moment it was better than the
Alternatives I'd probably do it and try
to figure out something
later um but here's my question since
you cannot use math and economics to
support limiting natural gas because
it's a questionable proposition
economically and even CO2 wise would you
say that the Biden Administration is
following the
science their their entire thing is
follow the
science so don't you think that they owe
us a an
analysis perhaps a model for climate
change they like to use models they
should produce a model they should here
we are cutting the cutting the natural
gas and here you can see how this
follows through to reducing you know
this line on
co2 if that's their argument and their
whole deal is you got to be compatible
with science why don't we hold them to
their own standard and make them
compatible with
science well it's because they've been
gaslighting and they've never been
compatible with science because you know
what is not a science
models everybody who thinks that a a
projection model is science has really
been
brainwashed it's closer to the opposite
yeah um do do you think that I could
create a model or here's a challenge for
you would you bet a million
dollars against my claim that I can
create a model that will predict the GDP
of America in 10
years so that's my claim I can create a
prediction model that'll hit the GDP of
America 10 years from now on this on the
same
dat who would bet against
me it's easy do you want me to tell you
how I could do it easily and I know
you're thinking hey nobody can predict
the future like that I I could create a
model that I would bet a million dollars
will be right do you know how I do it I
would create a thousand
models every one of them would be you
know off by a tenth of a percentage
point and then I would give you all
thousand models and I'd say in 10 years
I'm going to tell you which one of those
was
right and then I'm going to claim that I
created a model that predicted it and
you know what it would be
true because that would be the model you
had it for 10 years I'm pointing to it
it's the exact number that is the you
know
reality there you go now you're saying
but Scott that's not like climate change
models no it is that's how they do it
you didn't know how they do it they have
hundreds of models and they do something
called hind casting which is making sure
that it would have worked if it had
existed in the past up to today do you
know how they do that they make so many
models the some of them by coincidence
will be in the range of what is reality
and then they tell you and here's the
big scam that therefore it can predict
the
future nope think about my thousand
models about the GDP one of them was
right can it predict the fure
future no it wasn't right because it was
right it was right because there were a
thousand of them and one was was going
to be pretty close I threw away
everything that wasn't you know within
that range of something it could have
been how many of you did not
know that you can make the models do
anything including match the past it has
no predictive value none yeah some of
you do it but if you don't if you don't
do this for a living or you don't listen
to somebody like me who did it for a
living which is projecting the future as
funny as that is um you would never know
you if you're an ordinary person you
don't know that a metaanalysis is
usually fake you don't know that a
observational study shouldn't be trusted
at all you wouldn't know that peer
reviewed means coin flip doesn't mean
anything
it's just a coin flip yeah yes no about
50% so anyway um here's another funny
thing that axios is treating the weather
the way they treat
Trump they're treating the weather
they're reporting on the weather the
same way as
Trump so you know how they're uh the the
left leing people are covering
Trump what they're not not saying is
that his policies from his first term
were bad have you noticed that wh which
of his first term policies are they
railing against oh we don't want to do
that again none there's not even a
single policy that they oppose which of
his new proposed policies are they
saying are a bad
idea uh I can't think of
any well you know but abortion is
settled it's going to the states that's
not even a trump issue in my opinion you
know you could federalize it but
nobody's going to do it I don't think
it's going to get
federalized so instead what did they do
about Trump well first of all they're
trying to Gaslight you that he's the one
with dementia I love that
one right yeah he's the one with
dementia do you have any names uh I
forget when I'm just doing my podcast
here how many times have you heard me
try to remember like the name of the
Speaker of the House or something like
really easy names and I'll be like what
what's that name and then you'll say it
in the comments I'll go oh yeah a I'll
just like forget names it's very common
when you're talking about politics do
you do you know how many names that
Trump has had to remember in his life
the people he's
met is is like an insane number of
people to not hundreds it's
thousands it it's way over hundreds
probably the PE the number of people he
would need to remember would be I don't
know 8 to 10,000 or something just crazy
numbers but here's what axio says about
the the weather February's extreme
weather event uh did some bad things
what do they call Trump extreme
Mega because there's nothing wrong with
the mega so you call it
extreme what was wrong with the
weather well apparently the cold weather
doesn't really match the whole global
warming thing you know even though I
know climate change could be Extremes in
either direction but it doesn't f fit
the narrative so well so they just say
it's
extreme they're actually insulting the
weather the same way they're insulting
Trump because they don't have a better
thing to
say
extreme if they start saying that the
weather is
chaotic or possibly white
supremacist I guess that's where we're
heading that weather have you noticed
that the
snow always
white yeah yeah the snow is too white
and too
extreme yep they only have one set of
things to
say and I have a prediction my
prediction is if it rains hard on
Election Day X year will report it as a
coup all
right that's my joke of the day they'll
reported as a coup because they can't
tell the difference between the weather
and Trump because they're both
extreme all right
uh I have a challenge and a question for
you um so our debt is approaching 35
trillion we're adding a trillion every
100 days or
so and
how do we survive
that I don't
know because the problem's been around
long enough where people would at least
be mentioning potential
Solutions because I've never seen
one and here's my
challenge I want to see Jamie
Diamond or Bill Amman and I pick them
because they're
credible I would call them reasonably
Centrist but Democrat I think they're
both Democrat but reasonably Centrist
and experts at
finance and I want them to explain to
the rest of us how in any scenario we're
not
doomed in any scenario because I'm not
aware of one I honestly can't think of
anyway we're not
doomed so have you ever heard have you
ever seen Jamie Diamond say look there
is a way out you'd have to let's say cut
government 20% you'd have to get GDP up
to six you know which would be crazy at
the same time you'd have to you know
you'd have to manage inflation so maybe
you'd want more than usual but that cuts
into your debt a little bit so if you do
these three things you might be able to
you know reduce the rate of growth
enough that we can
survive don't you want to see
that how about Warren
Buffett can Warren Buffett explain to
the the public oh yeah there is a way
out it would be very very hard but if we
do the hard things we can actually do it
I don't think there's a hard
path I believe there's
none I believe there's none and the
smartest people even the ones who are in
the same team you know in theory as the
administration even they can't tell you
any kind of scenario in which we
survive which makes me wonder if there
is a secret
plan do you think there's a secret
plan because I'm trying to think of what
would be big enough to pay off our
natural
debt well
how
about if we put Russia out of the energy
business and then we took their market
share you got really quiet didn't
you what if the Ukraine
war is the only way we can pay off our
debt in other words there's no way that
the normal growth of the economy will
pay it off but but if we just owned
energy we just owned it you know you
couldn't even buy energy unless you're
buying it from us you know maybe other
people too but you definitely have to
get it from us too there just isn't
enough if we owned
Russia and we owned their gas
station we could probably pay off the
debt with GDP growth you know we would
be robbing Russia to do it I mean
literally we'd be robbing them
but you need a lot of money and actually
I'm not even sure if Russia has
enough would that even be
enough if Russia stopped spending money
on itself and just gave it all to us I
don't think it's
enough
right how about the growth of the robot
economy will we go to a super cycle in
which um the robot growth is so big it's
bigger than cars bigger than computer
computer is bigger than the internet
maybe
might but would that be enough to get us
under debt I don't know again can Elon
Musk explain to us in the best case
scenario if we mine an asteroid and
robots are big and AI is big is that
enough I think not probably
not and I wonder that the real play is
that the government knows that money is
going to go
away I wonder if the real play is that
the people who really know what's going
on think that our money will just go
away and they'll just be crypto or
something else or we don't need money or
the government gives us a coupon or
something I know but uh certainly like
the know the answer that all right uh
Gaza is a mess um
and the US is helping out we dropped 66
bundles air dropped uh of 38,000
meals we dropped into Gaza on the beach
there 38,000
meals there are over a million people
starving and they probably need more
than one meal a day to be
healthy is this just are we just trying
to make it look like we're doing
something I mean I'm glad we're doing
something
but and then I also don't understand why
would you give them food in Gaza how
does that even make sense is isn't the
entire thing that Israel is trying to
accomplish is to drain out all the
citizens so they can kill whatever's
left and then someday people can go
back shouldn't you put 100% of the food
just under the city limits and say fre
food you just have to come here to get
it and then do what they need to when
everybody's out the city
so I don't know war is terrible there's
yeah everybody's bad that's that's my
everybody's bad I'll just keep it at
that well the number that the uh Hamas
puts out for the death toll is at 30,000
we should not believe numbers like that
because it's coming from a sketchy
Source but but I remind you that all
numbers come from sketchy sources all of
them and we do come to believe some even
if they're not
true um so I think this 30,000 number as
non-credible as it is is going to enter
our Consciousness as the narrative and
they're pushing hard and I think they
can push it hard enough to enter it as
the narrative at 30,000 if it becomes a
narrative again not the truth truth but
simply what people imagine is the
truth
um that that will completely destroy the
uh I know reputation of Israel for
generations
and I think the rest of the world will
call it genocide what do you think now
again I'm not giving you my
opinion uh I'm saying that under this
situation that that number of people in
that short at a time on that size of a
population for these conditions you know
this situation I believe that most of
the world the majority will come to see
this death toll as the real one even if
it isn't and because that they will come
to see it as a
genocide I don't think there's anything
that worse that could happen for
Israel's reputation so I'm not sure how
they navigate
it um I'm just pointing out that they
most important asset which is the
Goodwill of other countries um is
largely gone and makes you wonder how
that's going to work
out now again that's not my opinion you
know I'm not I'm not criticizing Israel
because my take on it is you could
criticize them all day long but they're
going to do what they're going to do and
you don't have to love it but you're not
going to stop
it all right
um that ladies and
gentlemen is my fantastic Funday Sunday
show and uh whoa ran long I didn't even
know that thanks for joining on the
xplatform and on Rumble and on the
racist YouTube channel uh I'll see you
