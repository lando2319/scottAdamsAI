oh hello
don't look at that yet
don't look at that yet
good morning everybody
and welcome to the highlight of
civilization
that's right
you made it again and it will be
glorious today
well we all woke up to some uh
let's say a plot twist
plot twist
we'll talk about that and all the things
but before we get to the obvious news of
the day about the supreme court
how would you
like to take your experience up to
i don't know
levels that have never been seen in the
history of humanity
i think you would why wouldn't you
really
and all you need is a copper mug or a
glass a tank or a tanker a tanker
chelsea cyanide canteen jugger flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine of the day
the thing that's going to make
everything amazing especially this live
stream is called the simultaneous sip go
now if you're using a tankard
as opposed to a cup or a mug or
a stein
make sure it's not one of those russian
tankards
because i hear they blow up really
easily
well because i know you're all here to
talk about the supreme court leak
i'm gonna start with something else just
to make sure everybody's
found us
there's a cool story about a
startup
called cosmic
that creates these little prefab homes
that they make the parts
so that they lay flat on a flatbed truck
so they're easy to transport and then
you get there and you slap it together
it comes with its own
solar battery and solar power
and the entire thing is
completely energy self-sufficient it
still has to connect to the plumbing and
sewer
but otherwise you just ship it in slap
it together everything's ready to go and
you do a little assembling on plant but
you don't even need a big crane
now is this company in this particular
home going to be the thing that changes
everything well who knows
but
one thing i can say for sure is that
however well we could make a kit home in
the 50s because remember i think sears
made homes you could make yourself
but i think they mostly just sent you
the wood and the nails and said here's
some instructions and how to put this
together
essentially
whereas the new stuff imagine modern
engineering so in the factory is
basically robots right so the robots
will assemble in the factory
it fits neatly on trucks and then it's
easy to assemble in the field
this is by far
i think
between between robots
yeah i guess it'd be a toss-up between
robots and
self-driving cars and these little pre
prefab homes i think those are going to
be three of the biggest industries in
the future
and i don't know what would stop them
you know those those are things which
you can see coming pretty clearly these
self-driving cars that's guaranteed
someday
and these these pre prefab
kit homes that are made in factories by
robots
pretty much guaranteed because the
economics of it will be insane
um all right
so that's the good news i think housing
will be fixed and i always i always
thought
that walls should be made of mostly
glass
it looks like these prefab things have
mostly glass walls but they use this
really thick glass so it's insulated
i always thought that was the obvious
way to go all right
um
let's talk about the big news of the day
so there's a politico is running a story
that there is a leaked draft opinion
that suggests that the supreme court
will be ruling that abortion is no
longer
protected right at the federal level
which some people
say makes abortion illegal
but it's an indirect thing basically it
would bump it to the states
and about half the states
are poised to make it illegal
so it would be half illegal in the
country half legal
some states
so that's what's happening now here's
the thing
uh do you believe
that this is the first ever
leak by the supreme court
does that sound that would be amazing
right so that's the story the thing that
makes it a big story in part
not just the topic of it which is huge
but in part there's such a
break with
the the core thing that keeps the
country together which is the supreme
court in my opinion
and it would be such a
such a departure from the credibility
they've enjoyed up until now if in fact
this leak is real
so
is it real
so cnn reported it this way that
politico is reporting it's that they've
confirmed it but cnn has not
so cnn has not confirmed it has anyone
else confirmed it
just politico
here's my first question
question number
one has politico ever run any stories as
true
that later turned out to be
hoaxes
have they ever covered anything that was
a hoax as if it were true
is that a thing
or has politico been one of the few that
got everything right
what do you think
and and if they got something wrong
i'm not saying they did i'm no expert on
what they have or have not said
but
it is
it seems that they have maybe like
everybody i doubt there's any major
publication
that is not at one time in the last six
years covered a major story as true only
to later find out it was a hoax
probably all of them i i would think
you know some more than others
so
the first thing you need to know is that
if something is
like a remarkable claim
what what's what's the carl sagan
um saying
uh remark is not remarkable but like
incredible claims requiring credible
proof sort of thing
how's he say it
extraordinary extraordinary claims
require extraordinary proof this would
be an extraordinary claim wouldn't it
because it'd be the first time that the
supreme court had a leak
and it happens to be the biggest topic
of all time
i mean i suppose that's what you would
expect a leak to be about
but it'd be kind of remarkable if it's
true
kind of extraordinary you might say
so one would expect that the quality of
the evidence or proof of its existence
would also be extraordinary
what do we have so far
a publication
that is similar to other publications
and that sometimes they get it right and
sometimes they get it wrong
now that has to be considered
it's a 98 page document
and it's written with such detail
that one would imagine it could not be
easily faked
sort of like the steele dossier
so many things in there that even if a
few of them were fake
wow there's so much of it
right if you're going to do a hoax
that's how you do it
you know you wouldn't bother trying to
do a hoax with a like a
with the cliff notes
right so it's either
it's either a hoax done with you know
great completeness or it's not now one
possibility
is that it's a real document
but it's not based on a real vote
that's actually possible
that the the thing could be genuinely
authored to be exactly what it looks
like
but not yet based on a vote it could
have been it could have been written in
anticipation of one
it could have been written to see what
one would look like
you know if you voted this way
could you back it up
could you make an argument that the
country would read and say
you know some of the country would read
and say i hate this
but
at least they backed it up
so
i can tell you that i've written
documents that were drafts
that you wouldn't know they weren't real
if you saw them
they were just me getting my thinking
together that's the thing people who
write arguments for things i used to do
this for a living right business cases
you know argue that some money should be
spent in a certain way
and if you do that it's not unusual that
you write a draft opinion and then you
look at it you say huh
i thought this would be a stronger case
so maybe i won't go forward with this
right so one possibility is it's a real
document but it's not connected to a
real vote
here
here uh are some things that should be
considered
what would a hoax look like number one
we all expected a hoax right
um
you you've seen you've seen me say it
you've seen greg gutfeld say it
i think a number of people said it on
on social media at this point that we
expect
if history is our guide
we expect that the democrats would come
up with a new hoax
that would be a big one
i mean russia collusion is such a big
claim
that's so big
that that a candidate or president
colluded with russia that's such a big
claim that you say to yourself well that
couldn't be untrue nobody would make a
claim that big
but it's also the size of the claim
that's suspicious isn't it
because those are the ones that you can
sell
it's
isn't this wasn't this nazi propaganda
that are not propaganda but part of
their technique was the bigger the lie
the more likely people will believe it
small lies people go yeah maybe maybe
not but if it's a gigantic lie about a
huge story that's just shocking
people will say oh that must be true
they couldn't say it if it unless it
were true
so the size of it
should be their first flag right that
doesn't mean it's not true
but
isn't the timing and the size of it kind
of suspicious
especially when it's exactly what we
expected and exactly well about when
we'd expect it right
so if you're going to do a perfect hoax
you would first of all pick an emotional
trigger
why does that matter
why does it matter that a hoax if you
were if you were designing a hoax
why does it matter that would have a
strong emotional trigger
because
it will make you overlook the
possibility it's a hoax
the stronger your emotional connection
to it the more the less likely
you're going to be looking into the
truth of it you're just going to say my
god
something has to be done and you're
gonna
leap immediately into some kind of
action
tweeting or complaining or
something
but you're not gonna be doing a lot of
thinking it just totally bypasses your
your thinking so the abortion question
is unique
among questions
it's sort of like the holocaust and that
the the very mention of it just just
puts us on a 10 out of 10 in terms of
emotional connection
mom perfect hoax
bypasses your rational faculties
with an emotional trigger
it also is helpful if it's impossible to
debunk
do you know what would be impossible to
debunk
did the russians really tell you that
did that really happen in russia years
ago
basically impossible to debunk now i'll
say impossible
for hyperbole
yeah i suppose you could do it
but very difficult
now let me ask you this
does the supreme court ever make
statements about their inner workings
under any condition
i feel like we would have heard
something from them if they did
i feel as if it's their standard
to never make a public statement
so if you were going to hide
the place to hide it is somewhere where
somebody can't talk
if they did talk you wouldn't believe
them russia
right
so
putting the russia collusion uh hoax in
in a russian
let's say uh
hidden box
means you can't really confirm it or
deny it you put it into the supreme
court inner workings and
what a coincidence there's not a
coincidence it's the one kind of story
that you can't confirm huh
or or maybe maybe the supreme court will
fool us and actually come out and say
it's real or it's not
if it's real could they say it
not if they haven't voted
am i wrong
if they haven't voted i'm pretty sure
they're not going to comment at all if
there's any vote to be had
i don't even know what the case is
is there even a case they're looking at
or can they just
revisit things they've looked at in the
past just because they want to
i mean isn't it
is there something wrong with the story
that the ruling is not connected to a
specific case or at least
the reporting doesn't connect it to a
case
so he says the case was in february
and it was from mississippi
okay
was that the one where the
there's a girl or a woman gave herself
an abortion is that the one
because
when i'm reading the headlines there's
some somewhat of a disconnect now is
that just speculation
it could be speculation that those are
connected right
i guess it's all speculation at this
point
all right
um
and here's the best part
a good hoax
would still work after it's debunked
because that's how everything works the
fake news still works after it's been
debunked because the
the people who debunk it are not
connected in any way to the people who
need to see it debunked
the only people who ever see the debunk
are the ones who didn't believe it was
true in the first place
right so
have the democrats seen the fine people
hoax debunked
no but pretty much every republican has
have they seen the drinking bleach hoax
debunked no
but pretty much every republican has
right so debunking something doesn't
really change its value
so some people said to me but scott
we will know for sure
by before election day whether this is
true or not because they would release
their
any kind of rulings would be released
before then
does it matter
it won't
you say to yourself ish of course it'll
matter because we'll know if it's fake
news or real news by then
nope if it's fake news and we find out
in july
it's already done everything you need it
to do because people will have a trauma
in their minds of what could happen
if
republicans keep electing people or keep
putting people on the supreme court
right
so
the the psychological impact of it would
be completely the same
even if it gets debunked with complete
certainty by the supreme court itself
now if the supreme court debunks it
in a clean statement this did not happen
or
or it was a draft and it's not connected
to a vote
even if it was that clean like oh god
that's true
it still wouldn't matter
because people's minds would have
experienced it as true and they wouldn't
want to repeat it by having it actually
true in the future
right so you would create an
impossibility for them to
reverse it because they'd lived through
the trauma of it once and it was so bad
that that they're just super triggered
now for anything that would actually be
real
now the other thing i didn't write on
the list because i was hastily preparing
this is that it's it's really on the
nose isn't it
what are the odds
that the timing is perfect
for the political cycle
it was exactly what we expected
well let's say
we expected a large hoax like a really
large one
right around now
and here it is
can't be confirmed it's exactly the most
emotional question that would get people
to the polls
and take all of the focus off the other
things
for which biden is losing badly
it's a little too perfect
i'm sorry
it's a little too perfect
so
how long would it take us to know if
it's true
somebody says an actual leak would do
the same damage true
true
but keep in mind there's never been an
actual leak
correct me if i'm wrong but in the
history of the supreme court it's never
happened
so the odds of this being the first one
on one hand it would seem low if you
compare it to history
on the other hand there's nothing like
roe versus wade and nothing like
2022
and nothing like the fake news of today
there's not yeah we're in a whole new
situation
so yeah i i suppose if if ever there
were going to be a leak
you'd imagine it could happen now but
that's also what's too perfect right
this is exactly that the environment in
which you imagine this could be the
first time there would be a leak
and then it happens
could be because we're all so smart we
saw it coming hey this is the
environment that would cause something
like that or it's a little too on the
nose
somebody says just read the opinion it's
not fake
that's how they get you
all right let me let me state the
criticism the criticism is i think it's
a 98-page opinion it has the depth
and credibility of a real opinion
so i think we can stipulate that
so i will stipulate
that has the look
of an actual real opinion
and the experts who have looked at it so
far
appear to be
on the same side that it looks real
that doesn't mean it's based on a vote
that's the first thing
and it doesn't mean that you couldn't
fake that
you could
because first of all
i don't believe the justices write their
own opinions do they
or do they have them drafted by their
clerks
and then they edit them
in other words would you be able to run
here's and here's a question for you
would you be able to run a
a writing analysis on it
to know who the author was
the answer is yes
yes you could do a writing analysis on a
98 page opinion and you would know with
a high degree of certainty who wrote
that damn thing
now if it's a mixture of writing i think
it would pick that up too
i think it would pick up
parts of the clerks to the to the degree
we know who the clerks are and we know
their prior writings i think we probably
would
so if you could find the clerks
and alito's prior writing
and you could
yeah and why elito
right
um
somebody says alito probably has enough
publicly written to have an ai write it
i doubt an ai could pull it off
uh you need somebody who is maybe
experienced with that kind of writing
you know but also
maybe it was starting with an ai maybe
the ai could give you the first draft
but i think the ai can't quite pull off
a
a long-form hoax i think an a i could
fool you with a tweet
because in short
i doubt it could pull off a long-form
hoax
yet
but it will be
uh you know
and who knows
we could be well beyond the point where
they can do it and we wouldn't
necessarily know it you and i wouldn't
know it
so i'm gonna so here's my uh
my most likely opinion meaning if i had
to bet on it
which i wouldn't want to because it's
still fog of war anything could be true
if i had to bet on it i would say that
the writing is real-ish
meaning that
alito's hand was part of it but that's
not based on a vote
that's what i think
i think it's
somebody may have
may have leaked it
i think that's possible
but there are also other possibilities
which is just completely made up and
just fed to politico
all right
how many of you
uh came into this live stream assuming
this was definitely real
and have now been convinced that there's
at least a possibility it's not real
how many of you got your minds changed
in the last five minutes
at least to the possibility that it's a
hoax we don't know i mean if i told you
it's definitely a hoax that would be
going way too far
i would just say it fits perfectly the
profile of a hoax
so
one of the reasons that you watch
this live stream
is because i predict
and i predict things based on you know
specific
frames and techniques
so this particular prediction is based
on the the hoax identifier pattern if i
could make up a name for it
it's based on the fact that hoaxes look
exactly like this
doesn't mean it's a hoax
so let me be as clear as possible
because if it turns out to be true
then people are going to say oh adam
said it was a hoax how would i know
it would be it would be literally insane
or
stupid
to say that i know it's a hoax at this
point
at this point but
just just appreciate the fact
that it hits every note for a hoax every
note
and it doesn't hit every note for real
how about how about that
it hits every note for a hoax
but it doesn't hit every note for real
there are a couple of notes that are off
one of the notes is
the first ever leak
huh
right the timing
now how on the nose it is huh
right so there's a whole bunch of stuff
that's like it's sort of close to the
nail
but the hoax one fits perfectly
there's nothing there's nothing that
isn't perfectly fit for the hoax but for
the reality you've gotta you've gotta
you've gotta push things a little bit
you gotta say okay
it's because the topic is so
controversial
that's why it's the first ever leak
totally possible but you see how you
have to nudge things a little bit to
make that fit
it could be real
so let's let's keep that as a
possibility
all right here's what people are saying
about it
mike cernovich
says leaking this is a tweet from him
leaking a draft scotus ruling is worse
than january 6. i don't know if it's
worse than watergate yet
we need to get somebody on that
but anyway it's worse than january 6.
the court was the one institution where
conservatives and liberals lived in
peace and trust
you disagreed but the trust was sacred
this completely destroys the court's
inner workings
totally in shock right now now i have to
say that i think people who have a legal
background
and cernovich would be in that category
probably are more shocked than other
people
so i'm a little less shocked
meaning that i don't think this destroys
the court's
credibility
um
because we don't know if it's real we
don't know
and if this were leaked that's really
one person it's unlikely that
the justice leaked it right it's more
likely it's a clerk or
somebody who got a hold of it somehow
scott is trying to set up to win either
way
shouldn't i
you say that like is a bad thing i'm
trying to set things up so i win either
way you should take that as your role
model not it that's not something you
criticize
you should say damn good job scott are
you setting this up so you win either
way you should be impressed by that that
should not be something you're
criticizing i mean if you did it i'd be
impressed
but
i'm guessing from your comment you
wouldn't be able to do such a thing
just saying
all right
um so i'm a little less shocked i don't
think it destroys the credibility of the
the court
if anything it would be on one person
probably and if that one person is
identified
and
let's say there there's a
repercussions
then i would still be okay with the
system
you know i would say okay you know you
don't expect the system to be perfect
but you do want it to be self-correcting
and if it self corrects
which seems highly likely if this is a
real leak
i would just say i would expect some
self-correction
right this would definitely affect the
political cycle but not as much as the
actual ruling
right
so if this turns out to be true
then it doesn't have any political
impact
do you understand that
if it's true
there's no political impact
because we would know the actual ruling
well before the election
it's the actual ruling that would have
the political impact the the rumor of it
is
foreshadowing but
it's the ruling that would be the the
problem right
so
anyway
um
what else are people saying about this
yeah i guess the next thing i want to
know is what the supreme court's policy
is on commenting
because even if they even if the supreme
court has a policy on not commenting
you think that they would want to
comment on this one
am i right
uh you could disagree with this one i
think pretty easily that even if they're
even if they had a long standard of
never commenting this might be the one
they would comment now here's how i
would here's how i would do it if i were
them
you don't want to say a ruling is true
or not true like you don't want to say
it was written or not written
but here's what you could say
to the best of our knowledge there have
been no links
right
to the best of our knowledge there have
been no leaks
if they made that statement would you
say
would you say that that's sort of a
break with the past it would be
but it'd be kind of just
a steady state statement
it would be the very unprovocative
to the best of our knowledge there have
been no links
right
or or they could say
there's
there's something bad that might have
happened we're looking into it
right
but yeah i think they could do those two
things
without destroying you know any
precedent about commenting or anything
like that it's just such a unique case i
think people would understand if they
had a unique reaction to it
um i'm seeing the
i'm seeing in social media that
people claiming that 70 of the country
in some polls
are in favor of abortion in some form
does that sound true
70
and no i'm not on mushrooms but thanks
for asking
it doesn't sound like it doesn't sound
true
because i think the lower numbers are
the high 50s right
somewhere in the high 50s to 70 percent
so it's kind of convenient that the pro
abortion
people are using the higher number but
you'd expect they would
now yet and you all understand that the
supreme court does nothing but kick the
decision to this individual states right
so the individual states will
probably stay about what they are
um or at least they've already signaled
which way they're going to go so it's
about half
so that there's this swath in the middle
of the country
from you know texas up that's like solid
uh solid anti-abortion and then the two
coasts are pro-abortion
and then there's this other sliver that
goes north to south
uh with some of the western states
so
here's what i predicted long ago would
happen
there will be apps
that let you go from a state that
doesn't allow it to a state that does
allow it
and you'll be able to set up your whole
transportation and everything probably
through volunteers
because the biggest the biggest issue if
you have to go from a state that doesn't
allow it to a state that does would be
the cost of transportation
and the cost of housing because let's
say you would have gotten the procedure
no matter what state you were in
so that part's the same
so don't you think that they will
they'll spring up a
you know underground railroad of
volunteers who say look once a week
once a week i'll drive from texas to the
closest neighboring state
where it's legal and i'll take as many
people in my minivan
and i won't even charge you because i
believe in this cause or something
and
and you can stay at my house
i think it's going to happen so i'm not
sure that it will make that much
difference and how many abortions happen
you know it might not you we may be
surprised at how quickly things adapt if
in fact that
case actually came down that way
so did you know or do you remember that
as we're looking at all this january 6
protest and slash insurrection
alleged insurrection
that the democrats protested quite
vigorously when trump got elected do you
remember that
you know i didn't really remember that
because it seemed like just business as
usual
but joel pollock had a tweet with a
video showing those protests there were
pretty pretty vigorous protests saying
that they didn't recognize the elected
president
and
there was even a commercial done by
celebrities
urging
the electoral
the electoral college
folks to not vote for trump even though
the votes were in that direction
so
that watching the the level of hypocrisy
in this
is just it just makes your head explode
and of course everybody can get away
with it because the public is so
underinformed
you know i would put myself in
top five percent
of well-informed people about the
headlines you know because i do this
every day so if i'm not in the top five
percent i'm certainly doing something
wrong
but even in the top five percent i'd
kind of forgotten the democrats also
protested the legitimacy of trump and
you know tried to try to overturn it
with their at least persuasion
there was no violence and that was the
difference
there were some folks who were violent
and of out of the many protesters on
january 6 but probably there were no
actual violent people
and the democrats were were protesting
and that has to be
has to be different
but how many democrats are going to see
surrounding the supreme court because of
this leak
we've already seen it right it looks
very insurrectiony
and it's it's going to be a trouble for
the january 6 committee who's trying to
sell that as
as a big ol insurrection if if the news
is just showing the democrats doing it
right now
you know
surrounding a government building and
acting
threatening
well let me give you an update on uh my
dilbert comic that will get me canceled
uh dave the engineer so this is day two
of a week-long series in which i
introduced the first
regular character
into the dilbert universe will be a
black engineer
now the joke the running joke is that
the pointy hair boss
had orders from above to improve
diversity
and so he hired dave thinking it would
improve diversity
but dave is thwarting him
by identifying as white
and he can't be talked out of it now
later in the week we will discover
whether dave is a prankster
or he actually
that's the way he wants to identify
now what what do you imagine would be
the blowback i'm getting
from introducing this new black
character into dilbert okay just take a
guess
what do you think would be the
complaint
and by the way i guess it was banned in
the new york daily news and at least one
major chain of multiple papers so not
every newspaper is running it
racist no you're wrong
you're wrong
i thought that people were going to
accuse me of being a racist
they accused me of being anti-trans
now
let me be clear
the comic doesn't
touch on that topic in any way directly
or indirectly or even by analogy
it's not an indirect reference to trans
it's not a direct reference
it doesn't even it didn't even remind me
of trans
i i the first time i read it i was like
well are they talking about me
that's right the biggest group of
complainers
are complaining that it's really a story
about trans people identifying
but it's not
it's literally about
people also
under our current rules of wokeness do
have the ability to identify as they
please
both in terms of ethnicity
you know cultural identification
whatever
and as well as
gender related things
so
how is this about trans
now other people had a separate
complaint
and it was this was interesting they
said oh why are you trying to hear
credit
effectively i'm paraphrasing why are you
trying to get credit or act like this is
wonderful when you haven't had a black
character in the strip for 33 years
you know why why do you think that
you're awesome because you're doing that
33 years without a single black
character in the main the main cast
and now now you put one in after 33
years and you want a little credit
do you know what my response to that was
this is the reason i haven't
done it for 33 years because somebody is
going to try to cancel me for the wrong
reason
in this case it looks like the trans
community is coming after me
tell me in the comments have you ever
seen a better friend to the lgbtq
community than me
i mean seriously
i i'm as pro-lgbtq
pro-trans as you could possibly be
there's nobody on the left of me on that
nobody and still that is probably why
i'll get canceled
do you know i'll get cancelled because i
did a cartoon in which i tried to
improve diversity exactly as people
would like me to do
you can't win
that's why
the reason there was never a black
character
is because you not you
you're all also i'll talk about the
world
is because the world sucks
and they wouldn't let me do it and i
just proved it i had to wait until i was
so you money down at close to
retirement that i don't give a if i
get canceled
i had to wait until it didn't matter
that's the only way i could do it
because of
the critics
so don't complain to me and then ask me
why i didn't already do it it's
because you're complaining to me
and you're asking newspapers not to run
it is it theoretical
is it theoretical that
newspapers will not run it no they're
not running it right now they're
not running it
it's not theoretical
i can't introduce a black character with
really harmless characteristics
completely harmless he's actually his
characteristic is he's playful
that's it
an actual positive attribute
and i can't even get away with
that all right so if all of you
not you the people watching this were
kind of awesome
but if all the is complaining
want to complain you are the reason
you're the problem
let me be clear about that the people
who are complaining are the
problem so fix yourself
and then everything else will be fine
because i already want to put diversity
in the cast why would i not want that
now here's another reason that it was
always hard to do it in the past and you
won't believe this one
this was weird
the newspapers don't all print in color
during the week
a lot of them are still black and white
so the only way you know that this new
character was actually black or intended
to be by the author is that he was
colored black
but a number of the papers are running
it and he's white
just like all the other characters
because none of them have color
so for them they're getting an entirely
different comic it went to in which it
looks like a white guy
was intended by the boss to identify as
black but he doesn't want to because
he's white it's a whole different comic
now
what if i had
uh done something to indicate that even
in the black and white version
this character was black
what would that look like
like would i put like hashtag shading
and i don't ever do that on a shook you
know he's indian born in india
indian-american
and
you know i don't i don't cross-hatch him
or put dots there to show his
nobody cares about that
so my point is
already made so i don't have to say it
again
aren't you glad
all right
uh dinesh d'souza's
provocative film is coming out really
soon i think and i i saw a tweet from
somebody who saw it
and this was his character
characterization and i'm
sort of paraphrasing his
characterization so you should all go
watch it
because i i think
i think it's going to be big news
uh in a few days i think it's out
and
so one person's characterization was it
doesn't prove there was fraud in the
election
but it makes such a strong case
uh and their the individual
evidence looks strong
and it also lays out a path
which would allow one let's say the
government to investigate whether or not
these claims are true
so it shows you the base for which there
is great suspicion
a lot of coincidences and some actual
people confessing
so apparently the film has people
confessing
that they that they did some stuff with
uh mail and ballots
but not enough of them collectively
even if their confessions were real and
their crimes were real not enough of
them to prove
the extent of it that would change the
election result
so the claim is
that these individual cases are proven
or high credibility let's say
and all you need to do is do more of
them
you just have to find more of these same
people and get them also to confess
uh and you'd have your answer
now i don't know how hard it would be to
get extra people but
so that that's but the uh
the fun of this is that i guess uh
d'souza is laying out a pretty clean
path
for how you could know for sure
at least in terms of the mail-in ballots
at least in terms of i think five states
were where something
something unexpected happened we don't
know if it was illegal
hasn't been proven
but something unexpected happened in
terms of who won those areas
all right uh boris johnson is uh
looking to
spin up a new nuclear power station in
great britain once a year
uh instead of a new one every decade
we're going to build one every year
says boris johnson
how in the world
did this topic get so reversed in one
year
now
i guess it took climate change plus
russia
to turn off you know potentially turn
off the gas to europe i guess it took
all of that and then suddenly nuclear is
just wonderful and you know it's just
all positive and let's build them as
fast as we can
and it's almost like we forget
that we were ever against it we meaning
you don't even really see any
anti-nuclear stuff on social media
anymore
think about that
think about the fact that you know i can
tweet this now
and i don't know
five years ago
the comments would be full of but what
about the nuclear waste which is a
problem that's been solved for a long
time
and there would be you know what about
the danger which is a problem that's
been solved for a long time when i say
solve there's nothing that's zero risk
but you know well within the
you know the reasonable range for
everything
and i think people have actually been
now educated thanks to again michael
schellenberger mark schneider and a lot
of you
that
this is another perfect example of that
power shift
i feel like
i feel like this was smart people in the
public
advocates
educating the public to the point where
the politicians were then allowed to
make this decision
so it made it safe basically that the
public was informed enough that invade
is safe to go this direction and so they
are to their credit
they finally are
all right here's a tweet that i tweeted
that some people loved and
some people are still thinking about and
some people hate it
and some people asked what kind of drugs
i was on
because they wanted to take some too
alright so
listen to this tweet and then i'll i'll
go over it right
so it's got a few parts
it starts this way i said space time is
a closed loop
doesn't it does it make sense that time
is infinite
and it has a beginning and an end
does your brain can you process that
okay how can time be infinite
like how could i have a beginning
well none of these things make sense
so
i believe that space-time
is looped
or circular
meaning that we know that there's or we
think we know there was a big bang and
the universe expanded and then in theory
although i think there's some question
about that lately in theory it should
eventually shrink back in back into the
singularity
and then maybe start over again with
another big bang
so at the very least it's repeated
we think
but i think a better way to see that was
yeah like a mobius strip
or a cycle or a continuous loop meaning
that everything that has happened will
happen again and has happened infinite
times
like it's not so much that things happen
it's that there's a loop of all the
possibilities
and you might experience them in a
certain way but they just sort of exist
there
so
that's the starting point
so space time is a closed loop and that
means the internet happens every time
the internet doesn't maybe happen
history is a loop
it happens every time
so the internet happens every time and
god is waking up now
always does
you might already feel it
it's a corrective force spreading out
across multiple domains
now here's what i mean
the internet has connected humanity in a
way that was never connected before
and is giving us
almost god-like powers
do you think that elon musk could build
a rocket ship to mars without the
internet
which allows him to connect to all the
people he needs and
all the resources and knowledge and
everything probably not
at least not easily
so we're at a point where
take the pandemic
the the world's response to the pandemic
was certainly helped because the
internet exists and everybody could talk
right
so we're forming some kind of um higher
level intelligence
that is the sum of all our individual
brains
sort of like a god
if we assume that god always existed and
always will
then this model explains it
because god would simply be in a
different form
god would go through
a let's say embryonic form in which god
is simply all of the stuff
it's just everything
and that everything has a few rules
and whatever those rules of physics are
would cause that thing
to 100 of the time because space-time is
looped
100 of the time an internet would form
and 100 of the time
this god consciousness which is spread
out into every
every bit of matter in the universe
we start to form an a common
intelligence which is the sum of all our
individual thoughts
and that
if this were happening now which is when
you'd expect it to happen because the
internet is now mature enough
that if this god intelligence were
forming
we'd know about it
because you'd see things that would look
like a corrective force
a god force
and that god force would literally be
the collective actions of all of us
and you could say hey
you know god made us in his image
or you could say
everything is god because all the
material had to be here in just the
right way for any of this to happen
so you can very easily get into the
definition of what is what is god and
very easily imagine that we're
experiencing the birth of god
right now
which still allows god to always have
existed just as everything always
existed
everything including god
but let's say in this model god is just
all the matter
so what would what would it look like
if the internet is causing this let's
say higher consciousness that i'll call
god
to awaken
what would it look like
well
i think you would see things
look like a power shift
and take nuclear energy for example
whose idea was it to go from i'm afraid
of nuclear energy
to in one year let's do it let's do
nuclear power as fast as we can
well you could say it was a combination
of lots of people
making lots of individual decisions plus
some events
or you could say
god decided
because when you add up all those
individual decisions
none of them individually mattered
but collectively they formed an opinion
which is our new opinion
it is a new form of intelligence
it's an artificial you could call it an
artificial intelligence but it's made up
of organic things
for a higher level of intelligence that
higher level intelligence got the right
answer didn't it
it took a while
but when we were all thinking as
individuals
we had the wrong result
as soon as the world started thinking
collectively
and thank you to the disciples
the shelling burgers the schneiders the
disciples they basically spread the news
around the collective mind started
working better it started making one
decision as you know in a in a more
comprehensive way consider climate
change
considered you know energy sources
considered pollution considered
the poor
considered
desalinization
considered decarbonization of you know
sucking out of the atmosphere so
suddenly because all of those things
were all part of the nuclear decision
that the humanities brain just said all
right all right
let's go nuclear
that's not the only example
that is not the only example
um
i think you're seeing that the
the mind of the internet is becoming
more important
now i've referred to this as the
internet dads
that's simply another frame to look at
it
you can see already the rise of the
internet dads and again dad doesn't mean
male or female it's just an
energy the the people who are just
saying
i have the skill
i have the ability to communicate
i have social media
i have to do this
i have to be part of the brain now
that's how i feel
i feel that because i have a certain set
of skills i have the spider-man problem
you know the spider-man problem
you know with great power comes great
responsibility
i would love to just take a vacation
but when you have the ability to
influence things as i do
you know you've seen enough examples to
know that's true
if you have the ability to influence
things that are actually important
it's kind of hard not to
because you're i think i'm just
genetically biased
through you know hundreds of thousands
of years of evolution
to need to help the tribe
like the the impulse to help the tribe
is so strong i can't turn it off like i
get up every day and it energizes me my
my entire like motive for living
basically
is is to help the tribe
because i've already gotten most of what
i need right i don't need to take care
of myself so much anymore
so it's just sort of a natural
transition and i think that the internet
dads many of them are in that same
position they've taken care of
themselves and their natural next
evolution
is to take care of the tribe
and the natural way to do it is on the
internet
to
form opinions from bad ones to good ones
so that the the unproductive opinions
get squeezed down over time and the
internet dads
form some kind of a cohesive
way to live
how many of you have seen
the internet dads and i'll put myself in
this category for this this topic
tell you how to be successful in life
it's kind of what they do right
all the ones who are like these dads
they all vary directly
and i would say very usefully and very
practically
tell you how to succeed
that's a very dad thing to do right it's
also a mom thing so remember it's not a
gender
issue
so
when you see this group of people who
are doing
really nothing but trying to help
at least in this context we're all
helping ourselves i'm not
denying that
but
clearly people are very oriented toward
helping other people and collectively
the the dads all see each other
we all see each other right
you know i'm watching jordan peterson
i don't know for sure but he responds to
my tweets
probably has an eye on me
right and and anybody else you could
mention in this group or probably keep
an eye on each other
we're we're sort of influenced by each
other and collectively i think we end up
shaving our messages in ways that make
them more powerful as we notice what
works and what doesn't
and that
the power of
the the internet
has moved into some kind of higher
consciousness
some kind of higher level
intelligence and you can see that and
it's going to come about in a number of
things
now let me give you one example
suppose it turns out that the supreme
court thing is a hoax
aren't you glad i warned you
or at least taught you how to spot the
next one
it could be that this is just a whole
bunch of coincidences and so it looks
like it hits every hits every note of a
hoax but maybe it's not
but at the very least you would learn
how to spot one next time so you're
getting smarter
right
when you watch this live stream and i
would argue that if you watch
if you follow elon musk you get smarter
if you follow certain events you get
smarter jack basobic you get smarter
there are some accounts uh glenn
greenwald
you follow his account you just get
smarter like when i when i read his
stuff i'm like oh
you know i almost always agree russell
brand great example right when you
follow russell brand you just get
smarter
doc anarchy yeah
there are lots of examples though matt
tybee right
mark andreessen
perfect example
andreessen has everything he wants
jonathan turley another good example
nevall perfect example although he's
quieter um
you don't want to say sam harris oh
samaras yeah absolutely i'll throw him
in there
uh
and trump is sort of like the ultimate
dad isn't he although he's a little
provocative so he's got
he's got some expense
yeah alex jones i think i'm just going
to put in his own category
if you don't mind
because there's not really like a second
alex jones is there i feel like
the thing with him is
it's so hard to like his good parts
because the bad parts are like
no i don't agree with that opinion or
what he said or what he did or whatever
but i don't like to lose the fact that
there's a whole bunch of talent and
probably good intentions there
all right
now ladies and gentlemen
keep looking for that corrective force
keep looking for that
larger intelligence
i think the internet dads are only a
part of it so just to be clear i'm not
saying the internet dads are god
i'm saying that a a larger mind is is
appearing
and that it will have lots of components
just like your mind like your mind is a
mess of competing opinions right
so is this larger internet mind but
still it all works like there's a
competition in your mind and then
something comes out of it same with same
with the internet
and the internet dads that i call them
are one component by no means the
biggest part
but important i think they i think they
they show the um the power of this model
better than other examples i guess
uh why no internet moms you know it's so
it's not again it's not about the gender
uh so women can be an internet dad in
this context
um but the mom vibe is more protective
wouldn't you say
and the dad vibe is more
uh
kill it if you need to
uh walk it off
uh this is this isn't
yeah there's definitely a dad vibe
is that too sexist
you know i'm open to an opinion on that
if if you think that that
if you think that that
kind of frame oh barry weiss okay throw
barry weiss into the mix and then then
you've got your you know your female
internet dad
i'll accept that
contribution
all right
um
tulsi gabbard
okay
i'll give you that one
i'll give you that one uh megan kelly
somebody says
you just reminded me that she asked me
to be on her show and i forgot to
respond
i am so busy lately you have no idea
all right okay now i feel embarrassed i
need to get back to her
saying other names you know
some of the names that you're suggesting
are more purely political
so
uh
so let's let's take a candace owens for
example she she plays a political role
that's sort of her job
so that's a different vibe
i'm looking for people who you know
would oh okay i'm going to blow your
mind here
you're going to blow your mind
representative ilan omar
she's closer to an internet dad
than candace owens
i'm not saying i prefer her
or her opinions
that's not what i'm saying
i'm saying that elon omar is willing to
buck the narrative of her own side and
has there's several good examples glenn
greenwald did a tweet on this and i
wasn't aware of all the examples and i
can't remember them all but there are
several examples where
uh
representative omar
very clearly bucked the
the democrat narrative
now
without getting into the details of any
other policies that you love or hate and
how she's offended you in many ways i
accept all that
right i'm not going to argue any of
those examples that you think are are
horrible whatever
but
as glenn greenwald pointed out
when you see somebody who can do that
like they just have the capability
you should pay attention
doesn't mean you have to agree with her
it just means she's not operating on the
same code as other people
now
uh
now if i saw candace occasionally
vehemently disagreeing with some
let's say trump-like policy
then i would bump her up as well into
the oh whoa there's somebody who can
break a narrative
but i think she's the if you look at the
people who are
let's say you know 98 narrative
uh compatible
then you don't know what they're
thinking for sure
because it's too close to the narrative
so i want to be careful about how i say
this because it could be
well it's actually perfectly possible
that there are lots of people whose
actual opinions genuinely held are
exactly the narrative
so since you can't tell
okay are you agreeing with the narrative
because you agree with the narrative
or
are you doing it because that's where
your money is
right so
uh
we don't know what people think
we can only tell what they're doing
so if i watch somebody
violate a narrative then i know that
about them
but i don't know what they're thinking
exactly i just know that they have the
ability to do it so all you're seeing is
ability not
internal thoughts
are you shaping the narrative
what do you think
how many of you think that i have
impacted a narrative of anything
important in politics
let's let's put it up to the public vote
because you know it's hard to it's hard
to measure that sort of thing because
sometimes things go the way
you want them to go
but that doesn't mean you have any
impact
right so it is mostly um i think about
90 yeses here
yeah okay so yes
um and
and let me ask you this have you seen me
violate the narrative
anybody have you seen me violate the
narrative yes
and do you know that it makes my
audience smaller every time i do it
it does
i do it anyway
so if you see me operate against my
financial interests which i do
openly
i am openly working against my own
financial interests at the same time i'm
monetizing this
it's all very obvious to me that every
time i piss somebody off they stop
reading my comic
right every time i violate a narrative
somebody will never read a dilbert comic
again but nobody ever said oh i liked
your opinion on on this or that
so i'll begin right i'll start reading
your comics that i've never read before
or i'll
or buy your book that doesn't happen so
much it's more like it is a one-way trip
people just take things away from you
so when you see me violate the narrative
you should know that i'm completely
aware that's costing me money but i
think it's worth doing
right
so take that into account
do i know kathy geyswite
what a weird question
the uh
creator of the kathy comic and the
answer is well yeah i do
the cartooning world isn't that big
so there are there are
annual events in which most of the
cartoonists get together so most of the
syndicated cartoonists have at least met
each other
and by the way she's awesome
kathy guy's way it is
um
all right
um i never hung out with berkeley
brethord i did meet him briefly
i believe he was deeply unimpressed when
he met me
i met him at the height of his fame and
at the beginning of my career
so he he was
he was a superstar
and i was the guy who wanted wanted to
be him
you're reading way of the weasel ah
that's my worst book sorry
i hate to tell you that's my worst book
read if you don't like that one just
read any other book i've read just
anything else
so dilbert in the way of the weasel
probably my weakest book
all right
so
that's all for today
probably one of the best live streams
you've ever experienced i know probably
a little bit of a tingle going on
that'll last all day and i'm going to
say to you
i've never met gary larson or
or bill waterson
both of them are famously
uh reclusive
and i will talk to you
tomorrow
