mmm bum Papa papa
hey you're a robot
Nixon
misty bikini and the rest of you Dan
good to see you abs 88
Tyler Russell Tom how you doing I
am in the wrong time zone
so I'm little late
slept in you know I know that a lot of
you think well what's it like to be a
big famous cartoonist
you know what kind of hotel rooms do you
get and let me tell you if you're a
big-time cartoonist like I am famous guy
even when you're traveling for business
you get the finest hotel rooms
I want to show you the view I have here
in New York I'm and a high-end hotel in
New York the view is incredible I'm
gonna I'm just gonna show it to you I
don't be jealous you know someday if
you're a famous cartoonist you'll get
this - this is what I get to see
now a lot of people like to look at you
know oceans and trees and nature you
know landscapes stuff like that but not
me I like to see the back of your
utilities
here's my view it's a good one
and so
let us drink
let us drink our coffee
let us have the simultaneous sip
raise your cup your mug your beverage
container be it a Stein be it anything
else and join me for the simultaneous
sip
somebody just has only just mentioned
bill Polti and
Bill and I will be on Fox and Friends
tomorrow morning Friday morning I don't
have an exact time for the hit yet but
we will be talking about blade authority
and showing some
brainstorming ideas about what to do
with this space that has been cleared by
the blind Authority and more to come so
the the inner cities have a bunch of
land that's available for little or no
cost because nobody wants it right now
and the yet the thing key is that if
we're smart enough we can come up with
some ideas for productively using that
land in a way that's good for the local
population
it's a really tough problem you know
youyou probably saw me tweet around a
story about some I guess it was a an
architectural college class in which
every year they would have a project to
try to build a home for $20,000 or a low
price whatever it is and the latest
versions that they have there they're
getting better and better each class
improves on the last design and they're
getting better and better now and so the
latest thing looks like it would cost
about twenty thousand dollars to build a
small basic home
now
of course there are problems here and
people have pointed them out one is that
you can't take a nice home and plop it
in the middle of a bad area and then put
somebody in a twos you know
who knows what has a drug problem and
doesn't have a job you name it and
expect the things will work out well
right the house you know is not the
solution people need homes and they need
inexpensive homes and I would I would
argue it's the biggest among the biggest
problems in the world right now if you
look at the caravan if you look at if
you look at the middle class
disappearing a lot of it has to do with
the fact that leading a good life at a
low income is next to impossible these
days so how do you fix the the cost of
having a good life
but I think this the solution will be
something that is not just plopping a
house in a in a in a neighborhood it has
bad schools and whatever else you're
gonna need maybe a system designed in
which you're changing a number of things
at the same time building a community
making sure maybe it's got its own you
know perhaps a charter school in the
middle that sort of thing anyway I'll
present what are some more ideas on Fox
and Friends with Bill Volta tomorrow and
that I'll talk about them after
let's talk about the big news that's
always President Trump
man can that guy make some news
some of my favorite stories here on fire
stories yeah the president just we did
it my god he said something provocative
I didn't see that coming so
his his latest his latest statements
that are driving to CNN crazy and the
anti-trump press crazy is that he has
apparently
left it on the table about whether or
not he would consider a pardon for
Manafort
now of course he the anti-trump errs are
going not saying hey wait a minute
you know you you can't be saying that
you might pardon him because that will
influence them you know you're you're
obstructing justice by just dangling
that out there you know you're kind to
say hey you play along metaphor maybe
you'll get a pardon
but here's the thing
have you met President Trump you know I
mean are you familiar with him have you
watched him for three years what are
some of the basic principles that he
that he uses all the time
basic principle number one
you don't give up your options
is there anything he's more consistent
about then don't give up your options
he says the same thing when he talks to
North Korea you know are you going to
nuke North Korea all options are on the
table are you gonna pardon anybody all
options are on the table why wouldn't
they be
anybody who gives away their own options
before they have to is a freaking idiot
so when you're talking about what
Trump's doing it's fair to say it might
influence you know something that's fair
to say
it is not fair to say that therefore he
shouldn't do it because the alternative
is freaking idiot like that's the only
alternative anybody who gives up an
option before they need to and he
doesn't need to he's the president the
president does not give away his own
power for any reason you know unless
like a compelling one and that's not a
compelling reason so if you see it in
terms of his typical pattern of course
he's not going to give away that option
now is it also strategically smart
well it's keeping the you know the
chattering class chattering gives them
something to chew on that you know it
keeps them from talking about something
worse I suppose and it does
secondarily have the strategic
impact of making Manafort maybe a little
bit friendlier that he would have
otherwise batten now that's not the
president's fault the president is
simply not giving away an option why
should he if not giving away an option
happens to also have the secondary
effect of getting him may be a little
more likely to get what is good for him
I
don't know that that's dumb
now let's talk about my my favorite part
of the news yesterday was the president
retweeted a meme that showed a lot of
Democrats who were sort of his high end
you know enemies I guess you could say
from the the Clintons DeRozan Stein to
some of the security consultants clapper
those guys the deep Stander's and it
showed them behind bars and
what was CNN's reaction to that Wow a
hair on fire her hair on fire the
president the president should not be
suggesting like a dictator that his
enemies should go to jail
but let's look at the big picture
I saw that meme as a brushback pitch you
know in baseball sometimes if the batter
is crowding the box and you know and
using psychology against the pitcher you
know by getting real close to the plate
and you know trying to try to get in the
head of the pitcher what is the pitchers
response
it's it's the the blowback pitch you
fire a pitch right at his head because
he's gonna go to move out of the way
right you not tried to hit him you're
trying to blow him back off the plate
so what are the Republicans who who are
still there drunk on their victory from
the midterms so what are the midterm
drunken Democrats talking about well
let's go after the president with
infinite lawyers and infinite
investigations until we drive a man of
office and essentially overthrow the
graph to the United States with lawyers
all right now if they do that are they
likely to kick up something that's bad
for the president even if it's not
illegal it could be just the story is
bad the politics of it is bad the optics
are bad it's a distraction it's it's
everything bad
so what is what is the president do
brushback pitch
the the meme of all of those cats you
know that like that the top cats you
know of being literally behind jail
behind bars is visual persuasion it's
the best right it's fear if you can
combine fear and visual persuasion
that's powerful on a persuasion level
you know you I always like to pause and
say on an ethical level you can make
your own decisions probably wouldn't be
much different than mine you know on the
legal level that's something else but on
the persuasion level
fear and visual persuasion are solid
gold so in his brushback pitch his
tweets showing the top Democrats behind
bars does that mean he wants to put them
behind bars
almost certainly not I mean he might be
mad enough at some of them that he sort
of you know on some level wishes
something bad would happen to him like
jail maybe some of them deserve it but
that's not the point of the tweet the
point of the tweet is to make a mutually
assured destruction
real
it's one thing to say hey you Democrats
if you go after me with infinite lawyers
I also have access to infinite lawyers
so my infinite lawyers will go after
your infinite lawyers if you take that
road
what's the most effective way to say
that which is all just sort of concept e
and you know concepts don't really hold
people's you know emotions that much
well you take your concept and you put
it into a meme in this case you just
retweeted somebody's meme that shows
exactly what's going to happen if the
Democrats pursue their path and by the
way do you think he's bluffing
does anybody think he's bluffing I don't
I don't think there's even a little bit
of bluff I believe if the Democrats go
full weapons of mass destruction lawyers
against the president exactly as they
have said they will do
he's gonna he's gonna unleash the dogs
from hell
what what's that line that Russell Crowe
does in gladiator
unleash the dogs or no unleash the
unleash the dogs of hell or something
like that there's some famous line like
that that I always like not enough to
appear apparently I didn't like that
unleash hell it wasn't unleash hell was
it
maybe it was but now now if you assume
that my interpretation is accurate and I
like to think it is
oh it's at my single at my signal
unleash hell
now one of the things that the
that the anti-trump media consistently
does to mislead you is they skip over
the they skip over the question of
whether they've done anything wrong and
the Democrats the all the anti jumpers
do that they'll skip past the question
of whether they've done anything wrong
and they'll concentrate on the question
of whether they should be punished and
they'll say hey a president should not
be coming after us in such a fashion
that's bad presidenting
but you're skipping the first part of
the question was was there a reason for
him to come after you did the news media
do a good job and therefore everybody
should say hey good job good job media
oh you get a few wrong but mostly good
job was that the situation or did the or
did the anti-trump media becomes such a
deranged corrupt
you know into a
hentai country entity that the president
of the country absolutely frickin should
be calling them out if the if the leader
of the country doesn't call out a
horrible problem in the country is he
doing his job
isn't that sort of the job didn't we
don't you elect a president to identify
and call out problems and then try to
find ways to deal with them yes you do
and so when the president calls out the
media for being biased
the first question you have to ask is
not is it appropriate for a president to
go after the media that's not the right
question that's the second question the
first question is did they do something
worthy of criticism if the answer is yes
move to question two is it appropriate
for a president to call out something
that's a big problem to the country
that's his job
that's his job of course it's
appropriate if the problem is real if
the problem is not real then he's a
dictator
right and that's the way it's being
presented so the media likes to say well
obviously we're doing a great job so if
he's criticizing us he must be a
dictator
likewise with the with the folks who are
going to come after Trump with all their
many lawyers and lawsuits and
investigations and this and that look at
his taxes and you name it
don't go to the second question of
whether he should be saying I want you
in jail
that's not the question that's the
second question the first question is
are the people who are mounting this
campaign
on your side as a country in other words
are they doing something that's for the
greater good if they are acting for the
greater good and these investigations
are well-intentioned ways to make the
world a better place then the president
going after them and saying I'm going to
put you in jail my god even I don't even
have hair and my hair would be on fire
if that were the case if the President
of the United States no matter who it
was was going after was threatening jail
for people who are doing nothing but
trying to make the world a better place
you need to get rid of that president
but if the president is going hard and
threatening an entity which is only a
destructive entity trying to make things
good for them at the cost of the country
well then I want my president I
want my president to go hard at them now
within the law because the law gives him
all the flexibility he needs he doesn't
need to go in outside the law but if he
needs to go outside the bounds of
politeness
please do
right did anybody did anybody vote for a
president Trump for his politeness
was that on anybody's list well let me
look at the list there yeah yeah I got I
got five reasons for voting for this
president but right at the top you got
your politeness you know you state is
within the balance that's what I like
about him he is never rude he'll never
talk back to people who need to be
talked back to that's why I like him
said nobody
said nobody he literally he marketed
himself as a candidate by being
politically incorrect and by daring to
say the things that were true as far as
he knew that people don't say so you
know my take on the latest news is that
the president is doing exactly what at
least his his supporters think he should
do based on their opinion of what he's
speaking out against and now how corrupt
and biased they are
I
I did some tweeting a gret Glenn
Greenwald I don't know if I'm
pronouncing it writes for the intercept
and I always like to I like to couch my
comments about Greenwald the same way I
don't like the guy like there's
something about him I just don't like
yeah maybe it's because he came after me
and on Twitter once I'm sure that's a
big part of it
but I I can't ignore the fact that when
he tweets or writes you really should
pay attention to it all right so because
he does say things that seem to be you
know following some kind of truth as
opposed to following a left or a right
so I like to say that before
Greenwald yeah Glenn Greenwald so anyway
I tweeted today he was talking about
some fake news coming in a Politico and
some fake news about the Guardian and
you just have to read it you know I
tweeted it he's got a long tweet but he
absolutely
dismantles the media in this country and
and I believe he's as
objective and observer of these types of
things as you'll ever find so if you
don't believe President Trump
if you don't believe politicians if you
don't believe you know CNN if you don't
believe Fox News whoever it is you don't
believe
check out Greenwald and you can find him
on my Twitter feed this morning
retweeted
yeah there are some names that I have
trouble pronouncing you know every once
a while when I'm doing these periscopes
I realize I'm going to say a word or
somebody's name that I've never
pronounced out loud
so
you're often hearing me pronounce things
for the very first time in my life
alright what else is going on there's
anything else going on you want to
comment on
yeah we i've talked about the weavers
there's something I don't understand in
Yemen have you looked at a map of Yemen
let's see if Syria can give me one
yeah
map of Yemen
okay
okay coming up with a map of Yemen I'll
tell you
okay it's a pretty good map can you see
it
that's my map of Yemen it's the word
Yemen on a white background
apparently oh there's no map of Yemen
all right let's see here this is better
so just let you know what the map looks
like so see if I can give us so this big
thing Saudi Arabia and then attach to it
on the bottom there is Yemen and there
we've got Iran over there so Iran is
sort of backing the rebels in Saudi
Arabia is trying to get control over
Yemen by fighting and you know packing
the government that was deposed by the
rebels and so huge humanitarian crisis
50 thousand people have died it's just
apparently the biggest humanitarian
crisis in the world
now
here's here's the thing
if your Saudi Arabia
can you can you live with Iran being
your neighbor on the south and being
able to reach you with weapons and
everything else you probably can't I
don't know how Saudi Arabia could let
their immortal military enemy get a
foothold as their next-door neighbor
well it's literally the worst thing you
could imagine for Saudi Arabia but the
in in the past we've been backing Saudi
Arabia militarily with I guess logistics
and and equipment and stuff
somebody says that's a false narrative
if I if I've said if I've said anything
that doesn't pass the fact-checking let
me know because I claim no expertise in
this topic so
the question is how can Saudi Arabia
ever lose that war meaning won't they
stop at nothing to win that because from
a security perspective it seems like
they oughta literally just stop at
nothing you know kill as many people as
they feel they have to as horrible as it
is because the risk to them would look
like a mortal risk to their to their
kingdom now
and
it's so the question is if the United
States pulls out and I guess I guess
that's
that's a there's a some legislation
being considered for the United States
to pull out and stop backing Saudi
Arabia on this maybe partly because the
Ashoke thing maybe partly because we're
not giving a you know nothing good is
happening in Yemen
but I don't know how any of this gets us
to a good place exactly I think it's
helpful that Yemen is scheduled some
peace talks but I can't see exactly that
was pulling out of helping Saudi Arabia
gets us closer to a solution I suppose
it depends what you think the solution
is going to end up to be
so I'm little confused on the details of
why it would help us to stop backing
Saudi Arabia because Saudi Arabia is
trying to limit
Iran and that seems like the same thing
we're trying to do strategically so I
don't quite get the strategy there I
don't know if it's a bad strategy I just
don't get it and I don't know why the
reporting doesn't fill in those blanks
for me reporting you say
who does who does reporting anymore
what about Trump's comments on tariffs I
haven't seen of what do you say about
tariffs sorry I'm in a different time
zone some less prepared than normal
buh-buh-buh-buh
he says we were winning on tariffs now
well the thing with tariffs is
that you we continue to see what I call
the the child frame versus the adults
frame the the child frame always just
looks at the near term give me candy and
don't worry about dinner don't worry
about my health don't worry about my my
teeth give me candy because candy feels
good right now so
and of course the the trade wars
are by their design
going to hurt you in the short run
in order to get you hope a better
outcome in the long run so if the
president says it's working that would
mean that it's hurting the other side
let's say China more than asserting us
it does not mean that it is not hurting
us it does mean that we have to get
through this to get to something good so
we don't know how it will turn out but
it would be shocking if it didn't turn
out a little bit better than what it was
before it would be sort of shocking as
you know I am not in favor of
any trade deal with China so long as
they are the primary of fentanyl
producers and they're not acting
effectively against their own their own
cartels who were creating the fentanyl
that's killing 30,000 people a year
including my my steps on this year
at the end of the deal everyone will be
paying more that's not a good deal
did do you think that the end of the
trade deal both sides are paying more I
don't know that that's that that makes
sense under anybody's definition I think
the and the other thing that people will
say and I said this before but I feel
like I have to keep repeating it is that
if you go into a negotiation and your
attitude is hey I'd better give the
other side everything they want or
they'll be mad at me you're not really a
good negotiator
so
you know you really do have to assume
that you're gonna have to push back
against a bad deal even if it means not
making the deal even if it means keeping
tariffs forever they that you have to
push against the bad deal
avenatti apparently filed a suit within
the stormiest permission yeah that whole
avenatti store McDaniels thing feels
like stale news doesn't it even when
there's new news about stormy Daniels
and avenatti doesn't it feel stale it's
like staler than
you know Hillary Clinton's back brace
it's just stale
don't care so people I see people
prompted me to say since about Cohen
what's the story on Cohen he what he do
we plaid or something the Cohen thing I
have a little trouble getting interested
in as well
because we never quite know what's he
know what's going to happen it's a lot
of just guessing so I've been ignoring
the whole Cohen thing for the most part
Oh
Roger stone and and core sees
credibility somebody's asking me about
well the the great thing about Roger
stone and and I think this is hilarious
is that by his own description he's a
dirty trickster who does not conform to
the truth in other words he uses
hyperbole exaggerated and if you asked
him he'd say that's my job and I'm you
know I'm full of crap and that's what I
do for a living I make a good living
doing this so you know I'm not trying to
fool anybody I'm the guy who is full of
crap and then and then and then his only
legal jeopardy as if you believe that
the one time he wasn't full of crap he
said something bad
he's got this perfect defense that he's
unreliable
I've been thinking of trying to
cultivate that
I've been trying to think about
cultivating that defense for myself
maybe you should try it I want to just
start saying a lot of stuff that I know
isn't true and then if anybody ever like
says yeah we caught you why'd you say
this to somebody by your email I'll say
do you know me I never say stuff that's
true look at all my other things I said
that are calling clearly not true why
would you even think this would be true
so it's kind of hilarious all right so
that the part about Corsi
is
he apparently he did subscribe to some
conspiracy theories so you know he's got
to worry about that but who the hell I
was yeah
who the heck knows of that
all right
oh
I saw a story that apparently Ivanka has
some kind of voice problem you know she
gave an interview in which she was sort
of hoarse and there was some speculation
that there's some kind of a voice
problem and and maybe it's the same as
when I had talked the
spasmodic dysphonia problem I had with
my voice but I listened to it and to me
it just sounds like somebody who has a
cold doesn't sound like anything don't
worry about
there's a story about even scientists
become tribal well I guess that's
predictable oh I understand that
China pulled back on the gene-editing
after it got a lot of bad press
and
and people have suggested that pressure
on
China about their fentanyl could work
because public pressure does make a
difference so
I don't know if you've typed hashtag
fentanyl into a twitter search box but
if you try it fentanyl China is going to
be one of your top three hits and it
should be
he had gene editing is something that is
going to have lots of fits and starts in
other words it's going to move forward
and people go say hey and then we'll
move backwards a little then they'll
move forwards again then we'll look
backward but there's nothing that will
stop gene editing
if there's one if there's one prediction
I can give you with a hundred percent
certainty
someday gene editing for babies will be
common
you know there's just no chance that
that doesn't happen zero no chance
how do you stay thin at sixty read my
book I had to fail at almost everything
and still win big I talked about systems
for diet and exercise
it'll tell you everything you need
talk about interrogation techniques I
talked about that yesterday about
leading the witness and to imagining
they committed a crime it's very easy
very common and it's easy to make people
hallucinate things
by the way you ask questions
study said that trying too hard it
creates armed
is a hypnosis you know hypnosis usually
when I use the term I'm usually talking
about a situation where you're actually
putting somebody under hypnosis in a
room and it's one-on-one and you're
using the actual techniques of hypnosis
but when interrogators are influencing
people to
hallucinate fake memories they're not
using hypnosis
techniques at large they're doing a few
things that trigger people and those few
things are imagine that you are back
there now imagine that it happened and
when you ask people to imagine their
imagination and their memory starts to
conflate a little bit so you don't need
a whole bunch of technique to cause
somebody to have a fake a fake memory I
think the two components that I've heard
that make the most difference are first
asking people to imagine and then second
giving them some kind of comfort that
this is what everybody does so if you
say you know some people when they
imagine they can come up with memories
so you have to suggest that it's come
and a normal for everybody to do this
and you have to suggest that they
combine their imagination with their
memories and if you get them to do those
two things oh and then the third thing
is that the person has to want to please
you so if the person is trying to make
you happy and they're imagining and you
know other people do it those are
probably the three the three materials
you need to create a fake memory and
something like 70% of the people you do
it with
all right yes it's very much like the
McMartin preschool case same situation
there's a new Chinese underwater train
well I don't know what you're talking
about but you have my attention with
underwater trained
if you ever wanted to get me to pay
attention just say underwater train and
I'm like look somebody made an
underwater train did you see that Elon
Musk says he's going to yeah there's a
bottom 70% chance or something that
you'll end up living on Mars on his at
some time in his life
everything he says is interesting
all right I've got to go do some other
stuff and I will talk to you later
