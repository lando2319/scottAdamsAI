can you see me on
YouTube all right I think we're
live so so we've had three crashes so
far so I'm not sure if this is
personal uh no live picture on
YouTube oh they can't see me on they
said they can't see
me oh okay so I think the comments are
maybe just late or something but uh I'm
going to go forward as if you're there
anyway so you got all these apps uh that
will undress people you just give them a
photograph and'll create a nude uh
apparently no big
surprise they're a really big thing
now but so we're talking about the
nudify apps I'm going to say the same
thing that I said that crashed it three
times so far I'm going see if I can
crash it saying the same thing for the
third time in a
row make sure you wait until the end of
the broadcast
for a new reframe you haven't heard
before that could change your
life let's see if it
crashes okay didn't crash that time took
me three tries just to say that sentence
that's
weird uh yes we did the Sip you missed
it so everybody coming in who says I'm
late it's actually just YouTube had a
technical problem
um I'm just going to skip this
first story
because I I've lost all of my momentum
and my you know like the the entire
rhythm is
gone you if you do this every day you
get you get kind of addicted to the
opening Rhythm meaning I do and if I get
thrown out of the ri Rhythm by a
technical
problem it it's hard to get it back
honestly so you're just like swimming in
the ocean like w what do I do now
so let me go to the news next story you
you know that story about that Arlington
House that
exploded and that James U guy was in
there and some people like me said you
know what I think there's going to be a
lot more to that story well it turns out
there's a lot more to that story now I'm
not going to get into the details
because I don't know have much to
believe I mean it could be all just
garbage I don't know but apparently the
the individual Mr U who is in allegedly
in the house and died in the house um
had vast CIA connections and and he had
something to do with underwater fiber
optics across the ocean and that maybe
he was a CIA operative who was helping
the CIA spy on the under on on the
traffic under the water because his
company I something like that so there's
nothing that I believe yet I'm just
telling you that when we said there
might be something more there's just a
whole bunch
more it turns out it's the most
suspicious looking death you've ever
seen in your life so we haven't heard
the end of
this all right house robberies are uh
going crazy apparently there are these
organized gangs of South American
migrants who are looting homes and I
think it's related but maybe not there's
now these high-tech robberies where they
use some Electronics to to thwart your
security so there's a a big boom in home
robberies upscale home robberies now I
feel like this
is partly because there might be fewer
stores to
rob did we get to the point where all
the retail stores are already robbed so
they're like well somebody got all the
good stuff we better start robbing homes
so I worry that these this home robbery
thing is not a blip
but rather the beginning of a very
long-term Trend that could be disturbing
um I said on X but people acted like
they didn't believe me I said that this
gang hit my
neighbor my next door neighbor had the
organized gang of Central or South
American
robbers uh and I know that I'm not
making it up I mean we're all on a my
neighborhood's all organized we're on an
app they they had the security cameras
the local police said oh yeah this
they've been hitting people around here
and it's an organized group so it's a
group of people who will kind of quickly
come in Smash a back window usually and
just grab what they can and leave it's
usually multiple people from South
America and so they hit right there like
I could literally take a baseball and
throw it and hit the house that the that
they robbed that's how close it is it's
literally my next door
neighbor now somehow they knew that they
weren't home I I think they were
away um how do they know that do you
ever wonder about that I suppose they
ring the doorbell or something right
probably just ring the doorbell if
nobody answers then they hit
it anyway um so the
coined that phrase yet
dechico it'll happen more quickly so
that's uh what I call
dechico startup that's turning 4
forestry scraps in other words you know
wood and scraps into uh artificial
graphite to make lithium
batteries because apparently the the uh
materials especially the graphite for
making lithium batteries is largely
comes from China so if we can make
batteries from wood
scraps imagine that of course we'll end
up you know probably cutting down all of
our old growth forest to make batteries
but we'll deal with that
later so that's kind of cool making
batteries on a
wood didn't see that
coming all
right
uh uh this I shouldn't laugh at this but
I laugh at stupidity there's nothing
funny about this next
story except I can't stop laughing at it
but it's not funny just to be clear this
is very very serious topic and not to be
laughed
at um but what percentage of uh people
between uh 18 and
29 believe that the Holocaust was
exaggerated
what well very good very good you didn't
even know the answer and you got the
right answer yeah 23% a lot of you
guessing 25 but I'm I'm going to call
that correct round it off yeah about a
quarter of the young people people think
the Holocaust was
exaggerated or or didn't exist at
all but the uh an X User called
amuse uh just like it sounds on X said
with his chart doesn't reveal is the
racial disparity underlying these
numbers because you know there's a
racial disparity in absolutely
everything did you know
that yeah when somebody says um your
your ideas or your policy ideas are
racist do you know what the right
response to that is whatever it is
whether it's immigration or school or
any other thing and somebody says hey
your policy preference is racist do you
know what the correct the correct answer
to that is they all are they all
are every policy no no exception now all
the important ones there might be some
trivial ones that don't matter but the
important ones are going to affect your
money right if you change the tax code
in any way does it have a racial outcome
yes 100% of the time and there's no way
to avoid it because as long as humans
don't have exactly the same financial
situation across demographic groups
anything that let's say takes money from
the rich and gives it to the poor is
going to be racist there's no way around
it so pretty much everything we do from
immigration to everything that involves
a budget to health care to war there
there's no real exception they all have
a they all have a different racial
outcome and therefore are Races by
definition so I wouldn't deny it i' just
say what would be an example of
something that didn't have a racial
outcome there's there's
nothing so anyway
um but here's another one of those cases
apparently among uh black survey
respondents from uh between 18 and
29 uh 80% of them uh think the Holocaust
is a
myth
80% of black Americans between 18 and 29
80% think the Holocaust is a myth and as
amuse says maybe this accounts for BLM
support of
Hamas
I don't
know I I I think that might be a stretch
but it's probably not
unrelated you know I think you you would
find a perfect correlation between how
much you know about the
Holocaust and how supportive you are of
Israel I've often said that the
Holocaust is Israel's greatest
asset which is sort of counterintuitive
when you think about it but if they did
not have the Holocaust as something
that's you know a real Salient piece of
History do you think Israel would exist
as a
country I don't think Israel would exist
would it except for the Holocaust would
Israel have as much support as it has
from America in particular if the
Holocaust did not exist and the answer
is I doubt it I doubt it it's pretty
pretty underlying concept so as horrible
and tragic as obviously the H Holocaust
was
the fact that the Israelis turned it
into an
asset is one of the most
impressive pieces of work you'll ever
see in your
life now I often tell you this people
don't you it's hard to know the
difference between good news and bad
news now while the Holocaust was
happening of course it's all bad news
but the fact that that could ever be
turned into a gigantic National Asset is
really
impressive how ever it should be said
that the actions in Gaza are working
against that narrative and you know this
is not my opinion I'm just saying that
the effect it'll have on other people's
opinions is that it will weaken The
Narrative of the Holocaust would you
agree with that that what's happening in
Gaza will substantially weaken the
narrative not not that the narrative
isn't true you know the Holocaust is
real but uh by the way despite what the
ADL tells you the the head of the I i'
just like to remind you this that the
head of the
ADL accused me personally me personally
of be of being a holocaust denier on the
xplatform this
year that happened this year that the
had of the ADL accused me of being a
holocaust
denier do just hold that in your
head I I'm pretty sure I don't have to
explain that I'm not one right the
there's nobody here who's going to argue
that oh yeah you're a Holocaust in there
like literally nobody thinks that and
that was said in
public just think about that that was
said in public don't I have a legal
action maybe I'm not going to bother but
that's that's pretty bad
anyway
um so yes as we watch these narratives
uh shrink and grow right in front of us
it's going to change things
all right here's the best story of the
day this is Trump talking about the
debates all right so Trump had a very
long post on the truth platform and I'm
just going to read the whole thing and
I'm not going to read it because it has
um political interest whatsoever right
this has no political interest here's
where how you should listen to it he is
one of the best writers in American
history I don't know anybody else who
says that but
me but you really really have to
appreciate the quality of the writing
now I don't mean that he spells every
word correctly I don't mean that every
sentence has the right grammar because
remember it's it's all unedited he has
no editor you you're seeing it right
from his head to you I'm just going to
read it's a long paragraph here about
his his his thoughts on the last GoPed
debate and just listen to it for the
writing quality right the humor and then
what and then listen to it for the uh
the visual persuasion so what you're
listening for is how he paints pictures
with words and he doesn't use too many
words and watch how every word is in the
right place right this is this is really
fairly it's just brilliant it's just FR
it's just flat out brilliant all right
so this is Trump on the debates I
thought Ron Des sanctimonious was
terrible with his bobblehead facial
movements wow and is walking on eggs
wow so so
visual uh but that sloppy Chris Christie
wow sloppy wow uh Chris Christie was
worse now now do you see how much he's
set up in this he he's telling you you
he's giving you two people telling you
they're terrible in the most visual way
you could possibly and then he gives you
the hypnosis uh kicker the hypnosis
kicker is that one of them might be
worse because if he makes you think
which one is worse he makes you stay
there right if he just said uh this
one's a clown this one's a clown and
moved on well your brain would move on
too and that that' be that'd be okay
that'd be okay writing but when he said
say when he gets to uh but Chris
Christie was worse now you have to go
back and evaluate all right so is being
sloppy worse than being a bobblehead
walking on eggs sloppy versus the
bobblehead well if it was just sloppy
versus bobblehead that'd be a better tie
but if he add the eggs to the sloppy but
wait a minute sloppy could be worse than
eggs and Bubbles so so the fact that he
does that to your head in one
sentence it's it's the first sentence
it's the first sentence all
right and then um you talk about chrisy
still he says he's not fit mentally or
physically to be president plus he
suffers from TDS or Trump derangement
syndrome at levels not seen
before at levels not seen
before that that's one of his best uh
persuasion tricks again if he tells you
it's levels not seen before you have to
stop and say well is it or is it sort of
similar to
2016 or is it about where it was in 2018
is it really levels we've not seen
before I I'm telling you the the writing
is so good levels not seen
before uh in other words he's a he puts
in quote a sick
puppy and even the puppy is visual you
can see the
puppy on top of it
all on top of it all even on top of it
is visual uh his poll numbers are just
1% in a class in a class with uh aah
Hutchinson he puts aah in in quotes
he puts aah in quotes because he jokes
he used to joke that Hutchin Hutchinson
was Ada the Americans with Disabilities
Act but you would have to know that you
would have to know that background to
know why he put his first name in quotes
oh my God so you can't read past that
without stopping right like you you just
have to stop and and laugh laugh at the
fact he put it in quotes
and and then he says if
Hutchinson oh no I guess he's still
talking about Chris he goes he's dead
but so is Ron whose weird bobbing whose
weird bobbing head and fresh mouth makes
his high heels look
good his bobbing head and fresh mouth
makes his high heels look
good
sorry wait there's
more uh and then he says about Ron again
he goes he's walking on
[Laughter]
eggs I'm walking on eggs it's supposed
to be eggshells but anyway uh bird brain
he's talking about
Nikki hilly and he's giving her a name
bird brain I guess goes bird brain look
[Laughter]
different bird brain look
[Laughter]
different now I don't I don't know if
you had this take on Nikki hilly but I
thought I thought she look different did
you have did you have the same
feeling there was something about her
face right didn't her face look
different I didn't know why you know
like I'm not an expert on that stuff and
I don't know is that is that like makeup
or
Botox so I don't know what it was now
I'm not going to say she looked
worse I thought she looked pretty good
but she looked different would you agree
that she looked different and and he
doesn't make any comment except that a
bird brain looked
different it's so visual it's visual but
uh here's another hypnosis
trick if you don't get specific then
people get to see the image the way they
want so if he said a bird brain look
younger then people would say I don't
know maybe I'm not sure she look younger
so that have something to disagree with
if he said she looked like she had
Botox people would say well I'm not sure
I'm not so sure it was Botox right so
that would give them something to
disagree with but if you say she looked
different you hit everybody because
whether whether you think she look
better or worse or or why she looked
different you he opens it to all that so
she just look different th this by the
way is is right out of
hypnosis this is a specific lesson
that you don't get too specific with
your suggestions you let the brain fill
in the blanks the way it wants to fill
them in it's just
brilliant all right so bird brain looked
different and lost and
lost she did look kind of lost you when
when V was going after her and she had
that blank
expression she look
lost but I give her second
place and he says vake wins all in caps
because he thinks I'm
great there's literally there's nobody
else in the world who would have said
that yeah the thing that makes him an
original is that nobody will ever talk
like this again and and nobody ever
has VI wins because he thinks I'm great
oh my
God the Biggest Loser was Megan Kelly
what the hell happened to
[Laughter]
her she has lost whatever she once had
she wasn't very
much some things never
change
oh my God this was all just one post on
social oh God he he hit he h a lot of
notes there that's a lot of
notes oh 2024 is going to be so much
fun all right well Alex Jones has been
reinstated to the
xplatform is anybody
surprised boy boy talk about
foreshadowing I I think that was by far
the most uh the most
broadcast you know cats on the roof h he
he's coming back and sure enough I don't
know when uh X or maybe musk himself
made the decision but I feel like maybe
the decision was out there and and maybe
there was a little uh poking around to
see how the public would
respond um but I'll remind you of a
story I I think it's fair to tell this
story because everybody looks good in
this story but um you remember that Alex
Jones had two rounds of cancellation
when he first got cancelled there was
whatever he did the first time I don't
even know what it was and uh several of
the several of the platforms canceled
him but Twitter at the time did not do
you remember that so he was cancelled in
other places but not on Twitter at first
and then very soon after that there was
some other blow up and then he got
canceled on Twitter as well
so here's just a little backstory you
didn't know about um when he was
cancelled the first time by the other
social media uh platforms but not
Twitter um I was asked by uh Jack dorsy
who was running Twitter at the time and
I think he was just looking for some
opinions because he was trying to figure
out if Twitter should ban him as well
and I was I don't know who else he asked
but I'm one of the people he
asked and he said do you think Alis
Jones should be banned on Twitter and I
said
no and I don't know if I had any weight
in that decision but he wasn't at least
until something else happened and then
he was
so I just want to give you know Jack
dorsy some uh credit
for you know he he he actually went and
got some opinions and he didn't stick
with him you know one little bubble he
got outside the bubble and checked
around and and I and I think that well I
don't think my specific opinion was you
know the deciding factor probably
because he talked to enough people who
said the same thing I did that's
probably why he lasted as long as he did
so I'm going to give Twitter you know
old Twitter and Jack dorsy credit for
doing you doing the checking asking the
right people um and now he's back so
do you know
uh do you know the musical DJ musician
called Moby is everybody know
Mobi if you don't know Mobi uh this
might remind you of him I'd like to do
my impression I don't do a lot of
Impressions but this one's a good one
this will by be my impression of Mobi
you
ready hold
on got to prep here now my impression of
moobi pretty good
huh am I killing it or what probably my
best impression ever okay if you didn't
know or you're listening to this by
Audio moobi
looks disturbingly just like
me disturbingly disturbingly just like
me he's got a few more tattoos he's
younger but disturbingly like me anyway
um Mobi uh has never been banned on the
xplatform now you say to yourself why
would he be why would Mobi get banned
was he done I I'm pretty sure nobody's
even asked for him to be banned wouldn't
you agree I've never heard of him
getting in trouble for anything you said
on social media do you think he should
have has he ever done anything that
would
maybe get you banned on social media
well let me tell
you um apparently he's a he's friends
with Adam
Schiff and I guess he has a little
restaurant that Adam Schiff comes into
and they know each other pretty
well so no no that's not why he should
be banned no he shouldn't be
banned um
okay I'm being asked to do my Scott
Galloway
impression do you need my Scott Galloway
impression all right all right if you're
demanding
it here
now Professor Scott
Galloway wait am I nailing it I think
I'm nailing it how's it look is it good
pretty good okay yeah it's very good now
hold on I have one more left one more
impression now my
impression of Mobi doing an impression
of Scott
Galloway yeah what do you think pretty
good yeah those are my best Impressions
right there
all right so here are some things we
found out about Mobi apparently he's uh
uh he was a big Pusher of the steel
dossier but not because he read the news
like you and I did but because CIA
people who are his friends which he says
that he had friends who are CIA people
uh told him privately that the steel
dossier was 100% true and so he and they
asked if he would help spread the word
with his large social media platform CU
they were really sure that Trump was
some kind of a Russian asset and they
got Mobi to use his big platform to say
that steel dossier is all true and that
Trump's a whole asset now let me ask you
uh you remember when Mobi was kicked off
of all the social media platforms for
trying
to uh push a hoax which would have
changed the nature of the government in
the United States almost treasonous
except accidental in his case no no it
was never even a
conversation never even a conversation
so apparently you can say the most
outrageously politically wrong things
with no risk at all um now to his credit
I don't know if this is credit or not
but he seemed to believe it was true now
I don't have a huge problem with
somebody saying things they think are
true but but I would ask Mobi the
following
question
Mobi your friend is Adam
Schiff are you telling me that at no
time did you suspect he
wasn'ts were huh I think this guy is the
most massive liar in American history
never never came
up or we're glitching now on
locals all right I think it's
back glitching a little bit but now
we're good we're back we're back all
right
um so do you wonder now if the
CIA or or intelligence people do you
wonder if they're still acting to use um
people who have big platforms to spread
their
messages of course they are but I'm
going to add a little wrinkle to
it here's what I believe to be true but
I don't know it for sure I don't believe
that that thing we call our intelligence
blob you know the CIA and other
intelligence people who work for the US
I don't believe they're all on the same
side with each other do
you because what I
see is that uh the CIA trying to get
people that agree with them to say say
things that they want to say but I also
see it seems like they're also getting
people to say the opposite things as if
there's some group of operators who have
one opinion and they're trying to sell
it through the public and another group
who have a different opinion that
they're trying to sell through the
public and I don't know if any of it is
sanctioned it makes me wonder if the CIA
has you know a central uh
manipulation group that says all right
here's what you do you guys go try to
manipulate this network you guys go work
on NBC I don't know it might be that
they just there are a lot of people in
those
jobs who know that they know how to use
the
Press so my guess is this that there are
intelligence people who made sure that
they know people in the press and
important people
and that they have their own contacts
and when they have a a personal project
something that they want to push
political or otherwise they go to their
friends and they get them to put it in
the news but I don't think it
necessarily is coming from the top do
you do do you think it's all centrally
coordinated or is it just that lots of
people know how to do it and so they
just sort of do it automatically it's
just sort of normal routine stuff yeah
know it doesn't seem like they're all on
the same
side that's all I know all right um the
EU is about ready to pass some laws on
AI that people are acting like is a good
idea so the things that are um topic of
discussion are
copyrights so how can copyrights
possibly survive
AI I'm not even sure it's possible like
just logically how how could it
work yeah because can't my own ai go out
and find anything I want and show it to
me and modify it in any way I
want yeah then how hard would it be to
take somebody's original art and then
change it so you can't tell it's the
original but really you're taking
whatever is good about it so you're
really borrowing what's best about it as
opposed to the full art
but we do that now I mean artists
already take you know what they see
that's good in somebody else's work and
incorporate it into their own yeah I I
just don't see how it's possible in the
long run to protect copyrights which is
bad for me of
course they also say uh they don't want
face scraping so they don't want your AI
to go look for faces all over the
Internet so they can do facial
recognition how in the world do you stop
it how do you stop
that like do does anybody know if
something's getting
scraped how do you even know I it seems
too
late um how about uh and of course you
don't want to have anything you know
obscene or Reggie or anything
um yeah and they want some transparency
about the systems and blah blah blah
here's here's what I
think at the same at the same time the
EU is trying to figure out how to
regulate AI separately here's another
story um you've heard about this before
uh Brian relly talks about this you can
have your own
AI so I saw Dave David Hinkle saying he
did a fine tune last night of something
called mistol
7B uh using a 4bit quantization and some
some other technology anyway so he
tested against GPT 4 which is the
current best GPT version out there and
his own local one um they couldn't tell
the difference in the
output so competing against a 96 billion
company he's got some software running
on his own computer just locally nothing
in the cloud and it and it competed
equally and it's not connected to
anything it's just sitting there on his
computer and it's a filt a
i which is
amazing now it's not the only one you
know the like I said Brian relly as as a
version he talks about all the time and
how in the world can you regulate
something that you can run on your own
computer for example isn't the first
thing you would do if you had your own
AI is make it your
concierge and as a concierge it would
strip out all the advertising before it
presented something to you so the
advertising model should disappear why
would I ever listen to an ad ad again if
I can have my AI strip it out which it
would do
easily um even the video would just
easily strip out the ads and and give
you a new file
so uh and then what about you know that
they want it to be illegal to face
scrape well if I have my own AI going
out and talking to other
AIS that maybe did their own face
scraping and we're sharing and I I feel
like the face scraping will just become
a distributed system and then nobody can
stop
it because individuals will want to face
scrape as much as the government right
people will want to protect themselves
by knowing exactly who they're dealing
with so you're going to want you're
going to want that face scraping for
your own
protection so I think I think illegally
people will have that anyway um what
about uh the naughty stuff I've got a
feeling that the entire PornHub industry
is going to go
away because today you know you have
this real sophisticated porn industry
where you can find you know redhe heads
doing exactly what you want them to do
right you can be really specific but
imagine going to your your AI That's
just running locally and it can create
any image it has full understanding of
you know human sexual stuff so you just
say to your AI you know AI I'd like to
show I'd like you to create a 10-minute
video that has the following
characteristics and in the end I want
this to happen and I want the uh the
woman to be blonde and the guy look
Hispanic and muscular and you just tell
her what to give you and and in theory
you would serve up any celebrity you
wanted doing anything with anybody why
would you ever pay to watch an actual
human when you could see somebody who's
better than a human but looks human
can't tell the difference and they're
doing things that look exactly like real
humans so the entire porn industry
should go
away
right does does anybody disagree I don't
see how I don't see how original content
could compete with
that yeah you know maybe there's
something about knowing they're
real but I don't know I think we're so
visual we won't
care all right um so I think that the
efforts to um stop AI might succeed at
the big company level cuz if you're if
you're grock or you're Chad gbt you
could imagine that the government knows
who you are they're watching you closely
and you can't do any of these banned
activities but you're going to do it on
your own computer you know my my own AI
is not going to give me dumbass answers
like grock does I mean grock is is not
as woke but it's still very limited in
what it's willing to talk to you about
honestly all right so that's where AI is
going so have you noticed every story
becomes an Elon Musk
story every story it's either if it's AI
it's Elon Musk if it's Ukraine it's musk
if it's Gaza it's musk it's like how how
could he be in every story how's
that how could we even how's that
impossible but he's now he's part of the
hunter Biden story because Hunter Biden
called must
dumb Hunter Biden who films his crimes
and wonders why he's in
trouble calls Elon Musk
dumb okay sure uh and that Elon Musk is
not really interested in the First
Amendment he just spent $44 billion on
the first
amendment I I was say $44 billion of
belief is pretty high but okay
Hunter um but here's my fa favorite
quote this is from the Department of
Justice I saw this on Fox News yesterday
quote talking about Hunter the defendant
spent his money on drugs escorts and
girlfriends luxury hotels and rental
properties exotic cars clothing and
other items of her personal nature in
short everything but his taxes to which
which I
said
hero I
mean are you trying to make me love
him let let me describe me leading my
perfect life are you ready this is Scott
living his perfect life Scott spent his
money on drugs escorts and girlfriends
luxury hotels and rental properties
exotic cars clothing and other items of
personal nature in
short he paid his he spent money
everything but
taxes I call that
winning and if if his if his father had
not been the president he probably
wouldn't even be in trouble for it
so uh I am sympathetic to one point that
Hunter
makes I think it would be hypocritical
to say that Trump's legal problems are
entirely political which I do say I I
say that exactly even though there might
be some technical violations of some
laws and whatnot I believe that they're
so universally common those specific
kinds of technical problems that it
looks political that any one person is
in trouble for it it does seem like
selective prosecution but my
understanding of Hunter's tax situation
correct me if I'm wrong is that he paid
back all his
money hasn't he already paid all his
money back and he doesn't owe anything
to the IR
now I get I get that that doesn't make
it
legal but in the real world in the real
world if you'd paid back all of your
everything you owed would you go to
jail in the real
world I don't know the answer to that
question but I
suspect yes I I suspect that if you were
not the son of a president there would
be a little bit more working with him
you know what I mean
CU I don't really think I you know I
just don't know that that kind of person
goes to jail if you paid back
everything I don't know the answer to
that question I do see one very
qualified person saying that you would
go to the jail even if you paid back
your money IRS is
ruthless yeah I don't know but let so
let's let's make this an open question
so my open question is can you be a as
objective when you look at
Hunter as you are when you look at Trump
and say how much of this is really
political all right I I think you got to
put that standard both
ways all right um V ramaswami says the
timing of the hunter Biden tax
indictment is one more sign that the
Deep state is planning to sideline
Biden do you think
so do you think the fact that he's IND
it at all is a indication that his
father's not in control and they're
going to sideline him it's just they're
just chipping away at them because it
does seem like it would be part of a
deal doesn't
it like you're going to have to make a
deal to Pardon Hunter pardon yourself
but you're going to have to
leave right because if you stay we can't
protect both of you I feel like that's
the setup they're
giving all right um and then we're
questioning whether or not we'll ever
see any charges about the farest stuff
or possible bribery but I think even Fox
News says that that case has not been
made as far as we know so um as close as
comr is to connecting all the dots I
think it's just short just short of
connecting the dots is that your take or
do you think the dots are all connected
I mean logically they're connected you
know I have no doubt of what was really
happening so there's no question of what
was happening but in terms of a legal
standard do you think that they have a
legal case yet I don't think so I think
it's just
short but it's obviously you know the
smoke all over the place so maybe
they'll find the fire we'll
see all right uh researchers have
figured out how to 3D print uh things
inside a pig's body without opening up
the
pig let me say that
again
researchers can construct a let's say a
new heart valve or a new structure
inside a
pig without opening the
pig is that weird somehow they get the
the 3D printer ink into the pig and then
they use ultrasound to harden it in the
specific shape that it needs to be from
a
distance so they they just you know
they're doing it on a pig to maybe
someday do it on people of course now
apparently regular regular 3D printing
uses light to harden the substance but
since the you inside a pig there's no
light hogwash somebody says it's hogwash
but I think can you think of the great
pranks you could pull with that you know
imagine if you had that technology where
you could 3D print something that would
appear inside somebody's body you get
one of those machines for home you just
wait till your your buddy goes to sleep
like he passes out has too many beers
and you
say CU they used to just you know get a
magic marker and draw on people when
they they pass down drunk but with this
new 3D printing technology you
could you bring it in and you could 3D
print a a G in their
torso so the next next time they go
through go through the the metal
detector at the airport it's just a
pistol will show up in in their
thorax well that's the kind of pranks I
like to play with my friends yeah 3D
print a gun in their thorax
anyway there's a new study that says uh
that the more you use your Mobile phone
if you're a man uh the less semen
quality you
have that's right your your sperm will
be less and a lower quality the more you
use your
phone is that surprising to
you has has anybody had the following um
experience have you ever been really in
the mood for some adult
fun and maybe it's it's upcoming like in
an hour or so you think you might be in
it and then you make the mistake of
looking at your your phone or turning on
television and the television or the
phone completely sucks this the Sexual
Energy out of your body has anybody had
that
experience I swear to God I can I can
feel I can feel my
libido just being drained out of me when
I'm looking at a screen for anything
really
yeah
no maybe you're looking at porn on your
screen and it's giving you the other
yeah possibility anyway so yes so the
more you use your phone the less sperm
you have now in an unrelated story
scientists have uh Rec reported a
breakthrough and understanding whale
language so we can figure out their
whale noises I don't know if AI is part
of this or not but they've figured out
the various whale vocal izations and
pitches and vowel sounds and they
they're testing this with sperm whales
and they found out um that they can
understand the uh the sperm
whales um when they're talking now just
as a
clarification um they're called sperm
whales I didn't make that up that's the
actual name of a whale they're called
sperm whales but um
those are only the whales who don't use
cell phones the whales who use cell
phones are just called
whales I'm just going to let that sit
there for a minute that's
right if they use a cell phone they're
just called
whales okay all right I think that's
enough time I've given you enough time
to enjoy that all
right uh there's a Resurgence of
Snoopy this is sort of in my domain so
the you know Snoopy of penuts Snoopy the
dog
apparently it's having some kind of
weird social media Resurgence where
there's a little Snoopy wearing a puffy
jacket that everybody has to have they
all got to have it
so how how long can Snoopy
last you know Snoopy was uh a huge
licensing h in Japan for years after
Charles Schulz died it it just keeps on
going it's
amazing I'm very
impressed well Biden has reached a new
low in the polling according to the Wall
Street Journal in their latest poll
and you know people were asked uh in the
poll uh if Biden's policies have helped
them personally have helped them
personally what uh I'm take take a guess
what percentage of the respondents said
that Biden's policies have helped them
personally that's right you guessed the
right yeah 23 but you guess 25 and
that's that's well you got 23 very
good yeah 23% strangely enough so Biden
lags behind Trump according to this poll
uh by four four basis points 47 to 43 on
a hypothetical ballot with only two
candidates but if there's more than one
candidate his lead increases so we're
starting to get some visibility on if
the third party candidates help or hurt
him and it looks like they're going to
help
him does that surprise
you you shouldn't surprise you and
here's why Trump's support is
unmovable Biden's support is movable
that's it that's the whole story Trump
support is just locked in they're not
going
anywhere but Biden's support is
definitely fluid you know you could see
that people would say well if you could
give me any choice if I had any option
you know one of the things that the
Republicans uh are doing that really
helps Trump the fact that the
Republicans are still holding this you
know debate
format the Republicans are doing it
right in my opinion they're they're
actually showing that if if Trump falter
in any way that they've got several
strong candidates who could step right
in which I think really is good for
Trump weirdly so so the more we take
seriously the non-trump uh
Republicans the more credibility Trump
has does that make
sense it really helps Trump that we
spend a lot of time looking at the
Alternatives because if you spend a lot
of time looking at the Alternatives and
Trump still dominat
well then you feel like you did your
work right you you feel like okay we
validated him if if Trump had never been
challenged for some strange reason let's
say the primary got canceled because the
Republicans said oh he's so far ahead
why have a primary if they had done that
he would never be
legitimate so the Republicans are
legitimizing Trump by having a real a
real primary I think that's a much
bigger effect than people assume imagine
you're a Democrat you don't love Biden
you know you probably would have voted
for him you don't love him but then you
find out you don't have an
option imagine imagine Biden being your
only option right I would say the same
thing if Trump was your only option
Trump is not somebody who should ever be
your only option because he's so
divisive you never want him to be the
only option but if he still wins you
know given the existence of other
options well then you've got something
you can get behind you can say all right
everybody played everybody competed he
still won so now you can back him but
can you back Biden If he if he takes
stronger competition people who are more
capable than he is and they ban them
from competing I don't know if I if I
were a Democrat I don't think I'd
vote I I don't think that could get me
to the polls if I said really you're
giving me one choice and you and you
know exactly who you're giving me right
it's not like a difference of opinion
there's nobody who thinks Biden is
complete right there's no supporter of
Biden who says yeah he's he's 100%
nobody says that so that is just
insulting that those are your only
choices just
insulting all right
um so as you you know we're all waiting
for the next uh scop that will be the
headline between now and the election
that will be a fake news thing we're all
expecting a big fake news event uh and
sure enough someone tried to burn down
MLK's uh birth home the other day the
only reason it didn't happen is that
some tourists from Utah or something
spotted it and you know stopped it uh
here's and it was in the day day time
uh here's what you need to know about it
the perpetrator was was or is a black
woman that's right a black woman tried
to burn down MLK's birth
home now I'm not 100%
sure that that was a you know false flag
s
up but I would say more likely Mental
Illness but the the the bigger point is
that we're all waiting for something and
I love the fact that we've we've
uh smartly I think projecting into the
future that it's coming should give you
some protection when it comes because I
do think it's coming now I suspect is
more likely to be um based on some news
event that's taken out of context so I
think it's going to be more of a George
Floyd thing where there's a real thing
that happens but the effect of it or the
details are distorted to make the the
picture that's what I think less likely
than somebody going out and burning
something down
intentionally all right did you see the
pictures from Israel of the stripped
down
Palestinian uh presumably Hamas people
so they're all wearing
weirdly blue or black
underwear which is kind of
weird
and they were all they're all naked
except they little skibbies
and they're all together in a big group
and there's a picture of them now am I
wrong that that is a gigantic mistake
for Israel to allow that photo to go
anywhere now I don't know who took the
photo but it was probably a mistake to
make them
naked and sit in one place for long
enough for somebody to take a photo now
I know what you saying so let me say the
counter argument Scott don't you know
they have to make them strip because
they might have you know bombs on their
back or something I know I know but how
long do you need somebody to sit in a in
a group of other naked men uh looking
completely humiliated after they're
they're naked I don't know about you but
I can look at a naked man and determine
whether a bomb is strapped to his body
very quickly I can do it in well let me
do
it no no nope no no bomb there took me
about a
second so you're telling me that you
needed to collect all these people up
put them in one place you know shoulder
toh shoulder in the most submissive
kneeling you know conquered position and
you got to take a freaking photograph of
that I would say this is the
first major PR Mistake by Israel
this is a huge mistake and apparently
happened more than once there's at least
two places that they've done this how do
you feel about
it again I'm 100% you know backing
Israel's actions um so you know they got
to do what they got to do but what do
you think of this you which by the way I
assume is not Israel's policy I imagine
they're very unhappy that these pictures
got but
this this is pretty big in my
mind this frames them in not the way
they want to get framed right because
they're trying not to look like bullies
they're they're trying to portray
themselves as the you know the victim
class at least in terms of October 7th
and use that as their you know their
authority to go forward but that's the
kind of picture that can really organize
the world against them cuz that did not
look
like a
necessity yeah let me say that again the
fact that it didn't look
necessary um that that changes how you
feel about it you know changes how you
feel
anyway um we'll see how they do with
that all right here's my reframe for you
today I'm going to change some of your
lives now I say that only because there
enough people here at the moment that if
only a few of you found this useful it
would be life changing it goes like this
uh are you aware that it feels like
sometimes you've got different
personalities in your head do you do you
have that feeling like there's the you
know if you're in my case the creative
version of me the artist in me is a very
distinct personality and when I'm in my
artist head I'm very much in my artist
head it's almost like it's a different
person likewise you know in you might be
in your student head your work head you
know there's your hangry you know you're
hungry because you're have an eaten head
so you've got all these Personalities in
there right and it feels like it feels
like uh you're one person but you have a
bunch of characteristics is that the way
you think of yourself do you all think
of yourself as your one person and then
you have a bunch of characteristics some
good some bad but you're one person your
one
mind that's the way I normally think now
here's what uh gave me the idea for this
reframe uh as you know I mention it too
often I've been learning to play the
drums and the hard part about learning
the drums is getting limb Independence
you you need your arms and your legs to
be doing very different things at the
same time you know one's doing eighth
notes one doing quarter notes and you
know your foot is doing a tune at the
same time now
when you first try to do it it seems
impossible because your limbs want to
move together they they don't have a
sense that they could be independent but
if you keep doing it you you split your
brain into four or maybe five different
parts and you can actually play and move
your Consciousness to each of those
brains so I could be playing with all my
limbs and say to myself hey right arm
let's check in on you and I can move my
Consciousness to my right arm arm and my
left arm is still keeping time and so
are my feet how the hell right so so
because I have this sense fairly almost
every day that I practice uh I have the
sense of splitting my brain into four or
five separate
brains and yesterday I was just going
for a walk and had the following thought
that just froze
me I I actually got goosebumps when I
thought about
it I realized that there's one
personality of
mine that runs the
others and until I gave it a
name it didn't have much power to me it
was like oh there's a crowd in there it
seems like but really it's just
me and I gave it a
name it's the
executive and when I as soon as I named
it everything felt
different because now I think of myself
as competing
Minds right there's the artist mind who
wants to come out sometimes there's the
the angry one the smart one you maybe
the emotional one
Etc but the one I can count
on there's one I can count on because
it's the boss of the other ones there's
only one of my Minds that can make the
other Minds cooperate it's the
executive and as soon as I gave it a
name I could feel it it actually
summoned the
executive so right now I'm in performer
head so you know you go into a head when
you're performing because there's a
crowd performer head is not the
executive right but the executive is
watching and the executive takes a lot
of time off the executive doesn't get
involved right if you're a little hangry
because you haven't eaten the executive
might get involved but it doesn't
care do you know when the executive
needs to get involved and when it
does here's how it feels like to
me the executive gets involved when
you've
decided I've made that distinction
between wanting something and deciding
you the other parts of you want stuff
the artist eny wants
something right the emotional part of me
wants something my um my aggressive part
wants something we a bunch of at once
but my
executive is is like Darth
Vader when the executive gets involved
you can feel all of your other brain say
I'm sorry I'm
sorry I didn't mean it I'm sorry because
the executive doesn't around right
the executive just does the
business let me put it this
way if if I if I had a home
invasion let's say where I get mugged or
something if my emotional brain came out
I'd be dead right or if my artist came
out or something if the wrong if the
wrong me came out I'm dead but if the
executive comes out you're
dead that's how it
feels now obviously you know that's not
literally true
but try this reframe
tell yourself that one of your brains is
the executive and it can control the
rest cu the rest just want stuff and
wanting is not powerful deciding is
powerful so give your give your
executive a name I call it the executive
you could call it the chairman you could
call it the
boss and then tell yourself the next
time you've got a challenge let's say
the next time you're tempted by
something call the
executive just call the
executive now I don't think you can
understand the power of this until you
feel it in in real time so I'll I'll
check back with you just uh give a name
to that part of you that's in control
and call the executive when you need to
just take care of
business because um and I'll give you
the best example there there are
sometimes things that you put off
because they're
unpleasant the executive doesn't do that
the executive never puts it off because
it's unpleasant the executive doesn't
that's what it's for it doesn't hesitate
doesn't ask questions just doesn't so
call your executive when you need it
that is your reframe for the day YouTube
thanks for joining and I'll see you
tomorrow if the technology Gods allow
