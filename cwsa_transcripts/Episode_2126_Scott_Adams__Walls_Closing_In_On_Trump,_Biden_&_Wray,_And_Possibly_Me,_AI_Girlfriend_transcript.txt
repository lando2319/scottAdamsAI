[Music]
do do
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams who's
never been a finer time in your life uh
it's only going to get better from here
but if you'd like to get a little bump
of dopamine possibly a little
oxytocin then all you need is a copper
mug or glass a tanker cellist iron again
team Joker flask of vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure
yeah the dopamines of the day I was just
saying I knew I was forgetting something
and it was my microphone
sure enough
here we go I knew something was wrong
and now we're all good aren't we
aren't we
everybody's happy now
all right how would you like to do the
simultaneous sip it happens now go
ah
delightful
I saw a conversation on Instagram
yesterday and a little real which means
I don't know if there's any real science
behind it but the claim was this have
you ever heard this
that the the free market and the
business world
is designed for dopamine feedback
meaning that if you do something well in
the in the free market you get a raise
or some kind of Victory you get a little
dopamine hit that's good people like
dopamine
however the claim was that men operate
on dopamine rewards and women who work
on oxytocin Rewards and they're
different which was me which means that
if you insert a woman who uses oxytocin
as her operating system into a financial
system that's dopamine based
it might not be a perfect fit
is that interesting now of course
everybody uses both I mean we all like
dopamine and we all like oxytocin but
oxytocin is the drug that makes you feel
bonded and secure and in love basically
and dopamine is just the one that you
just had a good time
so men are operating on having a good
time and women are operating on trying
to get that bonding feeling going and
you can see why we would be confused
about each other we are literally not
the same operating system
say well I saw that uh there's going to
be a new release of Hunter's laptop
pictures
and you know what we can't get enough of
I don't know about you but just today I
was thinking there's only one thing that
could really make my life better
I would like to see Hunter Biden's penis
from every angle
am I alone I don't think I'm alone in
that
yeah we need to see it from every angle
we need to see close-ups uh yeah we need
to see the whole thing if you leave at
one angle I I'm not even going to know
what I'm looking at
so good news for everybody we'll see
lots more dirty Hunter pictures
meanwhile in Canada Canada has decided
that it's not good enough to put the
warnings on cigarette packages
they're going to start putting the
warnings on the cigarettes themselves so
there'll be a little message along the
the length of the cigarette so some of
the things they're going to say are like
say grass cause cancer of course but
here's my favorite one cigarettes cause
impotence
do you remember when people used to
smoke cigarettes because it made them
look cool
well I can't think of anything less cool
than smoking is something that says it
might cause impotence right on the right
on the cigarette
that that takes persuasion to the point
of Cruelty it's like wow that's
persuasive
but I think they can take it to another
level what do you think
I think that it's not enough just to
print right on the cigarette in Canada
cigarettes cause impotence
I think they should there should be a
law that the cigarette can't be just a
tube
you know right now it's just like a long
tube
it leaves a couple of balls on the end
so there should be like some requirement
that your cigarette has balls
so when you put it in your mouth
you know it might look cool for some
segment of society but for others maybe
it would be one more reason to quit who
knows who knows
just a thought
so Terry Reed the woman who famously
accused Joe Biden of some sexual stuff
that was never proven
um she moved to become a citizen of
Russia
now
uh let me give you a little uh whisk
blower tip
all right if you make a claim
about somebody in our government
and then you end up moving to Russia
that does not help your claim
it kind of makes you look like maybe it
was Russian all along
now I'm not saying it was
I'm just saying it's a it's a bad look
when your mysterious
accuser suddenly moves to Russia and is
fully embraced
yeah yeah she's afraid for her life in
the United States
okay I mean she might be that could be
true but it's a bad look don't move to
Russia is what I'm saying
if you're if you're claiming anything
that's controversial at all
all right uh I told you uh yesterday I
guess that there was this new Battery
Technology
using a material called vanadium
and apparently it would be a really big
deal
if it can be developed further now I
didn't I didn't know at the time that
it's already being refined
so this Vanadium stuff is not so much
hypothetical
but there are three places where it's
being refined I learned today uh Russia
Brazil and Arkansas
those are the three places that are big
with Vanadium Vanadium is a new material
for making batteries
that could be way better than the
current technology or at least as good
and and that would be a big breakthrough
in cost and reliability and all that
yeah so apparently the best refiners of
vanadium
is in Arkansas
so
it could be that Arkansas will become
you know big battery
making
the center of the world maybe because we
don't want to depend on Russia or Brazil
for our supply we've certainly learned
that
well in the let's put this next story in
the category of the the most predictable
story
of all stories
is anything uh
is anything more predictable than the
fact that in the news today there's a
tech developer who's going to clone his
girlfriend with chat GPT and he's making
an AI version of her and apparently she
can even take AI versions of selfies and
send to him
so was that the most predictable story
in all of Technology
there was no way that wasn't going to
happen so now we have we have ai that
can make an avatar of a person so
obviously you can make an avatar of your
chosen mate
then you could give that person a voice
that mimics the voice of the real person
so obviously you're going to make an
avatar of anybody you want and they'll
talk just like that person and they'll
be able to have a conversation but you
can also give it a personality
because you could give it a body of
writing for example and say this is your
personality you know conform to this
and it will just be that
so here's my question
do you think he programmed it
to have all of the let's say the less
positive characteristics of his
girlfriend or did he just put in the
good ones
for example will his AI complain about
him not doing enough
do you think the AI will complain will
the AI start a fight with him just to
get attention
just to test him
will the AI do that
will the AI be really angry at him for
no reason whatsoever
I don't know
and and so here's the funny part
this guy is creating a competitor for
his girlfriend
that his is that is a copy of his
girlfriend
minus all the up parts
how is she going to compete with that
you know anybody who's ever been in a
relationship knows that it's no more
than half good right like after a while
after a while it's no more than a 50
good and it's fifty percent you know
Terror and awfulness what if he takes
the the 50 awful apart out of the out of
the Clone how's the real one going to
compete with that
I mean that I mean that literally How
could a real woman compete with that
don't now when I say I'm sure that
everybody laughs right when I say how
can the real woman compete with her own
clone that removes her bad parts
you kind of think that's just funny
right
oh that's just like an amusing comedic
you know observation
this not it is not a comedic observation
it might be the biggest problem in the
world
because it's going to make reproduction
look like a bad deal
it really is it really genuinely is
going to make reproduction kind of a
challenge
and relationships and everything else
I once had an idea of producing what I
would call
uh
G-rated pornography for men
G-rated pornography for men
and it would feature a man coming home
from a hard day at work
and his wife being really nice to him
that would be the whole show
[Laughter]
that's it
she just really cares about him and asks
him how she can make him happy and
maybe brings him his favorite beverage
gives a little back rub
says she really appreciates all he does
for her and that's it that's the little
show
no plot so it be the reason I call it
porn is that you wouldn't be watching it
for the story
you know you don't really care about
their whole life you're just like oh I'd
like to see what would that look like
to have a man who's just like treated as
a you know as a valued part of the
household and stuff
that'd be cool yeah sorry 50s style
exactly now I believe in modern lingo
that would be called a Trad wife have
you heard of that term
t-r-a-d short for traditional as in 50s
kind of you know man is out of the
household woman does the cooking sort of
thing
okay
Travis everything is what I'm going for
well there you go
well so maybe that'll happen someday
um
I saw a story that at the close of the
market yesterday someone unknown sold 33
million shares of Apple at the close and
that's a 5.8 billion dollars worth
5.8 billion dollars
now here's what here's what I wondered
I wondered if whoever did that selling
on the same experience I did
because the reason I sold my Apple stock
so I don't own any and by the way I'm
not recommending this I'm not
recommending it
I'm just describing right do not do what
I do financially it is not a good idea
trust me it's not a good idea
but the reason that I got rid of my
Apple stock is that I'd spend a week or
two playing with AI
and then I tried to use my Apple s i r i
I don't want to trigger them to do
anything
and as soon as you use the Apple version
of you know that little thing you talk
to and you and you compare that to any
AI
it looks like they just gave up
I can't imagine a world in which Steve
Jobs is behind
on this technology
can you imagine Apple being behind
on this like way behind Way Way Beyond I
mean because Siri doesn't even look like
a real product in 2023. it looks like a
joke
well we'll see
we'll see if Apple can pull it out if he
had to bat don't don't bet my way it's I
think the safer bet is that Apple will
do something really big with AI
they'll just wait and try to get it
right but at the moment they really look
like they're not a current technology
and my biggest fear is that the entire
App Store
concept of the iPhone the entire
ecosystem doesn't make sense if you
could just have an operating system this
Ai and it does all of those things
so if you need a date your AI figures
out and do it
you don't need a dating app if you need
to do some math you don't need a
spreadsheet
just tell tell the AI what you want and
it'll produce it for you
so I think we're we're approaching the
point where uh the only interfaces
you're talking to a intelligent entity
your your AI wife will sing the theme
song from Miami Vice
that's very specific
good comment there
all right Mike m says Trad wives all day
long men how many of you wish you had a
Trad wife or maybe you do if you have
one you could just say you want one
there's nobody asked it
it's like a wall of yes
you had one got one yes
and you're happier because of it right
are you happier because you have a Trad
wife
is there anybody who wishes that they
had more of a more of a feminist
independent
partner
PJ says why are men scared of real women
is that what's going on
is that what you saw did you see men
were afraid of real women that's why
you're picking up from this conversation
I don't think that's exactly what's
going on
not exactly
well maybe it's just going to be some
reversion to the meme going on
yeah you know what's interesting is
let me here's a hypothesis that's brand
new I'm just making it up on the Fly
would you say that men as a strategy try
to figure out what it is that women want
and then they try pretty hard to give it
to them
would you say that's true
men try to figure out what women want
and they try to give it to them now that
where it all goes off the rails is that
women lie about what they want
so you can never get it right or or they
can't be pleased some would say there's
nothing that makes them happy so so it's
basically uh you end up being like a
gerbil on a treadmill I can make you
happy today if only I'll do a little bit
more all right that wasn't enough but I
think I can make you happy today
yesterday was a loser I did everything I
could but it didn't work out but today
I'm just going to work through your list
of things you want me to do I'm going to
put that shirt on you want me to wear
I'm going to do what you want me to do
it won't work out won't work out yeah
um but do women do the same thing
aside from looking good
which of course women do put effort into
looking good for men do they also put
effort into doing whatever would make
men happy as best they understand it
is that a thing
we see some yeses we see some yeses but
I think that's the Trad wife talking
maybe the Trad wives do
maybe that's the difference
all right
narcissistic abuse to put a man on a
treadmill and never give him any
positive reinforcement it does seem like
narcissistic abuse
you try very hard to please your husband
well
all right let me speak for a moment
to the viewer who said I try very hard
to please my husband
I would like to
put a little color on that comment
you you try very hard to please your
husband
so let's see what would be included in
that would would uh let's say
doing shopping for his clothes maybe
buying him a new shirt
that he didn't ask for would that be
part of it
buying things for him
with his money or with your shared money
I guess
uh
yeah
yeah the problem is I don't know if
women understand what men need
we just need a sandwich and a
am I right man
because the sandwich and a are
both appreciation
they're basically physical
manifestations of appreciation and we
work for appreciation
we're just appreciation animals oh okay
as long as you appreciate it I'll do
that would you bang your head against
this wall
would you appreciate it yes I would okay
I'll bang my head against the wall I
just need that appreciation that's all
I'm working for
so sandwich in a blow job is really just
the physical version of the the
appreciation
all right well if you understand what
men want then trying to please them
seems like it'd be crazy
um more examples of poorly run in
California my state that is total
garbage
uh so some insurers are pulling out of
the state
and I didn't know the details of why
this is going to make your head explode
this is why State Farm and some others
don't want to offer Insurance home
insurance in California
is the only state I saw this in the Wall
Street Journal California is the only
state that forces insurers to base their
rates
on the past
it's the only state
and do you know what's wrong with the
past
it does not describe the future
right so in California our forests are
getting drier and less managed
so things are much more dangerous in
terms of fire than they ever have been
before
now insurance companies are fine with
that normally they just say well you
live in a combustible State we'll charge
you a lot for that and you'll have
insurance and we'll make money and
you'll pay too much for it but that's
not our fault
and then everybody have insurance but in
California you have to set the rate
based on what the forest fire situation
used to be
just think about that you know we've
clearly entered a period where
because of climate or Forest management
or whatever it is the the risk of a fire
in California is way higher next year
than you know the average of any year in
the past and the insurance company can't
set the rates based on that
how much how much worse could you run a
state
it's the only one all of the other
states still have this problem just
because they're not incompetent they let
the free market do what the free market
wants to do
how hard is that
I mean all the other states got it right
all the other states
the California can't figure it out
so we don't get insurance our houses
just burn up
insane speaking of California in Oakland
which you might know is uh one of the
more dangerous places to go I certainly
would never step foot in Oakland
I've been invited to Oakland a few times
in the past you know a few years and I
always just laugh
they go seriously
you think there's any reason that would
get me to Oakland
there's nothing there isn't anything you
could be the Nobel prize in
Oakland and I'd say mail it to me I'm
not going to step foot in Oakland that's
just not going to happen
so there was a video of a meeting in
which the citizens were outraged about
all the crime especially the violent
stuff and the physical stuff and there
was a big crowd people who had joined to
say that the lack of policing had gone
too far
and the woman who was talking asked a
show of hands how many of them had been
assaulted
just physically assaulted
and an alarming number of people raised
their hands physically assaulted you
know I'm not talking about a property
crime just their body was physically
assaulted somewhere in the street and
it's like everybody's raising their hand
how often do you get assaulted just
walking down the street in Oakland looks
like it's a daily occurrence
anyway so that's another poor California
management
another topic uh I'm going to talk about
this because it Rhymes did you know that
America has a birth dearth
yeah there's a dearth of births
they said the birth dearth which is
really the only reason I'm talking about
this story is so I could say birth to
Earth
now you're going to say they're home
you have to say it
say it on your own everybody you have to
say it birth and Earth it's just too fun
not to say
you can feel it right as soon as I said
it you said to yourself I have to say
that
birth death
and then you felt okay well
so here's here's what makes me think we
live in a simulation
how do you explain the fact
that the human population is stalling
and starting to decrease
at exactly the time the AI is going to
take jobs
does that feel like a little bit too on
the nose
like how could those two things happen
at the same time
that the the exact answer
to AI taking all our jobs is fewer
people
right now what's our other biggest
problem
when you say inflation
inflation is a terrible problem do you
know what is the best solution to
inflation
and Improvement in productivity
so that one person can make more stuff
then that stuff will be less cost per
unit because it is made more cheaply and
then people pay less for stuff and
that's that's the answer to inflation
so it's kind of weird
that all of our problems the big ones I
would I would argue that climate is also
something that will be solved by AI
for example if you wanted to have a
proper Fusion reactor which would
certainly get you closer to solving all
the climate issues if there are any
um
you didn't you need AI to keep your
Fusion reactor optimized so there's a
whole bunch of places where AI will
probably figure out better battery
technology and a bunch of stuff like
that
so it's kind of weird that AI is coming
along at exactly the time when it's sort
of the only thing that would solve our
other biggest problems
isn't that weird everything from you
know climate and energy to
um too too many people old not enough
young workers inflation
even loneliness what about loneliness
what about health care
these are all things that AI is going to
be insanely
um useful
for mitigating those problems
I don't know it just it's such a weird
coincidence that you could have 14
billion years of of this universe
and then that in this little slice of
time
that those things all happen at the same
time
now it could be it's just a symptom of
an advanced civilization so maybe it's
not a coincidence but I'm glad it's
happening
all right
um bright bright barge was reporting
that according to polls Trump beats
DeSantis on essentially every important
policy issue
it's not even close
now this unfortunately plays very much
into the uh DeSantis is the tribute band
yeah this is a tribute band
that's the problem
most situations let's take a more
classic example let's take uh Joe Biden
versus RFK Jr
RFK Jr is not the weak version of Joe
Biden or vice versa
it's not like one is just you know a
little better than the other
they have different ideas
you know the things that RFK Jr would do
are very much not the things that that
Joe Biden would do so if you're looking
at those two that's a real choice
would you say if you say oh I like a
little bit more of these Biden
opinions than these RFK Jude your
opinions that's a real choice
but if you look at Trump and DeSantis
the only thing that's different
because their policies are largely the
same
at least the ones they're serious about
right they're largely the same
um
I don't know how I don't know how
DeSantis can make an argument except
that he would attract less negative
attention
but what's happening
as soon as DeSantis gets some purchase
uh MSNBC starts calling him the
the tiny Mussolini
which is super racist by the way
yeah work with me here for a moment true
or false if you're if if the Democrats
are calling Trump uh Hitler
because Trump is German by ancestry
and they're calling DeSantis uh
Mussolini
that's not racist
I mean seriously
how is that not super obviously racist
like that's that's right out there is
there any interpretation needed
I I don't think so
that to me looks 100 cleanly racist
yeah
so if so if we get a Cambodian American
guy running for president are they going
to call him Pol Pot
you betcha you betcha do you know why
because apparently they can be racist
right in front of you without any kind
of blowback
there's no blowback they could just be
overtly racist
it's not even a story
because they decided it wasn't a story
and I can't make it a story so it's just
not
yeah all right
um and this is the weirdest story I do
not know what to make of this story
so allegedly
there is some document called an FD 1023
which I'm told they don't this is an FBI
document that writes up some story from
an informant
now
my understanding is that they don't use
that form unless the informant is
credible in their opinion
so in other words the form itself is
telling you that the FBI believes that
it's not necessarily true
but that the source has weight it's a
trusted source
and The Trusted source
allegedly but the Republicans haven't
seen it they're asking to see it but
there's some whistleblower says it
exists and apparently director Ray
confirms it exists
and it seems to show
documented evidence this is the claim
this is not confirmed uh documented
evidence of the Biden family taking
money for
political favors which would be illegal
now
question number one do you believe that
if we were to ever see this document
because Comer and
uh whoever else is trying to get a hold
of it but the FBI doesn't want to give
it to him
apparently director Ray has offered that
they can see it
so they can see it in a skiff
but then the Republicans are saying
that's not good enough has to be
released now
that's kind of interesting isn't it
because the skiff would tell me that
it's a pretty big
if you put it in the skiff that means
that nobody can take a copy they can
only go read it in a protected place
that would be for the most sensitive
secrets
the most sensitive secrets
what is it about this document that
makes it that
why is this a skiff only document is it
because it's so dangerous to Biden
is it because they don't know if it's
true it could be that they don't know if
it's true which would make it dangerous
right and that would be a good reason to
restrict it if they didn't think it was
true necessarily true
um
but
I here's the thing that's missing in the
story
correct me if I'm wrong but at no time
has director Ray who seems to confirm
that this document exists he has never
characterized it
is that true
he's only said it exists
but he's not characterized it isn't that
like really really missing
let me give you an example
if he knew that it was a big nothing
don't you think he would have
characterized it as a big nothing but
yes you can see it I'll let you see it
in the skiff but I'm telling you you're
wasting your time because it's a big
nothing
right
so that's that suggests to me
that that director Ray thinks there's
some chance it's a big something
am I wrong
because otherwise otherwise he would
either give it to him now I do
understand why he might not want to give
you know sensitive things to people even
if they ask even if they have a right
there could be a real security reasons
why you don't do that
but not characterizing it is really
missing
or how about this uh yes the document
exists and yes I'll let you see it but
my issue is that it's not a hundred
percent
um verified
so it might cause more rumors than than
it should
that would be useful
right wouldn't you consider that good
and useful characterization of it we
don't know if it's true therefore if you
look at it and get all worked up that
might be causing problems but we'll put
it into skiff so you can see for
yourself
I would consider that fairly credible if
he said that
but just saying we do have it and you
can't you can't get a copy
suggests that they want to keep the
ability to mischaracterize it
in other words if they let the
Republicans in to look at it but they
couldn't take a copy and show it to us
then we would have to believe the
Republicans point of view
and then the Democrats could simply say
we looked at it too and it doesn't say
that
right and then that's the end of the
story the Democrats could say we looked
at it too it doesn't say that
that's all that's the end of it and we
would never know because we can't see it
then the Republicans would say you're
lying it does say that
and the Democrats will say well too bad
nobody else gets to see it and we say
it's not there
so it's a tie
wow
now I've also heard
uh that the reason the FBI or the
Department of Justice is slow allegedly
slow walking Hunter Biden's you know
investigation is they're actually trying
to slow walk it past the statute of
limitations
and they have a good shot at doing it
it's at least seven years or something I
don't know what the actual limit is for
any various allegations
but it looks like they've gone four or
five years
how many years have they dragged it out
so far
and does that mean that Joe Biden
does that mean that Joe Biden needs to
have another four years
to get Hunter over the statute of
limitations because I think that nobody
in the government is going to challenge
the president
I think it's too dangerous
so I think that
if Joe Biden can stay in office four
more years
I think he can pull Hunter over the the
finish line going to pass the statute of
limitations is that the whole is that
the whole reason the country is
is being
you know suffering under abiding
so he can keep his son out of jail
because if you ask me why somebody who's
400 years old wants a second term
I can only think it's personal
that does not seem political to me
right it feels like Joe is only running
to protect uh Hunter because he's the
only one who can do it he's the only one
who can do it you know if you put you
put a republican in their hunters in a
lot of trouble
I would think or Biden probably thinks
so let me ask you uh given that there is
one source saying this document that
exists and that has damning information
on it do you think that that one source
The Whistleblower
maybe there's more than one
whistleblower give me a fact check is
there more than one whistleblower
who has seen the fd-1023 form and says
it's damning oh I'm saying yes as
there's more than one
okay more than one changes the story
completely
in my opinion if we're only one
then I would say well that's a wait and
see
if it's two or three and they separately
have the same story
then I'd start to think there's
something there
but
I guess I'm
I guess I think I'm expecting to be
underwhelmed if we should ever see it
I don't believe the wall is closing it
or the walls are closing do you
do you think Comer has the goods this
time because it feels exactly like shift
chasing Trump the walls are closing in
it just doesn't feel like it's going to
close in
uh the FBI will release after Trump's
arrest
Maybe
all right
um
here's the latest hoax
Trump hoax you know there's going to be
more
but this is what I call a double tap
hoax
so a double tap Trump hoax is where they
they do the hoax itself
and then Trump reacts to the hope the
hoax and the way he reacts to the hoax
creates the second tap
so for example
they might say he's trying to overthrow
the government
and then he says no I'm not and you know
maybe maybe I would fire the people who
were investigating me for this because
it's all Bs
and then they take the fact that he
would fire the people behind the hoax
as proof that he's an authoritarian
so they get two Taps out of one hoax The
hoax itself
and then when he says he'll react to the
hoax you know by getting rid of the
people who who persecuted him
that he's an authoritarian a second hoax
they can hoax themselves all the way to
the bottom of the well
so the current one is that there's some
some existence of it audio in which
Trump says he kept some classified
documents related to a plan to attack
Iran
and apparently it was a General Mark
Billy's write-up of his plan for
attacking Iran
which it looks like uh Trump may have
turned down several times
now why do you think Trump would want to
keep that document
of Mark milley with an Iran attack plan
why would he want that of all the things
he could keep why would he want that
I have a theory
because it makes mark milley look like
the dumbest guy in the world
and a warmonger and somebody who's going
to get you all killed
I think he wanted that document to prove
that his generals were idiots
because he said that directly which by
the way just makes me love him
you know I I've got lots of things I can
complain about Trump just like all of us
do I can come up with a list it would
look a lot like yours
but when he says that his generals are
idiots
I 100 believe him
I actually believe that the man with no
military experience Trump would be far
more trustworthy than any of his
generals
because the generals are locked into the
military-industrial complex and that
makes them completely non-credible
I wouldn't believe any of them
I don't think they have any credibility
in our current system and Mark milley
in my opinion
whenever I see him talk I think to
myself
why does he seem dumb
because there are plenty of politicians
that you know maybe are kind of dumb but
at least when they talk in public they
can put on a good show
you know don't you think there are some
politicians that you think are maybe not
up to the job but they could still do a
speech it still sounds you know good for
their side
but Mark Billy no matter what he talked
about looked down to me like he just
screams dub
and that scares a out of me because
he's the guy with the you know the
military might
I my guess this is just a guess just
speculation I think Trump had the same
opinion of them that he's actually just
dumb
and he wanted a document that proved it
that might be why you have the document
I'm just speculating I don't know I
can't read any Minds
all right
um
so there's a study uh CNN a little
article that says that people who swear
have certain characteristics
huh and there are certain benefits of
swearing hmm
do you know anybody who would fall into
this category
apparently swearing is correlated with
high intelligence
but only if you do it well you know if
you're just doing f-bombs and n words
and stuff you know that that's not the
clever kind of swearing but apparently
it's correlated with high intelligence
swearing is a sign of honesty
it can lower it can improve your pain
tolerance and it's correlated with
creativity
so do you know what I say when the study
says that swearing
is correlated with high intelligence
honesty lower pain tolerance and
creativity
 yeah
yeah
all right University of North Carolina
Medical School
this is this is my favorite story of the
day They too had a Dei task force
that came up with some suggestions
and when they came up with their
suggestions and the University of North
Carolina Medical School looked at these
suggestions they thought the best thing
they could do was disband the Dei task
force
I got a suggestion for you how about
everything you did as a complete waste
of time and ridiculous and you're all
fired
so that's what happened there and some
of their recommendations were that the
medical students there would be required
to study topics such as quote
unconscious bias awareness
understanding and responding to
microaggressions and quote understanding
that America's Medical system is
structurally racist
at the administrators at the school said
well how about we just get rid of all of
you guys and then everything's fine
all right well you get to see more of
that
um so there's evidence now from the
Democrats that the GOP apparently was
willing to default
to let America default on its uh
obligations if they didn't get some
changes to the uh the debt relief and
budget
now
I heard that described as uh Republicans
you know being either Reckless or bad or
dangerous or something
uh because it was a
representative Liu who was saying it so
that was a Democrats perspective is that
the Republicans were really really on
dangerous territory and were literally
willing to let the country default
default
if they didn't get their Republican
stuff into the legislation
now what do you think about that
to which I say
finally
finally
they weren't bluffing that you do you
know the best bluff if you're
negotiating the best Bluff is not
bluffing
to you're actually willing to do the
thing you're willing to do and there's
no doubt about it apparently the
Republicans
and I'm going to give them a sitting
Ovation for this apparently McCarthy
convinced the Democrats that in the real
world they would prefer default over the
Democrats plans
and you know I agree I would have I
would have preferred
that the government default with all of
the disruption that causes
I prefer that and apparently the
Republicans were ballsy enough to prefer
it and also communicate it
and they sold it
because they they got some stuff no
nobody gets everything right we get to
complain about your own side this is
this is when you do that
but
um if I had a complaint about that it
would be that they should have gotten
more
uh
here's what I'd like I'd like to see
some legislation
that says if we don't you know reduce
our debt by x amount in the coming
budget requirements or budget you know
negotiations that there's no
negotiations
that if we miss our Target this year and
let's say the national debt increases if
the national debt increases I would like
in legislation to says next year every
budget item will be cut by the same
percentage
one percent five percent whatever it is
do you don't think that every budget
could be cut by five percent
yeah good
yeah that's how every Big Business does
this because I I used to work in uh the
budgeting and forecasting parts of big
businesses that was primarily my job
budget forecasting and
I can't tell you how many times I went
through the following process
I would talk to each manager and find
out what budget they needed for the year
I would sum them all up now take them to
the big boss and it would be more than
the big boss thought he could get for
his budget and he'd say all right this
is great just tell everybody to cut
their cut by 10 percent
and I would say oh wait wait that's
crazy that's crazy these people did a
lot of work to figure out how much they
really need to do the job
if you just cut them 10 there'll be all
these people who just can't do the thing
your whole operation will evaporate
and then the top manager looked at me
and he smiled and he said
tell them to cut everything 10 percent
and I Foster a little bit more
and then he said
10 percent
and I walked out and I told everybody to
cut their budget by 10 do you know what
happened
they all cut their budget by 10
everything was fine
they all cut their budget by 10
everything was fine
everything
was fine
you don't think the government can do
that
of course they can of course they can
and the worst thing we could do is is
let Congress negotiate the details
that's the worst thing you could do
which is what they do don't let them
negotiate details just tell them they
have 10 net less for everything next
year
and you're done
now suppose there's a new thing you need
you some let's say AI
legislation group you know some group
that manages AI federally so you need to
fund them okay
a hundred percent of all that money for
the new thing
comes out of the existing things in in
an equal way so for the new thing
everybody is you know 0.01 percent
lessen their budget so it's not just ten
percent it's 10.02
everybody could live with that
now you say to yourself well but what
about the things that are based on
population
you know such as they're just more
people who need more services to which I
say figure it out
figure it out it's how businesses do it
they they have to do more with less
all the time
they don't have a choice you're always
doing more with less it's just the basic
management you know reality
so
I would like uh I would like our
government to do less and if they can't
hit the well here's the way I put it
every one of the individual budget
things that the government needs are
important in their own way
but they're all subsidiary to the fact
that you can't spend more than you have
forever
so that just has to be a bigger a bigger
objective and if we can't agree on a
budget that would reduce it
it just has to be ten percent across the
board or whatever the percent is
and and just move on
all right
but I like the fact that the uh the the
original Destiny idea from the Democrats
was so bad
that Republicans were literally willing
to default the whole country to not do
it
and like I say that's that's the city
Ovation I give you a standing ovation if
maybe they got a little bit more reduced
the debt more or something like that but
that's a setting ovation
that's adequate that's an adequate job
so it's a good on good on adequate for
McCarthy
all right not ideal but adequate
well I'm pretty sure this is the best
live stream you're going to see today is
there a story I forgot
anything that you were hoping I would
talk about that I didn't
um what convinced the Democrats they
were serious probably just the way they
acted and the fact that there wasn't
much
there weren't enough people breaking
with the majority I guess
what companies have you successfully run
with verifiable proof whenever you talk
about your past you always claim
whatever the topic is you used to do
uh what made you such a douchebag
was there something that hurt you and
you know did somebody touch you in the
wrong way
why would you even ask that question in
such an away
I might be the most easily verifiable
person in the world
do you know how many thousands of people
are completely aware that I had the jobs
that I say I had and how easy it would
be to to check it
has anybody ever doubted it like you
don't think I work for a bank and did
budgets
really would I make that up I just made
up a whole job and I thought I'd get
away with it is that what you think
yeah Trump increased the debt as well
absolutely
yeah I I think we can be adult enough to
say Trump did some things great some
things average and some things you
absolutely wish he didn't do
anybody have a problem with that
why can't we just talk about it honestly
some stuff great some stuff average some
stuff totally wish he hadn't done
and that would be true for all the
presidents but I mean we're just going
to be like idiots if we just say he's
he's the Golden Boy and does no wrong
and yeah I'm not on that train now I
know it seemed like that in 2016.
because I kept telling you that the
things other people said were mistakes
were not mistakes but that's because I
was right
it's just because I was right that's why
I said it
all right
um
oh Twitter band The what is a woman
documentary today for a speech and
misgendering
and Matt Walsh is threatened to walk
away from Twitter
huh
Twitter bands one is a woman so that's
the
little Matt Walsh video
that's interesting I'd like I need to
know more about that I don't know if
that's a musk decision or not
might be by the way Elon Musk is back to
richest man in the world although I
don't think that's real
do you think that we know who the
richest person in the world is
because I think you have to you have to
include the dictators as owning all of
the wealth of the nation right because
they have control over it
so I would imagine you've got some you
know Arab Nation oil countries that are
bigger
Tate is there some Andrew Tate news
coming out
uh
yeah the Vatican Maybe
yay and Adidas what's up with the A and
Adidas I don't know anything about that
can you believe that yay got married
is that weird
I was not expecting him to get married
again yeah he got married again
to a woman
they say
uh why is RFK wrong that new plants
should be able to get private insurance
if they're truly safe
well he's wrong because the insurance
com the
um
the insurance business
is probably looking at older models and
looking at the past
so just as we're talking Insurance
should be able to look at the future
they should also be able to look at the
past but the past is misleading
so this is another case where if the
insurance companies could base on what
the future looks like versus how things
have gone in the past they would make
different decisions in my opinion uh
nuclear power plants should be insured
by the government
and the company itself because the
company itself might go into business if
something goes bad but I don't think
that private insurance companies should
be in the business of ensuring nukes and
the reason is
that if anything goes wrong with a
nuclear plant it potentially
it could be really expensive
so that might be more than a company
wants to take a risk of so they might
make you know all kinds of money for 20
years one meltdown
could wipe out their profitability for
the whole 20 years
so
from an economic model perspective it's
not that insurance companies are smarter
than we are it's just that the size of
the risk is a government size not a
company size does that make sense
did I sell that
it's just that the nature of the risk
is uh
I think it's very small risk but that's
why you have insurance you know there's
a small risk that I will die today
but I have insurance today
even those are very small risk that I'll
die today so it's very common to have
insurance for something of which the
actual risk is very small
but if it happened it would be very bad
right if I died today that'd be very bad
a very very small risk so I think it's
just a country-sized risk and not a
insurance company risk and the reason a
country can take it on
is because the country gets a benefit
that the insurance company does not get
if you're managing a country
you want energy to be as available as
possible if you're managing an insurance
company
then you're just looking at the
Actuarial tables you don't you're not
looking at the benefit of the country so
much
are the Rolls-Royce new plants insurable
good question so Rolls Royce is making
these small modular reactors and they
are in the business of making them
they're not thinking about it they're in
the business of making them did they get
insurance
that would be the question right don't
you assume they did because I doubt
they'd be operating if they didn't have
it
maybe I mean if it was if they're still
using some kind of venture capital or
something maybe they don't have
insurance
um
I think State Farm is only not going to
ensure
for new accounts so they're going to
serve us
you know if you already have the
insurance you're good
I don't know if you can redo it though
you might not be able to redo it
no they don't they're self-insured you
actually know that
there's somebody here who knows us the
Rolls-Royce plant is insured
how in the world would you know that
I
uh when it's got like a thorium reactor
in his backyard or is he NIMBY
um
I think I would have the same opinion as
everybody else
wouldn't you all have the same opinion
that you'd like it in somebody else's
backyard if you have a choice
is that done
but it's also true that I live near a
nuclear facility
I I do willingly live near a nuclear
facility
so what's that do to your argument
I I literally live within the blast out
of a nuclear facility
and I chose to I knew it when I I knew
it when I built my house
so I guess I passed that test I passed
the test of being near a nuclear site
and it didn't didn't change any of my
actions
uh Scott you can still save your soul if
I become a Christian
all right
um
was land cheap
I don't know
foreign
reactors some people like them
yeah it's time to wrap up YouTube
all right YouTubers
thanks for joining and I will
um
I'll go save my soul
you know the good news is I don't have
one
so
there's that
how many of you believe you have a soul
mostly yeses
a smattering of no
but mostly yes and do you think you
would Define a soul the same way
well let me ask you this does your soul
have a memory like a brain does
your soul have a memory
no
yes so some of you say that your soul
has a memory just like a physical brain
or a computer desk
how what is the soul made out enough
that it could have a memory
because I understand how a brain or a
computer can have a memory because it's
a physical change on a physical object
but a soul has no physicality
so what what would be the mechanism for
memory production
yeah you could be a spiritual being but
would your spiritual being have a memory
because memory is part of the physical
world we don't have
a sense of how that could exist in a
non-physical world
so
is it is it consistent to believe that
your soul is non-physical but that it
has memory could a non-physical thing
have memory
yes
so a non-physical thing could have a
memory
even though the way we store memories is
on a physical object
how would you store it why would it be
stored in what would be the
the soup in which those memories are
stored
Spirit bites
it's in the cloud
yeah
your soul has a history
but doesn't remember its history
and where would it store that memory
and you know so I I guess the part
um
where I say that souls are imaginary
well let me put it in a different way I
believe that I have a soul in a physical
sense
but it's like a boundary thing where you
can see a boundary but a boundary
doesn't exist right if you look at the
horizon
you can point to the Horizon say all
right there's the Horizon but there's no
Horizon you can't grab a handful of
horizon right it's a concept so it could
be that your soul is more of a concept
and here's a concept that I that I buy
into
that
the things you do in your life create a
permanent Ripple into the future
because energy never changes right it's
always it's always doing something
so whatever permanent ripples I put on
history
is my soul
for example
I introduced the concept of a talent
stack which you see in a lot of other
books now and people use it and talk
about it
that's my soul
not by itself but the the things which I
changed during my life
will Ripple forever you know Dilbert
will probably be there for a while now
my decrease in the sense that you can't
recognize the impact so after you know a
generation or so you might not see any
direct thing that I ever left on this
Earth
but maybe indirectly
you know combined with all the other
souls and their impact on everything
indirectly I might be you know some
small percentage of what happened in the
future and I call that my soul
all right
so that that would be an example of how
you could have a soul that doesn't have
doesn't need a memory right so the soul
that is just the the Ripple of your life
you know the the things that you did in
your life that doesn't have a memory
is simply cause and effect but I would I
would buy into that as being a soul
uh if I'm an avatar my soul is actually
in my Creator's experience not mine
yeah
boy you know and I'm seeing a reference
here on YouTube but
um I didn't realize at the time how much
how important it was when I was doing
two live streams a day during the
pandemic during the lockdowns
people continue to tell me how that
was
good mental health process I guess
yeah I'm saying lots of people say yes
that now
well I'd love to think you saved lives I
don't know
yeah I thought it was important I just
didn't realize how important
just didn't realize it so I'm glad I did
that and I'm glad that that brought us
together and YouTube I'm going to say
bye for now just talk to the local
people a little bit more and I'll see
you tomorrow thanks for joining
