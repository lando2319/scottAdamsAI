[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome
to coffee with scott adams possibly the
highlight of your entire life
don't know yet i mean can't rule it out
it might go well
but suppose
hypothetically you wanted to take this
from an incredible
situation to even better
even better what would you do well you'd
probably find a copper margarita glass
of tank or chelsea steiner canteen
jungle flask a vessel of any kind
you'd probably fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee
and then maybe you'd join me
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine of the day the thing that makes
really everything better
everything better except the withdrawal
from afghanistan it's called the
simultaneous sip but it happens now go
hello anne marie from kuwait
good to have you
you're probably drinking something in
the afternoon all right
whatever happened to i saw this question
on twitter
whatever happened to
the matt gates story
what happened to it
the the longer you wait
to find out if an allegation is true
the less likely it is
so i'm going to test out a new rule for
prediction are you ready
this is based on pattern recognition
and it is not not supposed to be some
kind of hard and fast rule but maybe a
tendency
and i i guess this is as much of a
question as it is a as it is a assertion
so the the question is this
is it true
that when there's a
well there's a big story and maybe
somebody did something
that the longer you wait and don't find
out they did something the less likely
they did something let me give you some
examples
uh it's been a long time since the matt
gates story broke that he allegedly did
something with women
paying them or something so
it almost doesn't matter what the
details are at this point
but it's been a long time hasn't it
right
now every day that goes by and i think i
told you this from the start every day
that goes by
when matt gates is not i don't know
indicted or charged with something
it's less likely it's going to happen i
think
now that doesn't mean something couldn't
happen
you know it's not ruled out but i think
the likelihood goes down every day let
me give you some other examples do you
remember when russian collusion
was a thing
every day that went by and we did not
prove there was russian collusion
made it less likely than it was
right and then in the end we didn't find
any
how about the capital insurrection
and all of the
planning
from i don't know from the white house
allegedly or something about the
insurrection
and the longer they look for that
insurrection
the less insurrection they can find
but it's not just things that you might
agree with
what about the
the vaccination side effects
the longer you wait to find out if the
vaccination itself was more dangerous
than the covent
the more likely it is that it's not
dangerous
now that's that's pretty direct
in the case of vaccinations
because the the sooner after the
vaccination is the the highest
likelihood of problems right
that's why you have to wait 15 minutes
after you get the shot because the
biggest risk is right then
the first 15 minutes and then you know
the first few days
but if you go three months
and you've got three months without a
side effect
the odds of ever seeing one start going
down not zero
not zero but the odds go way down here's
another one
um
how about
trump's legal troubles
from all of his financial and or tax
related stuff
where is where is trump getting indicted
right trump himself as opposed to the
organization
well the longer we wait i feel like the
less likely how about the arizona audit
i know you really want them to have the
goods you really want i know i know
i know you want them to find something
because
that would make you happy many of you
but the longer we go
the less likely
here's another one how about uh
ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine
the longer we go without proof that they
work
the less likely that they work
right and i think it's been a while that
we've been looking at both of those the
irobectin and hydroxychloroquine if we
had proof that they worked i feel like
that would be sticky
and that we'd know that by now
not saying it doesn't work remember in
each of these topics you can't know for
sure what the future is
but
i i'm going to put this out there as a
rule
uh
the the proof is suppressed yeah so what
i'm saying is somebody saying that the
proof
of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine is
being suppressed let's take that as
um not a given
but let's take that as a um a high
awareness understanding of the world
can we agree on that it's cynical it's
skeptical
but it's probably an accurate view of
the world
that information gets suppressed
by
big entities for lots of reasons right
so we can all agree that that's a thing
but would you agree with me
that they can suppress it easily for one
day
not too hard for two days
but suppressing something like this for
a year
when it's the biggest question going
that's a lot harder
right so every day that goes by that
they that the suppression
is keeping you from knowing about this i
think you have to start biasing your
your prediction
toward there's nothing there
doesn't mean there's nothing there i'm
saying that your prediction should start
biasing in that direction so just keep
an eye on that
and tell me how often it is wrong
okay it'll be wrong sometimes it's not
one of those rules that's hard and fast
but i'll bet you
i'll bet you if you use this for your
predictions
that you would be right
80 90 of the time
something like that so that's just
speculation keep an eye on it and see if
that predicts i think it does
all right
uh
why is it we're in this weird situation
in which i'm lazy somebody says
because i didn't do my own research
so
why is it
that all the smart people are telling us
two things
so let's say cnn msnbc they're the smart
people right
so all the smart people
are telling us two things number one
use science
and use data
to make decisions
would you agree all the smart people say
that use science
and accurate data to make decisions
so far so good
and then how do they help us make
decisions
by showing us anecdotal reports
so on one hand they're saying make your
decisions based on the science and the
data
but then they're spending all their time
producing anecdotal stories of this one
guy
who died because he got he didn't get
the vaccination
so it's sort of a mixed message isn't it
it's like you should use data in science
but we know that it doesn't work
it's not going to convince anybody so we
better try to convince you with our
anecdotal stuff which is the opposite of
science
so science is so good why can't you use
it
it's a perfectly good question right if
science is so good and we should make
our decisions based on science
why can't you just tell me the science
why do you have to give me an anecdote
and persuade me by scaring me with this
one story of this one guy who did
something
if the science is so good well it's
because science doesn't work
right it doesn't work to persuade
i mean it can get you just so far it
gets about half the public but then the
rest just say ah i don't believe it for
one reason or another
so the only way to sell science is by
denying science
in a sense now i would argue it's
actually scientific
to understand that people are not
rational beings and you can't convince
them with science so i would say that's
also a scientific view
but it just feels kind of crazy that
we're mixing these two things at the
same time anecdote sure
all right
um
i would like to assign blame
to people who have destroyed the world
who are these people
well let me give you some
examples
of how the world is being destroyed
and you tell me who's responsible
we have a major
drought in the west
so california's in major drought much of
the west is in
a big drought and people say climate
change
is a is a big component of that now
there's some skepticism of that of
course there always is but that's
sort of a general thing you're seeing in
the air that climate change is to blame
now who's to blame for that hold on to
that thought don't answer it yet
um
here in california we also have very
little power
so we don't have enough electricity
who's to blame for that hold you hold
your thought don't answer it yet so
who's to blame for climate change
drought
lack of electricity these are our big
problems coming on who's to blame for
climate change itself i mean the larger
question
um how about
the risk of losing in space
so right now uh russia and china look
like they're going to be pretty
aggressive in
controlling space militarily
how are we going to do in space
militarily
well we got a problem
because we don't have a good nuclear
industry
right
if we had a more robust
commercial nuclear industry we'd be in
good shape for going to space because
you need all that skill
so
what would be a solution to running out
of water
well i can only think of one
other than changing climate change
totally which could take decades the
only way i think you can get there is
using
nuclear power
and desalinization
but who is it who has stopped nuclear
power from being a big deal already
it's the green people
right
the the green people stopped nuclear
energy
using persuasion as opposed to science
and now we don't have a robust nuclear
industry that could possibly save us
by building some quick
nuclear plants maybe gen4 if we're
almost there
and
giving us some water what about our lack
of electricity
same problem
no nuclear power if we had nuclear power
in california or more of it we would
have plenty of power but who stopped it
the green the green people right
so the green people are responsible for
me not having water
the green people are responsible for me
not having electricity
but you say at least they
at least they stopped
climate change
no
no if they want to stop climate change
you need more nuclear power
so they made nuclear power worse i'm
sorry they made
so the green people made climate change
happen
because the only solution is nuclear
power and they're making it hard
so they their climate change water
problems electricity problems and we
won't be able to militarily control
space
and so we're basically doomed in the
long run
it's the same freaking people
the green people have destroyed
america
apparently
and if you look at our gas prices who's
to blame for that
it's all it seems like it's all coming
down to the same place now let's say
somebody says you know the war in
afghanistan is made worse by climate
change which they do
again
where's my nuclear energy
to get me out of the climate change
problem it all comes back to the green
people it's like the green woke people
destroyed the planet it just took a
while you know it's working through the
system
so
i assign blame
to the green people
um
uh david uh reboy has a uh tweet in
which he's tweeted in an article i think
was in reuters or something
uh or npr i forget which one but there's
a quote in there from somebody who knows
something about afghanistan and said
years ago a u.s general told us that not
only
yeah that they couldn't make many of the
afghan offers no not only could couldn't
many of the afghan officers read or
write
but they couldn't count
the afghan officers that we trained to
be the officers in the military
they couldn't read and write
and many of them
couldn't count
so i wonder what happened
i wonder how they lost so fast
oh my god
so apparently we just were trying to
train the drags
uh and the taliban must have been doing
a better job of recruiting looks like
they got more talent
that's part of it
well
here's my uh current updated take on
afghanistan and the withdrawal i started
with a contrarian take
which said that we don't know how much
of a mistake it is yet
meaning that there's some information we
don't have and we know we don't have it
and it could be important
and the information is this
why is it that everybody who's not in
afghanistan knew what to do
you know get the americans out
then you know get the military out bomb
the bases you know everybody knew it
the only people who didn't know that
that very obvious thing were the people
in charge of it
is that possible
it's not let me just say this is that's
a rhetorical question it's not possible
there's something we don't know
about how the decisions went down
something big
because i'm not buying that every single
person at any level of education at any
level of iq
every one of us knew the right way to
get out of afghanistan
but the people who do it for a living
didn't
it's just not working for me right we're
going to find out something but
here's what we can say
it looks like the taliban is not going
to let all the americans out
so that that's what's happening on the
ground according to the reporting
now if
the taliban had been really smart and
maybe better organized they would have
just said okay get out of here the best
thing we can do for ourselves is to let
everybody out
so we can totally control the country no
americans coming back but that's not
happening
which probably means the taliban
leadership can't completely control all
the individual checkpoints and stuff
don't have that kind of command and
control
but
if we know the americans can't get out
then it's a botched operation and
there's no explanation that's going to
make me happy i don't think so i mean i
could be surprised here's something that
whoa i didn't know that or maybe there
was some other big thing we traded for
it who knows
there could be some kind of secret deal
that we don't know about
but at this point
it looks like the biggest botched
operation in the history of operations
so the
the evolution that i'm giving you here
is i started with hey
it's fog of war
let's make sure we really know what's
going on here
and now enough time has gone by that i
can say okay if it's true for sure and
it looks at that way it looks to be true
for sure that the americans aren't going
to get out
or a lot of them
so at this point we can say it's botched
i mean that that that clears it up right
in a bad way
um
here's what biden's problem is
so the biggest
problem with biden is age and the
presumption of some dementia
now if you have that and you also have
the biggest botched operation of all
time like a historically big botch
one that both sides say was botched
which is rare
it's pretty rare to get both sides to
say so anything was botched that's a
pretty big step
and i don't know that biden can possibly
survive this
i feel as though the democrats are going
to have to have a ritual sacrifice of
biden
to show that they can still govern
they're getting close to that
let me say that again the democratic
party
is going to have to take biden out and
shoot him themselves you know
metaphorically
figuratively speaking the democrats are
going to have to take him out
because if they don't
it's going to be a big problem trying to
get the next democrat elected because
it's going to be you know it's going to
be a bad look so if they get him out
early but the trouble is that would put
kamala harris in charge and she might be
a bigger disaster
so
tell me this in the comments
who is the
top
democrat
who would run for president against
let's say presuming trump runs again who
would be the top democrat
i can't think of a single person
who would be president material that we
also know
buddha judge
yang
i don't know i think buddha judge and
yang didn't really
find the center of their own party
cuomo yeah i know you're joking mark
cuban well now there's there's an
interesting thing
mark cuban
that that's interesting idea
i can't think of anybody who would be
better or poised how much would you like
to see mark cuban
run as a democrat against trump running
for a second term
oh my god
oh my god
can you imagine that
that would be so good
it would be the best thing ever
i would love that i mean just from an
entertainment point of view and i
wouldn't mind who got elected honestly
if either mark cuban or trump got
elected i'd be okay with that because i
think both of them are
practical people not political people i
mean you'd have to be political to be in
the job but i think both of them would
go for the solution that works
i don't think either of them would take
the solution that doesn't work over the
one that does for some political reason
now they might disagree about what works
but i think they're both free of
politics in a weird way
so that would be fun
um
yeah
the rock no i don't think the rock is
serious about politics
um
just made news scott an audience what
just made news
is there some news about me i've been
watching the uh the hip pieces come out
trying to take out you know any
prominent voice that is associated with
either side there's this giant hip piece
on the the weinstein weinstein brothers
brett and eric
the long thread
taken them down i think everybody's
going to get their chance in the barrel
and i must be next
but seriously
who in the world are the democrats going
to run for president
i i feel like they've got nobody
oh i just realized
i just realized why my last two shows
seemed short
i've been printing on double-sided paper
and i didn't realize it
okay
so there's a new nbc poll
and biden's approval rating is dropping
but it's at 49 and it was 53 in april
this is according to nbc who loves biden
but i feel like no president can be less
than 49
uh yes all paper is double-sided what i
meant was i didn't realize i was
printing double-sided so yesterday when
i did my uh
i did my podcast i was looking at my
notes and i thought damn i was sure i
had four pages of notes but i only have
two
so if it seemed like a short show
yesterday
now you know why
i might be the dumbest guy in the world
sometimes
but
i have one brilliant idea would you like
to hear it
would you like to hear
my one brilliant idea so i pinned it to
my
feed today on twitter
now i think i've raised this before but
i just included a tom cotton
reference in there so hopefully he'll
see it now as you know
congress is mostly useless
with the exception of a few senators
right tom cotton being one of the few
people who works for the government
who's actually trying to do something
useful and seems to be you know making
some headway
so i included him because he's he's a
china hawk
as i am and here's my idea
so we have we're reaching record levels
of fentanyl coming into the country and
record numbers of overdoses
we know that china is the source of it
it's going through the mexican cartels
and killing killing americans by the
tens of thousands
and asking them to stop doesn't work
right
so if you just say hey please don't send
that fentanyl anymore they'll say sure
we'll take care of it that just won't do
anything
and there's just nothing you can do
about it
so i'm suggesting that we de-personalize
it and just completely remove uh
remove china's
leadership from the decision
and you do it this way you just say
here's what we're going to do for every
death recorded from overdose
in this country and we don't even need
to know if it was fentanyl would just
you know
let's just say every death recorded from
an overdose
and we will send back one
chinese citizen who's in college here
there are over 300 000 chinese citizens
going to college in the united states we
are training their elites
their elites want their kids in college
in the united states that's why they're
here
and what we should say is it's nothing
personal
we're just going to go in alphabetical
order and this is a key by the way this
is this is the key to the persuasion
alphabetical order because alphabetical
order says it's not personal
all we're doing is for every every death
from overdose we're going to pick the
next person in alphabetical order and
just send them home that day
and
here's the thing if you're an elite
and your last name starts with the
letter c
and the a's go home
you're going to start lobbying your
government pretty hard to cut the
out of the fentanyl because you don't
want your kid coming home and you're
having lunch with president xi because
you're an elite right the elites know
the other elites so only the elites can
talk the other elites into anything you
know it's not going to be anybody else
so you simply say
look elites it's nothing personal we
don't have any way to solve this problem
but we're going to let you solve it and
the way we're going to let you solve it
is we're going to send one of your
students back for every fentanyl death
and then you take care of it if you
never take care of it that's fine we
don't care
but take care of it
because there's we're going to get rid
of all of them
and how long would it take for china to
say okay we like killing you with
fentanyl
but not that much
we have other ways to attack america we
don't need that way
so
senator tom cotton one of the maybe
three senators who is not a complete
worthless piece of
and actually i think would be a fine
president someday possibly
so tom cotton if you'd like to maybe
look into that to see if there's some
way we can
just make it unpersonal and just put it
on a formula and let china take care of
their own problem because the
problem is we made it our problem
here's a little persuasion tip for you
when somebody makes something your
problem
make it their problem and then walk away
they'll solve it
you just gotta make it their problem
if they let if you let them make it your
problem it's never gonna get solved if
you can't solve it make it their problem
um
all right
let's see what else we have on the back
of my papers that i didn't look at yet
um
a provocative question from joel pollock
he asked this and there's some writing
in
uh
well
so he asked this question
uh with trump promoting vaccinations how
many people died because he has denied a
platform
good question isn't it could you
calculate
how many people twitter killed
by keeping trump off of twitter
who at least in his rallies says you
should get the vaccination
now i'm not going to enter the
conversation of whether you should get
the vaccination right you can work that
out on your own
but
it's zero what would happen let's just
game it through
let's say that trump was uh on twitter
and got to tweet maybe once a week
let's say let's see imagine once a week
he tweeted get your vaccinations
imagine
how many people would be persuaded by
trump himself telling you to get
vaccinated
well he is the most persuasive person on
the planet
so some
right now maybe some other people would
say no i don't want the vaccination
because trump is saying we should get it
i doubt it because everybody's saying
you should get it right
so it's only the people saying you
shouldn't get it that i think are going
to be the problem
and if you can get one more persuasive
voice to say you should get it would
that save lives now i know those of you
who think the vaccination is going to
kill us all
think that that would be a bad idea i
get that
but if you believe that the vaccination
saves lives and if you believe that
trump is persuasive with his base anyway
how many lives would he have saved if he
had been on twitter
now maybe you could argue that he would
have killed just as many people with
some other thing he said i suppose but
you don't know what that is
um
somebody says five to ten percent of his
base yeah i think something like five
percent to ten percent of the base could
be persuaded
so let's say eight million people
uh get persuaded who wouldn't have been
persuaded that's probably at the high
end
uh how many of eight million people
would eventually die of covet
that wouldn't otherwise die
i know it's an interesting question
likewise how many peop how many lives
did i save
by being one of the early people to say
close travel from china i know we didn't
close it completely but did it slow
anything down did it make a difference
were any lives saved i don't know
somebody asked the question about uh
brett weinstein
talking about ivor mechtin
did
did people talking about ivermectin
being you know a
uh an alternative to vaccination in in a
sense not directly an alternative but
in a sense people saying well as long as
i have the ivermectin i don't need the
vaccination
is there anybody
who died
because they believed ivermectin was
going to save him well we have one
example apparently there is a
there was a conservative radio host
named valentine i think who just died
tragically from covid
and he was an anti-vaxxer
but and he thought that the ivormectin
would save him if he got the covert and
the ivormectin didn't save him
apparently
now that's anecdotal right so you don't
make decisions based on individual
stories
but
it does look like there is some kind of
an effect where pundits are are killing
people
it looks like it now of course that that
assumption in the particular anecdote
depends whether you think ivermectin
works or not right if you think it works
then then he did the best he could and
he died anyway
but i did see a uh jordan peterson uh
retweet of a study it's it's a it's not
a brand new study it's been on a few
months
and
he was doubting ivermectin so basically
jordan peterson was retweeting a
skeptical article that said
it's possible that the ivermectin meta
analysis is skewed by one big fake study
so when you look at the average of
studies there might be one real big one
that's fake and that makes it look like
it's working when it's not
now i think brett all has addressed that
i think he addressed it and said that
even if you take that out it still works
or something but
hypothetically
how many people did get killed by
pundits now i don't know if the
weinstein's weinsteins will
is it weinstein or weinstein i i i will
never know
i'll never be able to pronounce those
names correctly and so i apologize i
apologize publicly for
for that
um
yeah it just makes me wonder how many
people are being killed by bad punditry
uh that's well-meaning i mean all of
it's well-meaning nobody's trying to do
anything
here's my next question that this is
another one of those dogs not barking
so we think that the taliban are not
going to let all the americans out
that's the anecdotally it's looking like
that
why are there so many americans there
has anybody ever answered the biggest
question of all
why are there many americans
living in rural afghanistan
and
i mean tens of thousands and if they are
living there
why didn't they get out months ago when
trump said he's getting out of
afghanistan
did you really not have any warning
yeah you're saying u.s contractors
but
didn't they have warning
as in months of warning to get out when
it was still possible
what in the world kept them there
and if it was the united states keeping
them there as in saying hey please stay
don't leave
until we tell you to and then they just
you know pulled up and and stranded them
there well if that happened we need to
go back in
uh or something
now
presumably i hear that the british
paratroopers are going and collecting
british citizens in afghanistan and
bringing it back so they're bringing a
show of force to do that
and the united states is not
and i'm wondering if we could just pay
some other country that's capable to
save our our people for us
now maybe we should just do a gofundme
and get a uh
some other country to who has a military
and actually knows how to use it and
stuff to go in and get our people hit
the expendables
doing humanitarian work yeah
i just don't understand
americans in afghanistan
it doesn't make any sense to me
and if they're there do they want to be
there
did they choose to stay
i just don't understand it
um
rome had to hire mercenaries and then
fell yeah
glenn beck raised 22 million to help get
people out wow if that's true that's
pretty impressive but i don't know how
you pay for it you probably have to
bribe a lot of people
alice says not one patient
not one patient who takes
hydroxychloroquine fruit
for lupus has died
that's not true
if it is true
send me a link on twitter but let me
tell you without even looking at the
data so there's a claim in the comments
here
that nobody who's taking
hydroxychloroquine for lupus
has died of covet
there's no chance that's true
is it really there's no chance that's
true i don't think that's true
if there's a real study on that i'd like
to see it but no there's no chance
that's true
yeah and there's no way the data has
been collected exactly
uh
all right
so somebody here takes
