hey
everybody i didn't see you come on in
here
i'm glad you showed up it's about time
yes this is the place you go to get your
day
off to a good good start and it's gonna
work today
sorry about the leaf blower that seems
to be blowing leaves right outside of my
window quite annoying and
i guarantee you that it will last the
entire time i'm on periscope
why i don't know but apparently
there are a lot of leaves exactly in
front of my window of my office
no place else but just going to spend a
good hour
right in front of my window so that's
how my morning's starting off but yours
will be better and all you need is a
simultaneous sip
and watch this watch this normally
i have the introduction to the
simultaneous sip
written on this piece of paper because
after years of doing it every single
morning
i can't remember it but watch this
[Applause]
and all you need is a copper mug or a
glass
a tankered chalice or stein a canteen
jugger flask
a vessel of any kind boom
join me now for the dopamine hit of the
day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous hip who
would be calling me during the
simultaneous step
i mean really who call who calls me
during the simultaneous sin
and join me now for the simultaneous
simultaneous step that makes everything
better go
now you might ask yourself scott how is
it that today is the day
you can remember the entire sequence of
the simultaneous sip
and the answer is this it has to do with
how people learn
i think it was yesterday i got in the
mail a
suspicious box i opened it up and it was
a whole bunch of
wrapped up different items and i thought
to myself
uh this could be bad i don't know what
this is all about
and i started opening them up and it's a
whole bunch of different items
and it was presented as a puzzle it was
a little noted there saying it was a
mystery box
and so i assembled the mystery and i
realized that it was one
item for each of the things that i say
in the simultaneous step
so i organized them on my table
and by the way this was sent by somebody
named amy
that's that's all i know somebody who
watches
the simultaneous sip i assume you're
watching now hi amy
and thank you for solving my problem
so my problem was that people learn
different ways and
i could read something a million times
and i would never be able to memorize it
no matter how much exposure i had my
brain just doesn't work
that specific way but
the moment it was visual and i could
touch it and feel it
and put it on my table and then look at
it
memory was instant so now let me take
this to the
world of education if you're thinking to
yourself hey school got worse
because you used to be in person people
think that's pretty good for a lot of
reasons
now it's just watching a video of a
teacher
much much worse but if you can imagine
what the world will be like when you can
learn anything
in a virtual reality world or an
augmented reality where they're
you know you see the real world but
there are items placed into it that
weren't there before
so for example if i were trying to
remember that sequence
i could have just you know called up
those images
looked at them and then memorized them
the
the ability to give you the kind of
learning you need
everybody being a little bit different
is extraordinary
so pretty much all of the all of the
stuff that's non-visual
in the current learning environment
could become visual
that one change just taking all the
stuff that you just had to memorize
names and dates and stuff like that and
just turn them into something visual
an actual movie that you live in you're
not watching it
you're living inside it so where
education can go it's probably
three times as good as what it is now
but we're not there
we will be i'll bet in five years you're
gonna have
uh the beginning of the augmented
reality education and it's gonna be mind
blowing
it'll be better than in person by far
all right i've got a new rule that
i try not to watch the news after 5 pm
my time
is hard but the news is so unpleasant
and by the way i would also lump in
there any kind of
entertainment drama anything that has
an element to the entertainment that
there's danger
or you know tension or stress or
just bad things happening to people i'm
going to try to avoid them after 5 pm
i would try to avoid them all day long
except that
i do this it would be hard to avoid the
news and
do these periscopes so uh i tried that
last night and that involved
not watching the democratic convention
but that doesn't mean i'm not going to
comment on it because i did catch up on
it this morning
watch the key videos and the highlights
and i think that
watching the highlights tells you maybe
even more
than watching every detail of the actual
convention and here's the reason
the things that get pulled down as the
the highlight clips or the things to
remember
and you imagine cnn msnbc etc
they're deciding what what opinions to
give the public
you can watch it in real time so you you
may have watched
the convention on your own and had your
own opinions about it but then you turn
on the news
and they tell you what to think about it
and at the end of the news programs
after you've seen
a few of these opinions that are similar
you start thinking
yeah that's what i think it actually you
you can watch them assign your opinion
to you
about what you felt about the convention
after you watched it so your own
feelings about it
you brought to cnn and by the time
you're done watching you're thinking
yeah kamala harris didn't wish he was a
tour de force
you know assuming that you're you're
leading in that direction to begin with
so watching that in real time is
disturbing and fascinating
um so i have lots of comments about that
first of all have you noticed that the
big thing that people are saying about
joe biden is that he
listens he cares and he has empathy
i assume that's because democrats
believe that's the part of his brain
that's still working
because if they thought to themselves
you know joe biden is a lot
smarter than president trump
i feel as if they would mention that
if they thought that joe biden was
better at let's say strategy
than president trump i feel like they
would have mentioned that
if you were better at really just
getting things done
i feel like they would have mentioned
that
but instead they go for the one thing
that you are sure is true
the biden cares and he listens and he
shows empathy
and i would say that he does all of
those things in fact i will go further
i would say that biden shows the caring
and the empathy
better than president trump boom
better than president trump that's also
why
you should not elect him your president
because the best feature of joe biden is
literally a flaw
now why do i say that it's the same
reason i say that i'm a terrible
manager if you want somebody to manage
your
let's say your big division of your
corporation
don't ask me to do it because i'm bad at
that
and the main reason i'm bad at that is
too much empathy
too much empathy it the the job of a
manager
and or a leader is to make people do
stuff they don't want to do
that's really the point getting people
to do what they want to do
well that doesn't take much skill do you
want to eat this cookie
yes give me a cookie there you go
that's it but if you want somebody to
enlist in the military and go fight a
war
you've got to make a pretty good case
for that so
i would say that the job of president
leader manager you know anything in that
domain is really about not being
too empathetic empathy
is what makes you a bad leader
now you have to have some right if you
had no empathy
you would be sociopath and that would be
dangerous
but if you have too much empathy you
lead with empathy
then you make the problem that all that
all democrats
seem to make it goes like this if you're
designing
a system for human beings
the the number one thing you're going to
have to think about is their motivation
and their incentives because whatever
humans are motivated to do
whatever their incentive is that's
what's going to happen in the long run
so i think that the the republicans have
a less
less empathy focused view of the world
because that view of the world gets you
the best result for the people you care
about
so in other words in the republican view
of things
the best way to show your empathy
or to act on it is to do a good job
designing a stable system that makes the
country as a whole work
and if you do that it's going to be
worse for some people
nobody likes that but it is going to be
you you can't make everything equal all
the time it's just not
it's not something that works you can
try
it could be your goal you could try to
make everything better for everybody all
the time it could be your
your number one thing you're interested
in
but you still need to design the system
and systems
tend to be not perfectly um
even in terms of how they distribute
benefits
so that would be the main difference is
that the democrats seem to want to build
systems whether it's how the economy
works or anything else
they want to build systems that are
based on
good intentions compare these two
systems
one that is based on good intentions of
human beings
good intentions and the other based on
real motivations of humans our greed
our you know our uh impulse to get away
with stuff if we can
you know really the dark side of humans
which is you know we're not all that
good all the time
if you if you design a system that
harnesses
the good and the bad of people such as
capitalism
such as democracies i would say that
they harness
both the good and the bad of people in
other words they they understand the
whole human being
and if you can build a system that can
withstand
the worst of humans that's a good system
capitalism does that so capitalism you
still need
you know oversight and control so
capitalism doesn't
become too far out of control but
you can't really build a system on good
intentions do you know what would be a
system
built on good intentions jazz
right the capitol hill thing the
protests
the protests are like a little
civilization because it's every night
now
if it were one off you'd say it's just a
protest but once you do it every night
it becomes almost like a lifestyle a
system
if you will and that's allegedly built
on
people's good intentions the good
intention of
having no racism of having a fairer
society that's better for everybody
that's a good intention
wouldn't you say socialism all these
things are very good intentions and i
don't think you should take that away
from
indeed i've said that the the big
problem with
republicans in terms of their messaging
i've said that they should embrace
the goal of the democrats the goals of
the democrats are great goals
they're great you know equality
everybody's got a chance
there are no artificial you know
systemic things that are holding anybody
back
who who hates that that's all great
stuff it's just how you get there
the republicans will build systems that
understand human motivation the
democrats will build one based on good
intentions
and you don't have to be a genius to
know which one's going to work
it's pretty clear that's
that's well beyond the it's well beyond
the realm of opinion
that a system built on understanding the
whole motivation of people is going to
work better
than one based on good intentions we all
know that's true
and so here's what i would do if i were
the
republicans and i wanted to kneecap the
democrats
further for their approach so they're
taking the
the president doesn't care about his job
approach
and he has no empathy here's how i deal
with that
i would say you know what democrats are
really good with empathy
the world needs plenty of empathy in
fact
i i commend the democrats for their
attention to caring
and empathy and i give them my full
respect
but the world doesn't run on good
intentions
the world runs when you've developed a
system
that understands human beings that's
what we're offering
we're offering you something that works
because it's
a tested motivation driven incentive
based
system that we can tweak it but that's
what we're going for
the democrats are very very uh
obviously and they're not hiding
anything they're going for a dis
different kind of system one that's
built on good intentions
you know how that works you're watching
the protesters and the burning of the
cities
that's what good intentions get you
every bit of that problem the burning of
the cities
every bit of that is based on good
intentions
don't want to lose your good intentions
but you don't want to build a system
that thinks that that's what drives
human beings
because it's just not so i think that
would completely
kneecap the entire democrats point of
view
which by the way is a similar play to
when bob dole was running against
uh bill clinton and clinton
gore said you know all this
all the niceness of uh of dole
we should appreciate it very honorable
great service to the country
but he's planning for the past and we're
planning for the future
it's the same play just updated to the
current situation
which is you give the other team their
full due
so the democrats are trying to claim the
mantle of the ones who care the most
you should give it to him you should
give it to him and say you know i wish
we could be more like you
it's really the the amount and by the
way
um there's nothing artificial about what
i'm going to say right now this
this is literally true
you have to respect the democrats for
the caring and the fairness stuff
you have to respect that because their
vision of where they'd like to be
is incredible i'd like to be there too
wouldn't that be great but
we live in a real world where you have
to make real decisions and deal with
real limitations all right that's enough
of that
uh jeffrey miller on
twitter had this interesting poll
he said if joe biden turned up as your
uber driver
are you confident he'd get you where you
need to go
now i feel like that's something you
could say of any president
because by the time you're president
you're a little disconnected from the
real world
you know stuff you don't know what a
what a
loaf of bread costs and you probably
don't know how to drive a car
after a while but that image is
wonderfully visual
because you see joe biden you actually
see him sitting up there in his prius
and he's confused he's trying to use his
phone and he can't figure out how to
navigate
that that is just a devastatingly good
um persuasive question joe biden as your
uber driver and he can't get it done
so here's my favorite part of yesterday
every now and then when you're watching
the the ugliness of politics
there'll be this little flower that
grows through the
crack in the pavement you know it's this
bleak landscape of politics
and there'll just be this little flower
that finds a way
pushes its way through the concrete and
gives you this little
little feeling of happiness and this
happened yesterday
when the president was doing his press
conference and he was asked
he was asked about q you know the cue
anon group
who uh here's here's the question
and the answer so the reporter asks
q anon believes you are secretly saving
the world from this cult of pedophiles
and cannibals
are you behind that and the president
as he often does you know there
this is a sort of a yes no question
you'd expect the president to give
some kind of an answer that another
human being might have given
that's what you're thinking it's like
well here comes an answer that
i i would guess there may be a couple of
ways you could go with this
answer it's going to be one of those
ways
but it wasn't it wasn't here's what the
president said
because is that supposed to be a bad
thing
is that supposed to be a bad thing
and he says
we are actually we're we are saving the
world
now this is what i call the
the ping theory i have to explain that
the ping theory was developed when i was
a teenager
and a guy i was working with we were
talking about
our summer job and this other person and
this other person we were talking about
we agreed that he had this unusual
quality
which is that he'll say nine things you
think he shouldn't have said or were
awkward or the wrong thing and you'll
think you know what's wrong with this
guy he's like socially
there's something wrong and then the
tenth thing he says
will be so smart that you just say
what happened because you don't
understand
how this person who is one way so
consistently
but then that tenth thing that he does
will be beyond anything you could have
done
and you say i don't know what i'm
watching here and
that's the ping and you can think of
this as like a
an ekg you know a chart on a machine and
the person is like averaging agent below
average unit
averaging below average union ping
and all of a sudden the meter just goes
off the chart and you go what the hell
just happened
it's like this little slice of
brilliance that just comes out of
nowhere
and that is gone again and you have to
wait for it again
it's like i think there's another one in
there so you wait for the
the nine the nine bad tweets you know
the the things that were
imperfect the the time you didn't pass
the fact checking and you're starting to
think
man you know this is sort of ordinary
and then
ping this cute answer
was a ping this is one of those times
where somebody said this to me first but
i was feeling it too
that there are times when trump makes
you hate him
makes you annoyed you know you're you
might be disgusted with the way he did
something that you would have handled
differently
but then there are these moments and
this is just for trump supporters of
course it's very subjective
but there are these moments when he
makes you fall in love with him
do you know what i mean there are
moments when he makes you fall in love
with him
and this was one of those moments
because
the fact that he was well i i called him
the
commander in troll for this answer and
it felt like the moment he was
activating the troll army
i felt that this answer when trump said
is that supposed to be a bad
thing we are actually we're saving the
world and i think he said some more on
the topic but he was also
not not condemning q whatsoever and he
acted like he didn't quite know what
they were about
but if they liked him that was great and
that they probably
and that they probably also liked you
know a better world etc
now here's why it felt like he was
activating his troll army
and if you don't know what i mean by his
troll army come on you know what i mean
it's all of us right it's it's basically
the entire online world
um now i don't think he had that
intention but it just had that feeling
of like you know that the election
started yesterday
like that was the beginning of the
serious you know election
everything else was sort of okay you
better do some training with the troops
all right maybe we should position our
troops
um wouldn't it be good if we had some
you know assets over here
i feel like everything was just getting
ready
until he said this about q anon and then
i feel like that was like this
the bad signal to just re you know just
release the trolls
the troll army joe biden has no idea
what's coming for him
but all right so the reason i love this
is that um
what is the biggest problem that the
democrats have made that i would
consider
just a blunder hillary clinton did it
they're doing it now and the blunder is
this
that they would ever treat any americans
no matter how much they disagree with
them
they won't treat them as you know bad
people
and the president as long as these q and
non people are not breaking any laws
they're not they're not acting like
racists right he did condemn the
neo-nazis that's an easy one but if
you're just a citizen
you just have a different opinion you
might be right you might be wrong you
might be following a conspiracy theory
maybe you're not
but don't you want a president who's not
going to throw you under the bus
as long as you're obeying the law think
about it
if you're obeying the law no matter how
crazy you are
or not or not yeah who gets to judge
who's crazy
that as long as you're obeying the law
you're in you're in the club that that's
the
the trump proposition we got our
constitution
we got our laws if you follow those
things
you're in the club period i'm not going
to tell you what to think what to write
what to say
if you follow those rules you're on my
side
and i'm on your side very powerful
even you know the way he did it was not
as explicit as i just said
but the fact that he wouldn't throw q
under the bus
he wouldn't throw them under the bus
boom i love that
even i've thrown q under the bus
right but i'm not the president of the
united states
if you're just a pundit you can say
whatever you want as long as you're
following the constitution following the
law
and i guess following the terms of
service in this case but
for the president to do that knowing
that's why i call him the commander in
troll knowing exactly the response he's
going to get
and knowing that his supporters are
going to think this is the funniest
thing that's ever
happened that's why you fall in love
with him he just
refuses to do what the other side wants
them to do
and he refuses also to throw throw
americans under the bus
unless they've done some horrible thing
all right does it seem to you that
the democrats were trying to portray
themselves as the party of
women primarily almost a
almost a female supremacy kind of a vibe
do you get that from the the democratic
convention it felt like it had very much
a female superiority vibe
and if i had to make one prediction
about you know one demographic group and
how they vote
i think black men maybe not women
probably not women but i think black men
are way way more let's say
trump curious than is going to be picked
up in any poll
i feel as though black men are watching
if they watch the convention
they're saying to themselves this
doesn't seem so much about me
this feels like a party for and about
women
i'm not saying that's good or bad i'm
not putting a value on that
i'm just saying that that's what it
looks like it feels like that's what
they're
trying to project so much so that
hilariously
if you saw the people magazine photo i
tweeted this earlier
they they have biden and harris posing
for
a photo but as someone else pointed out
they had harris with the male pose
male body language and they had biden
with female body language
and somebody asked if that was
intentional i don't know so biden or so
harris
was sitting on top of a table and she
she had sort of you know the a male
male looking pose now of course there's
no such thing as a bail pose or a female
pose
so what i'm talking about is sort of at
the traditional
you know 50s kind of what you'd expect
would be a male or female pose
uh and then biden was below her
surprise surprise right he's below her
but he's a little bit
closer just a little bit he's like a
foot closer
doesn't make much difference but he's
below her
now to me the photography is sending a
clear message
that she's in charge she had the
superior body language
she had the in charge position and he
had the
more submissive position i don't think
that's a coincidence
i think everybody's trying to present
her as the real leader
now i wanted to teach you in case you
didn't know how to do this you're seeing
this on
cnn and msnbc how to pronounce
vice president kamala harris
because when they say she's running for
the position or that she will be
if she wins the first vice president
there's a certain way that you need to
say it and it's how you say the first
part
the vice you want to kind of mumble that
a little bit
and emphasize the president part so
here's how to do it
incorrectly if she's elected
she'll be vice president kamala harris
that's all wrong
that's all wrong too much advice on
there here's how to say it
if she's elected she'll be the first
winner
president uh kabul harris
so you just wonder so instead of
vice you just go first first
it might sound like there was a sound in
the room and it just gets swallowed up
and you want to hit the president part
so you'll notice that there's a lot of
christ president harris
all right so now you know how to
pronounce that so that's good
um so i've been
fascinated to see how the pro-democrat
press would describe harris's
ethnic background because it's kind of
tricky right
because she is jamaican and
south asian so neither of those are you
know your
standard words that you hear a lot in
american politics
and it didn't it feel like she started
out being black
i feel as though it was only yesterday
that she was described as black
and there must have been a lot of pole
testing on this
because imagine if you were a south
asian
woman or just south asian and you see
somebody that's
you identify with as being you know at
least half or whatever the percentage is
you identify as oh i'm south asian she's
south asian
and then you see her party describe her
as black all the time
how would that make you feel you'd be
thinking well
half black isn't it what about the half
that's like me
you know why am i not included in this
in this party
so in order not to lose the people who
would identify
with one half of her in order to make
sure you nail down
you know the other half it's kind of a
tricky thing to balance
and so it looks like they might be going
for jamaican and south asian as their
best description
oh wait now i take that back they called
their first
black and south asian it was somebody
else who described her as jamaican
and south asian yeah so they're calling
the first black and south asian
now i'm not black and i'm not south
asian but i have a curiosity
about how you receive that if you are
black or you are south asian
i don't know the answer to i because i
wonder if does it feel pandering
here's how i think i'd feel if you gave
me somebody who
is half of whatever i am and tried to
sell it
as you know representing me
i feel like my my first impression would
be something along the lines of
why am i only getting half you couldn't
find
you know a completely south asian
candidate
you know what why are you trying to sell
me half a candidate
and if you're black are you saying the
same thing are you saying
are you telling me you scoured the
country and you couldn't find a woman
who was just black
right because you know that's the
population we're trying to represent
it's a fairly tiny part of the
population who is both black and south
south asian you have the combination of
the two that's a pretty small number
but why can't you give us somebody who's
just black
13 of the public a big part of the
democratic party
are you are you selling this a little
bit short here
i don't know that i would feel that i
saw a video of a woman who apparently is
south asian who was just delighted she
was like crying
because she was so happy so it could be
that um
the the ideal situation is that kamala
harris just appeals to everybody
because everybody finds something to
like about her maybe
i'm just curious about how people do
actually respond to that
i'll never find out probably
then hillary clinton talked and
elizabeth warren talked
and you're going to think this is sexist
so let me tell you
ahead of time this would apply to men
and women
so the comment i now make i deny
somehow specifically about women because
it's a universal comment
but it just happens to be about these
two individuals who happen to be women
have i protected myself enough
no cancellation for me today and it goes
like this
hillary clinton and elizabeth warren
both have crazy eyes
crazy eyes now specifically
it's a it's a specific kind it's the
eyes are too wide when they're trying to
convince you of something i've talked
about this before right
that if somebody is is talking to you
with these eyes
right now that i'm modeling that you
can't see if you're only listening to
this
if their eyes are normal and they're
telling you what you should believe and
why you should think
this these are your priorities that
could be convincing
but if somebody widens their eyes to
make their case
and if you pick joe biden everything
will be good and we'll have unicorns
and popcorn every day
the wider the eyes this is this is my
personal
interpretation of body language i don't
know if there's any expert who would
agree with this
but keep an eye on it so to speak
and see if over time you see this
pattern if somebody doesn't believe
their
own story that's how they tell it
if you don't believe your own story
you open your eyes wide when you tell it
because it gives because you're trying
to sell that you're honest
if you're if you if you wanted people to
not think you're being
clever and shifty you know you don't
want to you don't want to have squinty
eyes
you don't want to be no eye contact and
sort of looking around
because that that would sell that you're
trying to put one over on somebody
but almost as obvious as if you correct
for that
and you over correct no i'm not i'm not
shifting and looking away
my message is so believable oh look
you're right in the eyes
i'll look you right in the eyes and i'll
i'll wipe my eyes like big old saucers
oh yeah if you see that
that's somebody who doesn't believe
their own message
and you saw that from hillary you saw
that from elizabeth warren
uh you can think of other people
that you've seen that from so look for
that um
i watched calmly speech this morning
and i want to say two things first of
all uh the chris cuomo and
uh don lemon were doing their duo act
um talking about the convention and both
of them
mispronounced kamala harris's name they
both called her camelot
and this is after yeah this is after
the democratic operative
gave tucker carlson a hard time acting
as if he was
disrespectful to her by intentionally
mispronouncing
her name as camelot and then you turn on
cnn
and their her two biggest supporters don
lemon and chris cuomo
both calling her camelot
so that was pretty funny anyway
um here's what i think kamala
was going for in her speech i think she
was trying to sell herself
as more friendly personable relatable
human kind empathetic etc
because you think of her with a little
bit of harshness
right if all you know is before the
democratic convention that's what you
know of her
you'd remember her for attacking joe
biden
her friend for being a racist on the
debates that's pretty harsh
you'd remember her for attacking the
president saying bad things about him
lots of times you remember her for being
unkind to brett kavanaugh
you remember her as a cop allegedly
kept innocent people in jail after their
bend exculpatory
evidence so these are all the you know
allegations and feelings
so if you're trying to soften that hard
edge
you might want to have you know an
impactful speech
in which you try to be the softer kinder
happier version who can give a positive
message
about the world i would say it
failed completely um it's very obvious
that she's been
coached hard meaning that
there there's some serious outside
influence
that's really obvious in her
presentation
and she gave a speech yesterday that i'd
never seen before
in other words her mannerisms her
approach her delivery
uh her body language everything was
completely different
than anything i've seen from her before
and i would say it completely failed
in my opinion now i think she can
correct that
because she was she was in the general
area of where she needed to be
but she missed and the the mismatch is
that her personality
does not fit with the skin she was
trying to put on herself let me make it
not skim because somebody's gonna say
that was racist
uh i'll it didn't fit the uniform she
was trying to put on
and i think she would have done a lot
better
if she had found an artificial
personality that was
closer to her actual personality and
what i saw was somebody who was trying
to smile
and it wasn't real so she had this
sort of over smiled i'm not going to
lose the smile on my face
and even if i'm going to say something
that doesn't make you happy
you just look at my mouth it's ready to
smile
it's so ready to smile i'm the happiest
person
look at my optimism my mouth it looks
scrunched up like i just ate a lemon but
i'm still smiling
i'm still smiling and look at my eyes my
eyes are
i've got kind eyes and i'm smiling no
matter what i say
i'm so sorry i'm smiling and
it it looked yeah there was some sort of
uncanny valley situation going on that
it looked
so fake that i was really sort of turned
off by it
and i kept wanting her to just stop
making that face
but i think that was the face that she
was coached into
and then in terms of her delivery it was
slow boring forgettable
it was really bad as speeches go
i thought it was quite quite bad
that said how do you think democrats
received it
because they're the only ones who matter
and the answer is they probably loved it
they probably loved it or at least the
people on television talking about it
said it was an amazing speech and she
was introduced to the world and
everything will be different but i think
she got a little over coached and she
didn't get rid of her
nervous body language i makes i make fun
of this all the time
that she moves too much when she talks
and she was doing that again
so now she had a mismatch between the
trying to talk slow and kind i'm trying
to talk slow and kind about
all the things in my background and what
made me the person i
am but her body was doing something out
of touch with what she was talking about
her body was acting like there was a
problem i got ants in my pants
i've got a little itch i wish i could
i've got an itch in the middle of my
back i wish i could scratch it but i'm
talking
so so the the the facial expression
the voice the body language
were they just looked like bad acting
so i would say it didn't work at all
however
where her coaches are trying to get her
is definitely closer to what she did
last night
than what she normally does that they
haven't found that sweet spot i don't
know if they will
but what i've said before about harris
is
don't underestimate her ability to learn
because she is ambitious she is smart
she got all the way to here
you know that's not an accident she can
learn
so you might see even in you know in 30
days
you might see an entirely different look
from her and it might be good
because i you know her ability to find
the right
sweet spot that actually matches her
natural personality better
i think she can do it but she's not
she's not there
um i predicted that you would see last
night
what i call generic attacks on trump
because they can't attack him on
specifics
the reason they can't attack him on
specifics is that leads to many
counter-attack possibilities if you say
well he ruined the economy
i think people would reasonably say uh
there was a coronavirus
sort of made a difference people will
say well he
he he botched the coronavirus response
and then people would say well what is
it you're proposing we would do
and if they asked that you would find
out is what we're already doing
so anything that they would attack on
the
you know and how about you're not good
with terrorists
and then the republicans would say uh
tell solomons
sallam any of that salome so many
tell isis he's not good with terrorists
i mean it's really hard to make an
attack on the
uh on the details because he's so good
on the details if you can measure it
he probably did well can you measure the
number of people he put on the supreme
court
you can you could just count them it's a
measurable thing
and according to the people who voted
for him did well
can you measure unemployment before the
coronavirus
you can can you measure gdp you can
can you look at the stock market and see
if at least
the people are optimistic about the
future which is sort of what it tells
you
you can there's an actual number it's
called the you know the dow jones
so they're staying away from anything
you can measure
because that's just trouble which is it
if you only knew that let's say you came
from another planet you're trying to
decide who to be the next
best president for the next term and the
only thing you knew
is that one side was talking about
measurable accomplishments
and the other side was criticizing them
on things that had nothing to do with
the accomplishments
who would you pick if that's all you
knew
so here are the here are the non-words
and generic attacks that we heard from
last night
by the way i tweeted yesterday before
the before last night's
stuff that what you'd see is this
people would be saying orange man is and
they fill in the character flaw
whatever character flaw they want to
give trump and therefore
some bad outcome but they won't be
connected
right yeah baghdadi solomon a he did get
rid of a few people
trump did all right so here are some of
the things that
they said about trump so they said that
biden
has decency honor and dignity which
implies that
trump doesn't have decency honor and
dignity
so then i say okay i suppose that's true
suppose everything you said is true how
does that matter to me
you're not connecting the dots okay
let's say trump doesn't have as much
decency honor and dignity as joe biden
let's say i accept that how did that
make my taxes change
did china attack us did
did nato kick us out
how in the world does any of this
translate into anything that matters to
the bottom line i can't see any
i can't even see the argument for it
much less
see it in the outcome uh here's some
more
kamalaris said that one of the things
that
trump has done that's bad is we have a
loss of certainty
a loss of certainty when did we ever
have certainty
do you ever remember a time back in
obama's days when we had
certainty about what we don't live in a
world with certainty what kind of a
dumbass thing is that to say about a
president that he's caused a loss of
certainty
i don't know and of course
chaos they like to use chaos what is the
republican version of chaos
if you're going to say if you're going
to say this president
has too much chaos here's what i'm going
to say
we call it shaken the box i'm not a
republican but
i'll use we in this case as pro-trump
he shakes the box and we talk about this
in positive terms
all the time in every realm that he
enters
the first thing he does is he shakes the
box because whatever was happening
before he got there wasn't working
and if and if you couldn't fix it with
the current
situation whatever topic you're talking
about
if there's something about it that's
just stuck and a solution is hard
the first thing he does is he just grabs
it and shakes it
all right now what it looks like things
are a little different
at least the way we're looking at it is
different did that work
no let me shake it again and
watching that happen in real time it's
easy to say that's chaos
because it looks like he's just trying
stuff all the time he'll just he'll just
toss out an idea
how many times have you heard uh has it
been has it happened
that trump would tweet something and
then some agency within the government
would say no we don't do that or we
can't do that or
they'll disagree with them or that's not
our policy or something happens all the
time
is that chaos nope
because do you know what you know what
happens every time that happens
every time that happens the entire brain
of the country you know all of us
individually
we start focusing on that thing he
wanted us to focus on
maybe he was right maybe he was wrong
maybe he disagrees with his own
administration
but what happens is the actual practical
outcome
is we all learn about that thing we
learned why he was wrong
if he was wrong we learn what is right
we learn why they're doing it the way
they're doing it and we learn what the
obstacle is
and we learn it instantly and sometimes
that helps does it ever hurt
not yet i can't think of a time can you
think of a time that
trump tweeted that thing that wasn't
true and something bad happened
i can't the only times that something
like that may have sort of happened
is when the illegitimate press the fake
news
turns it into something it wasn't if you
take away the
the impact of the you know the bad
intentions of the press
if you took that into the equation he
doesn't really cause any trouble with
his tweets that are accurate inaccurate
provocative not provocative offensive
not offensive
it doesn't really seem to hurt anything
it just makes us smarter
and it makes us focus
they call it chaos
the other thing uh harris says is we
need a president who will do the work
do the work that's sort of a um
a what do you call identity politics
term
doing the work means brainwashing
yourself into a new point of view
because you do have to brainwash
yourself to adopt any view
you know the current view you have is
probably a result of brainwashing
but doing the work is the process of
re-brainwashing yourself in a different
way
but it's kind of non-specific and then
obama so watching the
cnn hosts and guests talk about obama
and michelle obama's speeches is really
it's really fun if you're not on the
same page
because you're just seeing like it's
like a different world and apparently
they think that michelle obama did a
great speech
one that was better than anybody else's
speech i watched
much of it i didn't see that at all
i didn't think it was even good
did you now i can't tell how much of
this is bias
because you know that the team element
of just wanting to agree with your team
is so strong
but i don't feel as if aoc
had given a speech i use her as my
generic example of somebody who's a good
communicator
i don't feel like i would have had that
same feeling if aoc had given a speech
because i think she's a whole different
level i don't think michelle obama
as you know good as her intentions are i
think she's a quite honorable
person but her speech i didn't even feel
that was
above average really and then obama gave
his speech and i thought well
you know i've watched him for a long
time that that man can give a speech
and i thought to myself obama's going to
be strong he's really going to be
bringing the
bring in the heat and of course cnn says
that's exactly what happened that he was
he just you know eviscerated the
president and you know
really came strong and then i listened
to what he said
it was the weakest damn thing here
here's some of the things he said
now remember i told you that the leaf
blower would find leaves
leaves directly below my office window
for a solid hour
i wasn't wrong it's been a solid hour of
weed blowing
right below my window how is that even
possible
anyway here's what obama
i might murder the wit the leaf blower
guy in a minute
obama said that uh i never expected that
my successor
meaning trump would embrace my vision or
continue my policies
so i'm already bored my successor would
embrace
my vision or continue my
policies
so that's pure obama talk uh every word
is a lawyer trying seriously i think the
lay flower is going to come into my
all right don't swear
cursing but if that leaf blower shows up
in my office i would not be surprised i
don't know how much closer he can get to
where i'm sitting
um oh god this is bugging me i
i'm gonna try to get over this but and
by the way
that never mind
so this is this is what obama said
this if you can hear me over the leaf
blower
this is what obama said i didn't expect
him to embrace my vision or continue my
policies
i did hope for the sake of the country
that donald trump might show some
interest in taking the job seriously
what his attack
his attack on trump is that he read his
mind
and he saw on the inside of trump's mind
where nobody else can see it
he saw in there that trump doesn't take
the job seriously
do you get that is that what you're
seeing
are you feeling as if the president
doesn't take the job seriously
how about why don't we ask isis hey isis
do you think the president took the job
seriously oh that's right you're all
dead
how about uh let's let's talk to iran
hey ram do you think the president's
taking
his job seriously yeah you do
how about china that we're decoupling
from didn't see that coming didn't you
china
hey china do you think the president's
taking it seriously
he's decoupling and destroying your
whole damn country
for the benefit of the united states is
that taking you seriously because that
sounds pretty serious
to me the president is willing to send
in the
national guard to fix the democratic
violence in the cities but they have to
ask
they're ready does that sound like not
taking the job seriously
no it's the opposite that's taking the
job really really
seriously how about the fact that he
brags about before coronavirus how good
the
employment was for black americans and
every every other group
does he say that a lot yeah he can't
stop saying
how good employment was before this
trouble
so i've never seen anybody take anything
more seriously than the presidency
and for that to be the thing their line
of attack
they're reading his mind and he's not
taking it seriously
are you kidding me if there's one thing
that i would say with complete certainty
he's taking it seriously and here's the
other thing
i always think that you know it's true
that the
person changes the presidency it's true
that trump has changed the presidency
everybody who inhabits the office
changes the presidency a little bit
but for more than that the office
changes the person
and it's my belief and i'm quite firm in
this belief
the less you have somebody who's
literally crazy by the time they become
president
they are so indoctrinated in being
a good president and making sure the
country does well
that they can't do anything else now
some will do a better job some will be a
worse job
but they all care by the time they get
to the presidency
even if they didn't on day one they
become
indistinguishable from the country once
you're the president
it's not like you have a good day but
the country has a bad day
that can't happen it can't happen when
you're the president
if the country does well you had a good
day if the country did poorly
you had a bad day and i don't care who
you are
trump obama clinton reagan it doesn't
matter
if the country does well you had a good
day period
if the country doesn't you didn't have a
good day and there's no way that changes
and there's no way
that you should be dumb enough to think
that obama can read
trump's mind and see in there there's a
lack of seriousness
because that would be just bad
crazy
it doesn't matter who it is trump or
anybody else they're serious
by the time they're in that job there's
no option you don't have that you don't
have the option of just playing at that
job
you know you maybe you can find ways to
enjoy yourself but he's not playing
it's serious business
um here's here's some other faint praise
he said about biden
this is obama quote he was my brother in
the white house
he made me a better president he will
make it a better country
now how do you interpret he made me a
better president
wasn't that obama bragging about himself
if the best compliment you could give
another person
is that they made you better that's a
little bit more about you
isn't it yeah i think obama was bragging
how he got better because of biden
i don't know exactly how what was it
that biden did that made him a better
president
i don't know it's unstated and then he
says he was my brother in the white
house
what's that mean are we supposed to like
him as our president because he was your
brother in the white house
it's all these it's it's nonsense kind
of words
that if you didn't put any critical
thinking to it you'd say oh
this makes sense i love biden because he
was like obama's brother in the white
house
it doesn't mean anything there's no
meaning
all right uh what else did he say that
was
he but he never did this is obama talk
about trump
for close to four years now he's shown
no interest in putting
in the work so this is the phrase here
the work
he has no interest in putting in the
work no interest in finding common
ground
based on what how can you tell somebody
has no interest
and using the awesome power uh it's just
so i would say that obama's speech was
weak now part of that is that
if you watch uh trump for four years
trump brings the entertainment he brings
the energy he brings the provocation
he brings the whole package to a speech
and we used to think obama was really
good at this
but now i watch it and even you know
even though other people are saying he
nailed it and this was a powerful speech
i didn't see any of that i it felt
empty and listless and uh and completely
bereft of
energy uh i saw it as a pillow fight
against a knife attack really um
on another topic i think we need an
executive order to allow
parents to always have a telestream a
live video into classrooms
because as you know the teachers unions
are destroying america
and by the way if you don't know how
they're doing it the teachers unions
have
tons of money because there are lots of
teachers
as long as there are lots of teachers
and they all pay dues
you can have a lot of money so the
nature of who they represent
just because there are a lot of them
guarantees that they'll have a lot of
money from the dues
and then they can use that money
politically so
part of what the teachers unions do is
you know they get the teachers good uh
you know good representation and they do
that very well
because the teachers have really good
representation it's a strong union
but part of the reason that they do that
or that they can do it is that they're
buying politicians
they can they can fund a campaign at the
local level
and pretty much get whoever they want
elected which is democrats
because they have so much money and then
once elected
they basically own that politician
because
the politician needs continued support
or they can't get reelected
so the the school the teachers unions
are are rich enough that they can
control local politics
which allows them to control basically
way too much
and it also they can control so much
politically seriously how is there still
a leaf blower outside my
my window i'm gonna i'm gonna lose it in
a minute here i mean i'm just gonna lose
it
you can't blow that many leaves in a
10-foot square area
it's just not possible all right enough
of that
uh i don't even know what i was talking
about i'm so angry now
about the classrooms and the teachers
unions
so that's how the teachers unions do
what they're doing which is destroying
the lives of
families and perpetuating systemic
racism because
they're so powerful that they can get
rid of their own competition
they can even make it impossible to have
a charter school or a private school
because they'll they control the
politicians and the politicians
control whether there's competition for
schools it's the worst system you could
ever
imagine do you know who designed that
system
and who's in favor of that democrats
because as i've told you their empathy
is excellent
excellent empathy caring
first-rate those don't if you want if
you want somebody to just care about
something
call a democrat they are pretty good at
that i give it to them
but they also have too much power and
they've designed a system
that doesn't um it doesn't take into
account human motivation
right the human motivation of the
teachers union is to protect
itself is that a high goal no
it's not but it but republicans
would design systems that understand
that people have
motivations and the incentives and if
you create a teachers union and you give
them that much money
they're going to want to stay in power
they're going to want to keep their
money
and they're not going to do things that
are good for the public
they're going to do things that are good
for the teachers and the teachers unions
it's a bad system so one way around that
system
would be uh i i don't think you could do
this necessarily with an executive order
but
who knows what you can do with an
executive order these days
and that is um
seriously there's still a leaf blower
out there it's been
over an hour for one hour
that leaf blower has been directly below
my window an hour
how is that even possible
and if i go outside with the camera to
show you you'll see him right below
there
blowing leaves for another half hour i
don't know what's going on there
i can't even talk about this anymore i'm
so mad all right
[Music]
yeah i can't even i can't even go on
anymore i've done enough
we'll talk about this other stuff later
and i will talk to you tomorrow
oh hold on did he just stop
oh my god that just happened didn't it
the moment i touched my screen to end
this periscope
at exactly that moment the leaf blower
stopped
that really happened all right
well let me say what i was going to say
i will go on
i can actually think now it is really
hard to think when that's going on
um watch
so we should have cameras in the
classrooms if the if an executive order
could do that that'd be great i doubt it
can
but you know i imagine the schools would
have some control over that there might
be some privacy issues
but unless the parents can directly see
what's happening in the schools it's not
going to change
so if we can have body cams on police
why can't we have
a body cam so to speak in a classroom
not on a teacher but just in the
classroom
there might be some privacy issues but
if there's something happening in that
classroom
that you don't want parents to see
isn't that a problem i feel like the
parents need to have control of that
and that would be a better system now
would you get too many complaining
parents probably
but it's a better system than what we
have
um rasmussen is teasing that
something happened with the president's
approval
apparently overnight the president's job
approval
jumped up sharply he got way more
approval
overnight is there anything that's been
happening
let's say the last i don't know
day or two days is there anything
happening politically that would make
the president's approval go
up could it be the democratic convention
because it's sort of the only thing
that's happening that hasn't you know
that isn't just a continuation of things
that have been happening
kind of feels kind of feels like
uh feels like that all right
uh in normal years i would say the fake
news
is a good term for the fake news but in
a election year
this is just disinformation wouldn't you
say
it feels to me like the news is just a
disinformation
operation now it's definitely worse than
it was even during the
well i don't know if it's worse but
watching chris cuomo
trying to spin the russia collusion as
if it sort of
sort of kind of in a way actually
happened
but didn't technically happen but in a
sort of kind of way that you can talk
about it
maybe it did happen and that the idea
that there was some kind of a conspiracy
and that obama was involved is just
crazy talk because obama wasn't involved
with
the fisa that was actually a reason that
chris cuomo gave that since obama wasn't
involved with the fisa process therefore
logically he wasn't wasn't he didn't
know what was going on
doesn't make any sense then he complains
bitterly
that the campaign was not spied on what
it wasn't spied on it was definitely
spied on
that we don't have to wonder about but
they use the word spied
you know well the definition of the word
spied
may apply to a slightly different
situation we know that
we know that the word spied you know has
a more specific meaning
you're not really answering the question
if they
intentionally surveilled the president's
people
which is obviously what happened
that was spying you can try to put a
different word on it but that's not
gonna change anything
all right um
the president also signaled
that uh boycotts are gonna work both
ways from now on
and he actually called for a boycott on
goodyear tires
now i don't know if that was a good idea
or a bad idea
because it turns out that goodyear has
sixty thousand employees
and if you're any of those sixty
thousand employees and you just found
out that the president
targeted your company for destruction
you might not want to vote republican
this time around
so i'm not positive that going after
a company with that many employees i'm
not positive that was a good play
but here's what i love about it and
again
there are times when you you fall in
love with trump you don't just like what
he did
and here's what i do like about this
the problem of these boycotts in other
words people being canceled losing their
job for a political opinion
etc is so big
that the president basically said he
would put an american company and a
business
for doing it think about that
the president of the united states has
identified
this problem as big enough that he would
put
a huge american company right out of
business he's the
jobs president and he would put this
damn company right out of business
for just that do you hate that
i don't know if it gets them elected i
just don't know if it's wise politically
but you kind of like it don't you you
kind of like it if you don't work for a
good year of course
that'd be pretty bad over there but if
you see that he's willing to actually
bankrupt and i don't think this will
happen by the way i doubt there will be
much difference in goodyear's business
but he showed a clear willingness to
bankrupt a major american company
over this are you okay with that
you kind of are aren't you you kind of
are
because this canceled culture would
destroy the country
and he's and he's put he just dropped
the gauntlet he said
i'll tell you what if you want to play
this game
it's not going to be one-sided you're
not going to be the only one
playing and let me show you by putting
on the line an entire american company
an entire
punt i kind of liked it
even though i don't know if that helps
him get elected but i kind of like he
would bankrupt a major american company
over this because that feels like he has
your back a little bit right
if you've been canceled if you have you
know
if you're afraid to talk up at work and
have an opinion
feels like he's got your back a little
bit now doesn't it
yeah and you're looking at the comments
people are saying they love it
now i don't want anything bad to happen
to goodyear and i think the details of
what they did is a little murky i think
they were trying to be inclusive and not
political
they just sort of misfired a little bit
on the messaging
so you know i don't know that good year
is worth
boycotting but i do like the fact that
the president was willing to actually
execute
a major american company over this
that's how important it was over this he
was willing to execute them
totally on board with the attitude but
maybe not goodyear
here's a little red pill for you that
might get me assassinated
i said in the long run that all
governments will be controlled by their
own intelligence services
but then if trump wins we we can
stall that a little bit because trump is
not
um but you can't hold it off
indefinitely
and here's here's the thinking the
intelligence
operation of any country will eventually
have control of the leaders and the
country because that's what they do
that's that's their skill set and
while they might not succeed in any
given year
so maybe you know 1989 maybe
nobody was trying to take over the
government or get control
but if you wait long enough and you have
enough different people who cycle
through the intelligence agencies
somebody's going to make a play for
controlling the country
they'll have an argument where it's good
for the country or not
but somebody's going to make a play
let's say 9 and a 10 times they fail
they only have to succeed once and then
they own the country
you could argue that j edgar hoover
succeeded that way he had enough
blackmail i guess on
different politicians that effectively
if it was an issue that
hoover cared about he controlled it
so in effect hoover kind of ran the
country but only cared about certain
things
so it didn't matter so much what if they
start caring about more stuff
so in the long run the only way it can
go because the
the math is inevitable if you've got a
agency that has the talent
to take over a country that's what they
do it's what they do
and you give them infinite time to try
it well it didn't happen in the 60s
well didn't happen in the 70s yeah
they tried but it didn't happen in the
80s the 90s took a run at it
didn't work it's not going to not work
forever
and also you wouldn't know if it already
worked now
if you're russia and you've got putin as
the head of your country
you could say well looks like it worked
in that case
you don't think that his kbgb stuff
helped him become the leader
of course it did is it a coincidence
that george bush the senior worked for
was ahead of the cia and then became
president
maybe it's a coincidence maybe
so the question you have to ask yourself
is
since it's a guarantee just
mathematically
risk management it's a guarantee that
intelligence agencies eventually control
every country they're in has it happened
yet
has it you don't know and you wouldn't
know
but one of the things you'd look for is
that the media
the messaging coming out of the news
would be
fake in a certain way and it is
so if you look at the news it looks like
it's just coming out of
intelligence agencies because now it's
it's just disinformation
it's no longer this harmless little fake
news where they're picking aside and
they know who their audience is and all
that it's way beyond that
now the you know the cnns and the new
york times
are directly trying to run the country
through the way they cover the news who
does that tell you is in charge
is it the fake news making their own
decisions that they've all decided to
cover things a certain way
maybe could be could be that
but it suggests that intelligence
services are already controlling at
least the
news so president trump i believe is
free of that influence
but that's the thing he has to beat so
he's fighting the fake news and the fake
news
may or may not already be controlled by
intelligence agencies
now if you uh follow say glenn greenwald
and a lot of other people
they will tell you the nbc and therefore
i suppose
msnbc are just direct organs of the cia
and that they basically are just cia
cutouts
i don't know what a cutout is i
shouldn't use official words when i
don't know what they mean
but the question is how many of the
other
organizations are the same situation all
right that's all i wanted to talk about
today
and i will talk to you later
