hey everybody
come on in it's time
for coffee with scott adams best time of
the day
yeah good morning omar
good morning the rest of you and
today is the last day of periscope
feels like the end of an era but you're
not done with me yet
you know i've been simultaneously doing
this on youtube
as the youtube viewers looking at me
right now now
so if you're looking for me go to
youtube and just google
real coffee with scott adams i think
there might be like a fake one
but look for real coffee with scott
adams
and you'll get me there now i'm also
planning to add at least one more
platform
now i don't know if the new twitter
whatever live thing will be something i
can use
i haven't looked into it yet but um i
might go to rumble
so i might be simultaneously on on that
but i haven't looked into it yet all
right
so you want to talk about all the things
or do you want to do the simultaneous
sip yeah
i know what you want but all you need is
a copper mugger glass a tanker chelsea
style and a canteen jugger flask a
vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid and i
like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes everything better is called
the simultaneous set but it happens now
go
well i was trying to figure out
why people who normally would be
of the same opinion as i
disagree with me so much on this one
question
of vaccine passports and i finally
figured out what it is it took me a
while
because i couldn't figure out why why my
view which i thought
just seemed completely reasonable was
just a mile away
from most of you actually probably the
majority of you and here's here's the
the answer that i have preliminarily
when you hear the government is going to
implement a system
what happens in your brain every alarm
goes off right
it doesn't matter what the system is if
the government is going to impose a new
system
you don't like it and the other
assumption and this is the the
part i finally realized the the
difference is
that when i when i see that the
government is considering
implementing a system i make the
following assumptions
which are different than yours so this
is why we ended up on different
places my assumption well let's do your
assumption first
your assumption you mean most of you not
every one of you
your assumption is that if the
government puts in any new
system it's just a slippery slope or
even doesn't even take much slipping
to be a monstrous mistake
and it doesn't even matter what the
system is if the government's going to
do it
and it's going to have some effect on
you it's just going to be a giant
you know screw-up now if that's your if
that's your
philosophy that it doesn't even matter
what the system is they're going to do
it wrong
and they're going to do it in the worst
possible way so it doesn't just solve
help solve a pandemic it actually
removes your rights forever
like the worst possible thing you can do
is it reasonable to assume that the
government would just
do the worst possible implementation
i would say no in my opinion that's not
reasonable
it's not reasonable here's what i think
i think that it more likely starts
starts exactly like yours
day one the government implements a new
program doesn't matter if it's this
vaccine
vaccination passport or anything else
on day one how does it look pretty bad
right
pretty bad like obamacare day one you
know the
websites don't work and stuff so i would
agree with you so far
all right so so far we're on the same
page everything the government does
is a gigantic mistake
on day one right so we're on the same
page there
but where we differ is that i think
things improve over time
and you think that they're a slippery
slope to something worse
doesn't mean you're wrong doesn't mean
you're wrong
so so far we're not disagreeing right so
far
here's uh and then to find out which of
those views
is more likely reasonable i think you'd
have to look at
historical examples now the problem is
historical examples are never exacts
right they're analogies they they feel
the same but it's not the same
situations
i've argued that the government
routinely puts in
short-term measures and then removes
them when they're not necessary
other people say you idiot once they put
in anything
short term and and money starts being
involved it just
ends up being forever taxes being a
you know an example that's given
somebody gave an example that the
government raised taxes four percent uh
to pay for world war ii and then we've
just been taxed forever
but nothing's really like taxes because
i think every country that doesn't have
massive oil revenue has taxes
so i'm not sure you can you can say that
hey we have taxes therefore the
government always
does x y we're just sort of like every
other
country we have taxes to run the country
so that's not a good example
but what about other things let's take
um
a patriot act okay there's there's a
good one the patriot act
has the patriot act uh hurt any of you
personally
how many of you have been somehow
inconvenienced by the patriot act
is there anybody here whose life was
affected
by the patriot act
uh what would be some examples i see
yeses
and what are the examples i haven't
talked
i haven't talked about crypto yet that's
coming up um
with the spending no the spending okay
so but again
the spending is sort of hard to compare
that to anything
um yeah i'm just looking at your uh
comments now all right so a lot of you
are otsa
et cetera but here's the thing there are
lots of things the government does that
need to be done
so if they do something that needs to be
done and it continues to need to be done
is that the government failing or are
they just taking care of things when
they need to
and then they just keep doing it is that
a problem
what about when there's a fema emergency
in their
emergency restrictions put in place has
the government ever declared an
emergency
and then just kept the restrictions in
place after the emergency was over
has that ever happened unless it made
sense for some reason
i can't think of it um
been to an airport in the last 30 years
well of course airports have security
because they think they need it
right wouldn't you want good security in
an airport
do you not want that i i kind of like
the good security in the airport
uh fisa court good example do you but
the fisa court is probably being
examined now right
i don't i forget the details all right
so the examples you give me are things
which
um i'm not so sure the that the public
is against
which of the things you mentioned would
the public
um by a majority be against
i don't know the answer to that but that
wasn't that sounded like a uh
sounded like a point it was an actual
question
um tsa has caught zero terrorists
so there's somebody here who thinks that
the airport should not have
uh the high level of security that they
do
wouldn't that just make it obvious that
planes would start blowing up
the fisa thing is a good example of
something that
became a problem and is it not being
reviewed right now
so my point is this that when things
become a problem we
we then get serious about it and try to
solve it
private security might be better
somebody said well i don't know about
that
all right so i'm very interested in your
examples so here's the thing
i think that the vaccine the vaccination
passports people are saying
next thing you know they'll be putting
other health care information on there
to which i say really
you think other health care information
is going to end up on that database
i could see other vaccinations i could
see that
but what other health care information
would need to be on there
what business isn't going to let you in
because of your health situation
to me it seems like the market will take
care of this
let's say we have vaccination passports
and
airlines require it
how is that different from now i mean
i've flown a few times during the
pandemic
and each time they required me to get a
covet test
that's negative and i just got the test
and then i flew it was inconvenient and
i didn't like it
but i prefer doing that knowing that
other people also took the test
if you gave me a choice of flying
without it or flying with the test
i would have taken the test so
i'm never against the government having
useful information
so here's here's the bottom line those
of you who are saying
my god the government messes up
everything it's going to be a
slippery slope
as abe says slippery slopes are slippery
well i'm not sure that's a reason but
i acknowledge i acknowledge your
suspicion that the government ruins
everything
i would just say that if you looked at
everything the government's done
you'd probably find more successes than
failures
and i don't think we have the government
that would allow us to move to full
the social credit system so let me make
you this offer
for those of you who are worried if our
government
um either slips into it or decides to
have a social credit system
like the chinese social credit system
do we all agree that we will overthrow
the government
democrats republicans we'll just all
throw in together on this one
and just overthrow the government
i mean actually overthrow the government
not
not just you know make small changes
so here here's a guy who says i'm out
scott has gone full blown
bootlicker i just told you that i'm
gonna i'm gonna be on your side to
overthrow the whole government
so if you think you're less extreme than
me
maybe listen for the rest of the story
so here's what i think i think sometimes
the government needs to do some things
especially in an emergency
i think that if they go too far we
overthrow the government
we don't really live in the country
where the government is going to
ride roughshod rush shot what's that
word
i don't think we live in a country that
the government can abuse us
the way china can abuse its citizens i
think we have too many guns
we have too many patriots we have too
many freedom loving people
and we're just not that personality you
know countries have a personality
you know that right so it's a lot of
different individuals
but america has a personality and there
is a limit
right and nobody here nobody is going to
be okay with the social credit system
right so if you're worried that i've
gone full bootlecker
bootlicker let me tell you i would take
up arms and i would be
part of an armed insurrection against
the government
if they do a social credit system so
um is that badass is that bad enough for
you
right are the rest of you not with me
you wouldn't
you wouldn't take up arms if they did
that
because somebody says bs no i would take
up arms
i'm not kidding yeah you there is a
limit
that every citizen has i'm just telling
you what mine is
that's my limit how many things in this
country are
opposed by a majority of the public
can you think of somebody says
you are no badass
what do you know about me
the my personality has this uh
strange characteristic which is i'm
totally flexible
until i'm not and
sometimes that fools people because
people see me very being very flexible
let me i will consider your argument i'd
like to fully consider both sides seem
very flexible
i'm very flexible and i try to be until
i'm not
and i just told you where not happens
social credit system
that's when i'm not flexible anymore
there's no argument there
there's a point beyond which nobody is
flexible that's my point
all right um let's talk about these
floyd trial i'm learning that there's
such a thing as a
two there are two ways to choke a person
apparently
there's the air choke where you're
you're cutting off their airflow and
then there's the blood choke
which i only heard of today apparently
if you're an mma fighter you know about
this stuff
in a blood choke you're apparently
putting pressure on
i don't know the arteries or what veins
or whatever
i think arteries and cutting off the
blood flow
so the air choke cuts off the air the
blood choke
cuts off the blood and uh
at least two mma fighters have said that
when they look at it
it looks like chauvin or chavin whoever
he is
was uh adjusting to make sure he had
a blood joke instead of an air choke
now what is the significance of this
first of all i wouldn't know the
difference and i don't know if it's
true but if it were true i did a little
bit of googling
did a little bit of uh googling
and it seems that some people say the
the blood joke the one he's allegedly
used
would cause you to pass out but it
wouldn't kill you
um but i suppose it depends how long you
do it
right if you did it forever then it
would kill you i guess
so somebody says i think doctors would
be able to tell what kind of choke it
was
well only if there was a tissue damage
right
so what i don't know is if you did a
blood joke
would that necessarily leave some
bruising
or or damage i don't know if you did it
for nine minutes
maybe i don't know so
so my remaining questions are uh would a
blood choke be deadly
would it be deadly i don't know um
if you held it long enough maybe so
we'll wait on that see let's see what's
going on there
um so biden has this infrastructure plan
that's going to cost a few trillion
dollars and
gets into all kinds of stuff and here's
my question on it
and i want to see if you uh if you know
the answer to this
does this pay for itself because
the infrastructure is not like other
things you know if you
fund a bunch of infrastructure it ends
up employing tons of people
and the the kinds of people it employs
are
exactly the ones we want to get employed
right the
ones who maybe don't have an advanced
college degree
but for all sorts of construction
infrastructure jobs they're exactly the
right people
um you know
so i would love to know what the
economists are saying about this
because wouldn't you like to know if it
pays for itself
meaning if you get this much this many
people
employed they start buying things the
economy goes well
the places that they bought stuff pay
taxes
um does it pay for itself i just i just
wonder that
now it could be that we just have to do
it you know so it doesn't matter if it
pays for itself you just have to do it
because the country's crumbling
otherwise uh
have you driven on an american road
recently
i swear to god i'm going to get like a
baja dune buggy or something just to
drive around on california roads
because the whole time here's it's just
potholes and cracks and bumps and
 so we certainly need some
infrastructure
especially for the uh low-income people
if if wi-fi is part of this or 5g i hope
i hope 5g is in here can somebody tell
me if
5g infrastructure or at least wi-fi or
something
it's in there right so i don't have an
opinion on the infrastructure plan
i'd want to see some economists tell me
if this actually ends up being
positive because it might it has that
quality
all right there's a very
uh disturbing story about youtube
competitor
library.com i think they pronounce it
that way but it's spelled
l-b-r-y and
they use some kind of a blockchain token
based
system uh to be a fully
censorship resistant platform
and the government has decided that
because of their bitcoin like
token that they're an unregistered
security
which and they've been sued so the sec
has sued
this company for being an unregistered
security
now uh
do you think this would happen if google
did not have a lot of money and was the
competitor to this
i mean am i i suppose the sec might just
look at it and say hey
you know these these tokens are a
problem but
though you have to worry that google has
so much money
that they can influence somebody to take
a look at a competitor
like you worry about that don't you i
feel they do have that clout
now should the sec be closing down
anything that's got a bitcoin-like token
well i of course am biased on this
question
very biased and i don't believe they
should
if the company is going through the due
diligence
lawyers etc to make sure that they're on
the right side of the law
most of the companies that have any kind
of a token did do that
they went through a pretty expensive
process
it's going to cost you tens of thousands
of dollars to issue a token
if you want to make sure you've checked
all the right boxes
i'm sure library did that you know
chances are
that they lawyered up the way they would
typically so
this is really chilling if the
government can start closing down
um you know blockchain related
businesses
because of the the token element of it
which which isn't a lot of them
that's a pretty big problem and
in many ways uh blockchain is sort of
the alternative to our government
you know i mean people who don't follow
blockchain etc just think it's like a
crypto
way to make some money they don't
realize it could be
you know transforming society because uh
of the uh distributed power of it it's a
longer story but
we got to be really worried about this
and uh
i don't know if that would have happened
under trump so that's
that might be another biden situation
all right let's talk about the matt
gates story the fun
story of the day except fun for
everybody except the matt gates
family and you know the story the story
is that
new york times is saying that matt gees
is under investigation
for uh no actually i'm going to change
the story
i'm going to say that the story is that
matt geese is the subject of an
extortion plot
that should be the top story because
there's two parts of the story
there's an allegation that he was paying
some kind of sex trafficking thing with
a 17 year old
of which we have no evidence that she
even exists
right so there's no evidence that
anything like that happened that we've
seen
zero evidence but matt gates did say
that the allegations were somehow
connected to
a uh an extortion plot
in which he actually named a lawyer a
real person he gave his name on tv
on the tucker carlson show and said this
lawyer
has been trying to extort us my father
wore a wire
and our plan to get him on tape
extorting us
was thwarted by this rather coincidental
leak about the new york times or the new
york times
leak about the investigation
is it a coincidence because matt gates
says this can't be a coincidence
that just when they were going to get
the actual recorded goods on this
this alleged
guy who was blackmailing him or
extorting i don't know if it's the same
thing extorting i guess
that just before they were going to get
the evidence that would damn him forever
the new york times broke the story which
made it impossible to get that evidence
but there would be other uh witnesses
apparently there would be multiple
witnesses according to matt gates that
would back up his story that there was
this extortion plot
now what do we have evidence of
and what do we not have evidence of we
have
evidence i would say
really highly credible evidence because
matt gates
named an actual person on tv
now is matt gates smart enough to know
that you don't name somebody to be part
of a major crime
give their actual name especially if
that person is a lawyer
who's part of a major law firm
would you would you slander somebody on
tv
who was a lawyer who was part of a law
firm
if you couldn't if you couldn't back it
up
do you think so i don't see any chance
he would have said what he said unless
he believes it's true
right whether he can demonstrate that to
us is
you know to be seen but i would say if
you if you're trying
to score this and then predict we'll
we'll put some
odds on stuff right and what i'm trying
to do is just
walk you through how how you would look
at this story and how you would guess
what
what's true and what's not so so far i
would say the odds of him having a
legitimate complaint about this
extortion thing
having other witnesses that will back it
up
and i think law enforcement was involved
so
i mean he's going to have really good
sources not just his family there'll be
somebody from law enforcement that's
going to back up his story i think
so i'm going to give that credibility
of 90
90 so i would say that what he's saying
is
probably almost certainly true if you
were going to predict its likelihood
now let's say what is the likelihood
that uh before he was engaged because
matt matt gates is engaged right now
but before that it was fairly well known
that he was
let's say an active single guy
and he was an active single guy who's
good looking
young and on tv and has power
how do you think he did dating
pretty well right do you think he needed
to pay for sex
in fact in the entire united states if
you were to rank
people by how likely they had to pay for
sex
he would be real near the bottom right
of all the men in the world who needed
to pay for sex
he would be at the bottom right
that's just true so what what are the
odds
that he paid for sex
if he were rich if you were rich you
might say well you know
sometimes he pays for it it's just
easier or whatever but he's not even
rich
right he's not even rich so
the odds that he would pay for something
he could get in unlimited quantity for
free
seems low to me it seems low so i'm
going to put the odds of that
i don't know five percent
something like that and only five
percent in the
anything's possible category not that
there's any evidence for it
number two the woman involved has not
been named
and matt gates says he doesn't even know
who they're talking about
do you think he traveled with somebody
paid her money
and can't even think who they're talking
about what did he travel with so many 17
year olds he's like i don't know which
even
i don't even know which one they're
talking about no
it sounds pretty credible when he says i
don't even know the name
i i couldn't even tell you who they're
talking about
she hasn't been named right now you're
saying that
she was 17 i don't know if she's still
17. now it was a while ago
do you think she's still 17
um somebody says lyle says wait until
scott gets
me tooed it's coming i assume so
i assume so i assume people will come
for me so
we have no evidence whatsoever of the
allegations against
matt gates we have a pretty good
credible
set of facts that he is being extorted
now um let's say this
here let's just walk through what we
know
there are no charges filed and
apparently this investigation has been
happening since october
do you think it would take that long to
file charges
i don't know unless it was part of some
larger thing but we don't have any
evidence of that
so that's suspicious here's the other
thing
when this sort of thing happens how
often is it limited to
one accuser how often is a famous
politician
accused of some kind of anything in this
sexual impropriety range in this case
only
because of the age and the allegation
money was involved
but how many how many times does that
end with there was just one person
accusing
it's always the third one that gets you
like cuomo right
it's never the first one because the
first one everybody goes uh
maybe maybe not you know a certain age
he's only had one accuser
but by the time you get to the third one
you go oh god there's a pattern
right it's always the third one it
doesn't matter if it's bill clinton it
doesn't matter who it is
um but we've had no third one no second
one
so if the longer you go without other
people coming forward and saying oh
you know the same thing happened to me
the credibility
you know keeps going down all right and
there are no witnesses that we know of
so although it makes sense that maybe
the 17 year old if she's still 17
might not be named would there not be
one witness somewhere no witness
that we've heard of not to say they
don't exist but
i feel like we would have heard of juan
a witness
or even that a witness exists so
the lack of uh evidence here is sort of
shocking all right so what do we know
about uh matt gates we know that he is
probably one of the most anti-war
republicans
would you say that's fair he is one of
the most anti-war
republicans which would make some
enemies wouldn't it
now would that make you an enemy of
china
do you think china could be behind this
in any way
i don't think so because i think china
prefers people who don't like war
in the united states how about russia
would russia be trying to take him out
i don't think so because they would like
also the united states to have
somebody who doesn't like war um
so it wouldn't be china or russia
so if if there were any foreign
influence
you know any foreign interference you'd
have to look for somebody who
did not want the united states to be too
anti-war
all right now that could be people
within the united states who have an
interest in
you know the uh the industrial war
machine
but you always have to worry about
foreign influence so you'd have to be
looking for some kind of a country
that wanted the united states not to be
anti-war how about iran
iran do you think iran would not want
an anti-war president i think they'd
want us to have an anti-war president
because matt gates is often you know
he's mentioned in the
the short list of people who could be a
presidential candidate
so probably not iran probably not
china probably not russia and we don't
have any evidence that there's any
external anything here right so there's
no evidence of another country
let's see what else we know um here's a
coincidence
there's a major epstein story that's
breaking today
about a new accuser and some terrible
allegations
now it's kind of interesting because the
epstein story has been around for a
while
you know the epstein story has been
around for a while
so every now and then it it pops up
but it's kind of interesting that the
epstein's story
popped up the same day that these
allegations about
gates are in the news what's that do to
your brain
well you can look at social media and
you can see exactly what it does to your
brain
it conflated them suddenly
because these two stories that don't
have anything to do with each other
are just in your mind at the same time
what's that make you think a little bit
of matt gates right
suddenly you've got oh epstein this is
all true
right we know the epstein stuff is true
no but nobody's doubting that it's true
and we know it's awful we know it has
underage teenage
girls in it right now suddenly it's it's
in the news in the same day
could it be well somebody says it's
related but i don't think
i don't think there's any suggestion
that the stories are related
but they're related in your brain aren't
they
now if somebody had say decided that
there was a good thing for this story to
be in the news at the same time
because it would be bad for matt gates
you'd have to wonder who could have that
kind of influence
over the news well democrats
democrats could have that kind of
influence over the news
and democrats could say you know let's
put this story on at the same time
because this is going to be really good
to have them out there at the same time
yeah democrats now that's if it's
domestic
so um
i would say that there's uh there's
gonna be more uh
there there will be layers to this story
at the moment the information we have
would
would suggest to me that the story is
not real
and uh that there might be
some forces behind this that
we are yet to learn of so that's what it
looks like
now let's test our uh prediction skills
so i'm going to go on record as saying
that my prediction is that the extortion
against matt gates
will be demonstrated and the allegations
against them
will not hold up in time
that's my prediction let's see your
predictions give me your predictions on
both
will the extortion thing turn out to be
true
uh and or will the allegation about the
17 year old
turn out to be true give me your
predictions
um you're all agreeing with me
that's not supposed to happen
uh i'm saying no's but i don't know what
the no means i'm seeing people agreeing
but the nose you need to be more
specific
um the people say no i'm not sure what
the no is for
somebody says yeah uh
nestor is sort of his uh
adopted son if you'll call him that
nester seems part of the story because
he's young
but i don't think he's part of the story
interesting interesting when was the
last time you saw so many people
not believe an allegation i can't think
of another time
generally when there's an allegation
don't you even if it's your guy
or or you're you're not guy um
don't you feel that whenever there's an
there's an allegation you think to
yourself
probably probably true right
the kavanaugh thing really changed
everything didn't it and uh
yeah i think the kavanaugh thing just
opened our brains to the fact that these
can be made up
and i i think i think most of you are
being
pretty uh non-critical about this now
there is a big risk in this gate story
whoever is trying to take him out and
the big risk is it's going to make him
president
if this thing falls apart the way it
looks like it's going to fall apart
you're going to have to ask yourself why
they want matt gates
out of the picture do you remember the
story we saw some documents that showed
that the
democrats and i think hillary was part
of the story
were intentionally trying to get the
news
to promote trump or ted cruz as the
nominee
because they figured that they would be
the easiest to beat
so we already know that the democrats
have colluded with
the news industry to try to manipulate
who is the
republican candidate
kind of looks like that doesn't it
doesn't it look like
the democrats at least if it's domestic
does it look like the democrats are
colluding with
the media i mean it looks exactly like
it
we can't say that's happening but we
know it did happen
and we know it could still happen
because nothing would stop anybody from
talking to anybody right there's nothing
that would stop it from happening again
and why wouldn't they do it again what
would be
any reason not to do it again so
here's what you have to look for whoever
the democrats
slash news business is trying to take
out
is the one they fear the most whoever is
getting
surprisingly a lot of attention
maybe who they fear the least
so watch out for the media telling you
that
you know that the strong candidates for
republican presidency
that they're having some scandals
because i think
everybody who's strong is going to have
a scandal let me make a prediction
if you look at other strong republican
candidates who
who's on the list well ted cruz right
he would be right at the top of the list
of potential presidential candidates
how is he doing lately you see the the
media is totally
totally ganging up on ted cruz right you
could watch it yourself
so it's obvious that the media has crews
in their
in their sights desantis now desantis is
looking
really strong and i have to say
if you had asked me just even a few
months ago you know could desantis be
you know the candidate for president i
would have said no i
i just don't think he has the the vibe
there's something that's um
looks a little bit more state government
about him do you know what i mean
it feels like maybe governor was
like his maximum you know he he hit his
potential and
he's a good good governor um
but lately lately i would say his
handling of the
the coronavirus um is sort of
he's like uh starting to elevate and
i i would say that my own opinion of him
as a presidential candidate has changed
has changed from not too exciting to
huh this guy is making some gutsy calls
and you kind of want you want a
president who can make a gutsy call
right you want a governor who maybe
plays it safe
but when you're talking about president
you need somebody who can
violate some expectations and he just
did that with it the
the vaccine passport just perfect
example
no matter what you think of the the
passport which is a separate question
the fact that he just said i'm you know
screw this
you're not doing it in my state that's
presidential
that's presidential so i think he
elevated on that
so i would expect to see some rumors
about uh
him i would expect to see the media try
to take out tom cotton
i think tom cotton is looking strong i
think the media is going to try to take
him out
so look for some some kind of story
about him coming up
all right name a major problem in the
u.s
that is not caused by china
all right you got the pandemic
china you've got the economic
devastation of the pandemic
china you've got the story about the
vaccination passports
china you've got the
fentanyl coming across the border
china you've got the uh
economic destruction of the u.s middle
class for the last
30 years china
you've got racial unrest in america now
you're saying to yourself
scott what do they have to do with that
do you think that the racial unrest in
america
is just happening on its own
do you think that we're talking about um
violence against asian americans because
that just happens to be what's happening
and it's important and it's a top topic
and that's why we're talking about it no
we're talking about it because somebody
wants us to talk about it
now i'm not minimizing the problem
let me say this as clearly as possible
we don't want any violence against
asian americans or any americans right
so yeah and especially when you put an
ethnicity on it it's worse than even
regular violence so we all agree on that
we don't want any of it you know zero is
the right amount
but there are a lot of problems in this
country
and the headlines are you know maybe 20
different things will be in the
headlines at any given time
but we have you know 100 problems that
are pretty big
who decides which ones are in the
headlines well
um there are smart people who i won't
name who would tell you that china
already controls our headlines
through um artificial intelligence
do they now i don't think that china
controls
all of our headlines i think that every
country every foreign country
tries to control just specific headlines
so would china use let's say
tick doc to create
enough energy on tick tock about uh
asian american
violence and discrimination that tick
tock would bleed over to
snapchat because those two are highly
correlated you know the young people on
tiktok or also on snapchat
so anything that becomes big on tick
tock owned
by china becomes presumably big on
snapchat
and from there presumably it would
infect the rest of social media
so do you think that the reason we're
talking about this
asian-american violence which again
important i'm not minimizing it do you
think we're talking about it because we
decided it's our
it's our headline this week maybe
but i think the smarter position is that
china made that our headline
i think they have that ability right and
there are smart people who tell me that
this is uh this is certain that they do
have that ability and they are using it
that doesn't make it true i'm just
saying that smart people have told me
that
um how about our you know our taxes
being so high
do you think we'd have as big a military
budget if not for
china and china being adventurous
if china were not militarily let's say
flexing would our military budget need
to be as big as it is
let's say russia was our only risk we
were worrying about and
terrorism i guess i would say that china
costs us a lot of money
in military preparation what about north
korea of course
china's could fix that doesn't want to
for some reason
so it's kind of amazing how many of our
total problems in this country
are directly or indirectly from china
but we don't talk about it that way
we just don't talk about it and we're
even worried about right
biden having some you know a little too
too cozy with china
so china is basically all of our
problems
you know because we don't have any
problems that wouldn't be better
if we had you know freed up more money
from our budget if we weren't dying of
fentanyl if we weren't a pandemic
almost all of our other problems would
be less of a problem if we could
concentrate on them
instead of trying to continually fix
problems from china
so here's a question for you see if you
can figure this out does china have
any control over the teachers unions i
mean i don't know of any
but if they wanted to destroy america
they would probably make sure that the
teachers unions were good and strong
because that's the best way to do it
that's the current situation so if
anybody has any information that any
teachers unions are influenced by
china let me know that because it seems
like an obvious play
if i were them that's what i'd do um
rasmussen reports that uh 62 percent of
the
i think likely voters is usually who
they
talk to but 62 percent of who they
interviewed were in favor of more market
competition
to lower health care costs
and of course it breaks down the way
you'd imagine 78
of the republicans want market more
market competition and 45 percent
of democrats so here's the question i
ask
remember i told you that no matter what
the question
about 25 percent of the public will just
do whatever is the stupidest thing
we have a solid 25 percent stupidity
problem is
in this country although i'm not sure
it's the same people on every poll
but it's just always about 25 percent in
this case you know 22 percent
of republicans are not in favor of more
market competition what
how in the world how in the world are 22
percent
of republicans opposed
to market competition that would improve
health care and lower costs
really how in the world do you find
those people
show me the republican who's not in
favor of greater market competition to
lower
their expenses i i don't even feel
that's like a political issue
that's sort of just a stupid problem
isn't it but then you go to the
democrats and apparently
um you know there are as many or
slightly more democrats who are in favor
of more competition too
so if you've got you know the vast
majority of the gop
and about half of the democrats are in
favor of greater market competition to
lower health care costs
trump really blew this didn't he
because market competition was sort of
trump's you know approach he could have
sold the hell out of this
and i always thought he should have sort
of packaged up
all of the individual policies he was
doing
things about let's say
allowing doctors to do telemarketing
across
borders that creates market competition
the stuff he did with uh prescriptions
created market competition etc
and i think i think what trump did was
he really could have packaged this up
and sold it to
half of the democrats and most of the
gop and he didn't do it
i think it cost him the election in some
ways you know people think it was
the pandemic maybe it was but healthcare
was probably number two
so when i tweeted about the amish and
their herd immunity
i i created accidentally the two movie
uh the two movie situation i didn't know
i was going to do this
and i'll read the tweet and then you
tell me how you took
it because it's being interpreted two
different ways
all right here's the tweet given that
the amish and it turns out it was just
one group of amish it wasn't all amish
but that one group of amish are at 90
herd immunity i guess we know that as
recently reported
and they weren't using masks for social
distancing
does that confirm to you that masks and
or social distancing
work now when i wrote it um
of course this is not a you know
randomized controlled test so
you know you can't take it too seriously
but when i wrote it i thought people
would say oh well the masking and social
distancing must make a difference
because the one group we know that
decided not to do it
got 90 infected so doesn't that prove to
you
that masks and social distancing or
maybe just one or the other
was working in the sense that it was
preventing them from getting
infections so quickly and then the
moment they dropped them
the friction went away and they reached
90 of her immunity
now that's how i thought you were going
to interpret it
but it turns out a lot of conservatives
interpreted it the other way
and the other way somebody says it
proves nothing
it doesn't prove it because it's not a
randomized
controlled trial that's been reproduced
right so
that's what i would call proof so yes
you're right it doesn't prove anything
but because you can't do a randomized
control test
in a pandemic because it wouldn't be
ethical
the only natural experiment we have is
the people who have volunteered
to not wear the mass in social
distancing and i don't know if there's
any other group that did that
so it's all we have it just isn't 100
reliable
obviously but conservatives interpreted
it this a different way that it was a
huge success
and that mass and social distancing
don't work
but when they interpreted working what
does it mean to work
they interpreted that differently
meaning that
uh the mass and the social distancing
were actually preventing them
to get to the from getting to this good
point
herd immunity so so the
conservatives looked at the same tweet
and said obviously
those things didn't work because as soon
as they got rid of them
everything was good they went to herd
immunity and now
now at least for them it's not a problem
but
they did have extra deaths we don't know
how many
long haulers they have and if it matters
we
we believe that they're they have less
obesity
so maybe it's not as much of a problem
but it was interesting that the two
movies were uh
were triggered by this this one tweet
but i think that even the conservatives
who answered that and said
it was a good thing that they got to
hurt immunity i'm not i'm not saying it
but people did
i don't know if it's good or bad so i
just don't have an opinion on it yet
um but uh
anyway i thought that was interesting so
um masks causing other illnesses i
haven't heard much about that
heard mentality just looking at your
comments for a while
all right those of you on periscope this
is our last day
tomorrow i will be on youtube
just google real coffee with scott adams
within youtube
or probably you can google it and follow
me there it'll be live
just like it is live on periscope with
comments and all that
you'll like it all right um i would also
i would also like to
thank all my periscope users
you've uh youtube if you don't mind
i'm just gonna talk to the periscope
users for a moment
uh you can listen in um
you may remember the first day i
periscoped it was during the
2016 cycle and i was standing in my
kitchen
and i picked up my phone and thought hey
i wonder how this thing called periscope
works and pushed a few buttons
and held up my phone and the next thing
i know
12 people around the world were watching
me
and i thought well that's cool 12 people
watched me
the next day 20
and 100. now thousands
and the the live stream i think on a
typical live stream
i'll get 50 to 100 000 uh
viewers and i think it's become fairly
influential
you're i think you're aware that a
number of people
in the administration last
administration would watch this live
stream
and i think that we added a lot and i
think that i'd like to think that i was
helpful
during the pandemic at least i tried to
be
so i can't tell you how much i
appreciate you
because you wouldn't believe it it's a
lot
and i hope that you do come over to
youtube but um
you have my everlasting appreciation
youtubers i'm sorry periscopers and
thank you for that
and i bid you goodbye
so it's a new era
here we are periscope is over
youtube is rising i'll probably do a
rumble at some point i'll let you know
about that
somebody's saying that matt gates story
was used to
eviscerate the border story
i don't know maybe will dominion be
naming me in a lawsuit
i don't think they would have any reason
to because i've never blamed dominion
of anything i've made i've made
statements about where
electronic voting has to end up
and eventually it has to end up captured
by a intelligence agency of one country
or another
so it has to go there we just don't know
if it has and i have no reason
i have no specific information to allege
that
is black lives matter a chinese entity
not a chinese entity
but you have to think that china is
boosting that story
all right i've gotta go talk for the
next four hours
on a video i'm sorry for uh audiobook so
i'm going to
sign off now and i will talk to you
later
