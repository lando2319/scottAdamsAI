good morning everybody and merry merry
christmas
not only is it christmas but you've
managed to find your way to the best
thing that's ever happened
yeah yeah yeah i know the birth of you
know jesus and all that that stuff's
good
and today we'll even allow that that
might be a little better but the second
best thing that's ever happened is
happening right now it's called coffee
with scott adams christmas edition and
you're lucky enough to be here
wow good for you
and all you need to make this special
day even more special is a copper mugler
glass
a tanker chelsea steiner can't eat
yogurt let's have a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid today
only we will accept eggnog every other
day of the the year no eggnog no well
new year's eve is fun but today
anything you like
go
oh yeah
well by now all of you saw the
prank played on president biden
he was doing one of these pr events
where he was pretending to call norad
and
talk to some child
about santa claus coming
but
the father of that said child got on the
phone and was thanking the president and
as he was signing off the father said
let's go brandon
and
biden actually said uh let's go brandon
that's right
he uh he didn't know it was a joke
and so he agreed with the the idea let's
go brandon
and that's right
now
i could be mocking our president
could i not
yes i could
jack murphy
anyway
um i could be mocking our present
but can i have a special dispensation
today
for christmas
would anybody mind if i say something
supportive of the president
just for christmas
all right all right i got a few yeses
um here's the thing imagine if you know
you're the leader of the united states
and all the things you're thinking about
and then it's also christmas
how many things are in your head
that you have to think about
when you're the leader of the united
states
and it's christmas like another 10 on
top of it
a lot
how how fascinated and interested do you
think the president of the united states
is
when he's talking to a random citizen
for a pr event
not too interested
probably not too interested compared to
all the things in his head
and so i imagine that it would be easy
for someone to give the reflex answer
without even knowing who he was talking
to
let me ask you this
have you ever had this exchange with
somebody
you'll say you'll say you're going on a
trip
and the other person isn't it's just
somebody you're talking to
and then that other person will say you
say okay scott have a nice trip
and then you look at them and you say
you too
but you know they're not going on a nice
i ever do that
it's it's just sort of automatic right
it's just sort of a reflex to me it
looked like biden was just doing
automatic talking because he was
thinking about other things i'm not sure
that was a sign of
anything
but uh let me defend him for christmas
because it would be easy to imagine
trump doing the same thing
if i'm being honest it would be easy to
imagine trump or anybody doing the same
thing just because his mind was on
something else i don't think it tells us
anything too dark
well here's some good news
the uh you've heard this before but i'd
like to throw this in a year and the
sahara is actually shrinking
because there's enough vegetation
largely because of climate change we
think well not climate change but rather
co2
so the co2 is good fertilizer it turns
out so the
sahara is shrinking now
what is the secondary benefit of the
sahara shrinking
and the tertiary benefit
and the
what comes after tertiary
you talked yourself into a corner scott
i wonder if they can tell that you had
to stop to think this long
nobody noticed that you don't know it
comes after tertiary
say something say anything they don't
have time to look it up
so and quad quadri
what are the other benefits
quaternary quaternary let's go with that
okay
uh yes hurricanes diminished is the
answer i was looking for
so the differential between the
temperature over the sahara
versus the temperature over the ocean is
what gets the hurricanes going in the
atlantic if you were to reduce that
differential
via
co2 causing more vegetation you would
reduce
the intensity of of hurricanes
another benefit is you might be able to
grow food
that's kind of cool maybe feed some
people another benefit is you might take
a place that is largely useless and turn
it into a sanctuary for refugees
will there be refugees from climate
change
some experts say yes lots of refugees
where are they going to go
well wouldn't it be nice to go to some
place that was lightly populated and
very green
maybe
so maybe we'll stick some fusion
reactors
on the ocean there
start tracking in some water maybe seed
it with these robots we were talking
about the seed the deserts
let the animals poop on it next thing
you know boom
we're growing plants and those plants
are grabbing the co2 right out of the
air
so let's see
you would
reduce
the frequency or intensity maybe of
hurricanes
you would feed people because you could
grow food there where you couldn't
before you could handle refugees which
is one of the biggest problems some
people think in the world
and uh
you could you could also capture a lot
of co2 out of the air
in case there's too much
so
that's pretty good news
here's the funniest human story in a
while you're all watching i'm sure jfk
jr
talking about his uh dislike of the
pharma companies and
vaccinations etc
so i guess you could say jfk junior is
the anti-vaxxer of all anti-vaxxers
would that be fair
do you think you could classify him as
an anti-vaxxer or is that too
is that oversimplifying
i i think he's known that way but i
think like everything else it would be
an oversimplification
however here's the funny part
he's married to actress cheryl hines
somehow he bagged one of the most
attractive women in hollywood
i guess
i guess i'm not someone who should be
talking about that there are mysteries
in this world and that's one of them
and apparently they're having a holiday
party and his wife has required all the
attendees to be vaccinated
that's right
jfk jr
the world's most famous
anti-vaxxer uh the most famous
anti-vaxxer
is hosting a party requiring
vaccinations because his wife his wife
said so
and he was asked about it
and he said quite honestly
something we all understand which is
he doesn't make all the decisions
[Laughter]
now i'm not even making a comment here
about vaccinations right this is not
about vaccinations it's just about a
human interest thing
that
no matter no matter what your
professional
brand is if you're married
things could go the other way
anyway
uh here's a little fake news for today
um
in which i will uh once again
defend joe biden because it's christmas
all right just give me today
all right i will go back to criticizing
biden don't worry about it
we got we got the whole year ahead of us
but today uh there was a report in the
uh
washington news today
not a huge publication but it's talking
about reports
which i believe are
anonymous anonymous sources within the
white house and you know how accurate
they are
they're saying that the staff is beyond
demoralizing
uh things are hypocritical and ironic
that a president whose brand is built on
empathy and family
has staff policies that fly in the face
of that brand
and more reports of you know bad
management and chaos
now
how true does that sound
does it sound true
that the white house under biden is all
mismanaged
and a bad place to work
have you ever heard that about any other
white house before
did you ever hear that about trump's
white house did anonymous sources
did anonymous sources tell you things
were not well managed in the white house
and the staff morale is low
how about this is what everybody says
about everything
it's not a story
this would be like
oxygen breaks out in america
oh
no we always had oxygen
i mean it might be a little dirty
but we always had some oxygen
no if you hear an anonymous report that
employees say that management is doing
poorly in a large organization
all you have discovered is the reason
that the dilbert comic strip was so
popular
because everybody thinks where they work
is unorganized and poorly managed
it's about his most universal statement
you could make
so is the biden white house any worse
than every other large organization
how would we know
how would we possibly know
all we know is that people say so but
they say that about everything
so
uh and
let me say that again if trump
had been on the receiving end of this
and he was this exact thing
i said don't believe it it's just the
general thing people say
even if it's true
it isn't credible because it's still the
general thing that people say
all right
here's a uh
oh i just want to put this out to start
some
fights with your family
a lot of you are believers in what
rogue doctor dr mccullough
has been saying about
backstations about the pandemic
but i tweeted today and i would call
your attention to it
i call your attention to it
uh a politifact a fact-checking
organization who talks about some of dr
mccullough's claims and then compares
them to what they believe
is the truth
stop it
stop i'm reading your minds
stop it
stop it
no i don't automatically believe what
politifact says
not automatically
right i mean you sort of have to look at
the two sides and you know do use
something like judgment even though
we're probably not
so
my point is
that you could have a nice fight
with your family just by
looking at the claims that dr mccullough
has made and compare them to the
politifact
fact check
fact check
now
i would note that politifact does show
its sources
so
if you want to check the sources
you can go check
now will those sources be reliable
are any of our sources reliable
in 2021 any of them is there any data
that you actually trust anymore
some some data might be accurate but we
don't know which ones it is
you know you can't you can no longer say
well it's official data it's probably
pretty good
we don't live in that world
not at all
all right so uh
i don't have an opinion on who is right
or who is wrong but uh you can check you
can check the sources
at least you can check the government
sources
whether those are accurate or not
all right i have a
persuasion kind of a
i don't know if this is an insight
or is it obvious
you tell me
is the next thing i'm going to tell you
insightful
where you go oh
i never thought of it that way or
the opposite this is so obvious
that i'm the last person who thought of
it
it goes like this
people are more comfortable
avoiding active decisions
than they are
avoiding passive decisions here's what i
mean
and again i'm not i'm not going to get
into
pro or anti-vaccination so i'm talking
about the the mental process here
if you decide to get vaccinated that's
an active decision
just the way i'm defining it right so
for our decisions if your body moves and
you go do something that's an active
decision a passive decision would be a
decision to not do something
i think i will not get vaccinated
all right so if you can accept my
definitions just for this conversation
that getting vaccinated is an active
decision and not doing it is a sort of
an inactive passive decision
okay
how would you feel
forget about whether this is even
vaccinations this could be any topic how
would you feel if you made an active
decision
and it turned out to be wrong
how would you feel
pretty pretty bad right
you made an active decision you went and
did something and then that turned out
to be a big mistake
you would feel terrible
now compare that to how bad you would
feel if you made a passive decision
you simply didn't do anything
but you had bad luck and the and that
turned out to be the wrong decision so
it turns out that not doing anything
that turned out to be the wrong decision
which of these two conditions would you
consider again forget about whether it's
vaccinations or anything else it doesn't
matter what the topic is i'm talking
about a general
persuasion bias kind of a situation
which one would you see
yeah somebody says see that a lot in
trading in in the investment world
which would you feel more comfortable
with being wrong
under the assumption that you could be
wrong
which one would be the one you feel more
comfortable
being wrong
go
uh i'm seeing passive passive passive
passive
lousy either way yeah it's bad either
way somebody says active a few actives
passive passive passive
indifferent passive yeah now i may have
primed you too hard on this so i think i
i was leading the witness a little bit
too much on this i i may have biased you
towards saying passive because i you
know
i framed it in a way that made that
easier to do
so uh if you'll forgive me for being uh
accidentally too persuasive on this i'm
not sure it would be quite as
uh
landslide-y looking as it does
but
that's just just a hypothesis i'm
working on
that independent of what the content is
people are less likely to want to make
an active mistake
well it seems like something you could
test i don't know which way it would
test out but i feel like i feel like it
would go that way
all right
reuters is doing a fact check on
something that many of you watching this
believe to be true
all right so here's something that a lot
of people tweeted at me because they
believed it to be true
as soon as i saw it i said to myself ah
that's not true
and didn't really pay much attention to
it now reuters is doing a fact check on
it
wait wait wait i know what you're
thinking hold on hold on
am i going to say that because somebody
fact checked it
that the fact check is the correct one
no
no but i am going to tell you there is a
fact check so if you haven't heard the
other side
that would be useful
all right here it is
there was data from in the uk from the
office of national statistics claiming
that the double vaccinated and triple
vaccinated
are more likely to test positive for
omicron
has been misrepresented
according to reuters new data shows
breakthrough cases among vaccinated
people are more likely to be omicron
than other variants
not that vaccines don't work or that
vaccinated people are at greater risk of
infection
so in other words when people saw that
this
uk bureau of officialness
um said that uh
there were a lot of double-vaxxed and
triple facts people are more likely to
test positive it was in the context of
omicron
in other words they were saying
if if you get a positive test with the
vaccination
it's probably omicron
which would not be the biggest deal
because omicron's the one you want right
if you're going to get infected
pick omicron
so am i saying that reuters got the fact
check right no
nope we don't live in a world where i
can just automatically assume the fact
check is right
but you should be aware
that if you interpreted that data
it was not intended to be interpreted
that way in other words the people who
put the data together
don't think it says what you think it
says
that's all just you should be aware of
that
that the people who presented the data
don't think that's the right
interpretation
all right
how about this
uh
i tweeted yesterday that our levels of
awareness are not yet high enough to
know that we all made irrational
decisions about vaccinations
or not to get vaccinated and then there
were a number of people who corrected me
and i'm going to accept this correction
i know it's a christmas miracle i'm
going to tell you i was wrong about
something
weird huh
here's what i was wrong about
so i said that everybody's decision
about vaccination or not vaccination is
based on fear but you're just afraid of
different things
some people are afraid of the shot some
people are afraid of the government
overreach some people are
afraid of big
pharma um some people are afraid of
covid et cetera
and then other people uh
corrected me
so there were people who made this
decision without fear
and they convinced me that they really
did not have any fear and they said
things like this
i didn't really think about the virus or
the vaccination i just needed to you
know my my works that i needed to get a
vaccination so i just got one
or i wanted to visit some place
it was the only way i could do it so i
just got one
now i will admit that that is not a
fear-based decision
so i'm going to say i was wrong to say
all the decisions were fear-based
some of the decisions actually were
completely thought free
which was a category i hadn't
quite anticipated i really should have
that that was certainly a mistake in my
mental model but there are a lot of
people who convinced me with their
comments that they literally didn't put
anything thought into it at all
and i'm not i'm not this is not even an
insult if it sounds like i'm mocking
them i'm not at all
because compared to the alternatives
it's not less rational
but some people were completely aware
that they didn't use rational thought
i think they're operating at a higher
level
i think the people who went into it
saying well
there's no way to know what's right or
wrong
but i need the shot for work and that's
my immediate problem so i'll just get
this shot for work
rose is saying you adams took the jab
also for practical reasons
that's not quite accurate but it's a
little bit accurate
i got
i got vaccinated partly for
practical reasons but i'm also aware
that
fear
was probably part of the decision right
so
you know i suppose i had a
fear of uh you know losing my wife if i
couldn't travel because i didn't get
vaccinated so i guess that was a fear
in a way
so i would soften my word fear to just
say that there was irrationality
all the way through the decisions in
both sides and everybody including me
because there's there wasn't really an
opportunity for a rational decision now
there's some people who said scott
what about people who were
already infected
let's say you're 25 years old
you're previously infected you got over
it fine
isn't that a case where
not getting vaccinated is just you know
a no-brainer
to which i say
no
not not even close
because
in that is a bunch of assumptions that
you don't know about
you don't know the long-term risk
of
covet let's say
you know coved
long covet you don't know the risk of
that
compared to let's say if you got
vaccinated
would your long covert be worse or
better
or even exist at all
if you got vaccinated on top of having
natural
immunity nobody knows
it's an unknown
so
every as soon as you think okay well
this special case is really clear there
are none
there i don't think there are any
special cases where it's completely
clear
you're all guessing
you know the most extreme would be
somebody with no
um immunity whatsoever
but even in the case of somebody with no
immunity
do you know for sure
that the vaccination is safer than just
keeping them hidden until this passes
do you know for sure
because i don't
i mean it feels like you know and it
feels like your common sense is giving
you a good enough answer but that's the
illusion the illusion is that we have
common sense there's a reason we do
randomized controlled trials
it's because we don't have common sense
but we're pretty sure we do
that's why you do the randomized control
trials the whole process of science
is to make you stop using your common
sense
because it doesn't work
that's why science is awesome
all right
um in other news i'll just throw this
out there it looks like coven's been
cured
i'll go to the next story
oh wait uh you probably want to hear
more about that
now
let me say that this is another one of
those stories of
covid being cured in a test tube
or a petri dish or something like that
basically in the laboratory
but
please do not go out and try anything
that i'm going to say right now
please
please please please do not try this at
home
i was i was even
considering not even mentioning it
because it
it increases the
you know the the horse dewormer stuff
happening
so
don't do this but there's a report that
if you combined a benadryl which a lot
of people would have in their
medicine cabinet already
used for allergy symptoms benadryl
if you combine it with this
lactoferrin a protein found in cow and
human milk
you can reduce the viruses replicate
replication by 99 in lab tests in human
lungs and monkey cells
so if any of you have
any monkey cells
this could be the answer to that
i worry about my monkey cells
as well as my human lungs
but here's the warning the lactoferrin
that they used although it is
commercially available
for other conditions to treat other
things it's not exactly the same stuff
they used in the experiment
so if you think you can just buy some of
this stuff and mix it together you can't
it's not available
doesn't sound like it'd be a big problem
to make it available
and one wonders what would happen if you
did try the over-the-counter with the
benadryl which would be the worst thing
i could ever suggest because
i'm not a doctor
and the last thing you want to do is mix
some chemicals together and put them in
your body because you heard it in a
cartoonist podcast don't do that don't
do that however all that said and the
fact that 95 of these things that work
in the laboratory never work in a human
being
but besides that i choose to be
optimistic
i choose optimism
all right
politico uh is trying to dunk on me
today and putting me on the list of
their worst predictions for 2021
so
i'm getting mocked on social media
for the worst predictions of 2021
and so
that must be true right
because i'm getting fact-checked by
politico
so if politico fact checks me well the
fact jack must be true
right
no
no
no the fact checks are all fake too not
all of them but there are a lot of fake
fact checks let's see how politico did
with their fact checking
so there were two claims i made
that they treated as predictions i'm not
sure they should have but they did
one was that
if biden got elected republicans would
be hunted
and they fact checked that by saying
that republicans indeed have not been
hunted
now
i'd like to give a little lesson on how
to read
to the politico people who approved this
and wrote this article
here's how reading works
sometimes the words in a sentence
are not always meant to be
literal so if you thought that the word
haunted
meant that there would be hunting
licenses for example for republicans
that maybe would be a bad interpretation
if you thought that hunted meant
for example uh that
people would actually get hunting rifles
and go searching around and finding a
republican so that they can you know
kill them if that's how you interpreted
it
and that it would be widespread and you
know it would be the the basic nature of
the
the country
you might not be a good reader
here would be a more reasonable way to
interpret it
haunted
being more of a figurative term
so for example
what might come under that category of
haunted
would be can somebody tell me how many
uh
trump supporters have been
deplatformed since trump was in office
how many of his main supporters have
been been de-platformed
and is it the same number on the left
for doing similarly
you know bad behavior
or does it seem like it was targeted
more at the right
more are republicans
does it seem to you
that people were looking for republicans
somebody say hunted hunting for them
looking for them online to see what bad
behavior they did so that they could be
cancelled
um how many
trump supporters are being held without
bail right now because of the
january 6 protests
are there a lot of
democrats being held for political
reasons as political prisoners because
that's what it looks like it looks like
the january 6 protesters are being held
as political prisoners because it's
taken so long and there's no bail
which seems weird because i don't think
most of these people had ever committed
any kind of crime
so i would say that the
country treating them as
insurrectionists
and then keeping them in jail for
political reasons is very much haunted
that word doesn't work for you hunted
that
feels like that's exactly
the right kind of figurative speech that
a good reader would recognize as
accurate enough
how many
trump supporters were the subject of an
fbi action
say roger stone
was that happening a lot to democrats
during the same time or did it seem like
it was targeted at republicans
it felt like it was targeted at
republicans
how many uh democrats were accused of a
heinous crime
for which there's so much video of the
actual events every single person could
see no crime occurred
well i can think of kyle rittenhouse
who is believed to be republican and at
this point he probably is i don't know
if he used to be i'm sure he is now
i shouldn't say that because that would
be reading his mind but
i don't i can't think of any democrat
who was on
multiple videos committing no crime
whatsoever who still had to go through a
full trial
right
yeah kavanaugh he was kind of hunted
that was before though
um
so i don't know i would say that haunted
came came true how many would agree with
me that my prediction that republicans
would be hunted under biden
is accurate
a lot a lot of you think i was accurate
all right let's do another one
they um i also said that there was a
good chance
that uh if biden got elected there was a
good chance that you'd be dead by next
year
and politico fact-checked me and said
not true
not true
false
uh what is the definition of good chance
anybody
don't google it just talk top of your
head what's what's the definition
of a good chance what's a good chance
i'm seeing people saying less than 100
percent less than 50 percent over 10
percent
10 or higher
uh do you know who's right some people
saying over 90 some people saying over
10
and the answer is both right
they are both the definition
if you look if you google it
you look up what is the definition of a
good
chance the definitions include these are
synonyms
a possibility
a possibility
also a probability
so two of the definitions are
kind of almost close to opposites so if
you say there's a good chance of
something happening it means that it's
possible
like there's a goodly enough chance that
it's worth talking about possible
but also could mean probable like 90
percent so
which of these is the more
likely interpretation
so i'm a public figure
who mostly is not too crazy
does politico think that my actual
prediction
is that you would probably be dead in
2021
because that's how they interpreted it
they interpreted it as probably
no i didn't think you'd probably be dead
i said there's a good chance
was i accurate
if there's not a good chance that you
could be dead in 2021
why didn't we have to wear masks and get
vaccinated
the entire theme of 2021 is there's a
good chance that you could die
right either a good chance from the
vaccine or the or from the the corona i
mean i think the vaccine the vaccine's
safer than the corona some of you don't
but you'd all agree with the concept
that we we led the entire year
based on the primary assumption
that there was a good chance you'd die
if there was not a good chance you'd die
we wouldn't have to do any of that stuff
right
we're not taking extraordinary measures
for things that don't have a good chance
of happening
so
so politico took
my word hunted and turned it into a
literal which was stupid
okay can we be honest that was just
stupid
but they also took my
good chance
which has you know wide variety of
interpretations one of them quite
reasonable there's more chance that you
would be dead
and how did i do
turns out that the average life
expectancy fell
i'm pretty sure it fell in 2021 it fell
in 2020
but
i'm pretty sure that my
my prediction was not only accurate but
pretty darn accurate
if you if you know how to read
so if you believe that hunted was
literal instead of figurative
and if you believe that
a good chance you'll be dead means
probably which would be ridiculous
but if you if you interpret them as
actual words the way people can read
pretty good
pretty good
that's what i say
how many agree that i got both of those
right
i just like to
have people say i'm right
all right
uh and and
let me ask you this
do you think that they chose me randomly
to be one of their uh
top debunked predictors
do you think that i was just just one of
the people
no
it's because i'm known to support trump
they would assume
incorrectly that i'm a republican
and they hunted me
they hunted me
they hunted me in the article debunking
that republicans would get hunted
now i'm not a republican so that's you
know slightly technically not exactly
what happened but basically is what
happened
i was targeted
just like every prominent
republican supporter will be
you know like it's happening on the left
as well but
it's definitely happening it's not only
happening to me it's certainly happening
on both sides but uh you know the odds
that republicans would be hunted under
biden
it wasn't that hard of a
prediction um
thank you
good predictions
um
politico is paying someone to monitor
your words yeah i don't know
i i doubt that's true per se but
i'm definitely on on lists
you know not
not necessarily a
actual written list but conceptually i'm
on on the list of people that would get
targeted in the next few years
wait don't you hear the stuff that comes
out about me like i don't even know what
it would be i'm not talking about true
stuff
but just wait till you hear
the stuff you're going to hear about me
between now and 2024 elections
it's going to be mind-blowing
none of it will be true why well who
knows maybe some of it will be true
uh
jack says what is your biggest fear for
america right now
you know i don't have one
i honestly think we're in great great
shape
and i know that's not popular at the
moment
but
you know we will get past the pandemic
and we're going to come out of it way
stronger
i mean my er
honestly one of my biggest
problems or
if i had to say there's one thing i'm
worried about
it would be that the economy overheated
i'd be worried about the economy going
too hot
at this point because if if the pandemic
didn't slow down the economy
i mean it barely did it was it was like
a blip
we took like 20 of our workforce and
idled them for months
and we just screamed ahead like like
nothing was happening
so
i see good news everywhere
just everywhere
inflation's a worry but i think we can
manage that inflation's basically a tax
on rich people and if you had to tax
somebody well you might as well tax
people who can afford it it's a tax on
everybody but in the long run
in the long run rich people pay most of
the taxes
but of course poor people will suffer
more from inflation
what about four plus faxes a year well
i'm not going to get four vaccinations a
year
is anybody here going to do that
um i think that the especially since the
therapeutics have been improved now by
the way did you notice that we got
covered pills
at the same time we got restrictions
that would make them almost worthless
am i the only one who noticed that
hey we've got these great pills these
could really help you if you take them
early
also we're going to create a series of
regulations
and procedures that make it almost
impossible to get them early
you know both of those things happened
yesterday right here's your pills here's
why they won't work because we'll have
some regulations where you can't take
them early
do you know what we would do if we were
serious about this
we'd say you think you have symptoms
here take these pills
no obviously we don't have enough of
them to do that
but if we were even a little bit serious
we'd say that's probably covered take a
pill
and we'll test you
and if the test shows that you don't
have it
immediately stop taking the pill
right
if we were even a little bit serious it
doesn't look like we're trying
honestly it doesn't look like that's
even a serious try and now that's an
example
um
that was what florida does just well i'm
talking about
uh jack i'm not i think you're talking
about regeneron and stuff like that and
i think you're right about that
and other therapeutics but we don't but
there's specific regulations about these
new covent pills from pfizer and merck
and it looks like they're going to
require a positive test before you get
them
imagine that you have to take it within
five days for it to be effective they
say
but your test
could take five days
and that's just for the result that's
not counting how many days it takes to
get a test so we've been told that you
can't possibly get a test within five
days in a lot of places right now
but
if you did
you could get the pill
so the solution to the pandemic is here
but you can't have it
i got questions
right know you all
all right um
yeah i think there's got to be
corruption in here somewhere i don't
think any of this is a coincidence
now it could be just a shortage model i
don't know how long it takes to make
these pills
uh my god scott you can get an at-home
test in 15 minutes correct and the wrong
topic
so my understanding is that the home
tests would not count
toward getting your approval for the uh
these new pills i think you have to have
the
you know the serious test not the rapid
test
now
do you do i think that that makes sense
nope
i think that if your own personal rapid
test which is not as accurate
if that thing says you've got covet yeah
you should be taking that damn covent
pill right away
here's what probably will happen
i think doctors will just do whatever
makes sense
i don't know if
if dr jews sees this maybe maybe you can
confirm this but my understanding is
since you can do off-label
stuff there's no doctor who would be
dumb enough
not to give you the pill
if it looked like it was indicated you
know all things considered right so the
doctor is going to be looking at the big
big big picture not just
pill or no pill so if your doctor says
big big picture
let's say you've got some comorbidities
and you know you're coughing pretty hard
your oxygen is a little bit low do you
think that doctor's going to wait for
you to get
a positive test
does anybody think that do you think any
doctor
seeing that you're obviously
suffering from coved i mean obviously me
meaning you know ninety percent likely
you think any doctor is going to make
you wait five days
you should quit your doctor right away
if that happens
assuming the pills are available i think
availability will end up driving a lot
of this stuff
oh let me give you uh
a thought experiment for
the the vacation day here
anybody want a good thought experiment
it goes like this
suppose you
reimagine government
as nothing but the nation's insurance
company
that's the whole idea
reimagine government as an insurance
company so there would be no private
insurance except for extra
right everybody would have a basic
insurance but if you wanted some extra
stuff like you wanted to buy a
luxury vehicle
you could buy some extra
insurance on your luxury vehicle
here's why
your insurance companies have to reduce
the risk of payout
and so the insurance company would the
first thing they do is say whoa we
better get a military so nobody attacks
us
so the insurance companies say okay
costs benefit we need a military
then
they would just go down the list and say
okay cost benefit we'll charge for this
don't charge for that you can do
anything you want it's a free country
but if it costs you know if you're doing
something we can measure
and it's bad for your health or other
people's health
we'll charge you more
so basically through insurance rates
alone
all policy would be determined
and your first your first impression
would be that can't work for everything
and that's what the thorn experiment is
try to find something it wouldn't work
for
it it works for way more things than you
think you should work for
um
what is the tipping point for feb 1 to
be a reality
well i think the tipping point will be
the direction of deaths
i think on february 1
if pretty much everywhere the death rate
is decreasing
down and it looks like
omicron
is is really as mild as we hope
if we can confirm omicron is mild
and that it has swept the country and
it's sort of the the main thing people
are getting
i think we're done
if the uh if the death surge
from the holiday
is not uh surprisingly high
i think we're done
i think we're done
now the question is how do you get
everybody to be done at the same time
i i hope that's sarcasm scott finally
woke up i can't tell you have to be
careful because remember i blocked
people for saying that and if you're
being sarcastic i can't really tell
because sarcasm and reality look the
same now
um
yes the omicron is more infectious but
probably less lethal
and
it is it is possible that we still get
overwhelmed just because of the sheer
numbers but i'll tell you that's a
problem i'd want
right
like if it's the fastest way to get to
herd immunity
then
um putting
and i know that healthcare professionals
are already crushed
but so it'd be bad for them
to give them that workload definitely
bad for the healthcare professionals but
it could be a neck benefit for the
country if it doesn't crush our health
care
to just get it over with quickly
do you ban people for saying you're
still not woken up
i ban them for bad grammar
actually i don't but
that was my witty rejoinder
um
pharma has notified the binding
administration
that the next variant is due fab one
yes that is a picture of me all right
um that's all i've got for now
and big old merry christmas to all of
you
and
um
jack says why do you blame the fake news
for covent when they just pair it what
the government says well the answer is
in your question
the fake news just parrots what the
government says
the real news would investigate and give
you both sides and all that
oh let me put this out here as a 2021
objective
now you all know i like systems more
than goals but
there there are special cases and a
special case
is one where the the situation is so
defined that you might as well have a
goal
i've told you that the only way to get
good information about a topic where the
country is divided is to put two experts
uh in the same conversation with one
aggressive host who can ask the right
questions and challenge them and
etcetera
um i've heard people suggest you know a
regular debate format which i hate if
you've watched a regular debate they're
just snore fests you need a host who can
keep it interesting somebody like trump
trump would be a great host for this
sort of thing i think i would as well
and i think that i could at least show a
model of it you know maybe it's the bad
version that somebody could do better
but i like to put this out there i'd
like to host
some expert debates
could be on covet stuff or something
else
but i just want to find something where
the country is quite divided
put the experts in the same place and
not have a timer on them
the only timer would be the host
in other words if somebody gets off
track i'm going to interrupt them
so it would be an interrupt driven
process because what happens if the host
doesn't interrupt somebody
you get nonsense
because people will just filibuster
they'll just talk as long as they can
so you have to have a host who's just
going to cut them off nope you didn't
answer the question nope
tell me yes or no first and then give me
the explanation and then they start the
explanation you go nope nope
give me yes or no
first
and then you can give me the explanation
so you have to you have to really get on
top of them and part of the
entertainment
would be watching the host try to
wrangle two people who didn't want to
get wrangled
because if they're trying to persuade
they don't want to get nailed down too
much right
so that would be the tension the tension
would be the host
with both of the of the people
ideally pushing both of them hard so
i've said the only reason i haven't done
it is that there's no technology
solution for doing it live
there must be by now
there must be somebody who has a studio
uh you know some professional entity who
can just zoom us up and put us on screen
and and turn the timer off that's the
important part you can't have an end
time
you cannot have an end time
it just has to go until it's done
according to the host
and you know we just try it
it could be a disaster
right it could be a total disaster
but i think we need to a b
test a few things
somebody says that again dave rubin's
help i don't know if his studio can do
that
i mean he has he has a full studio so he
has the most capability of any
independent that i know of
does anybody know anybody independent
who hasn't well actually
yeah there'd be everybody from uh
yeah
i don't want to name names but
yeah they're probably a number of people
who could do i don't know if
jim or if rogan or tim poole can do that
alex jones
yeah alex jones is what i thought
but you know you you if as soon as you
throw alex jones into the mix in any way
whatsoever
then it becomes about alex jones
who i always liked
he's such a likable guy
does anybody have that same impression
there's there's something about
about him that is just so uh so
relatable
uh
glenn beck
that would be interesting um yeah they
probably have all this studio capability
there don't they
or
yeah anyway so i'll put that out there
if there's somebody who wants to offer
some studio resources the minimum
requirement is
three faces on screen and live
and live can't be recorded
and the reason i want it live is that
there's a different energy to it and
that the people's comments could be
coming in at the same time because i'd
want the host
to have an assistant
doesn't have to be in the room but the
assistant should be monitoring the
questions
to make sure that the audience
might have come up with a good question
or a good counterpoint or a good source
that you want to you want to test
so you'd want the public to be live
that's why you don't want it recorded
and you want to you want to really keep
it
you know dangerous
one of the reasons that people watch
something this is one of my theories as
well
is the the thought that somebody's in
danger
now not physical danger but danger of
embarrassment or losing their career or
something like that
so
live gives you extra danger
which i'm attracted to as as an
entertainment form
all right that's all i got for now and i
will talk to you
tomorrow
and
have a wonderful wonderful christmas
bye for now
