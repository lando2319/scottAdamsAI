hey everybody
come on in come on in here gather round
it's time for coffee with scott adams
best part of your day once again every
single time
i hear there's some kind of event that's
going to happen in the united states
today
something called a super bowl
i don't know who's playing but i hear
it's a thing
so you should watch that later i guess
how would you like to enjoy this live
stream
more than you even thought was possible
i think you would like that
and all you need is a copper mug or a
glass a tanker challenger stein a
canteen jug or flask a vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine of
the day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous hip
and you're going to do it right now
go
ah how does that sound on your 1.5
times playback speed pretty fast huh
yes that's how quickly my mind is
operating
this morning it's just like so fast you
can't even believe it
let's talk about all the news
oh sorry i thought about the news and i
fell asleep
have you noticed what's wrong with the
news
i'll bet you have if you were to look at
the news
there's something missing the
interesting part
you know the part about trump because
without the interesting part
it's just news come on do we even care
well maybe things will get more
interesting uh
for example candace owens has
teased on twitter that uh she might be
thinking about running for president
might be thinking about running for
president
now i don't know what you think about
candice owens
being the president but let me tell you
what i think about her running for
president
oh yeah that would bring the fun
are you kidding me uh as as interesting
as
trump is i don't think anybody will ever
be more interesting than he is
but uh candace owens could bring us some
interesting news
imagine if you will the democrats
arguing against her
oh she's a race well she can't be a
racist
oh those sexes well she's a woman
and she might have that one thing
that president obama had that i always
say is
his best quality uh well i don't want to
say it's his best quality but let's just
say it's something that he did
brilliantly
which is he ran for president without
saying i'm running for president and i'm
black
now he mentioned it i mean it came up
but he didn't run for president as our
first black president
he just happened to be black which is
exactly the way to do it
if you want some support from the other
side candace owens would have the same
sensibility i would imagine that she
would be running for president as
somebody who could be president not as a
woman not as
a black woman but just somebody wants to
be president
and that would take away about
three quarters of all the things the
democrats say about
republicans what the hell would they
have left
for that reason alone i want to see you
run for president
now does she have the skills and the
capabilities probably
probably yes i would say i believe she's
smart enough she's connected enough
i don't agree with everything she's ever
said but that would be true of everybody
i'd love to see her in the race just
because i think it would make it so
interesting um france
has apparently been caught uh not
achieving
the goals of the paris climate accords
that's right france the country
the great organizer of the paris climate
accords
failed to meet their goal
so that's a pretty useful climate accord
right there
whereas the united states who pulled out
of it
exceeded their goal by a lot it's
almost as if the paris climate accords
are not important almost
i mean you could all almost start to
think that way
because it turns out it's not important
but
pretending it is at least allows our
politicians to say they've done
something
what have you done well i got back in
that paris climate accord thing
so you can't say i didn't do anything
because i did that
even though that's basically nothing
are you waiting for reports about all
the chaos
and the biden administration
you know in a transition time when
you've got some gigantic
government entity let's call it the
trump administration
and it's transforming into an entirely
different
big you know loping bureaucracy
called let's call it the biden
administration somewhere between the
trump administration
limping bureaucracy and the biden
administration
limping bureaucracy somewhere in the
middle
there should be a phase which if i were
describing it
i'd probably call it chaos chaos now
that doesn't mean that they're doing
anything wrong
it's just that when you transfer from
one big situation
to any other big situation
there should be a little friction just
normally
wouldn't matter if it's in the private
sector it wouldn't matter if it's in the
public sector
wouldn't matter who it is it wouldn't
matter who was involved who was running
it
under every scenario you could imagine
in the real world
should be some chaos a little bit of
chaos
let's listen for the reporting on all
the chaos
nothing yet seems to me
that we would have some whistleblowers
some anonymous sources inside the biden
administration saying
you know it's not going as smoothly
as it could because
you know that's true right you know
that it's not a perfect handoff
at the very least we should be
complaining about the trump
administration
not doing a good job of handing off
we haven't even heard that can we say at
this point
that the trump administration did a
really good job
of handing off power
we haven't heard a thing right didn't
you hear lots of stories when obama came
in about how the
the handoff was sloppy
nothing about that so either the trump
administration did a great job
in the handoff as well as the biden
administration doing a great job
picking up the the pieces
but you realize what's going on right
what happened was a complete absence of
news
because the old news was fake news and
the moment they re
they they decide that
as far as the biden administration is
they're not going to run fake news
they don't have any news if you don't
run
fake news there's no news
because there isn't that much that
happens every day
you have to generate a certain amount of
fake news to fill up the
you know the minutes so watching this
play out
in real time to see that the news
business
was never legitimate you know that and
this just sort of proves that
it was never legitimate uh it's kind of
fascinating
all right um i tweeted yesterday
that there's a technology that is
underappreciated
you keep hearing about big companies and
even even parts of the government
getting hacked
even the iranian nuclear program
got hacked and you know somebody planted
a bug
stuck in that this was some time ago so
we see all these
examples where even the most
sophisticated technology companies get
hacked
fairly regularly but the exception is
our election system
now our election system also has
hardware and software and
connected systems and stuff but unlike
every other system in the world that
gets hacked
what we've learned from our news is that
the election
software and hardware not only was not
hacked
that's what we've been told but it
couldn't be it couldn't be
because if it were possible then
people would be talking about that
they'd say well we don't know if it was
hacked we don't
know if it was or wasn't but it's
possible
that would be a story but since that
story doesn't exist
and that would be the obvious story that
at least is possible
the news has basically told us in its
own way that it's
not possible so we should take that same
technology that we're using for the
election systems
that make them unhackable including and
this is the hard part
they've somehow figured out how to make
all the people involved
in those systems unbribable
didn't even i didn't even think it was
the thing i didn't know you could make a
system
which in which the people were
unbribable
but apparently with the election system
we've done that according to the news
so we should take whatever we've learned
from the election systems
that makes them unhackable and just move
that
that learning and technology over to the
rest of our computer systems
and then you wouldn't need any any
computer security anymore
because that would pretty much end all
hacking
right wait a minute somebody's saying
uh somebody's saying in the comments
that the election system
is not unhackable that's uh that's like
saying it's hackable
are you saying i don't even understand
the point are you saying that our
election systems
could be hacked that's fake news that is
fake news my friend
because our news which we trust
has told us that that's not even a
possibility
do you know why because of audits
we've done audits we've done hand counts
compared it to the machine count and
wherever they did the audit it was
pretty close
at least close enough so therefore
it's unhackable why don't we take that
same concept
to all of our other systems we'll just
find something that we can audit
and find out if there's anything that's
been hacked because that works right
a few audits a handful of audits for all
those
systems around the country a few audits
i know to get it done
so that's all i'm saying is i don't want
to kick i don't want to be kicked off of
social media so i certainly wouldn't say
that we have had a problem with our
election system
i'm aware of no proof of any kind of
fraud
there is no proof in any court that are
a sick
that our system had widespread fraud
nor is there any evidence that there
could be any kind of hacking
it's impossible all right um
there's an investigator for the world
health organization who
who who who says the guy from who
who says that the wuhan lab
is not necessarily the source of the
coronavirus
so according to world health
organization investigators
we should be open-minded and there is no
evidence
no evidence i say that the wuhan
lab was the source of the coronavirus
according to mike pompeo when he was in
office he said that we do have evidence
that the wuhan lab was the source
so who's telling us the truth mike
pompeo
or the world health organization
who do we trust these days because you
realize that one of them is lying to you
right
either the government of the united
states
told you a lie that would be a really
big lie
it would be it would be similar in an
extent
to saying that saddam hussein
saddam had weapons of mass destruction
when he when he did
at least the ones we thought we were
looking for
that would be a gigantic violation
of trust or if mike pompeo is right
and there is evidence that it came from
that lab
presumably the world health organization
would have access to that same
information
and they would be
in this case the liars if mike pompeo
is correct so one of those two entities
either the recent government of the
united states
or the world health organization
is lying is lying to you
that's a big problem isn't it
that's like a really big problem now i
know that your bias
is to say that it's the world health
organization i can see it in the
comments
because you believe that they are
influenced by china and that china would
like us
not to believe it's the wuhan lab that
is responsible
so that that's all that's happening is
that the world health organization is
lying but that's a big
big problem really really big
problem by the way what does joe biden
say
about the wuhan lab whether that was a
source
because joe biden would have exactly the
same information that mike pompeo had
right they would be briefed on exactly
the same stuff
so has biden even been asked that
question
does anybody remember if biden has been
asked
what is the position of his
administration on whether the wuhan lab
was involved
well wouldn't it be nice if we had a
press
that would ask our president questions
we don't have that we've got a press
that asks the circle back
woman uh what's up and she says i'll
circle back
so good luck with your uh
government transparency there
so the biden administration continues to
escape by without having to answer any
real questions
of course the biden administration one
of its main selling points and the
reason that biden got elected in my
opinion
is that they committed to follow science
whereas they believe that the trump
administration was not
following the science so here we are
with the
biden administration with their science
following ways
with their own cdc saying that
essentially that the science supports
opening the schools
now they don't say that directly what
they say is that
with proper mitigation the schools would
be a very low
source of infection now
is that the same as saying it would be
safe enough
to open up schools if you could do the
mitigation not everybody can do it right
away
i say yes i would say that would be
science as described by the cdc
saying that the risk of reopening
schools is very very low
in terms of extra infections there would
be extra infections
but it would be low and that they know
how to mitigate
so the but the teachers unions
the various teachers unions around the
country
are strongly against reopening under any
condition
given the risk and they seem to be
winning so far
so could you say that the biden
administration is following
science in this case i would say no
i would say that the science would
strongly suggest
i mean science doesn't have an opinion
but it strongly suggests
that it would be safe to open up schools
or safe enough given
you know you always have to take a
little risk for everything
um i forgot the air quotes around
science
somebody said yes follow the science
just like the paris accord they're
following the science
so what will biden do well wouldn't it
be good
i'm just going to put this out there
wouldn't it be great
if biden our president would answer
questions from say reporters i'm just
going to throw that out there as a
possible
process to follow wouldn't it be great
if pres if president biden could answer
the question
are you being compatible with science by
following what the teachers unions
tell you to do now of course you can say
it's this
it's a state thing it's not a federal
government thing
but at some point the federal government
needs to take this as a homeland
security issue if we continue to keep
our
schools closed we will be degrading
the country to the point where it
affects our
our actual security certainly it will
affect the economy etc
and the mental health physical health of
our kids etc
so where's our leadership
is joe biden siding with the teachers
unions if so
say it in public we'd like to see you
answer that question
in public you're our president right
if if joe biden says
no we have to figure out how to override
or
convince those the teachers unions to
change their mind
well where is he where is he where is he
doing that
what is it that's more important to you
as a citizen of this country than
reopening schools
because if you've got kids you want the
schools to be reopened
trust me you know mostly you do and
if you want the economy to work well you
want the schools to be reopened
you really do so biden is completely
missing
on the number one issue in the country
now you could argue that you know
uh protecting us from nuclear war and
stuff is the biggest issue
but i would say that those things are
largely stable at the moment
right no immediate threats from overseas
our
biggest question in the country is
getting the kids back to school
and our leader is missing
he's not on a side i mean i'm sure he's
got an opinion that's out there
but joe biden is just missing
is that okay with you i would be okay
with him being
on the other side of this than than my
preference
if he were doing it in public if he
could take a question
if he would look the public in the eye
and say this is my decision
i would deal with that because maybe
he's got a good argument i'd like to
hear it
all right but he's missing in
action
with the biggest question in the
country
he is not even doing the
job let kamala harris do the job you
 idiot
get out of the way you doddering fool
or do your job which would be fine
because i do think he's up to it
you know i've i've certainly been
critical of biden's capability
but he's certainly capable of saying we
should oh
god damn it all right we just lost the
feed from periscope
due to my technical incompetence
but youtube you're still here with me so
thank you
let me maybe i should tweet that they'll
figure it out
so uh periscope is down but you can
watch the rest of this on youtube
so joe biden um you are not
doing the job right i could
i could easily be okay with joe biden
disagreeing with my political opinion
but doing the work
he's not doing the job you got
to
show up to work right
we're paying you show up to work
answer a question
all right or or just get out of there
and put kamala
in and maybe she'll answer a question at
this point
joe biden either has to do the
job or get off the stage
because he's not doing either one and he
needs to do one of those things
do the job or get off the stage
and we'll just deal with kamala
um so there's that
apparently the negotiations over how to
handle the second
trump impeachment trial has a lot to do
with how long it will take
so some of the negotiations are involved
um will it be two weeks or three weeks
etc
and the reason that that matters is that
congress has admitted
that they won't be able to do some of
the other things they need to do
while the trials on so they want to
they want to confirm biden's cabinet but
they won't be able to do that while
they're doing this trial
they've got a bunch of nominees they'd
like to
get the stimulus plan passed 1.9
trillion
but they won't be able to do that
because they're
uh they're they're around with
this fake impeachment trial
now just just hold this in your minds
for a second
congress has admitted that they won't be
able to do their work
vital work what is more important than
the stimulus package right
what is more important than figuring out
how to get kids back to school
they're not going to do that instead
they're going to do the one thing that
every person in the world knows has no
value
which is to impeach try to impeach the
president and fail
everyone knows everyone knows that
nothing will come of that
and yet they're admitting that they're
not going to do the work for which they
were hired
get us a stimulus bill confirm your
cabinet
they're actually telling us straight up
they're not going to do that work
you you
let me give you two choices either make
an argument for why this impeachment
makes sense
which you haven't haven't even tried
haven't even tried to make an
argument about why this is good for the
country
we get why it's good for democrats you
 we get that
tell us why it's good for the rest of us
why is it good for me
that you're not going to do the
work of the country
why does that help me right
and and who is asking the questions is
the press
putting biden's feet to the fire and
putting congress's feet to the fire and
saying
hey we've got a country to run and
instead you've chosen the only thing
that every person in the country
knows is useless
every person knows it's useless
you're gonna do it anyway right in front
of us right in front of our
eyes you're gonna not do the work of the
country
that we all think is important and
you're going to do something that
every person knows is a waste of
 time and you're gonna do that
right in front of our eyes
and we're gonna act like we're okay with
it
let me tell you one thing that i
appreciated about the uh
capital assault i disavow the capital
assault and those
involved have to deal with the legal
consequences
that said i do appreciate living in a
country
where the where our government feels
the people i don't think they feel the
people right now
i feel like the people are being ignored
grossly ignored right in front of us not
even the
not even a little bit of respect for the
 public not an ounce of respect
for the public
nothing if they had any respect for us
whatsoever they would do their job
instead of this
all right um on the pla
on the positive side
uh as you knew would happen the
reporting about
covid has turned friendly
what was there was there any uh any
chance that wasn't going to happen
so instead of endless stories about how
the
the biden administration is blowing the
roll out of the vaccinations
and by the way i don't know if that's
true i just know there aren't enough
vaccinations to go around
but if this were the trump
administration it would be endless
stories about how the
uh the rollout was not going well but
instead the stories are that the rollout
is going
better than he promised which actually
is true
so apparently we're doing better than a
million um
a million inoculations per day
um and that was biden's promise was a
million a day for
i don't know 100 days or something and
we're at 1.2 million
so credit where credit is due
biden uh in this in this regard biden
under promised and he's over delivering
have you ever
have you ever heard me say that about
trump yeah i've said that a number of
times about trump that he under-promised
and over-delivered
in terms of jobs and stuff and i think
this is a case where biden's doing it
too he under-promised and he's
over-delivering
his administration is it's worth noting
if we're being fair now we're nowhere
near
as fast as we need to be but it is
better than they promised
and apparently while the number of
infections
is dropping to a seven day rolling
average is lower
and number of hospitalizations is
dropping deaths are still high
but we're pretty sure that will follow
hospitalizations and come down
and we're looking at pretty big numbers
drops a
30 percent drop in the rolling
average of infections a 30
drop that's like that's a big deal
and how about uh hospitalizations are
down 20
over the past few weeks 20 is a big drop
it's a big drop now do you think that
these drops are based on
um the vaccinations
because i don't know that there are
enough vaccinations
to see a 20 drop in hospitalizations
that doesn't feel does it i don't know
that we know yet right
so i can't say this with any authority
but it feels like
the drop is unrelated or maybe the drop
is a little bit because of the
vaccinations but maybe not mostly
now i could be wrong because i'm just
sort of eyeballing it and saying oh how
long has it been and how many
vaccinations
but in my mind anyway i can't
see that we vaccinated enough already
to get a 20 decline in hospitalizations
but maybe maybe that is true
but i can only speak for where i am
but it's unseasonably warm in california
so if california is part of those
numbers and we're unseasonably warm i
mean yesterday was shorts weather
in february i think it was almost 70
degrees here in february
and that's northern california so
i think maybe weather might have
something to do with it
maybe but we'll see it's good news
anyway
and now that biden's president i guess
we'll only hear good news about stuff
so even if it's not good news uh over in
tehran
tehran a word i can never pronounce
correctly
so iran's supreme leader has said
predictably
that they would be happy to go back to
the old nuclear deal
as long as biden first drops the
drops the what do you call it the
sanctions
do you think that biden will lift all
the sanctions
in an effort to get iran to come back to
the table not to the table but to agree
to their
their part of what they're doing and i
would say
it's going to be tough isn't it what in
the world will biden do
how is he going to play this because
if he just gives iran what they want
he's going to look weak
if he doesn't give them what they want
then he's just doing
trump's you know trump's own policy
so what's he gonna do i don't know
i feel as though uh if
if biden um did decide to say hey we'll
lift the sanctions and
we'll give iran a month to you know do
what it needs to do to get back in
compliance
and then we can always put the sanctions
back on if we need to
he might do that but it would look
pretty weak
and i think it would embolden iran
so i think this is the thing that i'm
most interested in about the biden
administration
the things that he criticized trump
about is he really going to be able to
fix those things
because trump sort of found the only
thing you could do
and then he did it so if there was only
sort of one thing you could do
and we were already doing it let's say
sanctions on iran
what the hell is he going to do what is
biden going to do
so i'm so curious about that now he's
got a similar problem biden does with
the border
because there are caravans coming and
it looks like it's going to be
inevitable
that our border facilities will be
overwhelmed
what will happen when our border
facilities are overwhelmed
under the biden administration will they
put kids in cages temporarily
because that's what the biden or the
trump administration did
much to its uh discredit
because they didn't have a choice nobody
put a kid in the cage because it was the
worst
choice nobody said well look at all the
things we could have done
i guess the best choice is to put them
in the cage well it was the best choice
given the alternatives which are to
release them to
known child traffickers so
will biden do the thing that's not the
best thing you can do under the
circumstances
will you choose the worst thing you can
do which is release them to the
traffickers what's he going to do
now if he solves these problems iran
and he also if biden solves
immigration i'm going to give him credit
you know i don't want him
not to be able to solve these problems i
just don't know how he could
so curiosity and i will give
let's say even though we're all biased
about you know our political side
and i i'm no different i've got same
amount of bias as anybody else
but i still like america right i would
like america to do well so i would like
biden to
have the best solution for iran the best
solution for the border
and if he does i'll give him credit but
i don't know what his options are
nancy pelosi continues to give
politics a bad name
which is funny in it itself uh
if you can give politics a bad name
you're
you're really you're really bad
and so uh while i typically don't like
to do the
hypocrisy stories because they're too
easy and everybody does them
sometimes they're worth calling out so
first of all nancy pelosi got called out
for
not wearing a mask when she got her hair
done you know being indoors when she got
her hair done or whatever it was
so she got in trouble for getting her
hair done when other people couldn't i
guess
indoors but now she's getting in trouble
for
apparently she went through a side door
that the leadership can use to get into
the
you know the main congressional area
there
and so she didn't go through the metal
detectors
which people are being fined for not
going through them
i guess louis gomer and uh
uh who is it uh lauren
bobbitt what's her name bo bear uh
anyway so a few uh
congressional people didn't go through
the metal detectors
and we'll be fined five thousand dollar
space
for refusing to going through metal
detectors now in the case of gomer
he had been through the metal detector
had left to go to the restroom
came back from the restroom and didn't
want to go through the metal detector
again
now was he going to go get a gun from
the restroom
like the like a mafia movie or something
he tweeted about the same thing he made
that joke
was that really something that gomer
should be
penalized for he went through the metal
detector once
he just used the bathroom he's a sitting
member of congress
did we really need to check him again so
the fact that nancy pelosi also uh
avoided the metal detectors by coming
through a special
door that they have for leadership i
think she has to be fined
i think she has to pay the same fine i
don't see any way around it
you either have to treat them the same
or not and it's pretty easy to treat
them the same
it's not like she can't pay out right
she's pretty rich
but she's got to pay it
all right so there's there's where we
are with our uh
terrible government the biden
administration is going to just
apparently not work on the things that
are the most important to the country
getting kids back to school
for example uh
somebody says i bet she doesn't pay the
fine yeah we'll see
how is nancy rich well her husband is
rich
but uh yeah you might have some
questions about that
yes i understand not everybody is
treated the same in congress
his winery yeah i hear about the plump
jack winery
staying open i don't know if that's true
or not
that sounds like fake news it sounds
like
something that i wouldn't trust
um so i think the gavin newsom
recall petition is getting close to the
uh
the number they have to go beyond the
number for the recall because some of
the
names will be challenged
but it looks like he's going to get
recalled at this point or at least that
they'll be
a recall vote of some kind
you know what i don't mind
of all the things that gavin newsom has
been accused of
the one that i don't care about at all
is that he ate at the french laundry
because here's here's the thing if if a
restaurant
is legally open you can eat at it
that's it if gavin newsom was the only
person
served at the french laundry and they
opened up just for him and his friends
or something
well i'd say that's pretty bad but if
the restaurant was
legally open he can eat there
he can eat there even if he's telling
you that you should usually stay home
if it's open he can eat there that's the
end of it
so um i'm happy to pile on governor
newsom for
everything else he's done that you don't
like but i'm not going to pile on him
for
going to a business that's legally open
that's just not where i'm gonna spend
any of my uh
any my outrage
it's an appearance thing yeah i get it i
get it it's an appearance thing
but you know how it appeared to me the
way it appeared to me is that he went to
a business that was
open that's it and
going to businesses that are open is
really good for those businesses
so i i dinner twice this week
so california is newly at least where i
am is newly reopened
for business for the restaurants so the
restaurants were closed down completely
for
several weeks and now they can do
business outside
here's the good news the the weather was
nice as i said yesterday
i went down to my main street my small
town here in pleasanton california
and it was happened the main street in
my town actually i've never seen more
people there unless it was like an
actual event but just for a for a
saturday night
just for a night that people go out to
eat
there were more people downtown out and
about
and eating than i've seen maybe ever it
was it was actually really
um inspiring made me feel good now the
dining is still outside
so we ate little tents and they've got
their heaters there and stuff
now it's california so we can still do
this even in february
but i gotta say here was the strangest
thing about it
these little outdoor tent situations you
know they often have an
open side so they're not enclosed but
it was pretty good i actually enjoyed
eating on the sidewalk and the little
tent more than i would have probably
enjoyed eating indoors
because when you're indoors you're
packed together and you've got the
acoustic problem
and you know i kind of enjoyed it
it was maybe even an upgrade eating
outdoors
so both meals were excellent and it was
good good to feel normal again
even with the masks and stuff um
so i i'm feeling like progress you know
the a few of those restaurants looks
like they were doing good business so
maybe they'll be back
uh super super bowl parties
yeah you know unfortunately i don't know
any way that
super bowl party parties will be avoided
it's guaranteed that people are gonna
have them now let me ask you this
have any of you attended any kind of a
unmasked or even masked
event with lots of people
how many in the comments how many of you
have attended at least
one event it could be in your own home
in which you add a number of people from
various places so i'm just going to look
through the comments
it looks maybe evenly split
between people who have and people who
have not
yeah i'm amazed a lot of you have spent
time
in crowds during a pandemic you
voluntarily
spend time in crowds okay i'm gonna
i'm gonna say that i haven't done that
now i don't think any of us are doing
perfect social distancing
but i where i draw the line is
uh a crowd i'm just not gonna go
where a bunch of people are packed into
a space for any reason
there's no reason i will put myself in
that situation indoors especially
if it's outdoors if it's outdoors
i'm going to judge differently but
indoors
there's no freaking way i'm going to be
in a crowd indoors
mast or a mess it's just not going to
happen
um now i did happen to
observe a group of people who got
together to
sing happy birthday recently and i did
notice that the social distancing was
completely ignored
but there's nothing wrong with the group
of people i was observing
rather i think that's just human human
nature
that people will spontaneously come
together
without realizing what they've done
until it's too late
so i don't think there's any way you can
keep americans from gathering for the
super bowl
uh but my advice would be if you can
avoid it
you probably should i'm definitely not
going to get together with a crowd
myself
your neighbor had a party of 50 last
night yeah i was watching a
loud party not near my house but uh
yesterday so i feel as though people
have given up on the social
distancing or at least a lot of them
have so we'll see what
that brings us all right that's all for
now and i will talk to you
tomorrow
