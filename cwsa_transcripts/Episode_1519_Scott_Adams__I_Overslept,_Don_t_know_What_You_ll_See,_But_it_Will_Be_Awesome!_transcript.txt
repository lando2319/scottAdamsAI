well
good morning everybody
and welcome
to coffee with scott adams the overslept
version
do you ever have one of those days where
you wake up and for some reason it's an
hour later than it's supposed to be
and it has nothing to do with what your
brain decided
your body just decided while you're
sleeping you know what
i'm not gonna i'm not gonna let you up
i'm just not gonna let you wake up
so after uh
i don't know something like
i think at least a week
maybe more than a week where i haven't
gotten more than three to four hours a
night
now i normally don't sleep a lot
five is usually good you know if i get
if i get five or six i'm i'm over
sleeping
but around four
or three i started getting a little
crazy
and
i was getting a little bit crazy
because i had to do the cat feedings
every six hours and everything
but
uh this morning this morning my brain
and my body decided you know
your alarm's gonna go off
and you're just not gonna get up today
i'm just not gonna let you so my body
and my brain just didn't let me get up
so i'm a little less prepared than
normal but is it going to matter
no
no
because already you're feeling better
aren't you
right
as soon as i was a little bit late did
you say to yourself oh no
oh no he's a little bit late
what's going on
but don't worry i'm here
and that means that you are about to
experience the unparalleled pleasure and
all you need is a cover burger a glass
of tiger chalice or stein a canteen
jugger flask a vessel of any kind now
when i say stein
does not include marc stein now you have
to have a vessel that you can put liquid
in that you can drink out of
if you try to put liquid into mark stein
well you get it in
but good luck getting it out in a form
you want to drink if you know what i
mean so don't do that get the get the
handheld kind of a stein
and then fill it with your favorite
liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
and you know it does you know it does
you know it it's called the simultaneous
sip and it's going to happen now
go
ah
i can feel the coffee the coffee now
flowing into all of my
court bustles
yeah every one of my court bustles
and i got a lot of court bustles
well the most fun story today is that uh
william shatner will be on the jeff
bezos blue origin spaceship
to visit a space
is that the coolest story ever
that william shatner famous of course
from star trek
he's 90 years old
and he's going to space
he's actually going to space william
shatner everything about that story i
like
but
can i take a point of personal privilege
for a moment
can i talk about something that has
nothing to do with you
[Laughter]
it's just about me
if if you're in my age range you know
give or take a lot of different years
william shatner is one of your main
i don't know main icons from your
childhood
one of the the most important people
that i've ever
you know
cared about in terms of a celebrity
and one day on twitter somebody tweeted
something at him and he
he
referred to me as
dilbert's dad
and i said to myself
what
william shatner knows who i am
i don't know if i've had a cooler
professional moment
than seeing on twitter a reference to
the fact that william shatner
somehow knew who i was
i've never been so happy in my life
you know and
you've you've observed enough to know
that i have an interesting life so it's
not like i haven't met lots of famous
people but for some reason
the fact that william shatner
knew my name
or knew what i did for a living anyway
it just was mind-blowing to me so that's
that's just about me i'm sorry that
wasn't about any of you let's get back
to you
enough about me
let's talk about you some more
so i didn't see this on 60 minutes but
apparently there's a facebook
whistleblower
who's saying some pretty damning stuff
pretty damning stuff
um apparently
let's say apparently on january 6 ish
facebook made a conscious decision to
turn off
the filters on fake news
what
they turned it off
so apparently or at least the accusation
is that january 6
might not have happened
or at least maybe was accelerated or
worsened in some way
by the fact that facebook
stopped
stopped monitoring
what it was
presenting
now
shouldn't it have been off all the time
yeah
why was it ever on
if it was okay to turn it off
why was it ever on
right
what's the difference between
after the election and before the
election
who won
that's the difference
the difference is who won
isn't this telling us that facebook
rigged the election
by changing the algorithm to one thing
before you voted and then immediately
changing it to whatever made them the
most money after
did they and it looks like the
whistleblower is suggesting this
did they
give up some large amount of revenue
intentionally
to change the result of the election
it looks like that's exactly what they
did
it looks now they may have you know
conceived it differently the way that
they you know thought about it
themselves they might have just said hey
it's an election we better get rid of
the fake news i mean maybe if you give
them the most generous interpretation
it's that the election was important
they didn't want it to be you know all
fake news elections so they tried to get
rid of the fake news so you'd have a
better
your reason to vote
you know accurately
but why why does that thinking change
after the vote
well why did why did fake news become
good for us the moment the moment the
election was over
shouldn't shouldn't fake news either
always be bad
or even if it's bad we just always get
to see it anyway because of freedom of
whatever
this is pretty damning
this is pretty damning i you know
you've seen the project veritas stuff
and that can be pretty damning but
this does look worse
you know if if these whistleblower
complaints pan out i don't know if we
could ever prove them
but it's pretty bad
so and her allegation is that the
facebook executives explicitly
decided to make more clicks
by selling you fake news that would get
you all worked up
intentionally like an actual
conversation
and then they decided to make more money
instead of making you happy and having a
good life
it's almost too
it's almost hard to believe
and what she said was specifically her
name is hoggin i guess
h-a-u-g-e-n
she said the version of facebook that
exists today
is tearing our societies apart and
causing ethnic violence around the world
that's pretty bad
now let me ask you this
why do we
regulate
medicine and drugs
why does the government regulate
medicine and drugs
it's to prevent harm right and that's
the only reason
they do it to prevent harm
why don't they regulate social media
algorithms
does the social media algorithm have the
potential
to create harm specifically death and
revolutions and
january 6 protests and everything else
can they do that with an algorithm
can an algorithm change an election
can an algorithm change your mind can it
cause a fight can it cause ethnic
cleansing can it do all those things an
algorithm
yeah i can
yeah
is there anybody here who thinks it
can't
if you think you can't you haven't been
paying attention
brainwashing
is really sophisticated now i mean it
used to be
i mean it always existed there were
always people trying to fool you one way
or another or con you one way or another
but they weren't good at it
you need the the technical
you know power of you know zillions of
messages and being able to test it in
real time and all that to get to a
really
you know commercial grade ai that really
affects your brain
at least affects it in a
specific way
so
i feel like we have to have the
conversation about regulating um
algorithms
right just for consistency if we
regulate drugs
usually because the drugs affect your
brain or body right
but if if there was a if there were a
drug
that made you vote differently
would it be legal
suppose a pharmaceutical
developed a drug
that could turn a republican into a
democrat
number one
is it technically possible
yeah there's a question for you
scientifically speaking
would it be technically possible
to develop a pill
that would turn a republican into a
democrat
yes
undoubtedly yes
no doubt about it
yeah now i i'm not saying it would work
on every person right the same way an
algorithm doesn't influence every person
the same way same way every drug doesn't
influence people the same way some
people just don't respond to some drugs
but
yeah
you could
you could do some damage
so
i think we have to look at the question
of regulating um algorithms because they
do reprogram our brains
and if if the if the exact thing that an
algorithm can do
which is maybe change your vote
if you had a pill that did that and you
could
pretty sure you could
wouldn't be legal
it wouldn't be legal
if that's all it did now let me go
further and really get uh
really good provocative
don't you think that uh let's say if
let's say democrats you know sweep
everything and they they own the
congress and the presidency and they
even take over the supreme court in
terms of the majority someday
could they ever tell you
that being a republican
is a medical problem
is that possible
is it possible that there would ever be
a a administration
that would treat republicanism as a
mental disorder that could be treated
with a pill
totally yes
totally yes
yes with capital y capital e cavalier
absolutely
absolutely could do that
so
i'm just asking the question i mean we
have to look at i think fda regulation
of anything that can program your brain
if something can program your brain your
brain
you need somebody to be looking at that
you just can't let that into the wild
just randomly programming people
all right well the cdc came out with
some new recommendations about
the holidays
and it says if celebrating indoors bring
in fresh air by opening windows and
doors if possible
and you can use a window fan in one of
the open windows to blow air out of the
windows
because it'll pull the fresh air in
now this is different than what i was
talking about last week
i was talking about a fan
even if the window is closed so my
speculation was that just moving the big
plumes of concentrated coven around
would probably you know
distribute it in a way that might
actually reduce the number of infections
in the room because you need a certain
level before you get there now
that probably only helps for short-term
occupancy
if you stay in a room long enough and
you got a bunch of coveted in the room
if the windows are closed and you have
bad ventilation i don't i don't know
that a fan would help because it's you
know just it would just fill up
eventually with virus
but for most situations where people are
coming and going and there's a little
bit of ventilation i do wonder if
just a regular fan
would work and here we here's why this
is important
we're talking about christmas
people aren't going to open windows in
winter
people are not going to open the window
in the middle of the winter at least in
most places i live in california
i don't open the window on christmas
no i don't think one time in my life
it's been you know warm enough outside
that i would open a window even in
california
northern california southern california
yes yeah do in florida i can get that
so
i feel like the cdc might be getting
closer to the scott theory that just
moving the air around might do something
now of course that's as far as i know
untested
so i'd need to see
uh yeah in southern california you open
the windows for sure
um
so i'd love to see uh just a fan itself
tested
all right um
there is a new book coming out and an
expert who
is behind that book
who says that the havana syndrome you
know the idea that our
our uh
our diplomats were being targeted by a
secret sonic weapon
this expert has been looking into it for
a long time and says quote there is more
evidence for bigfoot
than there is for havana syndrome
the u.s expatriate who is based now this
is in the daily mail
the daily mail had this story
is um so he's based in the university of
auckland
and so he's in australia so maybe he's a
little more free to talk about this
stuff
he said the evidence overwhelmingly
points to mass hysteria
or as it is commonly referred to by
scientists
mass psychogenic illness
aveda syndrome is a result of
incompetent government officials and bad
science
said this expert i would go so far as to
rename it avena syndrome delusion
uh the absurd belief in the wake of
persistent evidence to the contrary
that diplomats are being targeted with
an energy weapon
and he said it is possible to use noise
as weapon but not in the way it was used
here blah blah because of physics or
something
so
um
are you ready
i mean he's an expert he wrote a book he
researched it and he said no there's
this is just obviously mass suggestion
who
i i have to brag about this
i know you don't like it
but since this entire episode is about
trying to figure out how to understand
the world and predict it
right your worldview works
if it predicts
have you ever heard me say that
that's it
if your worldview
predicts
better than somebody else's worldview
that's as good as you can get
you know you don't know if you have the
right one i mean maybe your view of
reality is all wrong but it predicts
it predicts
so on day one of the story of the havana
syndrome
uh with my
with my somebody has a picture of my
original recording there so i said on
day one and i believe i'm the only
public figure who said it can anybody
confirm that
that on day one
not later
but on day one
i believe there was only one public
figure who said this is definitely mass
suggestion i think it was me
i don't know that anybody else in the
world who's a public figure some of you
privately probably said the same thing
right
not one person has come forward to say
this even even now
even now you know so many months have
gone by and people didn't find any
weapon
even now i don't think anybody who's in
public is willing to say this until this
guy wrote this book
now could the guy who wrote the book be
wrong sure
sure
am i telling you now that
we have reached certainty
no because the world doesn't work like
that every time let me just say this
generally
every time you think that i've achieved
100
certainty on one of these stories where
i couldn't have direct information i
don't
i don't maybe sometimes i
you know i give you that impression but
i couldn't have
so never think in terms of 100 anything
just at this point
i'm going to say 95 odds that i'm right
maybe 95 could could be higher 98
something like that
that's what it feels like i don't have
anywhere to measure that
well one of the things i predicted ish
i'm not sure this was a hard prediction
but that the taliban would be
um
pretty hard on not only isis but
al-qaeda that they would just be enemies
and sure enough the taliban completely
destroyed an isis-k cell
uh i guess isis attacked them and they
just sent out a search and kill party
and just wiped them out
how much more of that are we going to
see
i don't think
you're going to see
necessarily the taliban let anybody
get enough power within afghanistan
that afghanistan would be attacked again
by the united states
my feeling is that the taliban
leadership has
one very big number one priority
keep
the united states out of afghanistan
that's got to be their top priority and
so if that requires you know
wiping out isis and al-qaeda to do it
i feel like they're going to do it just
for their own self-protection
i don't you know i don't think that
their
global ambitions for
islam are quite strong enough of the
taliban
themselves that they would let the the
people who are going to attack america
have a strong foothold there if there's
anything they can do about it i do not
believe
of course this is based on you know me
having no experience whatsoever in
afghanistan obviously
but it seems to me that the taliban
ironically could be the
the best
prevention against
terrorism
weirdly
so that's the optimistic view now does
the optimistic view work out very often
when you're talking about the taliban
nope
nope
so i'd say that whenever you get
optimistic about hey this taliban
situation could work out pretty well
yeah let's go brandon
um
everybody knows what let's go brandon
means right
is there anybody watching this right now
who would say what's that mean who's
brandon
what does let's go brandon
it's a reference to uh the fact that
when people as stadiums are chanting
f joe biden
uh there was one uh
one news person who
cheekily said it was let's go brandon
because she was interviewing
the winner of the race named brandon
uh but now we're seeing that uh let's go
brandon as sort of the uh
what happened is it evolved into the
polite way to say f f uh
f biden
so now you can say in public
let's go brandon
and everybody in their mind is
translating into f joe biden it's kind
of perfect
now
don't you think
what do you think are the odds
that
donald trump
will say let's go brandon
in a public event has he done it yet
i feel like he probably did it already
didn't he have a has he had oh he did
he did
of course he too oh he tweeted it no
well
trump can't tweet
oh did he do it already okay
well that's the trump we know
um
so china is once again
sending just all kinds of fighter
jets and bombers over taiwan and they're
making it real obvious at this point
that they're intimidating taiwan into
basically not fighting and just giving
up i think is the idea
and they're really putting the pressure
on taiwan and of course joe biden's
doing
nothing about it
nothing
so what should we do about it
what should the united states do
about china clearly making military
moves toward taiwan
well
personally i don't see any scenario in
which we should fire any bullets in
china
i hate to say it
but even if they take over taiwan
personally
while taiwan is a you know an ally and
we don't want to let down an ally that
would be
horrible
a military confrontation seems
i just can't see it
now threatening that we might
it's probably good so yeah we should
threaten it we should act exactly like
we're gonna do it maybe we could
surround it with warships if you know
china gets
too aggressive something like that
but
shouldn't we at this point put a price
tag on it
i feel like trump would
don't know for sure
but when they're getting this close
to a military move you know like a
serious military move on taiwan when
they get this close i think it's only
fair to tell them what the price tag is
the price tag probably isn't nuclear war
i don't think we're going to launch a
nuke
over taiwan do you we're not that's not
going to happen at least
not less something escalated out of
control
but
would we not punish china economically
well i don't know if we can
don't know if we can
right away
but i think we could say
that's the last american company that'll
ever go to china to do business
i think we could raise the taxes
substantially
on american companies that want to stay
there
i think we could
make sure that they get sucked dry
but it's kind of a
it's a delicate dance because they have
especially rare earth minerals and other
things that they can
control us with
now if we are not trying as hard as we
can to find other sources for all that
stuff
and some of it's harder than other stuff
you know pharmaceuticals you can't just
ramp up a pharmaceutical manufacturing
plant in a day
but
i don't know what our government is
doing behind the scenes
but if they're not trying a lot harder
behind the scenes
to take down china economically
that's a mistake you know we know what
they're doing publicly trying to make
buy america more of a positive thing
than a negative
but
we need to give them an invoice
we need to give them a written price tag
that says look if you take over taiwan
independent of what we do militarily
which we're not going to say in advance
because we don't say in advance what we
do militarily
the cost of this is
your economy
that's the price tag
the price tag for taiwan if you want it
is your economy
and we should make that completely clear
and that it's your economy forever
like it's not going to change it's not
like we're gonna put sanctions on you
for five years this is permanent
if you cross this line
it's just permanent
oh
azalea says greenland has rare earth
minerals
[Laughter]
well
as long as we have the military and
greenland is pretty close
sorry greenland no we're not going to
conquer greenland but it would be nice
if we had alternate sources
you know australia is an alternate
source
canada is an alternate source for a lot
of this stuff
so we do have allies who have rare earth
minerals right
we got to give them a price tag
so
as you know if you're brand new to me um
china makes fentanyl and sends it to the
cartels and then the cartels send it up
here and then it kills people and one of
the people that fentanyl killed was my
stepson
so china and i have a
have an issue
we have an issue it's personal
and so i've been looking for ways to
take china down
um with a
persuasion kill shot
and
after a b testing it for about three
years
since 2018 is when i lost my steps on
um
i have the kill shot now
so i tested a lot of things but here's
the kill shot
so i tweeted this yesterday and this
um
this should get it done
the tweet goes like this the foundation
of economics is trust
right
you can't you can't do any kind of a
business deal without a minimum level of
trust
now sure you can trust plus verify you
can have
mutually assured destruction and all
those other things but they all get to
trust
the trust in the sense that if i give
you money you're going to give me some
kind of goods or service
you're not just going to take my money
and run away
and and you have to trust that the money
i give you is real money
right that i actually have money you
know my check won't balance etc so the
economy can't move without some minimum
level of trust with the customer and
everybody
else so
people argued whether that's the
foundation of economics because other
people said no no
the foundation
is you know
supply and demand
okay don't get
don't get caught up with the word
foundation
there are bunches of things
um
there are bunches of things
which uh
are required for economics right your
economy won't work unless you have
resources and currency and oxygen and
you know there are all kinds of things
you need
but i'm just going to say that trust is
the thing that
makes everything work
like it doesn't matter if you have
resources if you don't have trust etc if
you have trust
um
you're right ronnie i'm going to read
ronnie's comment
trump got scott to publicly thank
president xi for lying about stopping
fentanyl true story trump made scott
look dumb true story
true grissom
i know that you're surprised sometimes
if i agree with a critic
sometimes you're just right right i'm
not even sure that that's a criticism
per se it's a accurate description of
what happened
so what do i think of trump's
performance on china and fentanyl
failure total failure f
f
right let me say that as clearly as
possible
trump
failed spectacularly
on the fentanyl china thing and i'm not
happy about it because it's personal
biden of course is failing too
um
i guess that's why i felt i had to do
something myself
yeah if we had a leadership that was
doing something useful
i'd let them do it
but they're not doing it
so i kind of had to do it myself
so here's the rest of the kill shot
so i said the foundation for economics
is trust everybody who in business
understands that you have to have trust
for things to work
and i said china has lost its economic
foundation in other words it lost its
trust
do you trust china
do you trust that if your ceo ceo visits
china
that they won't be locked up on on fake
charges for some kind of
you know leverage over something no not
really do you trust that they won't
monitor your communication nope do you
trust they won't steal your ip nope do
you trust that
um they'll just play fair even if it's
bad for china nope
do you think that their data is accurate
the the things they say about really
everything their economy if they tell
you that there's enough energy to run
your factory
is it true do you trust them
nope
china
through its own actions
has destroyed its trust
and if you if you do new business with
china new business right if you're
already in business
it's harder to wind it down
and i understand that you have to be
practical too right
but
um
and i said you don't have to be an
economist to predict how this will turn
out the only question left is the rate
of decline
the only question left is their rate of
decline
they have entered a death spiral
here's another way to say the same thing
when i said the foundation of economics
is trust
closely related to that is expectations
and psychology
the thing that drives every economy is
psychology not only about trust
but do you think that next year will be
better or worse
if your psychology is that next year
will be better you invest
if your psychology is the next year is
going to be terrible
maybe hold off
china has entered a death spiral
economically
i don't see the end of it
because their adventurism
is going to make it harder to do
business not easier and their energy
needs are going to be increasing not
decreasing
every problem they have
is going to get worse
because they're going to start building
on top of each other and the psychology
of why anybody would do business with
china if they could avoid it is
completely different now
and as we watch things like the uyghurs
and prison camps
we see you know all their bad behavior
to corporations stealing their ip etc
and when we see them sending warplanes
to taiwan
i think you have to say that the
prospects for the china's economy
are worse
in the future not better
and the worst to the point where you
don't even want to do business over
there because you don't know what's
going to happen
because the united states could clamp
down on china so hard
and i think it's heading in that
direction
that you just wouldn't be able to do
business there it would just be too
dangerous to have a factory there if
you're an american
so at this point
the simple knowledge that
china is entering an economic death
spiral
and that it would be insane for anybody
to move business there or to start doing
business if they had to
um that's enough
that's all it takes
the the future of china has now been
written it's as clear as the havana
syndrome if you if you have this kind of
talent stock you can see it let me play
it another way
the reason i can see the havana syndrome
thing as a mass hallucination is because
i'm a trained hypnotist and i deal with
persuasion and mass mass
persuasion as kind of a hobby
so when i saw i said oh that's obvious
because i have a very specific skill set
that can see it
if you have that same skill set it
doesn't you know it has nothing to do
with iq or anything else but if you have
that specific experience you can see it
too it would just be obvious
likewise if you had a background in
economics and business as i also do
you can see this
all right is there anybody
actually i know there are plenty of
economists who are watching this right
now
so if you're an economist
give me a shout out
tell me you're an economist in the
comments then tell me you can see it too
or can't you know either confirm or deny
if you're an economist in the comments
or even if you just have lots of
business experience let's say
can you see that china just entered a
death spiral
um
i'm just i'm saying yeses
anybody disagree anybody who has
experience in economics
econ degree
can see it with your your framing yeah
the way i frame it you can see it
um
right the foundation of economies is
trust so i agree with you on that
um i am an economist i do see china's
death spiral uh if the opposition plays
their part that's that's that's always
true right
reliant on domestic investment
confirmed from irwin yes yes
all right so
so just keep watching the comments in
case there any more but just hold this
in your mind
everybody who has experience in this
field
can see it now
right
that's new
okay that's new
i would say even maybe a few months ago
you could be a working economist of a
lot of experience in economics and not
necessarily think china is getting
trouble
you know you see the troubles
individually but you wouldn't think but
not china is a country
but now you see it
now you see it pretty clearly
if you add the energy problems plus the
climate change problems plus the trust
problems um
plus the decoupling that's going on
plus
fentanyl
plus coronavirus
at this moment anybody with economic
training can see it china just entered
an economic death spiral now how do we
how do we avoid going down with them
what keeps the rest of the world from
going into this death spiral at the same
time
probably timing
which might be enough
timing
in other words
let's say apple doesn't you know pull
out of china because it'd just be too
hard
but
they do start a long-term process of
finding another way to manufacture
so
if they can stay in china and keep
manufacturing their iphones until
they've got a proper alternative set up
maybe the impact on the united states
isn't so much
because china is still going to want to
work with american companies as long as
they can
right
as long as they can they're going to
keep taking our money
so i feel like we could phase our way
out of there
because their their incentive is to keep
doing business with us even as we're
leaving
i'm seeing a disagreement in all caps
you're wrong about china
disagree
um
may i take a moment
may i take a moment to
address the
fine person who's watching who was
yelling at me in all caps that i'm wrong
but does not give any kind of a reason
you might be new here
you might be new here
yeah china's response about fentanyl is
that systemic racism exists
sure
i don't care about that for this topic i
care about it but not for this topic
um
scott you could only use 50 characters
tell me why i'm wrong with china
not in detail but give me
give me sort of the
an idea
right just give me an idea what that
means so as i've um
i think i've trained most of you
that you get blocked if you just say i'm
wrong
especially in caps
if you don't give me any reason if you
have a reason that's great if you have a
reason i want to hear it all right
um
key assumption you're not sure china
government cares about its people
you know i'm going to push back on that
i'm going to push back on that the the
suggestion is that china doesn't care
enough about its
um you know domestic
population
and that gives them flexibility that
they can do you know bad things to other
people they can hurt their own people at
the same time i'm going to push back on
that
honestly that just sounds racist
am i wrong
that that feels like something i would
have heard as a kid
you know we used to hear that about
japan
in world war ii it's like oh the
advantage the japanese had is
they don't care about people
so you know they'll do suicide runs and
you know they'll fight to the death and
stuff because they don't care about
people
i feel like that's just racist
i don't think there's anything to that
is there
i mean every country sends its people to
war knowing they're gonna die
and every country has heroes
people who do suicide missions sometimes
they're ordered to sometimes they
volunteer i feel that's just plain plain
or racism to imagine that some some
country cares less about its own
population now i know you're saying the
government you're not saying
anybody but the government
but i don't think i i don't think that
she
could get away with even with as much
power as they have over the population i
don't think he could get away with
abusing the public in a way that
everybody could see
i mean that at some scale he couldn't
get away with that
so i
i i reject that that
i'm going to say without having you know
any data to to support either of our
views i would say short of data that has
to be assumed to be a racist point of
view
does anybody disagree with that
and by the way i used to hold that point
of view
i would say when i was a kid i would
have agreed with that yeah it does seem
to me that over in those asian countries
they must care less about their people
because of the way they act but as a you
know as a more mature and informed adult
to me that just felt like it was racist
like probably there was nothing never
anything to it
so uh
trump says he would beat desantis if
they
had a battle for the primary
what do you think would trump beat
desantis in the primary
i say yes
yeah i say yes
because what is desantis except boring
trump
right
desantis is just trump without the
without the sizzle
you know
policy why is there they're pretty
aligned and trump says the same thing he
likes desantis so desantis and trump
actually get along and they see each
other a lot
down in florida there
um and i think back in june trump was
asked if he would consider desantis as a
vice presidential candidate
what do you think of that
now we know that pence is
sort of out of the running right
what do you think of desantis
as a vice presidential choice
honestly it's the best idea i've ever
heard
it's like the best idea i've ever heard
right
because what is it that you worry most
about
trump
or you should
the thing you should worry the most
about is age right
age
and so you need somebody who can really
just
take over
and and you're not going to lose a beat
could desantis just walk into the
president job
you know after a little bit of time as
vice president just to know what
people's names are in the federal
government
i mean sure he knows most of them
already but yeah yeah yeah desantis
would be a just walk into the job
now
the democrats tried to do that with
connell harris but they
they the bed so hard
somehow the democrats not only
found the most
degraded
you know biological entity that they
could find to run as president joe biden
but then his backup
might be the least capable politician
we've ever seen in our lifetime
kabul harris might be the least
capable politician now she's smart and
capable and or smart and experienced and
stuff
but in terms of how she handles herself
in public
as a vice president it's the worst i've
ever seen i mean dan quayle was
you know level above
yeah she's as bad as you could be
but
if you if you saw trump as a package
with desantis
desantis cures
a lot of trump's problems
doesn't he
because if desantis was the vice
president unless let's assume that they
had a some kind of close working
relationship
wouldn't you
assume that trump would always hear
at least one reasonable person's
republican ideas
right
you would be you would be at least
assured
that one strong voice that you consider
reasonable descent this
would be in trump's ear
doesn't that make you feel better
because even if you love trump you think
well he can
he can take some risks
but wouldn't you like
you know the guy who you think is is
more of a
solid reader of the science which even
even bill maher pointed out that
desantis
he does he does deep dives
at least that's the story so he's he is
looking at the science
so what do you love
i mean it cures trump's biggest problems
age cures it
uh back you know as a backup plan and
the the knowledge certain that trump is
getting the right advice
that's a pretty strong package
pretty strong package and starting out
election by having such a strong
and popular pick for a vice president
vice president candidate that says the
law for you
now what would what would this set up
for after
trump served two terms
it would set desantis up as the heir
apparent
which is also good if you're republican
so to me i would say the most uh the
most likely outcome
would be a vice presidential pick of
desantis and trump as the nominee
anything could happen
still plenty of time
um
desantis's wife as a breast cancer
diagnosis you're saying
i don't know that that would stop his
political
march
um i mean that would be tragic and would
certainly throw him off his game for a
little while
but i feel like
you know that they all have problems and
they all work through them
that's a pretty big one but i think you
probably work through that
all right
here's the story that
tells you everything you need to know
about human beings
there was a fellow who did a
analysis of stanford students who ride
bikes
and found out that there were more
bicycle riders who had masks
but no helmets
than there were
helmets and no masks
let me say it again
stanford students which if you are not
aware
would be among the smartest
human beings
in the united states
no
the world
right
if you got into stanford
you have proven that you're one of the
smartest people in the no not the united
states
the world
so the smartest
people in the world among them
are more often more likely to wear a
mask outdoors on a bicycle with no
helmet
than a helmet and no mask
what's happening to us
well it's the perfect story to tell you
that we're not making our decisions
based on data right
it's not based on thinking it's not
based on common sense it's not based on
your iq
it's not based on science it's not based
on your political party
although maybe there was some influence
of political party that's possible
yeah that's how smart we are
as a species this is how smart we are
the best of us
the very best of us
that's that
that's that's our best human beings
right there
working through the statistics
well uh dr fauci has warned that
christmas might have to be canceled this
year
uh at least in terms of visiting your
family
so you might not be able to visit your
family for christmas dr fauci says
as soon as he said that his popularity
went up 35
no i'm just joking
but it's kind of funny
because you know somewhere in the
country there's somebody who said please
cancel
please cancel christmas i can't do
another
christmas with my family
somewhere somebody's saying
we like that dr fauci now is it a
coincidence that dr fauci
uh looks very much like
somebody you would cast in the role of
the grinch
why is it that he is acting like the
grinch
and coincidentally
looks exactly like the person that you
would cast as the grinch
just a coincidence
i'm seeing lots of statistics that
vaccination rates are totally unrelated
to infection rates
in various countries and counties do you
believe that
do you believe that
vaccination rates are completely
unrelated no correlation to how much
infections are going on
and therefore the implication of this if
true
are that vaccinations don't make any
difference to infection rates
do you think that's proven because you
saw graphs about it on the internet
twitter had graphs about it is it true
i don't think so
i don't think it's even close to true
but you're seeing these graphs on the
internet just like oh here's a fact
no i don't think any of it's true
um
definitely there's
so the thing you need to know is that
death rates are definitely lower where
there are more vaccinations
death rates definitely lower but
measuring infections we're just so bad
at measuring infections who knows what's
going on there
who knows
but if death rates are plunging wherever
there are more vaccinations
something's working
all right well how about that
looks like that was about all i needed
to talk about
so this was me sleeping late and having
no time to prepare
i think you'll notice that the quality
of the product completely unchanged
completely unchanged
let me tell you uh quickly a little
story about something i learned that
will be a valuable lesson for you are
you ready
valuable lesson coming up
when i first started cartooning i was
working a day job and i had to do all of
my cartooning
from 4 30 in the morning to roughly you
know six-ish
if i didn't finish it then there
wouldn't be a cartoon that day or you
know eventually it wouldn't run
so i had to do one a day no matter what
some days i would oversleep and have
only 30 minutes
sometimes 15
to devise and do a first draft of a
comic
sometimes i'd have two hours i'd write
something pretty good
but sometimes i'd have 15 minutes or 10
minutes
and i'd just say damn it i got to make
something so i just make something just
whatever i just just vomited something
on the page
wait about two months
both the vomited 10-minute comic and the
one i really was proud of worked for
hours on this one they would run in the
papers
which one do you think people like more
the one i vomited in 10 minutes
or the one that i'm really proud of put
some work into it
yeah you know the answer because i'm
priming you for the answer the answer is
the answer is actually no difference
so the there's no difference
statistically speaking
the response for the one that i vomited
in 10 minutes exactly as good
as the one i spent hours on
the public couldn't tell the difference
i thought i could tell
but it was an illusion the public
couldn't tell at all
likewise
so when i woke up this morning and said
oh
i have literally not enough time to
prepare for this it would be impossible
and then i said to myself
oh that's just an illusion
it's not impossible in fact it's
probably easy
it's complete illusion that i needed two
hours to get ready for this
and so in 15 minutes
put on a show
if i hadn't told you i overslept do you
think you could have told the difference
no i'm not saying i'm not saying this
was as good as every other shower i
think right you all have your own
opinions about that but do you think you
would have known
that i only had 15 minutes to prepare
no no you can't tell the difference
so
trust me on this how many of you don't
want to start something because you
don't think you'll do it well you're not
prepared enough you know you're not not
quite ready you're not confident
do it
surprise yourself
what if it doesn't work
well then try it again later but if
you're if the reason you're not going
yet is because you you didn't have
enough time not prepared don't think you
quite have what it takes
you're not good at knowing when you're
ready
you are not good
at knowing when you're prepared
sometimes but as a general statement
you're not good at it so sometimes
just ignore your own brain saying i'm
not ready i'm not ready and just do it
you will be surprised how often that
works and when it doesn't work
what do you do then
you learn something
you get smarter you get tougher you take
another run at it and you're smarter
this time and then you get it done
so don't worry about not working
that's sometimes that's just part of the
process to working all right that's it
for today
and i will talk to you tomorrow gotta
run and do my thing
