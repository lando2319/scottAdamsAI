all
right that should help There's a uh there's a button on here
for sound that you press two different ways
and so it fools you Well I'm glad you're here I'm glad you waited for the uh the
seven to come on That's better All right You happy now
there we go Um it was great the whole time No it
wasn't Nice try All right
Good morning everyone and welcome to the highlight of human civilization It's
called Coffee with Scott Adams and you've never had a better time But if you'd like to take this experience
up to levels that no one can even understand with their tiny shiny human
brains Well all you need for that is a copper
mug or a glass of tankered shell a canteen jug or flask a vessel of any
kind Fill it with your favorite liquid I like coffee And join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine hit of the day The thing that makes everything better It's called the
simultaneous sip And it happens now Go
All right Well we're off to a slow start but way do you see the finish oh gets
better every minute Well the uh political news is a little
bit boring today So it'll be a little bit more about technology Google has uh released a new app called
Doppel DPL which is weird because years ago I tried
to create this app and the name I had picked for it was Doppelganger
So they they've actually recreated an app that I had actually formed a company and tried to create years ago before AI
So theirs works a lot better than mine but it's called Doppel
And what it does since you probably wonder is uh it puts you in the clothing
that you're looking at buying So if you're looking at a shirt or a dress to buy you can see yourself in that shirt
or dress So the AI will put you in it Now that is very cool I I think I told
you um when I was trying to invent my version since that was before AI could
do this Uh my version was to find somebody who looks just like you and
found a nice shirt cuz there's always somebody who's exactly your size and
would be confused for you if if you were in the same room So you just find that
person wherever they are on Earth And if they say "Hey I got a new outfit."
Well you just look at their outfit and say "Well if it works for you it probably work for me
But uh Google has a better one Um now the uh Snap app has uh glasses So
they've got those uh augmented reality glasses And now there's a third party
who's made an ad blocker for people wearing glasses in the real world You
know the the Snap special AI glasses So what it does is if you're walking past a
advertisement in a window or a sign that has an advertisement it blocks it
So instead of blocking your ads on your online stuff it blocks advertisements in
the real world I don't know how many people need that I
kind of I kind of don't mind advertisements in the real world I only I only dislike them when they're digital
But anyway that's that's a real product already
Well according to Fox News Kurt Nutson I
think that's how you say his name Nutson um there's a robotrun convenience store
called Venhub that's got two robotic arms that run around and grab whatever
it is you've ordered on your app Now I I can't tell if this is the beginning
of something big or more of a novelty cuz you know there there's going to be
this long period of time where people are trying out all kinds of cool AI
robot things and some of them will be really successful and some of them will
be novelties Uh we don't know what this one will be but we won't need human beings to run
our convenience stores Uh have you ever seen the uh the estimates of what is the
biggest expense for a convenience store now other than buying the product but
the biggest expense you would think would be you know employee salaries
and it might be it might be salaries but right up near the top of the biggest
expenses um are theft So if you can remove the
employees from your convenience store you get rid of the biggest expense not
just their salary but what they steal All right
Um Elon Musk says that uh Gro 4 the AI
that uh that Elon's working on Grock 4 the new upgrade is going to come out
right after July 4th and Mus says it will reason from first
principles Now that would be very different from what the large language models have done
so far So is that going to be sort of a general intelligence
will um let me see if I can catch up on your
comments Some of you are still saying you can't hear but that's old news We
fixed that Um so that's kind of exciting Apparently uh
the new Grock will be unmatched Um it'll be better than all the other AIs But will it really be able to reason
from first principles so the large language models that exist
they just predict what the next word will be in the sentence They don't have any understanding But you wouldn't be
able to reason from first principles would you unless you had some kind of general
intelligence So maybe this is the beginning of something much bigger We don't know
Um Meta has apparently successfully poached some really expensive highlevel
AI people to go work on Meta's AI and leave open AI They've taken eight um key
open AI researchers Uh Rowan Chung is writing about that Do
you know how much that would cost now remember I told you was fake news that
they're paying $und00 million signing bonus That's not happening But it's
probably a lot It's probably a lot So Meta is really
serious about uh poaching high talent and it's working
So you know how almost every show it seems like I tell you about a new
laboratory um came up with a new battery improvement for your cars or whatever
any battery and I always tell you but that doesn't mean anybody will ever
build that battery So there's probably a battery breakthrough every single day in
some laboratory around the world But it turns out that uh Tesla has been working
on their own upgraded battery So they're uh just finishing a factory in Sparks
Nevada that'll have this new LFB battery So lithium iron phosphate
and they're safer and more affordable than traditional EV batteries
That comes from Elon Musk So while all these laboratories were talking about uh
the improvements in batteries it looks like Elon Musk was building an enormous
factory to make a highly improved battery safer and uh cheaper All right
that that might be a real big deal So if you're like me you've had some
trouble figuring out what the company Palunteer actually does
cuz it seems to do a variety of different things that don't seem directly related to each other So I
really don't know what they do but part of what they do has something to do with
you know having a complete index of citizens or something I don't know
something for the government But there's a new thing that apparently they've got a deal for
and they're going to make a uh some software I don't know if they already have it or they're they're building it
but they have a deal for a 5-year period to build a software platform that will
help with uh putting up nuclear power plants Now if you're like me you probably said
to yourself why do you need software to build
like what would you need this the specialized software for and I don't know but I could imagine that building a
nuclear power plant is really really hard and complicated And you should make sure you do the
steps in the right order And it would be really good if you built a power plant
that somebody had already built and got approved So probably it makes sure that you stay
within approvable limits and probably it makes sure that you can
do it faster because over time you could imagine each of the steps would be a
little bit more automated or so might be a big deal if we could come up with a
software platform where any state who wanted to build a new nuclear power plant you could just
say all All right First sign up for this Palunteer platform and it will tell you
the rest of the stuff and make sure that you build a power plant that doesn't blow up I guess
So that's kind of cool Uh I saw a user on axe
uh Farzad who asked Elon Musk uh when does Tesla expect to get a 3:1 or more
robotox robo taxi to supervisor ratio So
at the moment um I believe that the cars are being watched by human beings I don't know if
that is the same as the safety person Um so the the uh the robo taxis are
testing in Austin They have a human being who sits in the front seat um just
in case there's some problem I guess because it's still a test And are these supervisors slash tea
operators are they remote so are they remote human beings who are
looking through the cameras of your car to make sure that the car is operating
safely so um Farzad says you when do you get down
to 3:1 so that there are more more users than our supervisors and bus says
probably within a month or two Uh we continue to improve the Tesla AI
with each mile of it So I do love
the fact that it seems impossible and then it seems possible but it seems
really hard But uh Musk is willing to push through all of that you know
however long it takes however many people you have to have you know what how however many people
you are going to be in danger just nothing stops them I I love that So you
might and apparently the reason for the question is that the robo taxi would be
according to Farzad wonderfully profitable once you get rid of the human
the human supervisors So we'll see Um Trump says he was talking to Maria
Bartama and he says that we'll have a buyer for Tik Tok
um within two weeks Well within two weeks they'll announce it but he says they already have a group of quote very
wealthy people but it's not going to be sold unless China says yes
So you know we're also doing a trade discussion with China So will they say
yes because the alternative they think is that Tik Tok will be closed
i don't know I feel like the odds are against it So I feel like even if there
is an approved group of wealthy people approved by the US they would not
necessarily be approved by China to buy it So um that might get delayed again
Well you probably heard um that there was some crazy shooter in Cord Alen
Idaho who has now been neutralized I guess he was such a bastard he set a
fire to attract the fire department and then he shot three of them Three of the
the firemen Two of them died one of them was in bad shape And uh I guess his shooter is already
dead I didn't see if the cops got him or he got himself but the the threat has
been neutralized Now before you say is that some kind of Iranian sleeper
cell u I have no idea but it doesn't sound like it If you were if you were a
terrorist you wouldn't do something where just a few people come to a remote
forest and then you kill them He didn't shoot himself people say
Um you would go into a crowded area and you know make as much noise as you could
So it doesn't have it doesn't have Iranian terrorists written all over it
Um I see that some of you looking at the comments some of you know more about the story than I did because I just uh I
just skimmed it before I came on All right so
sorry about the uh victims but it looks like the threat has been neutralized or
neutralized itself According to a Rasmmanson poll um that
will be released this morning um 48% of the people pled I think those
are usually you know voters in the United States um 48% support a special
prosecutor to look into the 2020 election
Now hold that in your head for a minute 48%
of the of the people pled I guess that would be adults in the United States uh
48% who think it's worth having a special prosecutor look into the 2020 election
Now that would probably be pretty much every Republican
and maybe a few independents thrown in there too So
correct me if I'm wrong but it wasn't that long ago that if you even suggested
that the 2020 election might not have been pristine you you were just you were
just cancelled You got sued It was a terrible terrible thing to say
And now even Ros O'Donnell is saying you know I think the 2024 election should be
looked into So we've managed to go all the way from
there is no way that an election in the United States could be rigged because we
have so many so many ways to check it It's going all the way to we're pretty
sure that we should look into this That's a really big change in in public
opinion A really big change And I wonder if what would happen to the January 6
hoax if they actually found something big about the 2020 election what would
happen to it cuz remember people like Bill Maher who were were still in
serious TDS They believe that the reason the reason
that Republicans mostly uh stormed the capital on January 6th they believe the
reason is that those citizens thought that they had genuinely lost the
election but wanted to take over the country with their preferred leader
Trump Anyway now those of you who are not in TDS know
full well that that never happened What I mean is there were not people who
believed that that the election was uh fair who were protesting
There were only people who genuinely believed and they could have been wrong
They might have been wrong but they genuinely believed that the election was
obviously rigged and they were trying to delay things until we could at least
find out if that was true So
going from uh going from January 6 was an insurrection which assumes there's no
way to question the accuracy of an election That's that's just off the table All the way to 48% want a special
prosecutor to look into it And by the way 2024 might have been a little
sketchy too That is a big big change in public
opinion Anyway
um as you know the supreme leader of Iran
uh was immediately upon the uh the beginning of uh military action by
Israel was uh taken by his military and put in their most secure bunker
Do you know what their most secure bunker is called fordau
Okay that's just a joke He was not put in Forau But it's kind of funny to
imagine that his own military would put him in the best bunker they have Oh we
got a bunker that nobody could ever bust Why don't you put me in the bunker
that's near my house oh no no no That bunker is not nearly good enough You got
to be in the good one The one that's so that's so secure that even two bunker
busters would not destroy it Would 12 bunker busters destroy it stop
asking questions and get in this car We're taking you to Fort Okay that didn't happen but it would have been
funny However according to Fox News
um and people watching the satellite imagery of the Ford site Iran is getting
busy there So it looks like they're trying to clear the roads and the
entrances And we don't know what else they're doing but let me ask you this question
Would they spend a lot of time trying to dig stuff out of the ground if they
didn't think there was some chance that important stuff survived
would they were there human beings in Florida there might have been So you
know maybe they want to you know get the bodies out to give them a proper burial
Maybe Or is it possible that they think there's a secret wellprotected pocket
somewhere in there that there might be some good stuff if they could find it we don't know but they're they're not
ignoring the site They're digging around So they're up to something We'll keep an
eye on them Meanwhile in another other part of Iran in Tehran
uh CNN is reporting that there was a ceremony where women would show up with
their babies So there'd be a giant crowd of women who each had a baby and they would hold their baby up in the air and
uh pledge their baby's life to martyrdom
So basically it was mothers saying "Yes kill my baby." presumably mostly sons I
guess maybe Um so martyrdom is a pretty big concept in
Iran still So if you're wondering hey I wonder if they're done fighting Well I'm
guessing not I'm guessing not because they don't have a concept of losing a
fight The people who stop fighting it's
because they understand the concept that they lost the fight In Iran apparently they don't have that
concept You either win or you die a martyr and that's the other
way to win Or your child dies as a martyr That's another way to win So
Iran needs to learn that there's a way to lose a war too because otherwise there's just going to
be more of it So that's suboptimal
Well in related news Iran's top Shiite cleric who is another million-year-old
guy he looks like he's already dead has issued a fatwa
against Trump and Netanyahu Now the fatwa is basically you know
giving people permission for violence against them But
why would it be that the top cleric issued a fatwa
whereas is that something that the supreme leader normally does or could do
or would endorse or wouldn't endorse so it brings me back to my central question
Is the Supreme Leader still in charge of that country because I don't believe it
I believe he's been nudged aside and that the military is already in charge
That's that's my belief at the moment I could be wrong I wouldn't say 100%
But if I had to put a percentage on it 60 to 70% chance that the supreme leader
is already moved aside or nudged aside He might still think he's in charge but
maybe the reality is a little different All right Um according to Newsmax World
um Israel has uh postponed the trial that Netanyahu was in So he was accused
of various corruption uh things And you
remember that Trump was making some social media noise saying that uh they
should stop lawfairing Netanyahu because he likes working with Netanyahu
apparently Now remember I said when I was talking
about it yesterday I guess I said uh is it even like a possibility
that the Israel uh judicial system will look at a truth social post by Trump and
then cancel the trial And I was kind of kind of mocking that
as even a strategy Like why would Trump even think that could possibly work like
why would he waste any time on something that couldn't possibly happen and then
it got postponed Now we don't know why it got postponed It has something to do
with Israel's you know vital interests um probably something military something
about security but uh the court actually postponed it Now postpone doesn't mean
Netanyahu's out of trouble but are these related
is is it possible that Trump's message actually made a difference or
or was Netanyahu and his legal team working on this all the whole time and
you know they just had a breakthrough that the court was willing to accept i don't know but it does seem like a bit
of a coincidence that when Trump talks up you know speaks up about it Israel
suddenly is acting different than you imagine they would act So we'll keep an
eye on that Well the big beautiful bill as Trump
likes to call it uh lots of infighting going on Um the two people who were not
in favor of it are Ran Paul and uh Tom Tillis in the Senate but Tillis has
already he just announced that he's not going to run for reelection Uh I guess Trump criticized him in
recent posts and said he was going to encourage a potential primary challenger
And if you've been paying attention to Tom Tillis lately
you probably said to yourself he's acting like somebody who doesn't want to run for reelection
Well turns out he didn't Um so
and then I believe that uh
all right I believe it was uh Laura Trump who is being considered as his
potential replacement in North Carolina He's North Carolina right do I have that
right well so he's going away Um and Rand Paul
he says he's basically above it because it increases the debt and he is opposed
to anything that increases the debt So not only does it push up the debt limit
by five trillion but depending on how you do the math and
what weasel methods you use it either increases the budget deficit by $3.3
trillion over the next 10 years That's what the CBO says
But the Republicans have come up with some kind of new math that turned that 3.3 trillion into
into you know nothing So what they do is they say well if we
don't um increase taxes that's not a change
so you don't count that Even though it would increase the deficit they found a
way to pretend that it that that would be counting the counting the dollars
wrong Oh my god Yeah it's as bad as you think
So I think Rand Paul's on the right track there Um Trump has said that if it doesn't get
passed uh it will mean a 68% tax hike without
the big beautiful bill How many of you believe
that if the big beautiful bill doesn't get passed that we're going to have a
68% tax hike how in the world do you calculate that
that's that that's not even slightly possible
Anyway but that number is out there now I was uh curious how the media would
summarize the bill because I have a uh hypothesis that when it comes to public
support um all that will matter is these summarizers because there's something
like 25 different topics that the big beautiful bill addresses But if you do a
if you read a story about it it's not going to list 25 things and tell you
what people think about each of those elements They're going to pick out what they think are the you know the topline
things So I was looking at the Wall Street Journal
and I was curious how they would summarize the bill So this is their
summary and you could tell I think from the summary um not 100% with certainty but it's
suggestive of what the public will think about it because the media tells the
public what their opinions are and if the media has summarized it one way versus another way you could kind of
know what the at least their readers will uh think of it So Wall Street Journal says broadly so this would be
just sort of a broad summary of the bill the mega bill would extend tax cuts and
boost defense and border funding while cutting spending on Medicaid and food
aid It would add nearly 3.3 trillion to deficits compared to current law and
compared to letting the tax cuts expire as they would otherwise Now if if you knew that that was the
only thing that the public would know about this bill would it pass
nope Because the Democrats are going to look at the part where they say Medicaid and
food aid will be cut and they're going to say "Nope." And then the Republicans
will look at the part where it's adding to the deficit by 3.3 trillion and
they'll say "Nope So the Wall Street Journal has given both sides reason to say no You know
even if you like extending tax cuts and boosting defense and military you
probably rank those lower than these other hot items like Medicaid and food
aid and deficit If you ask me the deficit is more important than all
the other stuff So that would suggest there's going to be a
little bit of trouble getting this approved and making it popular enough that Republicans can do well in the
midterms Um
all right So they're using weasel math to uh to make it look like they're not
increasing the deficit but every reasonable person thinks that they are
Um all right So and I guess Tom Tillis is
opposed to the Medicaid cuts as well Yeah And Laura Trump is seriously
considering running for the North Carolina seat I believe she's from North Carolina but doesn't live there
presently How long how much time do you need to go live someplace
and have that as your main residence before you can run for the Senate do you have to have just mailing address
there like what is the requirement for residency i don't know
but um it might happen And they say if she ran she would win easily I believe
that Well you know that uh Canada had said it
was going to charge American tech companies with some kind of digital
sales tax And Trump said "If you're going to do a digital sales tax on our
companies we're going to cancel our our trade negotiations and just send you the
bill." The bill would be here's what your tariffs are We're done negotiating
and Canada said,"Well maybe we'll drop that digital sales tax
thing so we can negotiate." So that worked Trump threatened them with uh
with some tariff badness and Canada said "All right wait wait hold on hold on All
right we'll we'll put that in pause and we'll go back to the negotiating table."
But uh Europe on the other hand um still has one of these digital um
these digital services taxes So they have not dropped it yet but they're still negotiating But Trump says he's
going to deal with Europe and the C all the countries that have not made deals yet which is most of them uh just by
sending them tariff letters and telling them what they're going to pay So on July 9th
the current extension of u you know tariffs being held off until the
negotiations were done Um that after July 9th Trump is going to say um you
can negotiate if you want We're open to negotiating but until then here here's
your bill for tariffs Um apparently the the NATO agreement for
the NATO countries to spend more going from 2% of their GDP up to 5% over time
um might be one of the things that solves the the trade negotiations
between Europe and the US because one of the big issues for Trump was that
uh there was a big trade imbalance So uh we they weren't buying enough of
our stuff but the NATO increase uh a lot of that money will go to my American
arms And so just on its own it's going to close that uh is going to do a lot of
work to close that trade deficit So the NATO stuff could have the weird effect
of making the trade talks work better Um
and let's see what else has happened Um Trump is also mad at Japan because uh
Japan's also got a big trade deficit with us Meaning meaning that we buy more
of their stuff than they buy from us And that could get fixed according to
Reuters Um Trump is suggesting that they buy more of our energy
Now I don't know if there's any limitations to how much of our oil and gas they could buy but uh that would be
one way to fix it And uh if not I guess they'll just get a bill
So Trump will send the bill for the tariffs
Um so there was a headline that um Jake Tapper and CNN has conceded on the air
that Trump has achieved and this is his own words Jake Tapper what may be
empirically the best week of his presidency so far Now isn't that an
interesting way to remove credit from Trump they're saying it might be the best week of his presidency
So the comparison is not leaders everywhere or presidents you know all
the presidents we've ever had which is what I think is the proper comparison
They're comparing him to himself so that you don't have to give him too much credit It's like well you know for
his presidency that that was a good week So it was reported like like Jake Tapper
was finally giving him credit Well I don't think he did
I I think he just he said you know even Trump is going to have a good week
compared to Trump So it was sort of a compliment without the compliment
Anyway so uh Tapper mentioned the Supreme Court victories expanding his
power the DAO being at a high and the ceasefire between Israel and Iran and uh
and in Rwanda the Congo Rwanda thing So even Jake Tapper is seeing that Trump
had a good week although he should have compared him to other leaders not to
himself Senator Chris Murphy who is becoming
like the Grinch of the Democrats He he's one of these uh angry
angry pundits You can always get an angry comment out of him He was asked if uh he gives Trump any
credit for getting the border under control Now if you were asked on camera in
public could you give Trump any credit for getting the border under control how
in the world could you spin that into something negative for Trump
if you had to do it as like an assignment I said "It's not what you believe but just as an assignment could
you come up with an argument that Trump has failed at the border?"
Well I I wouldn't be able to do it but uh Chris Murphy
he says no he's not going to give Trump credit for the border crossings being low because uh Trump administration is
violating the law to get there And the law that he says that's being violated
is the law that allows people to apply for asylum You know I guess he was part of voting
on that law So I I didn't know this but it sounds like
the Trump administration has done something probably an executive order I'm guessing that uh says you
can't you cannot easily apply for asylum because that's the part that was being abused Everybody was just saying "Oh
asylum." And then you could get into the country and stay here for you know years
waiting for your asylum hearing And then once the asylum hearing happens you probably in at least in the old days you
could have snuck away and stayed in the country anyway So that's what he's arguing for
So the best the Democrats have and he's one of their smarter people the best
they have is arguing against process again except that the process
was completely corrupted So they're not just arguing for a good
process which you could understand Oh well we had this good process so they
should be following our good process It was the worst process ever It literally
effectively opened our border to anybody who wanted to walk in and claim that they were you know asking for asylum
So once again the Democrats have been
I I don't even want to say tricked because they're doing it themselves
They're taking the 80 the the 20% view on another 8020 again And and again
they're not arguing about the part that people care about Was the border open
before yes Has the border now been closed
yes That's where the public is Do you think that we really give a about
some uh some asylum thing that might be getting gamed by the the Trump
administration and I don't even know if it's being gamed or if they have you know solid legal standing It doesn't
matter to me Does it matter to you i only care that they closed it It was an
immediate security threat an existential threat to the country You think I care
that he bent a rule if he did i don't know if he did but oh my god how could
he be so immensely tonedeaf that you can't at least say "All right
it was good on the border but we have all these other issues."
Democrats Wow Well uh Tyler Winklevoss
an ex was saying uh quote "I was wondering what happened to the LA riots
They just stopped all of a sudden Makes sense They were never organic just NGO
funded propaganda." Well apparently and I don't know if this is related but
apparently at about the same time that the uh FBI and the IRS announced that
they were going to look into who was funding the protests the protest stopped
Now did the protests get what they wanted did they make ICE stop doing what it was
doing no Did they get anything they were demanding
not that I'm aware of So why did these massive protests
just stop well my guess is that Tyler Winklevoss
is exactly right and that uh the people funding it stopped funding it
We don't know that for sure but it looks like it So look how much we've grown up
since 2016 In 2016 if I had seen a national protest you
know like Black Lives Matter I would have thought it was organic
I would have known that you know George Soros might be paying for some signs and stuff like that but I would have thought
for the most part it's organic It's just getting a little boost from money people
But now I don't think that at all Now I think that none of them are organic and
that all it is is you know fake protests and you just wait a few days and it
stops especially if you talk about who funded it So we're much more
uh I think understanding that these protests are fake and you can
just wait them out Um I saw a uh an analysis on ex
I don't know if it was done by somebody else but uh Daniel Greenfield
um tells us that only 5% of New Yorkers voted for the socialist candidate Mani
Now remember he's not elected mayor yet He only got through the primaries But the primaries are now something where
most people vote and there weren't any Republicans voting because it was a
Democrat primary So if you go through the math as Daniel Greenfield did and
you look at you know only only Democrats and then you take out the votes for the
other candidates he was running against and um etc only 5% of the city voted for
him and he's overwhelmingly favored to win
Now does that does that track
does it make sense to you that only 5% voted for him but he's overwhelmingly
favored to win it could be It could be if the 5% is sort of accidentally a good
you know polling proxy for the larger market It could be And remember the
Democrats matter more than Republicans just because it's a Democrat town So who
whoever gets nominated as a Democrat is overwhelmingly likely to become the next mayor
But uh it is possible uh at least this number opens up the
possibility that the city could come to its senses and realize that you know
he's not the best solution Um let's see here are some things he
said So uh Trump is trying to label him a communist which I think is hilarious I
don't believe he's technically qualifies as a communist but communist is sort of
the nword for socialist You know what I mean it's the word you're not supposed to use cuz it's
going too far Um but it's you know socialism sounds like maybe something
you might want whereas communism sounds like something nobody wants So it is
pretty good It's good branding But uh I don't know if he technically
qualifies as a communist Um so here's what uh some one of the things that mom
Dani said he was asked I guess he'd made previous comments that we shouldn't have
billionaires And so he was asked you know to comment on
that and he said I don't think that we should have billionaires
And then he talked about fairness If some people are billionaires that that's
obviously a sign of an unfair system Now do you remember what I always say
about fairness u I've been saying this for years
Fairness is a concept that was invented so that idiots and children have
something to talk about Smart people
don't really start with fairness as their standard And the reason is nobody
agrees what fair is If you could get two people to agree
what fair looks like Well maybe you know maybe you could use that as your standard but not really In the real
world we don't agree Do you think it's fair that somebody could work hard and
make more money and then it could be taken away and given to somebody who didn't work hard and didn't make much money is that fair
well depends who you ask So there's no universal standard of fairness If there
were well then maybe I would say "Yeah go ahead and use that under some circumstance." But if nobody can even
agree what fairness looks like you can't use that as a standard that just allows
you to do anything you want and just say "Well I've decided this is what fair looks like."
So he wants to tax white people more Uh specifically he said tax the whiter
neighborhoods more And now he wants to get rid of billionaires So billionaire
um Bill Aman was not too happy about that
Um and now the other thing that I noticed today is I saw more anti-Muslim
um commentary on X than I have ever seen before I think today was the high the
the high limit of it Now I'm not going to say that the commentary was unfair
because it talked about for example the practices of the Iraqi uh Muslim
population And I won't repeat some of the things that were claimed as being standard
operating procedure for that uh that group of people uh because it's too
horrible And I don't know how much is real and how much is you know certain
people but not everybody I don't know any of that But I will tell you that probably
because of mom Donnie and maybe because of the Israel Iran conflict
um I'm seeing people who would never have said these things out loud just
going right at the Muslim culture problem Now my take on it is not that
I'm judging anybody as being good or bad because you know who am I to judge
anything but it's easy to say that the systems are not compatible
You you can't just take a bunch of you know hardened Sharia law Muslims and
drop them in the community with your non-Muslims It wouldn't matter what else
they were if they were just anything else It's never going to work So while obviously there are tons of u
Muslim citizens in this country who don't have any radical thoughts they're not breaking any laws or not offending
you in any way and they're completely you know part of the American experience
Um but we can all agree that the hardcore Muslim version just
will never be compatible with you know the American cultural experience
So unless uh unless the Muslims are the ones who are conforming so that they can
fit into the current system the system would have to change if you got enough
people who demanded that change So it does seem like u there is more
anti-Muslim content than I've ever seen before but I'm not going to judge that
It could be because this is the time to talk about it
Well there's a story that the the Mexican cartel hired a hacker I guess
one of their own hackers to hack into the phone of
um of an FBI assistant legal attach who was at a US embassy and he broke into
the phone remotely So I think the only way you can do that
is by sending somebody a file that they click on and it can take over their
phone So that's probably what happened But they got into the phone and then
they found the names of um informants
Uh but of course the informants are who the cartel wants to kill So they found
the name of the informants But then and this is the impressive part the same
hacker hacked into the public camera system in Mexico so they could track
uh where the guy who owned the phone they could track him in public
So it was just like a TV show So they got into his phone and they knew who who
he was looking for you know who his informants were And then they could see him actually on the street and who he
met with And that allowed them the confirmation to go out and kill the informant
Uh I don't know if they successfully killed any but that was that was a risk
That's uh this is like one of those stories I read about a serial killer who
who you know got away with it for decades and had a you know a torture
thing built in his backyard underground And I think well you know I I certainly
can't approve of the serial killer but I got to say he's got some good work ethic
there So this hacker I have the same feeling I do not approve of him breaking
into phones and I don't approve of his hacking and I certainly don't approve that he's helping the cartels kill
informants But I have to admit that took some skill
It was a lot of skill to do those two things So there's that
I guess the uh Duke Law School Law Journal they sent a secret memo to
minority applicants telling them they'd get extra points if they write about their race
So they were being coached on how to do DEI without DEI So they
they presumably are not allowed to ask you know what's your race and then take
that into account for admissions but they would be allowed to read a uh to
read an essay that all the applicants have to write So they're saying you know
if you're going to write the essay you might as well put something in that essay about your race
Why don't ask why Just put it in there Trust us We'll take care of it
So they're in trouble The Free Beacon is reporting on this
All right ladies and gentlemen It's a lazy summer Monday and the regular news
is boring cuz the big beautiful bill I'm so tired of that damn thing I don't know if it'll ever be passed but I'm
definitely tired of it Um I got worn down However because uh Trump is still
your president and the world is a crazy place I would expect there to be some
big news that breaks because there always is On the other hand it's entirely possible
that because the news business will be going on vacation for the 4th of July
that there just won't be much news cuz you know your news is mostly mostly fake
It's based on real stuff usually but um the news decides what to get get you
worked up about And so if enough of the frontline people are on vacation you
you're not going to get worked up because they won't do the kind of content that gets you worked up So we
might be entering the boring phase of the summer or there will be another gigantic war
possible All things are possible All right that's all I have for you today
I'm going to say hi to my beloved local subscribers
and uh stock market's not doing so well
Um all right good All right locals I'm coming at you
privately The rest of you I hope to see you tomorrow Same time same place
