and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine day of the day
the thing makes everything better it's
called simultaneousip
it happens now go
Ah that's pretty good you know
there are some days with the news does
not deliver
and then I've got
not much to do
but today
the news is amazing it's like all fun
and interesting stuff are you ready for
this
all right
uh number one question people asked
after seeing the video of RFK Jr on uh
doing exercise with his shirt off we're
still talking about it which by the way
was the most brilliant
um probably the most brilliant political
play of the year just taking your shirt
off because he's running against
somebody who's you know barely alive
that's a pretty strong play it was a
strong play and it totally worked
but some people ask the following
question
how is it possible to look like that
when you're Nearing 70.
unless you're doing
something like steroids right were you
wondering that
were you wondering if he was doing
something illegal
well I'll give you a little uh Insight
on that I was contacted by one of my
normal Twitter
persons that I talk to a lot
and my Twitter friend said that he was
the same age and he looks the same
without a shirt
[Laughter]
so apparently there are at least two of
them you know it's somebody I trust you
know somebody I've got a lot of
interaction with so I believe him
and this individual who said he also
looks like this at the same age uh gave
me his
his method
and testosterone of course is right at
the top of the list testosterone
replacement and then there were a half a
dozen other uh let's say supplements
completely legal types uh you know
doctor prescribed that sort of thing but
apparently the the
the technology
exists to make normal people look like
that
isn't that amazing that that's not a
fluke
is not a fluke he just did the things
that people know how to do if they're in
that you know exercise lifestyle he was
probably just a little more aggressive
about it in the sense he he's almost
certainly supplementing in some way but
all of it would be legal right so if
you're wondering if he's doing any weird
steroids or anything doesn't seem to be
necessary
at all
but I've got a question for you
doesn't testosterone change your
behavior
doesn't it how can it not wouldn't it
make you more aggressive
let me ask you this do you think that
RFK Jr would be running for president at
his current age if he had not taken a
testosterone
do you think he might have said you know
gardening would be fun I think I'll do
some gardening
I don't know you know those cavities are
pretty adventurous so maybe you would
have but the the question you should ask
yourself is
is too much testosterone a problem
now he doesn't have any indication that
you know there's nothing about his
personality that would suggest that he's
pretty level-headed
but I think you'd have to ask that
question you know if you had a president
that you had elected before
um before testosterone treatment and
then hypothetically that president said
hey I think I'm going to get some of
this testosterone
wouldn't it change how they acted
wouldn't it Becky more likely to go to
war
it's a real question
yeah we we always act like the chemicals
in our body are are having no impact on
us
of course they are
all right
CNN got exclusive access to the Trump
audio tape
how do you think they did that
it's the audio tape where he's shuffling
the so-called classified documents how
do you think they got that well this
morning the New York Times says they
also have access to it huh
CNN and the New York Times
they have access to this top secret
document
uh let's see there's a Fox News have
access no no
Breitbart uh bright bar no Breitbart
didn't have access
interesting
isn't that interesting
it's almost as if the Deep state is on
one side
it almost feels like that hmm
um well anyway
here's a little trick you can do to
determine how brainwashed we all are
go go to the media and try to find the
transcript the text written transcript
from the Trump
audio
because it's pretty short
so it'd be very easy for anybody to
print the full transcript it'd be about
this big on a page you know just maybe
six inches of size on a page very easy
right
go search for that
see if you can find it
I did couldn't find it I the best I
could find is you know a little bit you
know this and that and I pieced it
together I had to listen to it myself
this morning I listened to it myself and
then wrote it down
so I'm going to read it to you
now why do you think it's so hard to
find the the transcript
what do you think
same reason it was so hard to find the
uh for a while it was hard to find the
transcript of Trump's uh comments in
in Charlottesville
here's how this is played
if the news can tell you there's an
audio tape that they've heard but you're
too busy to listen to
they win because then they just they
just describe it any way they want and
you you don't have the time to listen
so you accept their characterization of
it because they wouldn't they wouldn't
listen to an audio tape
and then just lie to you about it when
you could just listen to it yourself
right they wouldn't do that would they
do you think the news would just lie to
you about what's on this little audio
tape when you could so easily just
listen to it and find out they were
lying no of course I would we live in a
world where they'll do anything that
that's not even slightly outside the
bounds of normal behavior of course they
would
are they doing that
well I would say they're not lying I
haven't heard anybody say he said
something he didn't say or vice versa
but
have you heard that they left anything
out of the story
that's actually in it
yeah there's something in the story
that's way bigger way bigger than some
documents
but so here's
um here's what I took from it so this is
just what Trump was saying so this is
not the other side of the conversations
with people in the room but he started
out by saying these are bad sick people
and we found out in context later that
the bad sick people
are generals and people who want him to
go to war that seems like the context so
he goes these are bad sick people I'll
show you an example
and then he says he said I wanted to
attack Iran it turns out that was
General milley is the he said Millie
said I wanted to attack Iran they
shuffles his paper it goes right this is
him
all right this is off the Record
um defense
defense department and him so he's
saying that the defense department and
general milley are you know acting
similarly and he says this wasn't done
by me this being the piece of paper in
his hands this
this was not done by me
it was done by him meaning Millie
pages long so Trump is saying it's a
document that's pages long
it's not a summary it's pages long
I at one point I wondered if it was a
summary but it's pages long
and then Trump says this totally wins my
case
do you remember what the news reported
as the case that he's winning
do you remember that was a big story
the case that he won
what's the argument it's not even in the
news
the news is leaving out the entire
context of the audio
do you know why they're doing that
well it's pretty obvious once once once
you listen to it all right here it goes
he goes this totally wins my case so in
other words there's some conversation
about Trump being bad in some way and
we're going to find out what that is
accepted his secret confidential
uh-oh look at this you attack
he wanted to attack Iran
so apparently it was a document for
Millie
showing an indication that he wanted to
attack Iran
that's at least that's Trump's
characterization we don't know if that's
what it was but that's how Trump
characterized it
uh he says this was done by the military
and given to me
uh
so and then he says as president I can
declassify but I I can declassify but
now I can't
that's an interesting story because he's
got his tense
he's confused the tenses here I wonder
if that's a defense because he says as
president I can declassify
but now I can't
and what how did CNN characterize that
as president I can declassify
but now I can't
um
so he's called the document secret and
confidential
and then he said as president I can
declassify
and he says but now I can't
does that say he didn't declassify it
because that's how it's being presented
on CNN they're telling you that he's
admitting he didn't declassify it
let me read it again and see if you you
can hear the confession
so these are just the two parts about
the document they're taking on account
uh they're taken out of order
but the other stuff isn't relevant to
that
um
let's say you said accepted his secret
confidential
so he's called the document secret and
confidential
so I would agree that that's probably a
fact would you
the document probably is secret and
confidential I doubt he'd say it
if it were not probably is labeled right
on top there
so he's already said it's secret and
confidential
but then later he says as president I
can declassify
but now I can't
does that say you didn't declassify it
listen again and see if you can hear him
say he did not declassify it because
that's what CNN says
they say he's saying it in his own words
right here
but I'm not hearing it he's saying it is
secret and confidential
but then he's saying as president I can
declassify
but now I can't
one interpretation which is valid is
that he didn't Declassified and he knows
it so that's what CNN is saying but did
he say that
it's not what he said
he's he's saying two separate things
which could both be true
what is that it's secret and
confidential which doesn't mean it's not
Declassified does it
aren't those different
couldn't it be Declassified
but still be secret and confidential in
other words could he have Declassified
it for his own use
but is still secret and confidential
from the rest of the world and he would
plan to keep it that way
but it would be Declassified if he had
Declassified it so simply saying that he
could do it then but he can't do it now
it doesn't say he didn't do it
it's just a statement of fact
I know
so
but here's the biggest part of the story
here's the biggest part of the story
that is not even included what is a
bigger story
that a president potentially took some
classified documents that he could have
unclassed Declassified with a
not even a wave of his hand
he could have just walked out the door
and had people watch him
that would be Declassified in my opinion
given that the declassification thing is
not required
you know constitutionally there are
there are procedures and that would not
be the procedure but the president gets
to decide what the procedure is
that's my understanding so if he said
watch me walk out the door with this box
of Secrets you would be declassifying it
by definition
now that's my take on it because there's
a lack of standards that you know that
are constitutionally described that
would make it any different
argument anyway but here's the bigger
the bigger story is not that he may have
taken some classified documents the
bigger story is that the
military-industrial complex was trying
to frame the president
how is that not the story
here he is claiming now it's a claim
I'll just say it's a claim so Trump is
alleging that his generals and the
military were trying to Goat him into
war with Iran and they were framing him
for the one who wanted to go to war
that's a much bigger story
am I wrong and then here's the here's
the kicker
taking that document may have been the
way he protected himself
he may have taken that document
specifically
to win his argument that's what he's
saying he says this totally wins my case
the case being the argument that he was
never wanting to go to war with Iran
by his military was urging him to do so
now the counters of that which is a good
counter is that the military draws up
attack plans for lots of places
any any place you might want to attack
they probably have one for Russia they
probably got one for Taiwan you know if
there's a Taiwan war and so of course
they'd have one for Iran
so is it news that the military had a
document
that described a battle plan no that
part's not news but we have not seen
that document
the document might go far beyond
describing what a an attack might look
like it might be recommending it
that's what I mean Trump is kind of
suggesting
that it was given to him as a
recommendation or let's say a strong
suggestion or maybe they're trying to
influence him to do it that would be a
little different than just saying we
have a bunch of attack plans that are
always a in the file
so here here's the file of the Iran
attack plan that'd be really different
wouldn't it if it was just the file you
know the basic attack plan uh we just
like to update you we always have one of
these cooking it's always on the back
burner
don't take it too seriously
or did they say we really need to be
looking at this I mean we should get
serious about this that's very different
so Trump may have used it to protect
himself
which to me if I were on a jury that
would matter to me
it would still mean that he had
technically broken a law
but the context in which he was caught
breaking the law he is also caught
allegedly caught giving you his reason
for breaking it
and his reason for breaking it would be
to protect himself from a military
industrial complex that's victimizing us
all
uh
all right have I ever told you that I
never get a message unless it's an
emergency right the now
right the now not in 10 minutes now
not in an hour
because I already said I'll get back to
you in an hour no it's got to be right
now
right now
so I've got to send a text
right now right in the middle of my live
stream I've never gotten that I don't
think I ever get taxed or just saying
how you doing if I feel like it's
everything is you got to do something
 right now at seven in the
morning
how is that even possible how do so many
people live a life
that they're creating an emergency for
other people
live streaming
wait
wait
I hate it when people make their problem
my problem all the time so
something and you know you know what you
have to do right you just have to cut
them out of your life you just got to
get them out of your life you can't have
people like that who are throwing
themselves into one emergency after
another and you're the only one who can
save them
Jesus
all right uh enough about that
um you all saw the video of the Patriot
front the alleged group of racists who
got unmasked by the proud boys at least
some of them did and now we're doing the
thing where we're trying to find out if
those unmasked people are feds or if
they were at other events allegedly and
I don't believe this to be true but
allegedly uh one of the unmasked Patriot
front people
look like one of the feds at January 6
who was doing some sketchy stuff to make
it look like you know he was taking down
a window so peekaboo could crawl through
something like that I would say at this
stage in the reporting I don't believe
any of that
I don't believe that they have
accurately identified
the unmasked Patriot front guy
as somebody else now Elon Musk weighed
in on that tweet about that point and it
sounded like he wasn't quite convinced
that they had figured out who that guy
was but uh but he said uh musk tweeted
it looks like one is a college student
and then he says parenthetically who
wants to join the government I don't
know how he would speculate that
somebody that he just saw their face
wants to join the government
I don't know where he got that and he
says another is maybe an antifa member
but nonetheless a probable false flag
situation so I agree with the last part
there's something about the Patriot
front that doesn't look genuine at all
it just nobody on the right
the things they look real
and there's nothing about them that
seems real everything about them looks
like an OP of some kind
or they're funded by somebody who's
sketchy or something but they definitely
don't look like
they are what they present to be
so that's all we know about that
speaking of Musk
um there's a lot of conversation about
depression being potentially over
diagnosed in the US
but musk agrees that depression is over
diagnosed in the U.S if you haven't seen
the data the percentage of people in
America who take antidepressants is like
through the roof and other countries
that you would imagine would be
comparable
very little
I mean just a gigantic difference and
one of the differences is maybe we
allowed direct advertising from Big
Pharma
so it could be that we're just more
hypnotized to buy the stuff in other
countries they don't allow the
brainwashing so it doesn't happen
so I don't know maybe maybe more
Americans are being helped by the meds
that's possible
but it doesn't look like it
so here's the weird part is that musk is
saying that ketamine might be a better
solution and he has friends who seem to
be benefiting from it
now we're in some dangerous territory
here aren't we
so I do love the fact it's one of my
favorite things that Elon Musk gives you
not he gives you his opinion
I respect that way more than uh let's
say Zuckerberg
because Zuckerberg I think is trying to
run a company
you know without at least stating his
opinion too much he's obviously you know
very Democrat but he's not like talking
about it it's not something he's putting
out there but I love the fact that musk
does
because he's one of our smarter citizens
in his opinion at least gives you sort
of a a stake in the ground
around which you can argue or debate
but it's like a really good stake in the
ground
and so he so he takes this topic which I
think is vital I think it's a vital one
for the well-being of the country
ketamine and the over over prescription
of depression meds huge huge uh
topic and he can just send a tweet with
a few sentences and he just sticks a
sticks a fork in the ground and says
let's talk about this
very good this is like ideal citizen
Behavior this is internet dad stuff done
right if you if you say I'm agreeing
with them about ketamine I'm not doing
that
I'm not doing that I'm saying it's a
vitally important question and he's
making sure that you're
giving it the right amount of attention
you love him
I think the dumbest thing that
people say when somebody makes a comment
about another public figure is you love
him
you love him you're in his cult
you just stopped doing it really you
should just stop doing that or is that
maybe just an NPC thing it's not a real
person thing you love him you want to
marry him
all right
speaking of mental health I say Rob
Henderson tweet about uh Jonathan Nate I
think it was a sub stack in which he was
talking about the percentage of people
with mental health problems in the
America
uh did you know that 56 percent of
liberal white women aged 18 to 29 have
been diagnosed with a mental health
condition
and if you look at the uh if you look at
the graph
of uh of the young females who have been
diagnosed with mental conditions it's up
here
if you look at the number of
conservative women who have of all ages
who have been diagnosed with mental
problems it's way down here
now I think it's sought treatment for
not diagnosed I think it's sought
treatment for
now
can we stop pretending this is political
we really don't have a political
difference in this country
and I think that we're also poorly
served by the people who are saying that
it's Rich versus poor it is
very much Rich versus poor but that's
mostly not what's bothering us
mostly is mostly mental illness
it's mostly mental illness that the
people in the Democrat Party can't call
out because they're too woke they can't
say you know
ah I see where you're going it sounds
woke and we like woke but
honestly I think that's coming from
mental illness
I'm not sure you thought that through
and why is it that somebody like Vivek
or Trump
can't call that out directly just to
hold up that chart and say see these
people and not seeking uh mental health
problem Solutions
these are conservatives
somewhere in the middle you got the
independence they're not very high
either
but then look at this this is the party
we're running against
over half of the young women who are the
dominant voice in the Democrat Party in
my opinion uh over half of them
have a mental illness and the reason
that they're comfortable as Democrats is
is what the reason they're comfortable
as Democrats is
they all have mental problems
no that's not fair that's not fair that
was just a joke
now the the Democrats are more the we're
going to accept everybody as they are
the Republicans are more like we're
going to accept everybody who doesn't
bother us
and you know obeys the law
a very different standard except
everybody versus except everybody who
leaves us alone and obeys the law
completely different
so I think the Democrats accidentally
became a a breeding ground for mental
illness because if you had a mental
illness you could go there and you'd fit
right in and people would even notice
they literally wouldn't notice
literally no joke to talk like uh talk
like Biden now no joke people no joke
you could have a pretty serious mental
illness become a Democrat and nobody
would notice because you'd fit right in
and that's I'm not trying to be
hyperbolic I'm trying to actually
accurately describe the situation I do
believe he was fit in I don't think
people would notice
so
the fact that we don't call that out for
what it is a massive mental health
problem
uh you know now what is causing it and
do people become Democrats because they
have it or does being a Democrat give it
to you which way does a causation work
I'm thinking maybe both ways
if you're a republican you've got a game
plan don't you
you still have to execute but let's say
you're a young woman and you're a
Republican don't you know exactly what
you need to do
to be happy
you do
right you can make a list of all the
things you need to be happy it'd be like
find a good guy
you know get married have a family have
some kids you know go to church whatever
it is but you're you'd have a list all
the things to make you happy all right
I'll do the things on this list and uh
sure enough I'm happy
but if you're a Democrat everything goes
fair you know traditional family is just
one way to go religion is unnecessary so
you wake up every morning and you don't
have a mission
you don't have a path what would make
you happy if you were a Democrat and a
woman
if you're a woman and a Democrat what
would make you happy
I don't know
I mean I actually don't know
because the things that make Republican
women happy are getting married and
having a family and you know the
relationships Etc they're God doing the
right thing having a good life you know
doing the best you can with your
character
and that makes people happy and exercise
how about exercise
exercise even is somewhat becoming a
republican thing which is weird I mean
not completely but in terms of the way
we talk about it it sometimes is
not saying they're I'm not saying there
are no Democrats who exercise so don't
get excited in capital letter me
all right
um
let's talk about the musk and Zuckerberg
cage match
uh I just love everything about this
story
just everything about it is funny so now
uh Elon musk's mom may
has weighed in and she's uh canceled
she's canceled the fight
geez canceled it
um now
Elon Musk is not aware that it's
canceled and neither is Zuckerberg but
uh May's canceled it and by the way I
love the way she handled it
she just says no it's canceled does not
happen
you know she knows she has no authority
to cancel anything but she's bullying
her mom Authority as she's saying it
that way no Mom Authority this is
canceled
now what would I would be so happy if
Elon canceled it because his mom said so
now I don't think that's going to happen
I think that's very unlikely but I think
that would just be cool
like it would be it would just be a fun
way to to end it but anyway may may musk
suggested
that instead of a physical battle they
have a uh a battle of words
so they'd have some kind of a contest
there'd be a battle of words maybe a
maybe an insult battle
and I thought well if it's going to be
an insult battle
he's going to need a coach
so I volunteered
who better
to help Elon Musk write some good
insults
I mean it's really sort of my
sort of my sweet spot
but I saw that some MMA fighter also
offered to coach Elon Musk at Elon Musk
accepted
he accepted coaching from MMA star I
didn't recognize his name
but
so he's still acting like he's serious
which is perfect so I don't know how
serious he actually is or Zuckerberg
either I don't know how serious they
both are they're both playing it like
it's serious which is exactly the right
thing to do for both of them exactly the
right thing because it just makes him
look good just makes him look tough
gives them some attention reminds us
that Zuckerberg is a jujitsu guy reminds
us that most might be more of a badass
than you think you know he's not just
all about the thinking and the math you
might actually be able to throw a punch
so I think it just everybody wins I I
would like to see them not get hurt
I like that I don't want to see him get
hurt
but it's a wonderful story
all right uh let me test your memory
this is going to be a memory test we'll
see how you do uh do you remember that
Ron DeSantis is running for president
anybody
is it anybody remember that
his name is Ron
uh DeSantis DeSantis have you heard that
name
I believe he's running for president and
the process he's used for under to run
for president is he's uh he's going to
act exactly like the most boring cubicle
employee in that movie Office Space
yeah so uh he's telling you that he
would be as a president of the United
States he would make a very good
governor of a state
because he's still saying that he's
going to be really effective and
efficient and get things done
and the fact is
I'm so efficient
in Florida we
've got a lot of things
done
done I mean it looks like he's not even
trying
but apparently that's what trying looks
like now let me say again I think he's
been a really good governor
and I think the skills of a governor are
somewhat different I don't mind when my
government gets when my Governor gets
all wonky I would like a little bit more
of that in my state
you you tell me I would love to see um
Gavin Newsom
just get all wonky and talk about
nuclear energy and you know how we're
going to have to build a dam here and
you know do some really like on the
ground
work
I'd love to hear DeSantis talk about
work
DeSantis just talks about how bad the
others are
DeSantis does the work
so so let me be clear if DeSantis became
president I would be comfortable
because he is somebody who does the work
he's a he's a qualified
serious
no-nonsense
effective executive
could be a great president I just don't
know how he could win because he's just
too boring yeah he's not crazy enough he
doesn't know how to get your juices
flowing every time I listen to him I'm
like all right I don't remember anything
you said
so he needs to build a wall or do
something that's got a little more
visual or fear persuasion or something
got to get our attention all right
um James O'Keefe
is making some news with his new
organization OMG
um
he says he's got evidence that we
haven't seen yet there will be evidence
that over 60 percent of the money
involved in what he calls a massive
illegal American political donation
funding scheme is apparently coming from
China
what secret illegal political money
flowing into the Democrat Party from
China
sixty percent of it going into at least
some area of funding I don't know
now does that sound true
do you think that's going to pan out
60 of money involved in this
massive illegal Amer so I guess I guess
there's two categories of things one is
that there's some illegal category of
funding
uh so it's not all the funding for the
Democrats it's just there's a category
of illegal funding and within that
category of illegal funding sixty
percent of it allegedly according to
James O'Keefe is coming from China do
you think that's going to pan out
I think I'd bet against it
is not impossible
not impossible in fact yeah
I know it's very it's there's a very
good chance it's true
I'd say the chance of it being true or
solid
but I would still bet against it
I don't know
there's something about it that's not
quite tripping my credibility trigger
here but maybe I mean he says he has the
goods he says we're going to see it so
maybe yes
that's what makes James O'Keefe
interesting
uh lots of provocative claims and every
now and then he's got the goods
so keep an eye on that
all right Reuters did a little analysis
uh didn't come out maybe the way they
hoped uh they were looking for which
presidents
um in all the history of the United
States which presidents are descended
from slaveholders
which presidents and I think they might
have been Disturbed to learn that every
single president of the United States
including Obama
was descended from slave owners in the
case of Obama on his mother's side
uh there was one exception
one exception just there's only one
American president who is not
been descended from slave owners
see who that is
[Applause]
Donald Trump
Donald Trump
he's the only president who is not
descended from slavers
now don't you think he should mention
that
don't you think he should mention that I
think so
I think you should mention it
not that it means anything all right
doesn't mean anything yeah to me
personally it means nothing whatsoever
that somebody was descended from
somebody doesn't mean anything I don't
care that the KKK were Democrats
50 years ago I don't care those a long
time ago
but it's a it's a good fun political
point
all right uh Jonathan turley's uh great
writer of course and lawyer talking
about the hunter defense
so it looks like Democrats are trying to
float the idea that if Hunter did
anything bad
such as lying that his father was
sitting next to him when he was
extorting some Chinese guy on the phone
the everything he did that was bad uh
might have been done under the context
of him being an addict and so you should
go easy on them it's basically just all
part of him being an addict which he's
now recovered from
I think I don't know
um but as Turley points out the hunter
was an addict defense as one problem
which is they've also presented him as a
capable business person who earned every
penny he got by being on the board of
barisma
you can't be both he he can't be the
addict who is so out of it
that he doesn't he has no control over
his actions but he also earned every
penny he got with these overseas
companies by doing his good works of
some kind
and there's a little
that's a little bit of a stretch a
little hard sell
anyway turtle is great
all right so now we've got a situation
where we've got this WhatsApp message
discovered in which Hunter seemed to be
soliciting a bribe from China and saying
that his father was in on it that's
that's the indication doesn't mean it's
true it's just allegations at the same
time we've uh what a coincidence at the
same time we've got this audio about
Trump's handling of the classified
documents which some say
um makes him look like he's confessing
which I think is a little murky but
that's the story
now
here's here's what this boils down to
and I'm not making this up
the primary reason that Biden and Trump
are likely to run against each other
is the following
it's the only way either of them can
stay out of jail
they both need to Pardon themselves it's
a pardon election we're seeing which one
of them gets to Pardon themselves and
stay out in jail
am I wrong
I don't think either of them would be
running for office if they didn't need
to stay out of jail
and
you know but Trump may be thinking
differently I think I mean Trump may be
running for Revenge as well but you
don't think it matters to him that he
has all these legal difficulties and it
sure would be convenient
if he also happened to be the only
person that can pardon somebody wouldn't
that be convenient
I think that history is forcing us to
find out if a president can pardon him
or herself
don't you think Trump's going to test
that
and Biden My Testa too you know if Biden
stays in office he'll test it but I
think that Trump if he went in office
the first thing he do is pardon himself
from everything and everybody will be
fine with it just get rid of all that
stuff he just won the election
well
so uh
just think about this situation
right if you're an American just just
think about this
in the let's call the second tier of
candidates
you've got Vivek ramaswamy
Republican you've got RFK Jr Democrat
I would be completely happy with either
of those two people as my president
I think they're in it for the right
reasons
they're both brilliant they're both
Patriots they have some you know policy
disagreements but not the crazy kind you
know what I'm saying if you saw Vivek an
RFK Jr debate
you wouldn't find much difference
because both of them are factual based
um
and I think both of them would change
their minds right in front of you
if the data is some new data arrived I
think both of them would publicly change
their minds with better data how much
better can you do
right as a pre if you wanted to have a
president could you do better than
somebody who's completely a patriot no
doubt about it
hugely talented hugely talented does not
have you know any kind of a
a past that's going to be a problem
right I think RFK Jr has a really
interesting past but this kind of
personal stuff is not really anything
that bothers us he's got the vaccine
stuff he has to explain but I told you
how he could do that pretty easily so
our second tier of candidates and I
would include uh DeSantis in there a
solid solid Patriot a solid operator
right any one of these candidates and
you could add three or four more
any one of them I would be really happy
to have as my president democrat or
republican in this case
and but the two who are running are the
only two who are a problem Tim Scott Tim
Scott highly qualified candidate right
but think about it the two who are
likely to be in the general election are
the two who are probably running at
least in part to Pardon themselves for
Major Crimes
felonies
now in my opinion Trump's alleged
felonies
you know are a little more trivial
if if everything said about both people
is true trumps would be trivial in my
opinion whereas bidens is pretty serious
in my opinion it's all it's all a ledge
so we're just guessing at this point
uh but how did we get here how did we
get so we have some of the best solid
real candidates genuine candidates best
the best group we've ever had and they
won't get to run because the two top
people are trying to stay out of jail
in part in part
I mean I don't think that could be worse
got it
and maybe something will change
you know if if Biden dropped out
and whoever was leading in the polls
promised to Pardon them both
would Trump drop out
probably not he's a fighter I think he'd
want to win yeah
all right probably not
um
I saw some reporting from Jesse waters
on Fox News saying that uh
Hunter allegedly paid for Joe Biden's
burner phone while Joe is in office as
vice president
he had a burner phone
so I guess Biden had three phones
he had a personal phone a business phone
and a burner
you should put them in jail just for
having a burner phone
like I don't think that's illegal
but
if your president has a burner phone
next
let me say that again
if your candidate has a burner phone for
anything
next
maybe yeah maybe it's a fake and RFK Jr
have burner phones
but I don't think so you know what I
think they do instead
I think instead they don't say things on
phones they're uh criminal Behavior
just a guess
just a guess I'll bet Vivek doesn't need
a burner phone because he never does
anything illegal
and if he did he wouldn't do it on the
phone
isn't that a better way to go maybe
somebody who doesn't need the burner
phone
I mean that that should be like a
minimum requirement for your candidate
so
I never felt you needed a burner phone
if the answer is yes you don't you need
to ask any further questions if you've
ever had a burner phone
next
all right
there's a some more allegations this
time from Canada the great who's got a
great website and
his his threads I don't know who he is
but his threads are more insightful than
other people which makes me very curious
what his real identity is
I don't know how he continuously gets
more Scoopy material than other people
but uh
he says I'll just read what he says in
his tweet in a groundbreaking Revelation
it has come to light that Dr Peter Hotes
he's the one who RFK Jr wants to debate
an esteemed vaccine researcher has been
entangled in a web of funding
collaboration in research with Chinese
military scientists potentially involved
in the development of covid-19 the
intricate tale weaves together key
Chinese military virologists and
culminates in the Smoking Gun evidence
surrounding Covenant 19's notorious Fern
cleavage site
now let's do an analysis on here to pick
the propaganda
all right
propaganda doesn't come from just one
side
if you saw the Democrats say a story
that something had
uh come to light
and that somebody was quote entangled in
a web of funding collaboration and
research
with you know Bad characters China
uh and uh
there was another word here uh that I'm
looking for
potentially
potentially involved in the development
of covert 19.
sounds a little sketchy doesn't it
it's about he there's a definite
connection
to somebody who's potentially connected
to something that's like not a
connection
it would be a connection if you knew
they were connected that's a connection
but to say that somebody is
potentially
related to something
says you don't know
that's like we cannot determine there's
a connection
I I feel like this was written in uh
in an anti-inductor hotels way
that seems deeply unfair
and I'm not saying that there's nothing
to it I don't know I'm just saying that
boy you wouldn't want to see your own
name in this would you
imagine if this is you yeah and you get
on social media and you see that
somebody's accusing you of doing this
dirty work with Chinese military
scientists but the strongest word to
connect you is the word potentially
potentially they were working on coven
19.
that's really that's seriously messed up
in my opinion
might be true I mean there might be
something to it but I don't know I think
you need a little more than that to go
public
um Rasmussen de Paul on RFK Jr talk
about his chances and nearly half of
Voters have a favorable opinion of RFK
Jr
and among Democrat voters more than a
third think he could win the nomination
one-third think he could win the
nomination
that's bigger than it used to be I'll
bet
I'll bet it's grown
so far he's doing the best
um campaign that I've seen
ever
maybe ever yeah I'm good I'm gonna I'm
gonna double down I think RFK Jr is
running the best campaign that I've ever
seen
now he's doing what Vivek is doing so
you know there's those two guys have a
lot in common and it's in a good way
um
sir
uh
that's weird all right just a weird meme
um
so anyway
I've got a feeling that uh RFK Jr's
willingness to talk to anybody
his his viral videos he went down to the
border so far the expense for RFK Jr the
expense is him holding his phone out
that's his expense and travel basically
just personal travel and him talking to
his phone so he goes down to the Border
holds up his phone you know does a
selfie video
and it's very it's very good made
national news
yeah identified him with concern for the
the border which you don't expect from a
democrat in this day and age so he he
went counter to uh
counter to the Democrat profile of
trying to avoid that issue it went right
at it
so that makes news that's a man-based
dog because Democrat is not supposed to
go to the border and say it's a problem
perfect and all it cost him was travel
and he held up his phone
that was it
that he does then he does this video he
releases a video of him working out with
his shirt off
super effective it's like the thing we
all talked about as much as that stupid
submarine
right totally effective and then he goes
on every podcast including ones that are
going to give him a hard time left or
right
and the other candidates are looking
like cowards except for vague right the
vague I think is modeling I I feel like
RFK Jr might be borrowing from Vivek who
is sort of the the OG of using the
podcast as a primary push
so
great job on campaigning so I I would
expect him to keep Rising
I'll say again that my uh somebody said
I was in the bag for RFK Jr and that's
not true I'm still uh I'm still
endorsing ramaswamy now I'm a single
issue voter on fentanyl so that's that's
a big part of it but uh Robert Swami's
great and I would say that my my ideal
situation for the next presidential
election and maybe you could agree with
me the ideal situation is you're happy
no matter who wins
have you ever been in that situation
before
I was in that situation once
when uh Gore ran against Bush
I actually would have been you know
about felt about the same no matter
which one won which is why I didn't care
too much that it went to Bush right I
preferred Gore
I know you don't like him on climate
change but I always thought he was a
serious guy climate change you can have
your questions and I'll I'll give you
that
but that was that was the closest I came
to thinking that the candidates were
kind of a coin toss
now as it turns out Bush started a a
major unnecessary War
maybe Gore would not have maybe Gore
would not have
I don't know
so
but anyway I'd love you know a contest
between RFK Jr and ramaswamy
I feel pretty comfortable with the
country whichever way that went
now I'm going to give you my most
provocative thought are you ready
if you're a Democrat and you don't like
Republicans who do you want to be your
president
seems like a simple question right
you're a Democrat you don't like your
Republicans they're doing all the wrong
policy stuff
so who do you want to be your president
a Democrat right obviously obviously a
Democrat no you're wrong
that would be the dumbest way to play it
if you don't like Republicans and
they're your biggest problem you know
everything the Republicans doing is a
problem
your best case scenario is a republican
that changes the Republicans
that's your best case scenario it's
called Trump
do you remember actually a lot of you
were most of you are probably right
leaning so you don't remember this at
all but let me tell you Republicans used
to be a lot scarier
do you know that
are you aware of that Republicans used
to look like The Crazy Ones
because they seem more warlike crazy
right Trump changed that Trump turned
the Republicans into the anti-war party
he did that I think he did that alone
right and that was one of the big
reasons I liked him because he was he
was going to take some of the crazy out
of the Republicans now I'm going to
offend some of you now but it has to be
done in the interest of
you know being useful and honest it has
to be done
20 years ago
the Republicans looked a little too
religious
and by that I mean we didn't care not we
but other people didn't care what they
believed they just didn't want that
belief to become their policies they
didn't want policies that were
religiously inspired
abortion is kind of a special case
because it's sort of a life and death
situation there's nothing like it don't
make any analogies to abortion or the
Holocaust there's nothing like them
right so any any analogy to the
Holocaust or abortion just fails
immediately because they're too unique
now I'll make the same argument uh so
the argument about Trump is he took the
crazy out of the Republicans
and made me very comfortable
enjoying Republicans
I would say it changed me
because I I had always been you know
policy wise I'd always been pretty
liberal you know let people do what they
want to do but
the Republicans were scary to me because
they were saying God is telling me to do
this
and I don't like that
I don't like that
I want you to tell me why you want to do
it and give me reasons and risks and
benefits and show me the budget and tell
me what's going to break if you do it
I like that that's what Trump does Trump
tells you why he's doing it
here's why I'm doing this okay good
don't tell me that God told you to do it
then I get scared because I don't know
if your God's my God I don't know which
God you're listening to which which
demons sounding like a god is talking to
you but that's scary stuff
Trump trump got rid of all of that while
still being while still being respectful
to religion very respectful to religion
which I like I like being respectful to
religion
so I think Trump normalized the
Republican Party
that's what I think
if you had been a Democrat the best
possible president you could have had
would have been Trump and you got what
you wanted
I think now RFK Jr maybe could do the
same thing to Democrats because the
Democrats have been you know kept
captured by the actually literally
medically clinically mentally ill part
of the party there's no doubt about that
they've been captured by the mentally
ill part of the party
RFK Jr is not crazy
if he were to win
he would be the the Democrat I want to
be the president
because he would fix Democrats
you get that
he would fix Democrats I want them fixed
just like I wanted Republicans fixed
so for me
I could live with that situation even
not not lighting up with all of his
policies necessarily I don't know if I
do actually maybe I do you know if he
explained all his policies in some
detail maybe I'd like him
but it's not about policy it's just
about that we have two candidates that
can take the crazy animal sides and that
would be good
um
there's a viral video of a bunch of
Russian women and some big Gathering
dancing and celebrating in Moscow and I
think the celebrations was related to
maybe pregosian being you know pushed
away or something
but instead of uh commenting on the
politics of it the internet has decided
to comment on the weight of the women
that became the story
and the and the the reason it became a
huge comment is there were no overweight
women in this enormous crowd
there weren't any or I'll say there are
no obese women there were no obese women
in this huge gigantic crowd of women
what's up with that
do you think they're eating different
food over there
what do you think is going on
well they're definitely taking fewer
Pharma you know farmer products
that's that's a fact right America just
you know there's tons of products
um I would argue that also in America
um weight has gone through a
psychological change here
so that the uh be okay with your body
people are making a lot of progress the
the people were saying you know being
overweight is you know just a personal
choice leave me alone
they they've yeah the fat acceptance I
think fat acceptance has become normal
in America
and the the obvious predictable impact
of that would be more people saying oh
you mean I can just not work out and
people won't mock me I can just buy two
seats on the plane and that's acceptable
now and it is
I mean it's more acceptable than at any
time in history so you're always going
to get more of whatever you incentivize
and less of whatever you put some
friction on now if you're in if you're a
young woman in Moscow
do you think that if you became obese
your outcomes in life would still look
good and you think that's working out
and and nobody would mention it to you
I mean I don't know what the culture is
there but it's not clear to me if this
is because their food source is cleaner
which may it may in fact be the case
they're uh they're a prescription drug
taking is much less
Maybe
or it might be in the culture where
they're they're
incentivized to look uh let's say
incentivized to look like they're um
they're they're good for marriage
meaning they look like they can produce
children so they're healthy
yeah
could be so I don't know what it is
there's probably a number of factors but
I remember looking at the there's an old
um video that had been colorized from I
don't know 1920s or some early time in
New York and you would see thousands of
people walk by in the streets adults and
no obesity
none in all of New York City you could
just watch that video for like minutes
at a time people are walking by they're
no overweight people
so that I mean I think that has probably
mostly to do with food more than
anything
so the Russian diet uh is obscene carbs
you know the men don't seem that then do
they I don't think the men are that then
progression looks like he's a little
plump all right anyway that became a big
thing
um
I've told you that I think AI is not as
scary as other people right have you
heard me say that
the AI I think we're exaggerating the
risk from it
um Mark Andreessen has done a very long
thread and he's written about it and his
opinion is the same
that people are freaking out about AI
but it's just code and it's not going to
attack you and it doesn't want to kill
you now his argument is that code
doesn't have opinions
so it's not going to want anything
right so AI is not going to
independently want to kill you because
it didn't evolve to be competitive with
humans
right we want to kill each other because
we evolve that way with those impulses
but AI isn't going to have any you know
any uh two million years of evolution
impulses in it
it's just going to be working with the
facts
now of course it's picking up some
opinions from patterns and stuff like
that but they're not translating into I
want to kill you
in a real way now I don't think he
addressed The Accidental
hypothesis
it's not that AI will want to kill you
like it wants to compete with you and
rub you out I don't think that's a risk
honestly here's what I'd be worried
about I'd worry about an individual
weaponizing it
that's a risk right you know one
individual having the power to change
Minds anywhere in the world through
manipulating images and stuff that's
pretty scary but I don't I think we'll
figure out how to work our way through
it like we do with most things
so his opinion matches my own at the top
level some of some of the details we
might talk about but at the top level I
agree with them the AI is going to be
almost all positive
that's what I think I think almost all
positive we will have to work hard
to make sure the potential problems
don't become real problems but I feel it
will be fine this would be and I think
Mark Andreessen was pointing this out
this would be like the hundredth time
Society saw something that was going to
kill us all and then it didn't this is
probably just another one of those
probably
of course that's also exactly famous
last words
somebody always there should be an NPC
coming in at any moment now it's like
famous last words
but we're still here so nobody's been
wrong yet
nobody who said we won't all die has
ever been wrong
ever in the history of the world they've
never been wrong
share some civilizations crumbled but
not the whole world all right let's talk
about Russia and Wagner probably some
things have happened since I started the
live stream
um
and uh so here's the update there is
some kind of a plane that took off
the summer ledge might have progression
on it heading to Belarus
do you want to take bets on that
do you think that the plane that left
was carrying progosian to Belarus
put your bets down
I'm gonna say no
I'm gonna say no maybe I mean anything's
possible right if he's under arrest
you know if if let's say progression is
under the control of Putin let's say his
forces are literally standing in the
room with him then yes
then yes that might be exactly what
happened but if progression is only
surrounded by his own troops
and he got to decide what he did and
what he didn't because he was hiding
I doubt he got on a plane and went to
Belarus
that sounds
ajatia it sounds very unlikely
and here's why
that would require him to be separated
from his
um his military that's the only thing
protecting him
so do you think he would he would get on
a plane
away from the only people who can
protect them and go to another country
that's that's controlled by his Nemesis
Putin and Putin has all the assets he
needs there he can make anything happen
in Belarus and then he would go there on
a plane without his military to protect
them
and that maybe they'll follow up later
in the military will catch up with them
is that what you think
I don't think so
unless he's the dumbest
uh the dumbest you know leader of a
military and of all time
no he's definitely not going to separate
himself from his military
under these conditions
now at the same time so I'm going to bet
that he's not on the plane anybody want
to take the other bet
you want to take a bet the other way
all right now I could be wrong
and it wouldn't be I wouldn't be shocked
but it seems unlikely unless unless
there's something else about the story
that we're not told
I don't see him getting on a plane
without his military now
um I saw a report that Russia is trying
to take the heavy weapons away from
Wagner
do you think that's happening
do you think Wagner is giving up its
heavy weapons as we speak
maybe some of them
because there's some of them that were
not part of the alleged coup attempt so
maybe some of them
um when when Putin says that the Wagner
people can go to Belarus
with their leader
or they can join the military or they
could just go home to their family do
you think they feel comfortable about
that
because I saw some smart people saying
if you put the Wagner people the you
know potential coup people in with the
regular army the regular army will kill
them
because they were enemies you know a day
ago so or you know Putin will have them
killed within the context of the
military by just putting them in all the
dangerous jobs so
joining the joining the Russian military
looks like a death sentence
what about just going home to their
families
do you think Russia is just going to let
them go to the home to their families
and you know get a regular job and
I doubt it I think something bad will
happen to them
one way or the other
and if they went to Belarus
how many of them could go and they
wouldn't be bringing their heavy weapons
so if Wagner goes without having weapons
what is Wagner
Wagner isn't really anything without
heavy weapons
so
I know it looks like all bad choices for
them they're I think they're going to be
killed no matter what happens
all right so my hypothesis is still
about what happened
goes like this I think I said this on
the man cave but I'll say it to you as
well
um I think that the the intelligence
agencies for NATO
so it could be you know the British
intelligence
French American Etc
I think that they intentionally were
trying to stoke
the division between uh
pagosian and Putin because that's their
job would you agree that that would be
their job to make sure that the Russians
are fighting each other instead of
Ukraine of course so they probably they
probably exacerbated that but it
probably didn't need to be exacerbated
that much I mean it could have happened
on its own but maybe they gave it a
little push
um here's here's my speculation that has
no evidence for it if I were an
intelligence agent and I'd and I'd
gotten progression all worked up
but he didn't know what to do about
being worked up
I would give him some suggestions
and here's how I would play it I'd say
hey progression we have Assets in the
Kremlin we totally know what's going on
in that place and by the way there's a
whole bunch of generals who are going to
support you if you move if you move on
Putin that every one of them they're
just waiting for the signal the moment
you move they're going to switch sides
you won't even have to fire a shot
you'll basically just walk you roll into
Moscow all the generals flip boom you're
in charge and don't don't contact them
yourself
whatever you do whatever you do don't
try to talk to those genitals yourself
because that will be detected I mean you
can't even put one phone call to one of
these people we tell you are on your
side
because that's going to be detected so
trust us you know we have listening
listening and assets everywhere as soon
as you make your move you're going to be
massively supported by the Russian
people and by the way we will work with
you when you become the new leader and
make sure you're successful because
you're not Putin
yeah we'll we'll absolve you of your
past
actions and you'll be our guy now you
just have a successful Russia so then
progression says all right I've got a
plan they're all going to switch to my
side and he starts going and he finds
out that they lied to him that the
intelligence agents did not have any
assets in the Kremlin or at least ones
that were doing what they said and that
uh and that there was nobody going to
change besides them except maybe you
rastav vandan you know one One Small
Place
so
yes I'm making this all up
right there's no evidence to suggest it
the the reason I think it's possible or
even likely I would go as far as likely
is that that's what I would do
that's what I would do if I were in the
CIA
that's what I would do
now are you telling me that there's
nobody in the CIA who's at least as
smart as me sitting here at my desk
having never been in the CIA
it's the obvious thing to do isn't it
am I wrong that is not that it's the
obvious thing to do to tell them that
it's going to work out if they do a
civil war yeah it'll work out great
we'll help you
I mean to me it seems obvious
so it may not be what happened
but if it didn't happen then you should
have some issue with your intelligence
Services because they should have been
doing that
now am I wrong about that
check my work
they should have been doing that
I can't say they were but would you
agree they should have
everybody on the same page was should
have
at least right and more and more okay if
you agree with should have it's a very
short distance to did
very short distance
all right we've now entered what I call
the Highlander phase of the Russia
situation if you know the old movie and
TV show Highlander there were these
people called Highlanders who were
Immortal with the exception of if
another Highlander cut off their head
with a sword all their secret powers
from the one Highlander would be
transferred to the winner of the fight
and then that one would be stronger but
in the end the Highlanders would have to
kill each other until there was only one
left so their little tagline was there
could only be one
in the end there can only be one
Highlander
well in my opinion what's happening
right now is that both Putin and
pagosian are hiding as much as they can
from everybody they can because they
don't know who's got spies where
presumably pregosian has spies
don't you assume there's at least
somebody in the Inner Circle who's
talking to him I'm sure because he was
part of the Inner Circle
right he was part of the Inner Circle so
of course he has sources
so don't you think that Putin is worried
the pragosian ever knew what building he
was in and when
as long as Wagner still has heavy
weapons
that building would be vaporized and it
would be a decapitation strike
right if if progression takes out Putin
there's a reasonable argument that
progression is the next leader of Russia
it's just one one missile
do they have missiles they must have
some kind of assets that could kill them
wherever he is
now the same would be true
for percussion don't you think that
Putin has his has his winged monkeys
looking for progression baby knows where
he is but don't you think they're going
to try to find him and at least follow
him long enough to get the kill shot
whatever that looks like and they'll
blame it on somebody else but I mean
they just have to put a bullet in them
and say that oh it was a traitor one of
his own people shot him right I mean
it'd be easy to lie about it after it's
done
so it wouldn't be hard to kill him you
just have to find him so in my opinion
what's happening in Russia is that
progression is hiding as hard as he can
while looking as hard as he can for a
Putin Putin is hiding as hard as he can
while looking as hard as he can for
progression and it's just Highlander now
it's just it's down to two people
they're looking for each other they're
gonna kill the other one if they find
them
is just about whether you can hide
better than the other for as long as
possible so remember Putin is not being
seen in public and when he what he has
seen it looks like it might be recorded
so that his location is never known
so it's Highlander we're literally down
to two people trying to kill each other
if they can find them
and they both have the assets to kill
all right
I saw one report not a credible one that
the ukrainians are breaking through
everywhere
that the ukrainians have finally
successfully probed you know the line so
much and they've degraded them so much
and of course Wagner's gone maybe their
morale is lower we don't know but it
seems reasonable that it would be and uh
and maybe Ukraine is getting ready for
the big push real soon now
do I need to remind the NPCs that a
hundred percent of what you hear from
Ukraine is not reliable no matter the
source does anybody need me to do that
as speech again or can we can we skip it
this time
all right let's skip it this time
all right
um
so that's about what's happened
kind of an interesting day was it a
story I missed today
well thank you for asking Dawson I'm
having a nice Tuesday
I hope you do too
um
Highlander reviewing party yeah that
sounds fun
yeah I think this was one of my best
live streams
no doubt about it
uh Bruce Willis playing progression
uh
did you sleep well
not bad yeah I only got up at
4ish
all right
um
your assumptions were what
all right I think I've done everything I
need to do today and covered all the big
stories
and uh
I haven't seen Roseanne special so she
has a Fox Nation comedy special right
uh I just got a copy of Joshua Lisac's
new book
just got it I'm going to take a look at
that and I'll I'll give you some
opinions on that
