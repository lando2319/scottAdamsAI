up on
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization
I know you hoped we would do better by
now but after 15 million years or so
here we are but if you'd like to take
this experience to levels nobody's ever
dreamed of all you need is a copper mug
or a glass a tanker jealous of Stein a
canteen jug or flask a vessel of any
guide
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure it's a dopa Beat
hit of the day thing makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous sip
happens now go
ah I think some of you were
front-running me
I I think some of you are doing ah
before the Sip I feel like
got to work on the timing got to get
that assimulty
all right
so uh here's big news in the AI world
uh mid-journey 5.2 the newest release
it can draw hands
I've never understood why AI can't draw
hands
but I just saw a demonstration this
morning of many different hands and uh
they were amazing they were sort of
perfect
so for a while I thought you know
this AI is never going to be able to do
what I do
as a human artist
but yeah there you go now I did see an
argument today on social media somebody
said that if you use AI to write your
marketing copy
it will never be good
because marketing copy is about
surprising people and AI doesn't know
how to do that AI only knows how to do
what's been done before so surprise is
not part of its features
maybe for now
I can't imagine that'll last forever
all right I was reading an article in
Breitbart by Joel Pollock
and he was talking about a community
California Community poll results
strategies 360. and what percentage of
people do you think are considering
moving out of California
if you had to guess
40 percent
[Laughter]
40 percent of Californians are
considering moving
let me put this in context
40 of Californians are considering
moving and
at the same time
the governor of California is the
Democrats second best guy
both true
40 of the people want to get the
out of his state
and he's their second best guy for
president
Biden's number one of course
he's the second best guy
isn't that amazing that my head almost
can't hold those ideas at the same time
yeah
well according to them he according to
Democrats he's the second best guy
RFK Jr we'll talk about him he might be
the actual
best guy we'll find out
um
yeah but the reason people want to leave
I guess a lot of them because of state's
policies but a lot of them because it's
expensive
and uh
if you're a republican you're three
times more likely to want to leave
because of the policies
but I got to tell you every time
somebody leaves California
I just think of them suffering
because you know I've lived in
California my entire adult life but
until I lived in California I lived in
Upstate New York
do you know how you feel when you walk
outdoors in Upstate New York
what's the word what's the word you feel
when you walk Outdoors
pain pain yeah some call it cold
but it's just pain
and what happens if you walk outdoors in
let's say Florida
in July Florida in July
how's that feel
well what would you describe that
feeling
pain it's pain
you can call it humidity you could call
it uncomfortable heat but it's just pain
it's just pain it hurts to walk to the
car
do you know how often I'm in pain in
California because I went Outdoors
sometimes like when the forest fires are
there it's kind of unpleasant you know
if the sky's all cloudy but mostly
mostly you can walk outdoors with your
short sleeve shirt pretty much anytime
you want for a little at least a little
while you might not want to stay there
but
it is really tough to beat that it's
really tough like for the last month I
would say for a solid month
every single day has been sunny and room
temperature
I think 80 is the highest it's been
I've been leaving my my doors of my
house open just all day long
because the indoor and the outdoor
temperature are the same
do you have that where you are
I don't know that's my commercial for
California it's the weather
um
so RFK Jr is uh let's say added some
Nuance to his opinion about nuclear
energy
I had thought he was a little bit
negative about it
but he's he's giving a much smarter take
on it smarter because he's acting like
he's open to it if it can be economical
and safe
so his current statement is uh I'm all
for nuclear energy if it can be made
safe and if it can be made economically
competitive
which is brilliant
that's really the very best framing for
a Democrat because he's basically saying
I agree with everything you say
can you do it
which is kind of Genius everything you
say about nuclear absolutely can you do
it
Shelby you can do it
show me you can build it cheap enough
show me you can make it safe
that I'm all for it it's an excellent
framing now part of his argument is you
can't get insurance which would be an
indication that it's not economical
because the insurance company would
surely want to sell you insurance
uh if you had a you know business with a
reasonable risk
however I say to myself this I think
there are some things that should not be
insured by Private Industry
and nuclear energy would be the top of
the list
I don't think that a private company
really wants to take that chance see
that they have What's called the reverse
IBM problem
the reverse IBM problem goes like this
and I've told you this story before in
the 70s or so when I was negotiating
contracts for technology for a big Bank
IBM
would offer their their Bid And I'd look
at the other bids from other companies
and if you if you picked IBM and
everything went wrong which was very
rare because IBM made sure everything
didn't go wrong that's why people picked
them but if you if you picked IBM
nobody would say you were an idiot if
anything went wrong because you still
picked the best company
but if you pick something that's not IBM
this is in the 70s
and it goes wrong
everybody who's going to second-guess
you says uh really so you didn't buy IBM
and then things went wrong well you're
fired because you should have just
bought IBM because everybody knows
that's the one where things don't go
wrong or if it does they fix it which
they actually did their reputation was
stellar
um
so but it's a reverse problem with
nuclear let's say you're an insurance
company
and you ensure a nuclear site and a
catastrophe happens there's no way in
the world you can explain that to the
public or your investors your investors
will say well everybody knew it was
dangerous what the hell are you doing
even if it isn't
right first of all everybody would act
like they knew exactly what the risks
were like as if they did so
that's the perfect situation for the
government to be the insurer and could
even make a profit I would think
don't you think the government could
ensure all nuclear facilities and
actually make a profit on it as long as
they were as long as they were at least
generation three which has never had a
never had a death associated with it
um
and it gets built you know in a timely
fashion and whatever
so it seems to me these are all really
solvable problems
but they're not solved
I mean they're not exactly solved I
think the safety thing is pretty much
taken care of but you know you know the
one thing he didn't mention
What's missing
um all for nuclear energy if it could be
made safe and if it can be made
economically competitive there's
something he you yeah he usually
mentions nuclear waste didn't he
I feel like in the past he's mentioned
waste
but people who have been updated to the
most current knowledge about nuclear
know that that's largely been solved all
they do is store it on site where it was
created they just put it in barrels and
just leave it there it turns out you can
put it in a barrel
and just leave it
and everything's fine you don't have to
transport it you don't have to put it in
somebody else's backyard and the and
wherever your nuclear plant is the
people around there have sort of gotten
used to it
so it's largely a solved problem
anyway it's good to see him evolving on
that or at least evolving his rhetoric
you did that well did everybody see the
meme of him of RFK Jr with his shirt off
at an outdoor gym
how many of you saw that it was just
everywhere on social media yesterday I
think I saw it 100 times
all right so the you know the story
there you have to see the picture his
chest and arms are so ripped yeah I mean
it looks like the Incredible Hulk
smaller size
I think he's like six two though so he's
a big guy
um
yeah so he's uh his 70th birthday is
coming out I don't know when but you
know he's 69. he's almost 70 and he's
absolutely ripped
his body looks like a 25 year old who's
been at the gym every day
uh
so and what's funny is
what's funny is you think that that
would have no impact on anybody's voting
preferences
but it totally does
the the people on the political right
were saying well there's a man right
there's there's a guy who understands
the men should be in shape they should
be able to handle themselves they should
take care so a lot of the Republicans
were saying oh we got a role model
finally finally have a role model who
who appreciates good health
which by the way is something I've said
about Biden because it's always good to
say something good
about somebody that you maybe disagree
with other stuff makes you sound
incredible and I've always said that
Biden's a good role model for Fitness
always kept his weight good I think he's
a lifelong exerciser I've always
appreciated that about him
um and Trump trump is maybe the worst
case scenario for personal health
so another one another good one is uh
Vivek ramaswamy I mean he's young so
he's got that going for him but vervexa
he's a gym guy tennis player he's in
Gray shape I I love the fact that at
least some of the candidates are in
great shape and
that helps
um
there is a uh a Harvard
Professor who is an expert on honesty
research so it works for Harvard expert
on the subject of honesty
uh has been let go because uh
she may have fabricated research data in
as many as 135 studies including the one
on honesty
okay
now I saw a comment from on Twitter
where somebody had referred to as a as a
Democrat and somebody pushed back and
said
there's no that's not the story
the story doesn't say she's a Democrat
no no the story doesn't say she's a
Democrat it does say she's a woman who
works at Harvard who lied on 135 studies
potentially
I don't know what the odds of being a
Democrat are in that situation
but it's not a coin flip if you know
what I mean
all right well that was funny that's a
little story but it's funny
uh do you ever have do you ever have
this situation where there's there's a
topic that you've been arguing about for
you know days or weeks and then somebody
comes in with a comment
that you didn't think of it just ruined
your whole two weeks because everything
you should have said should have just
been that
right so now I would like you to erase
from your memory everything I've ever
said on the topic of whether RFK Jr
should have a debate with Dr Hotes over
vaccinations
forget everything I've said about it and
I would like you to replace it with this
far superior opinion that I saw on
Twitter
this is a Jeff Pilkington uh tweet
who has some really good really good
tweets because he's good at seeing both
sides of the political situation
all right now think it just imagine how
stupid I felt when I read this
he uh so Jeff says regarding vaccines at
a debate the reason the left generally
doesn't want to debate on this topic is
simply because there's no issue with
vaccines on the left
how do you debate something you don't
have an issue with
what is wrong with my brain
what is wrong with my brain how did I
not see the obvious
are you kidding me
of course they don't want to debate it
would be stupid they got everything they
want
the the team that already has everything
they want and it's not going to be taken
away
why in the world would they debate
it doesn't make any sense at all and
he'd hear people like me were like well
debate is just obvious of course you do
why wouldn't you it's good for the
public everybody likes a good debate
everybody likes better knowledge
everybody wants to get the right answer
so of course debate is good
no the team that has everything they
want and it's not going to be taken away
they're not going to debate you not ever
so I I kept thinking in my mind my
stupid stupid stupid mind I kept
thinking that we were this close to
having a debate like ah any minute if we
just put a little more pressure on that
debate's gonna happen any minute now no
no there's no chance of a debate there's
no chance
it can only be bad for them they have no
upside because they've already won
everything they can only lose why would
you do that
now how many of you are having the same
feeling right now
that you're feeling stupid that you
thought there would ever be a debate
don't you feel stupid
as soon as you hear this better Point
all of all of the other points you've
made about it just feel stupid
I love this I like I love I love the
total mind of finding out wrong
you've been
it's kind of an interesting
experience just to be that wrong for
that long
anyway well thanks for joining me and
being wrong for at least for some of you
well because of this Russian coup that
we'll talk about of course
um if it was a coup and not a psyop you
know you know could have been a psyop
we'll talk about that
but I'm still seeing today as I've seen
just about every day for a long time
somebody claiming that the j6 January 6
situation was a coup
now
prior to this Wagner situation in Russia
he astounded stupid to say that people
occupying a building and not taking any
weapons out of their pockets at least
guns
that they thought it was a coup
that that little group of people thought
they could conquer the whole country
by walking around in a building for a
while
and I thought well that's pretty absurd
and so when people would argue it I
would of course point out that it was
stupid and then they would always say
but but but there were guns nearby there
were guns nearby
that doesn't really help your point
that that's not helping your point and
then there but but there were some
people there who didn't want to
overthrow the government
yes
probably in every crowd
do you know where else there are some
people in the crowd who want to
overthrow the government right away
uh New Year's Eve
New Year's Eve when the ball's coming
down
big crowd there's some murderers in
there there's some pedophiles and
there's some insurrectionists guarantee
it because it's a big crowd you could be
sure there are all those people are
there but we don't really say well
there's that there's that New Year's Eve
crowd in Times Square that's a bunch of
murdering pedophiles
well why don't we say that I'm sure
there were murderers of the group
I'm sure there were people who had done
every kind of sex scribe so why don't we
say it's a whole bunch of sex crime
people uh appearing in well because it
would be stupid you don't judge the hole
by some few people
yeah
uh we're gonna get rid of the co-sters
coopester
the the double there's a I'm still
getting some people who are defending
January 6 as a uh an actual coup now so
here is my point
so I've held I've held for a long time
that people were wrong about their
characterization of January 6. but after
watching the actual you know what an
actual at least the beginning of a coup
would look like with tanks and shooting
them helicopters and
now when somebody says that they think
January 6 was a coup
I feel bad for them
like no joke I just feel oh
I'm sorry I'm sorry that happened to you
because these are really victims and I
mean that not in a political sense I
mean that in a medical sense medically
speaking these are victims because
they've been sold something that's not
real and now it's become part of their
psyche that's a mental problem
so they've actually been assigned a
mental Problem by the Democrat press
propaganda machine they've actually been
assigned a medical problem and they
accepted it all right medical problem
mental problem I accept
if you say if you say so
all right
well let's talk about this little uh
Wagner situation and progression and
marching on Moscow and turning back and
all that stuff you probably know all the
details I don't need to go over the
details I'm sure you follow the news
enough to know
that Putin made a deal with progression
to go to Belarus
and then Wagner will be you know most of
it absorbed into the regular military
and then apparently I'm not sure this
part is true
not sure this part is true but allegedly
um
uh allegedly Putin is going to fire the
two generals that progression wanted
fired
do we have a confirmation on that
because I'm not so sure about that I
mean I read it in the news but I'm not
convinced maybe maybe yes maybe no I
don't think it's important all right so
let me give you my best takes worst
takes take
I'm going to tell you which takes I
think are the most uh insanely
ridiculous
some of these will be your takes
don't get too bad at me we're still in
the fog of War right so if you've got a
bad take today about that
join the crowd I'm pretty sure all of
our tanks are bad
can we agree on that can we agree that
whatever happened there we'll never know
we'll never know what happens we will
never ever know what actually happened
there's no way there's not the slightest
chance we'll ever know
so would you agree that all of my takes
should be bad under those conditions
can you agree that all my takes are bad
so you don't have to rumble about it
while I'm talking okay all of my takes
are bad but here are the other takes
that I think are bad because I think all
of our takes for bad like we're all in
the same boat just a bunch of bad takes
all right number one
um
how many of you believe
that
that that's the actual thing that's
going to happen
that progression is actually just going
to go to Belarus
and and live his life similar to the
family dog who went to the the farm to
live Adam's life didn't die no the dog
didn't die it went to the farm in the
country it's living there happily now
right how many of you think he's going
to be allowed to take his military uh
including their heavy equipment with
them to Belarus
do you think do you think that's going
to happen
okay so so here's bad take number one
is that what happened was that Putin
gave progression Belarus
because Belarus is weak and uh Wagner is
strong and he'll just bring his military
there and basically he'll just take over
Belarus and uh and then maybe Putin will
have a strong partner in Belarus because
really Putin in progression have always
been friends and there's there was
nothing like a real coup that happened
it was just maybe a maybe an OP of some
kind
how many of you believe that Wagner will
be allowed to take his military to
Belarus
you know that's crazy right
it's crazy
there isn't the slightest chance not
even the smallest chance that you will
take his full military there he might
need to he might need some number of
people who are his personal protection
that might happen
yeah maybe there's some scaled down
something or other but he's not going to
be bringing with him the kind of
Firepower that would take over a Belarus
how many disagree
is there anybody who thinks he's going
to take over a Belarus or that he's the
de facto ruler of Belarus now
there's not even a chance of that not
even the slightest chance
yeah so all right good so most of you
don't believe that
um how many of you believe that the
missing 6.2 billion dollars is part of
this story
that that that goes a long way to
explaining who's doing what over there
how many think that's part of this story
I see some mixed bags some yeses and
no's
I'm going to say I wouldn't rule it out
because I don't know one way or the
other
but here's here's the smarter take on
that
money is fungible
did you know that
like if you gave me a dollar I I could
spend it on a piece of candy where I
could buy some gas with it
right
the 6.2 billion dollars
is a concept
it's not an important one
if if the U.S wanted to bribe somebody
they don't need that special secret
budget they just use the regular budget
if the CIA wants to you know bribe
somebody they don't need any hidden 6.2
billion dollars they got lots of ways to
do it you know just lots of normal ways
so although it's not impossible that the
62 6.2 billion that was missing or
recently found or whatever it was it's
not impossible to have something to do
with the story
but I would say it's unlikely
I would say it's unlikely
because the the American NATO side
doesn't need any extra special budget to
do anything
they have all the money they need to do
whatever they need secretly or not
secretly so they wouldn't need any
tricks
they'd have everything they need
so I don't buy that although I wouldn't
rule it out I wouldn't rule it out it
just seems that it doesn't make sense in
the world of budgeting right I did
budgeting for a living for years in the
big corporations and that's the first
thing you learn is that the the budget
items are not real
they're just conceptual so you could
take from this budget and put it in that
budget take from this budget put in that
budget so budgets aren't real they're
just sort of little guidelines
so forget about the 6.2 there was plenty
a million with plenty of money to do
anything they wanted to do with or
without it
all right next uh
next bad take is that uh Putin and uh
progosian have reached an agreement
how many how many think they've reached
an agreement
does anybody believe that
and if they reach the agreement do you
think that either one of them plans to
keep it
apparently Russian agreement is an
oxymoron
yeah I think even the Russians might
admit that
at this level you know at the at the
political level or military political
level a promise doesn't mean anything
that that a Russian agreement in writing
verbal
nothing it doesn't have any zero value
so the entire story is about two guys
that made a Russian agreement
that's what the Press told us
pressed all this hey it's all over two
Russian guys made an agreement
that's nothing
that's literally nothing
how about the idea that it's over
do you believe it's over
of course that is not over until one of
them is dead because they can't both
live
and it looks like it's going to be
progression who's going to be dead of
course he's going to be dead it might
take a month
might take two months
right but he's dead
all right
so
does it make any sense to you that
Wagner made an agreement and that that
this was the agreement
the agreement was that they would get a
couple of people fired
but those firings wouldn't really have
much to do with them because they
wouldn't be in the war anymore
so they'd solve a problem that was
irrelevant to them
because they're no longer fighting that
war
um but also we are led to believe that
progosian and all of the Wagner people
agreed to a deal which guarantees they
will die
that's what we're told they agreed to a
deal that guarantees their own death
because progression is going to be
killed in Belarus as soon as he's
stripped of his military
as soon as his military is now
surrounding him
he gets poisoned
falls off a balcony
now what about all those Wagner people
who are going to be absorbed into the
regular Russian military
well I saw one military person explain
it this way
the the regular soldiers
when they see the stink of the Wagner on
this person
you could say hey yeah you're what
you're one of us hey welcome to the unit
all right your job will be to check for
mines
uh no you won't have any equipment
um not equipment just feel around
just go out there what do you mean
you're not going to do your job no you
are going to do your job
well you're not going to go out and
check your minds with your bare hands
well
boom
sorry I guess we gotta kill you
so the idea is that the Wagner guys will
get all of the most dangerous worst
assignments until they die or Revolt or
get fragged or something so basically
they're all dead
or wish they would be
right so do you think that Wagner agreed
to a deal that guarantees that all of
their deaths
I know
I know I so whatever happened I don't
believe that uh
progression had any
any intention of keeping his side
now if progression is going to Belarus
we'd probably see some preparations
because you'd think it would happen
pretty quickly right
has anybody seen progression today
um is he making a videos
do we know where his military is
I think he's already in hiding right
he's probably already hiding
do you think he's not already trying to
figure out how to kill Putin to
assassinate him looking for somebody on
the inside it might do it for him
of course he is of course he is
he I don't think he'll succeed but of
course he is
do you think Putin's already planning to
have him killed if they can find him and
he's probably he's probably already in
hiding and not in Belarus either
yeah he's probably in hiding my guess is
you're not going to hear from him again
you may never hear from them again he
may simply already have disappeared he
might already be dead you wouldn't know
all right
so I do not believe that the Wagner
people agreed to go into the kill box
all right here's the deal if you'll give
us what we want we'll go into the kill
box
oh no they did not agree to that
um
so the next question is was it a psyop
was it a psyop and it was never a real
um
a real thing
how many think it was a psyop
you have to be brave to say yes to this
since you know I'm going to be talking
about the the worst takes
haven't ruled it out
I suppose it would depend it would
depend on your definition of a psyop
the the people who said it was a plan to
find out who the Traders are
I think that's the least likely
possibility
because you wouldn't do this
just to find some Traders there are
other ways to do it like every other way
to do it you wouldn't do it this way now
I'm not even going to get into the
details of why you wouldn't do it this
way but you don't have you don't have
your uh
most important military person
come out in public and say that the
reason for the war was you
don't need to be there
you wouldn't do that as part of an op
and the reason you wouldn't do that is
you could do other things that might
make it look credible without giving
away the main narratives that you're
trying to protect
if it were the only way to do the op
then I would say well maybe it was the
only way they could do it so even though
they didn't want to change the narrative
maybe they took a chance because it was
just the only way to do it
but it wasn't the only way to do it it
wasn't the only way to do anything
so I can't I can't wrap my head around
the possibility that they would give up
the main thing that would cause good
morale among their troops
the main thing is that they have to they
have to think there's a reason they're
fighting
and progression took a re took away the
reason for fighting the reason they're
not protecting Russia nothing was at
risk
there's no reason
there's no way in hell
that Putin and pagosian said all right
here's the deal you're going to say that
the whole reason I invaded this country
is
and then I'm going to pretend like I'm
mad at you and you're going to do a fake
coup
you're going to shoot down some of our
helicopters but just you know limit it
to seven
does any of that sound like that was a
real psyop
now add to that the fact that we're
we're hearing the news today
if you can believe the news Washington
Post
um that our spies the U.S spies knew
that
progression was going to act militarily
against the government we've known it
for weeks
do you think if we've known it for weeks
that he was going to do it that it was a
psyop
we've known it for weeks
no I feel like we would know if it was a
psyop if we were new somehow we had good
enough sources that we knew he was going
to do it
we'd probably know everything about it
or a lot about it
all right so I I think the odds that it
was a fake coup uh would be super low
super low
I suppose anything's possible but super
low odds that it was a psyop I saw Elon
Musk mocking that idea with a meme
yesterday
you wake up in the morning it's another
psyop although I'm not sure he was
mocking it or saying it might have been
because remember you know how parody and
reality of merged as soon as I said he
was mocking it I realized
no I can't be sure he might actually
think it was a psyop
I mean I don't know I'd be surprised if
he thought that but hey maybe
all right let's see other bad takes
um
Russia is done for so here's the takeout
seen on social media Russia's done you
know the government's going to fold the
country is going to collapse
to which I say
what
I didn't say anything like that
to me it looked like the strongest
military in Russia
took a run at something that was at
least threatening to be a coup
and Putin squashed it with a few threats
now I saw a report that didn't have any
sources so I don't believe it but if you
were Putin
wouldn't you have the names of all the
family members of the of at least the
leadership of Wagner
wouldn't you know where their grandma
lived and where their cousins and their
kids lived
and don't you think they were all
rounded up
don't you think Putin said hey
progression are your generals there are
you are your Colonels and everybody
there I want to read the names of their
family members
and then he just reads the names of
their family members and their addresses
all right let's say yeah this is a
colonel uh Victor Bobo let's say your
wife is blah blah blah your sister is
your brother is your father is and then
you just give them all their addresses
let's see after the that's the end of
the coup
all you have to do is give them their
names and addresses so you know that
that Putin knows exactly where they live
and who they are and they turn around
and I think that's probably what
happened honestly I think probably that
they actually
given that you know there's a
possibility that they actually agreed to
go in the kill box the only reason you
would agree to go in a kill box
just to save your own family
right to save your own family you
actually would agree to go in the kill
box
that's the one time you would do it
so it certainly looks like that I you
know I'm only speculating I can't now
but it looks like
Putin just said if you leave now
everybody gets to live at least
temporarily
if you take one foot into Moscow
I'm going to start killing your family
one at a time
I think that got him to turn around now
I don't think they I don't think
progression has agreed to go to Belarus
really I think he's going to run
but yeah I bought him time just to act
as if he was
all right
um
there's a take that says that Putin
didn't handle it well
you didn't do a good job of managing the
the coup that's not what I saw
I I thought Putin handled it like the
best dictator ever
when when
progressions troops rolled into rastav
and Don and they were they got no
resistance
do you think that was because
um all the people there were on their
side
or was it just a bunch of Russian
military people and the and when the
public sees Russian military in the
context of having a war with Ukraine
they just treat them as Heroes
and maybe that was it and maybe the
military was ordered not to engage
if what Putin did was tell everybody to
not engage
or at least not engage much I think
there was some helicopter action there
but don't engage much until they get to
the border of Moscow because they're
going to get crushed if they enter
Moscow
so you could kind of let everybody else
just stand down
let them be totally Exposed on in order
to get to Moscow there was apparently
huge amounts of open space where you
can't hide
so basically Putin could have just kept
them outside of Moscow and then picked
them all off from the air
with no real risk I mean he'd lose some
assets but you'd certainly get it done
so Putin was never even even in a little
bit of trouble
when when I was looking at it early in
the
early in the coup
I said you couldn't know who would win
but that was based on one variable that
we didn't know about
the one variable is how many people
would join the the insurrection
if and there was no way for me to know
from my perspective if it turned out
that a whole bunch of lower generals
were totally in on this deal
well it might have worked
but if they were not it didn't have any
chance so basically the only way it
could have worked was you know mass
defections of pretty high ranking people
and maybe progression thought he would
guess some maybe some people promised
just to play up play both sides of
things and then didn't come through
Maybe
but what it looks like at the moment is
that there was never any rest any risk
when I heard the number of troops that
Wagner had to attack Moscow
it would be something like
I don't know one percent of what you
would need
did anybody see the actual numbers of
what what you needed to take a city like
Moscow the numbers you would need I
think they came there with like one
percent of what they would need to get
it done
it was something was somewhere in that
neighborhood like a ridiculously not
even close number
so unless unless the population joined
them which didn't happen
uh there was nothing there and I'm not
even sure that Russian people were ever
concerned about this
did you see the pictures of the the
Wagner group uh they were you know on
the sidewalk with their machine guns I
think they were just moving into rostov
on on Don and then there was a cleaning
lady Street leading lady with a broom
who's standing like 30 feet behind the
people with the machine guns and she's
just doing her job of sweeping the
street
and and all of the other Russians were
just sort of hanging out taking pictures
nobody took it seriously
I don't believe there was anybody in
Russia who thought the Russians were
going to kill each other
and then they were right I mean minus
some helicopters apparently but but once
once the Russian military
was on the ground with a bunch of
civilians the fact that the civilians
treated them like it wasn't the coup
may have actually stopped the coup
because this is one of the tricks I
teach you if you get in trouble you just
don't accept the frame of the person
who's giving you the trouble
so these civilians they never accepted
the frame that there was a coup
they just it was just business as usual
which to me is the most funny thing
about it because it's as if the
population knew it wasn't real
real isn't that the the feeling you got
I never got a sense that there was any
Russian citizen who was ever worried
even a little bit
so it was never a close to actually
being a successful coup because the one
thing we didn't know about just wasn't
true that a lot of people would join
them
so
uh let's see what else is bad idea here
um
do you think that Putin gave too much
some people say Putin is weakened
forever
because uh even though he stopped
the coup and even though he banned the
guy or he'll kill him soon
that he did fire the two people that the
guy wanted fired progression one fired
and therefore he caved and now he's weak
do you buy that
I don't
because nobody nobody in Russia cares if
he fires his generals
how many generals has he fired just
since the Ukraine war started he's fired
like six top generals or something four
four to six
is it it's just that it was just a
Tuesday
firing his two top war generals is just
a Tuesday for Ukraine for Russia happens
all the time
I don't think any I don't think he had
any
impact on anything
do you think there's that NATO is
thinking themselves well we thought he
was strong but he fired those two
generals
now we've got our chance no
no nothing has changed it changed
absolutely nothing it's just something
for people in the press to talk about
yeah to sound smart oh he's degraded his
power there will be other challenges to
him no who's going to challenge him he
just squashed the Wagner group
he squashed the Wagner group with a
phone call
that looks pretty strong to me
if you could stop a coup with a phone
call
all right here's a
um
CNN's take
Oliver Darcy now I always like reading
Oliver Darcy because there's some people
you think are not even trying to be
independent thinkers they're really just
yeah on the party line and they're not
going to budge
so he's one of those
um
he says one notable thing about this
rapidly developing International story
talk about Russia
since Elon Musk took a sledgehammer to
Twitter's verification system the
platform is far less useful during
breaking news events and so people are
depending on traditional newsrooms for
verifiable information
was that of your experience
was your experience they had to rely on
the platforms for your good information
I listened to Mario uh Mario's spaces
that was on for like I don't know hours
and hours during the thing and
and they were looking at all the
different sources
so they were saying oh there's a report
from The Source or there's a report from
telegram now they were very clear to say
which which sources you know were
dependable and it was turns out most of
them were not
um
okay I just saw a comment that's making
me crazy but I'm going to ignore it for
a moment
um
so my experience was the opposite
so when I knew that something was going
on I immediately turned on CNN and they
were talking about the submarine
so I went to so I went to Twitter and I
started getting good information and I
thought well by now CNN is caught up so
I went to CNN and it was a commercial
so all right commercial so I'd go back
to social media I get all this new
information and stuff and I say okay by
now CNN has it so I'd go back
it was a submarine
goodbye happy accidents
goodbye
you
there's just some people who tried to
get blocked so I'm giving them their way
good for you you're all gone now
all right
um but I would say I would say that once
CNN and Fox News and the rest caught up
that I did catch up with them news but I
don't think they had any news they
hadn't seen already
so I would say CNN was not really
additive on this situation
all right uh Trump is doing his trumpy
thing talking about hunters
so-called bribery alleged Scandal and
he he read the WhatsApp message from
Hunter
and he and he did a mock acting like he
was impressed by the by that Hunter
Biden was tougher than he thought
because you know the messages
threatening the Chinese guy if he didn't
pay him money
he goes oh he's tougher than I thought
now Newt Gingrich thinks that the the
Biden uh you know potential bribery
allegations
almost guarantee a Republican president
and it would be Trump what do you think
do you think that the Biden
Revelations will make any difference to
the election because I don't
I don't think it'll make any difference
at all
yeah and it's always the same reason
either the Democrats won't we hear about
it or won't believe it
and but they will believe that Trump is
the devil incarnate
because they were told so
so I don't know that any of this matters
anymore I'm not I think we're in a post
post-factual World in term at least in
terms of politics where I don't think
the truth or the facts really matter too
much to anybody at this point
all right
um
how about how many
Democrats do you think are aware of
Hunter Biden's WhatsApp messages
like so it was a big story on the the
right-leaning universe
I kind of Wonder I think it might be
zero you know close to zero not zero but
very low I mean you always have Jake
Tapper he probably knows
yeah
all right
um
I saw somebody uh asked the question how
can you spot an NPC a non-player
character so if if we're a big
simulation
if this is a simulation or reality that
means that some of the characters are
not players they're just sort of scenery
NPCs
how could you identify them I I may have
told you this trick before
but they don't have stories
that's that's the way I I identify them
they can't tell the story
if you went to me and said Scott
tell me a story about the time you
succeeded at something I'd have several
tell me about a time you were
embarrassed
several stories
tell me tell me about a time you nearly
died
several several stories
you could you could give me almost any
topic and I can give you a story
but have you have you met people who
can't tell you a story
so you say something all right tell me
tell me a story about something that
like you really enjoyed
um
oh
can't uh
um well I uh I can't um I've uh
and they just can't do it
and my
my speculation is
is because they didn't have any history
that if you're a player
you can tell the story because you're
just recounting something to happen to
you
but if you're an NPC you don't have a
history
nothing happened to you you're just
walking around like scenery the whole
time
all right well I just put that out there
if you see somebody who is unable to
recount a story of their own life
you should be suspicious
no that's different from not liking to
tell stories if you are capable of
telling a story but you don't like it
you're still a player
all right all right I don't think
anybody has agency but that's just me
ladies and gentlemen
is there a story I missed is there
anything I should be talking about that
I'm not
what are you talking about Scott uh just
Google NPC you'll see what's going on
um you disagree
yeah Adam Rich actor from Eight is
Enough died from fentanyl overdose
I'm getting a little bit tired of the
fentanyl overdose stories
I finally woke up
I could never tell if you're being
serious
uh
foreign policy speech no
do you think about candida I don't know
what that is
uh Wagner Wagner admitted to election
meddling in 2016.
well we knew that there so progression
owned that that troll Factory
which was a total hoax
right so we were told that the uh that
Russia was
interfering on social media but then if
you actually look at the memes
some of them are pro uh Hillary and some
of them are pro-trump so first of all
it's not even clear they had a specific
agenda secondly if you look at the memes
they're so weak
they're so weak the memes they had no
impact on anything and I didn't even see
any of them so there's no chassis at an
actual impact but interfering it I mean
he attempted to interfere so you could
call that interference but interfering
in any way that mattered no there's no
evidence that any of it mattered
some people think this stuff growing on
your tongue controls your actions
could steroids hurt your voice box I
don't know
I need to see a speech
do you think progression was dumb enough
to kick off a bad coup
uh no I think that progression believes
that he could pull it off
and then something changed because
remember in a coup I mean you can plan
but things are going to happen and I
think the part that didn't that didn't
materialize is people taking aside
so I think that's the part that didn't
materialize just a guess so now I don't
think that I don't think the fact that
the coup didn't look like it could work
at least on paper
doesn't look like it could have worked I
don't think that means it was a psyop
because again it would be the dumbest
sign up anybody ever did
it just means there's something we don't
know about it
see what I my my speculation is that
Putin rounded up their families
and I I think that that may have been
just a blind spot you know maybe
progression just didn't just didn't see
that happening
by the way this is the same argument for
why uh the Second Amendment is important
despite the fact that the military of
the country has bigger weapons
because if there were ever some kind of
you know dictator takeover and it was
supported by some military group of
Americans the first thing the Americans
would do is round up their families
they're not going to fight directly
against the military they're going to go
get your cousin and your brother and
your mother and your grandmother and
then they're going to shoot them one at
a time until until we get the country
back
that's what's going to happen
now I can tell you that will happen
because I'll probably be an underground
leader if that happens
and that's what I would order
those would be my orders round up their
families
as horrible as that is
is war you do what you got to do
so yeah
um
you wouldn't kill their families well
then you will be killed yourself you
always have a choice
I'd threaten them I wouldn't kill him
um
I thought it wasn't War anymore yeah I
would still say that Ukraine is over in
terms of a war
I think it's largely over I think both
sides want to negotiate but they're just
you know trying to get a little extra
leg up I think the ukrainians are still
probing the Russian defense
see if there's any holes there
do you do you think that having
progosian gone will have a big effect on
the military effectiveness
you do I'm going to say no
because first of all progression was an
offensive force and the Russians aren't
looking to be as offensive you know
except artillery and planes and stuff it
looks like they're more of a defensive
military and I've I'm coming to the
belief that the Wagner group was more PR
than effective
that because progression got the most
attention
we came to see them as the fiercest
Fighters making the most difference
there's no real proof of that
there's no real proof and a hundred
percent of what top Russians say is
always a lie
so where do where do we know these
Wagner groups were the extra special bad
ones
I don't know I think progression told us
so I'm not sure that they were ever as
bad as or or as effect I don't think
they were ever as effective
as it was presented and I think that you
could take them completely out of the
war which just happened they basically
got completely taken out of the war and
there'll be no difference I'll bet you
don't see any difference at all
uh well I believe progression's coup
statements
did I say I did
I say I believe believed anything he
said
I don't believe that happened
all right uh
Wagner drawing Ukraine into making
mistake
see so some of you think the psyop
was designed to make Ukraine think that
they had an easy time and then lead
their soldiers into a kill box
that wouldn't be a very good plan
really going to fight I would bet
against it actually
I bet against it but it's very possible
I mean it could be like a 50 chance I
just don't think that when it comes
right down to it they're gonna
put on the uh tight shorts and
start duking it out I just don't see it
all right
uh let's fight between those two it
would be fun to watch
I believe it's Trump Oaks is still
do you do I think uh Rogan believes the
Trump hoaxes well there were probably
something specific
that Rogan had a problem with
but I don't know what that was
uh
mocking some mockers
uh
progression didn't say Putin would go
after his family sounds like a bad take
now that the take is not based on any
information from the news
the take is based on what's obvious
are you telling me that if you were
Putin you would not have rounded up
their families
you can't tell me that
seriously
of course you would it would be the
first thing you did that's like top of
the list of course you would
um
you retweeted it yesterday what was it
uh metaverse people don't have links
you know I was also wondering if the
increase in Bitcoin was related to
anything happening in Russia
has anybody speculated that yet do you
see Bitcoin sort of zoomed in the last
few days
made me wonder did somebody need to buy
a bunch of Bitcoin
to bribe somebody
Maybe
you know
BlackRock you say
you're telling me they wouldn't secure
their families no how could they how
could they secure their families
like where they weren't unless they were
with them like in the military they
can't secure them against what unless
they left the country and then that
would be suspicious too
uh oh BlackRock is starting a Bitcoin
ETF oh is that what happened BlackRock
started a Bitcoin ETF
well that would do it
Maggie going after the Patriot front oh
is that a real thing
oh you have to send me that video
somebody says there's video of Mega
people going after the Patriot front to
try to find out their feds probably
oh yeah you gotta show me that
you think BlackRock is collapsing
I'll bet against that
all right
Biden attitude in the White House
a lesson in mockings okay I'm not going
to give you a lesson in mockings and
mockers in New York City
yeah you know I can't do retail requests
right
you know there are thousands of you you
can't all ask you can't use this to ask
me for favors
it's not going to work very well
I mean I'm happy to help what I can but
this isn't really the the retail favor
uh platform like hey I think I can get
that guy to do me a favor if I just
shout it like lots of times in the
comments just lots of times
and then he'll just do me a favor
probably not
all right uh that's all I got for now
I'm gonna uh let's see something
probably gonna do a man cave tonight
best thing in the world by the way you
uh people on uh on YouTube if you
haven't seen the Dilbert Reborn
comic the spicier version
uh you can see it on Twitter
if you subscribe to me or if you want to
see that and lots more including my
other comic robust read news you want to
go to the locals platform
scottadams.locals
prediction RFK will take out Newsom
Maybe
could happen
all right
um
that's all for now and I'll talk to you
later YouTube
