highlight of civilization and happy
Martin Luther King Day
I'm sure all of you are celebrating in
an appropriate way
in a moment we'll be drinking some black
coffee
I think that's how you celebrate I don't
know I'm not up on my traditions but
that's the way we're going to do it or
the way I'm going to do it you could add
cream and sugar if you want
but if you'd like to take it up to a
full Martin Luther King extraordinary
situation all you need is
a copper bug or a glass detector
jealousy style the canteen Joker flask
vessel of the decaying fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure It's So Dope for being here
today thing makes everything better it's
cold
the simultaneous
MLK special version go
yep that was good yeah that was some
good stuff good stuff
now I don't know what's going to happen
today because something really weird
happened to me last night
I fell asleep
and I forgot to set my alarm
and I had a full night of sleep
full night meaning six hours or so
I don't know when the last time I slept
that much was I might be at my all-time
Peak Performance
so I mean I don't like to get you
excited but this might be the best live
stream you're ever ever going to see
well let's start with a Rasmussen poll
40 of American adults
think the nation has reached the day as
Martin Luther King hoped when men and
women of all Races have equal
opportunity
wait 40 percent
only 40 percent of the country thinks
we've achieved equal opportunity
now I get that we don't have equal
outcomes
but only 40 percent of the country
thinks we have equal opportunities
that's not a good number is it feels a
little low feels a little low but here's
the problem
it's we're measuring the wrong thing
how many times have I told you if you're
not measuring you're not managing
anything you're just letting it run you
know anything that you don't measure
you're not managing because you can't
tell if the things you're doing
are changing the outcome you want if
you're not measuring anything you're
just wildly flailing around and hoping
to get lucky
here's what we should do
I think we should change our metric from
equal opportunity
because you can never make anything
equal sort of an impossible standard but
you could have equivalent strategic
options
strategic meaning if you're black and
you're poor
and you're in America
all you have to do is work hard get good
grades stay out of jail and you're going
to get a scholarship and you're going to
be preferred at most of the biggest best
Employers in the country
so that's a perfectly good strategy
it's completely available 100 of kids
have that available they don't even have
to be in a good school they just have to
stay out of jail and
do their homework and they're going to
be in good shape so I think we should
change the the thing we measure from
equal opportunity which made sense when
MLK said it to
making sure we have equal strategies
equal strategies equivalent strategies
not equal not equal because they
wouldn't be the same
but equivalent you could find your path
it'll be just as good as anybody else's
if you exploited it
well I love when things that are serious
turn comical
uh on their own
here's what used to be serious
uh people complaining that Donald Trump
was a criminal and we should not have a
criminal in office as a presidency
there was a time when there were all
these serious allegations
and a citizen quite recently would say
to themselves my goodness with all of
that smoke
the walls must be closing in there must
be fire
reasonable turns out basically nothing
important was true so yeah the worst
thing what's the worst thing that Trump
has done
he uh he claimed the Stormy Daniels
payments
in some way that people didn't like
that's it right well Trump University
was settled
right so I mean that's that was done and
that was done before the election
so here's the funny part Rob reiter
famous Rob Reiner actually tweeted this
I think it was yesterday
and here's here's what's hilarious
I don't think he's joking
but I also don't think he knows it
like I don't think he knows how this
sounds I'm just going to read the tweet
and I don't have to add any kind of joke
to it it's just the context
all right here's just what he said
Rob Reiner's tweet the difference
between Joe Biden and Donald Trump is
Joe Biden is a decent law-abiding person
and Donald Trump is a pathological lying
Criminal
what does he does he not have access to
news
even CNN is turned on on Biden if
there's if there's one thing that the
news is very clear at at the moment
is that there's nothing illegal that
Trump is accused of at the moment is
there
is Trump even accused of anything
illegal
I thought every single thing has been
cleared at this point am I wrong
is there anything left that Trump is
even accused of
I don't think so oh there's one sexual
claim from long ago right
oh he had some documents right yeah like
Biden did
but
what could you say about that opinion do
you think that's his actual opinion
and how do you explain it like who who
would publicly say after all the news
about the bidens who would publicly say
well at least he's not a criminal
I don't know it just stands as it stands
as a joke just by itself it was such a
joke that it became like
you know it's actually trending right
now so that the phrase Meathead you know
from this TV show is still trending
because it was so ridiculous that I
don't know that he even knew it like I
don't think he knows why that's
ridiculous
but how many times have you seen this
happen
it's backwards reasoning well assume
that everything Trump does is for his
own good and you know it's some kind of
a scheme and then he reason backwards to
why he must be thinking
that's what he's doing in Biden assume
he's a good and virtuous person
and Less Reason backwards to the fact
that he couldn't have committed any
crimes
logically how can a good and good and
decent person commit any crimes
therefore he's innocent backwards
recently artists yeah artists
um here's my favorite headline of the
day so this is a headline from CNN
now
if there's anything I've taught you it's
this
you know the headlines don't match the
stories
often right
it's not it's not an occasional thing
it's very very common maybe I don't know
maybe a third of the time probably a
third the headline in the story don't
even match you know because headlines
more Sensational than the story
so here's one where I don't want to read
the story
because I don't want to find out that
the headline is wrong
can we all agree on that
I'm going to give you the headline just
as it appears on CNN today on their
website
don't read the story don't and if you do
please don't tell me it's not true
I need to know this is true here's the
headline study shows how Monty Python's
silly walking could be healthy
stop stop everybody don't look into it
don't look into it we need this to be
true
greet everybody on board
within our own little viewing Community
don't let anybody tell you what the
actual story says I don't want to know I
don't want to know no I need I need to
live in a world in which Monty Python's
silly walking is the healthiest thing I
can do
please be true please
just let it go let it go
well speaking of headlines that might be
true
but they might be propaganda
would you believe this headline coming
from an entity largely funded by a
pharmaceutical company
here's the headline from today long
covid can be debilitating even for
healthy kids
Maybe
Maybe
yeah I'm not I'm not I'm not saying it's
not true all right so let me be clear
I'm not giving you any kind of medical
advice I don't know what's true
but isn't it a little bit on the nose
that the The Entity funded by big Pharma
really thinks that the risk is more than
you do a little bit more of the risk
than you think there is
but it might be true
so what do you do what do you do it
might be true
I don't know
it's just a little too convenient isn't
it a little too convenient
all right
here's another headline that doesn't
match the uh the story from today this
is on Fox News website so here's the
headline White House council's Office
drops bombshell following demands of
visitor logs for Biden's Delaware home
are you kidding me are you telling me
that the Biden's personal residence they
they don't have their visitor logs so
that we know who might have been around
that classified information in the
garage are you kidding me my God this
this headline has me all outraged I'm
outraged people outraged because of the
bombshell
and then I read the article
yeah we don't keep visitor logs for
personal residences we we've never done
that
it's not exactly the bombshell I was
hoping for
a bombshell would be oh yeah it's a
federal law you better keep those
visitor logs if you're the president
even if it's your private home
but there's no law like that
never has been and nobody would think
it's a good law
it's a bombshell it's a bombshell that
the bidens acted like everybody else
does all the time for good reasons
bombshell
literally there was no reason to expect
it existed
none and if I had been a bombshell
do you remember when the uh the White
House law visitor logs disappeared under
the Trump Administration
you know that happened right
the White House got rid of their own
visitor logs so would it be a bombshell
that a private residence doesn't have a
visitor log
the White House didn't have one didn't
have one under Trump I was there for a
while and they got rid of it
there's your bombshell
all right here's another weird little
story
uh you on UC Berkeley campus
they found a skeletal remains
aren't you curious where it was
how could you have a dead person on the
UC Berkeley campus
that's that's so that it's there so long
that nobody notices until it's
completely uh turned into just a
skeleton
well apparently there was some room that
they don't go in a lot
and the room has had a dead guy in it
for I don't know how long there's been
some dead work person I don't know I
don't know if it's a guy some dead
person's been in there for apparently a
long long time
so
um here's a little
little advice uh if you plan to be a
serial killer
a good place to leave your uh Corpses
is in a room on the UC Berkeley campus
apparently pearly it's just a good place
to put them
a lot of people would try to bury them
or you know make them dissolve and lie
and acid and stuff but now you just want
to put them in a campus
put a hat on it nobody will ask any
questions
uh here's a fascinating news that I I
would I would like to pretend is true
now whenever I tell you that in the news
there's a medical breakthrough
what should your brain do as soon as you
there's a medical breakthrough a new
trial
probably not probably not you probably
never see it but maybe
you know sometimes it makes you feel
good to think there's good stuff coming
I think the real situation is good stuff
does come
and there are also stories about good
stuff coming but I feel like the good
stuff that actually arrives was never in
the stories of things coming
is that my imagination like whatever
they do the story this amazing thing you
never really see it
like you wait 10 years and you think you
know I think I'd see that by now but
then there's a thing that nobody ever
talked about that suddenly you know an
approved drug and it's a miracle thing
so here's the CNN reported uh they've
figured out how to focus sound
for brain surgery
and apparently it's been used
successfully at least in a trial in a
human and what they do is they they
figure out how to get the sound waves to
kind of reach exactly the point of the
brain you know the depth that it can
disturb a very specific part of the
brain
and they used it to disturb a part of
the brain that was giving people Tremors
you know they were shaking
and they actually took some of these
Tremors away
amazing imagine being able to take some
of these Tremors away like that's that's
a big problem
like I don't know I'm not sure if
Parkinson's is necessarily one of the
things they could Target so this was a
different kind of Tremors I think not
non-parkinson's
but somebody's calling me a sophist
the weakest the weakest criticism of all
time okay can we have a moment to
celebrate the worst trolling you've ever
seen in your life I'm literally talking
about a reported medical breakthrough
there's a troll
there's a troll calling me a sophist
foreign
all right
you may have noticed on Twitter that the
Elon Musk tweeted that the S and the ESG
stands for satanic
one of the odds that the best Twitter
troll is also the order of Twitter
could not be more perfect
and even the fact that he calls it
Satanic because he knows people are
going to take that literally like he
knows some people I guess say yeah
probably literally Satan's all over this
thing
well so we know what the Elon Musk
thinks of ESG and the biggest promoter
of it is the wef
now I do believe that I accomplished one
task or at least I was one smart small
part of it that
ESG is widely reviled
by everybody who's not directly
benefiting from it right
wouldn't you say I mean it's very
unpopular everybody knows it's garbage
and it's give somebody somebody's
pushing an agenda and it's not
necessarily for your benefit
um so the first thing I'd say about uh
ESG is if it's true that the S stands
for satanic it's not true but let's say
it is
then wouldn't the wouldn't the S be
handled by the G
anybody anybody
if the S stands for satanic wouldn't the
G
in the SG take care of it
all right you have to complete the joke
in your mind
I saw a long Twitter Thread about the
wef from Michael schellenberger who as
you know has high credibility uh
with me as well as the public but he's
one of the probably the most
I don't know it'd be hard to say who's
the most productive journalist
in the country right now but I think
it's him
I think shellenberger is the most
productive writer journalist researcher
I'm not sure what he would label himself
I would say the most productive in in
the country for the entire year most
consistently high level useful On Target
uh unbiased unbiased non-political
reporting I've seen
maybe ever if you look at the total body
of work for the past year
I don't know if anybody's ever matched
that it might be unmatchable like
historically it might be unmatchable now
taibi is doing a great job and you know
a bunch of other people at Glen grid
well yeah I can name 10 other people
Miranda to be divine
doing great work but I think
shellenberger's kind of a in his own
League at this point
but um
you know that I have not been on board
with those who said the Wes the world
economic Forum which I believe is
meeting this week I think they're
meeting
um I have not been on board with the
notion that there's some evil
organization that has intentions to do
bad things too
and you've all been shouting at me and
shouting at me they say they're going to
take all your private stuff and they're
going to it's an evil organization and
blah blah blah and I wasn't buying any
of it
because the the specific allegations
just seem ridiculous to me
see ridiculous
pillenberger reports it is long thread
and also on his sub stack which I
recommend I subscribe to it it's
probably it's the only one I subscribe
to so if you want to you know that
that's a good indication of its value
it's the only one I subscribe to so
um
here's what he reports
so you've heard the thing about uh
the world economic Forum quotes that
you'll own nothing and be happy and
you'll have no privacy I didn't know
that was part of the quote but it is
apparently that was one person wrote
something once
and it got published by the WF they got
a lot of pushback for it so they just
took it down
so
I do believe that that part of the story
was overblown
overblown I think it was one person
describing you know that if you had Uber
in the future for example you wouldn't
need to own your own card you'd be happy
about it
I I think that was just somebody's
opinion it wasn't the wef master plan
all right so that part should give you
some comfort
the Sheldon Burger is giving you you
know accurate sides of the story because
he reported that they did say that and
they did take it down
so that is on them so so you're
definitely correct
that they've promoted a view that's a
little sketchy from your point of view
and then they took it out
but here's the part I was completely
unaware of
and this is where I am now completely on
team WF must be destroyed
all right as of this morning so I'm
totally on board and here's why
this is also from
schellenberger's reporting
um
apparently the
wwef's 2022 annual report
tells a relationship with an unnamed
hedge fund
and a portfolio of assets that includes
Swiss equities Swiss bonds Global
equities
and precious metals that is in part
managed by Al Gore's generation
investment management
foreign
so what I found out today
is that there's a large hedge fund
that has some influence over W the world
economic forum and you don't know their
name
non-transparency I know you're saying
BlackRock but none but whatever it is
it's non-transparent
and how much assets how much assets does
the world economic Forum have
like why why would they even have a lot
of assets other than to put on the
events where are they getting assets
how do they even make money
now here's the even better question
what do we know about Klaus Schwab's
personal finances
I don't I assume he has no obligation to
give anybody his personal finances
would you agree
probably there's no law and apparently
Swiss law protects the organization from
having to report anything so they don't
have to report anything
now so there's an individual
who is organizing all the rich people
and trying to influence them in a
certain set of directions
and we don't know anything about how the
person who's in charge
makes money
because it's not necessary to disclose
it
that's all you need to know
that's all it took to get me in you know
that the claims against them I think are
a little
sketchy
but if you tell me they're trying to
work they're trying to influence our
governments and we don't know who's
paying them
that is the end of the story
I am so down to completely destroy this
organization any way we can unless they
want to be transparent if they decided
to be transparent
well then we could take a look and
decide if we like it or not
but if I told you if there's anything
I've told you consistently
if it's a large organization
and they're not transparent
guilt is the assumption
Assumption of guilt because they're an
organization if it's an individual
assumption the assumption is instance so
Klaus Schwab himself
I would assume no crimes have been
committed
because he's an individual right he's a
human being
Assumption of Innocence no matter how no
matter how suspicious you are Assumption
of Innocence but what about his
organization
Assumption of guilt you can separate
those
the organization is presumed guilty in
every way because they're not
transparent about where their financial
ties are and I would say that Klaus
Schwab's
financial situation being not
transparent I assume by the way fact
check me out in that I'd be very
surprised if he's transparent about his
finances but
as long as he's not transparent and as
long as he's the leader of the entity he
may not have broken any laws at all I
have no reason to think he has
but he's part of an entity that you have
to assume guilt for lack of transparency
right
yeah so yeah I'm talking about the
Assumption of guilt not actual guilt
actual guilt is a separate question from
the Assumption of guilt
so
I think that's how you go after them and
I think that you force them to live by
their own standards question number one
how many lgbtq members of the wef are
there
huh
not
none do they have a good balance of
women and men
um
I feel like maybe not
just guessing
do they have a lot of good diversity
there a lot of good diversity
um
it doesn't look like it no
do you think that do you think that
corporations
are being asked to be transparent about
their ESG
that's right
yeah the wef
is asking corporations to be transparent
about what they're doing
it's a non-transparent organization
asking others to be transparent no
no
and no
that's a that's a hard no
if they were a transparent organization
saying look at us look how transparent
we are and now also you know we'd like
you to be transparent too well that
would be an argument I'd listen to
but no a non-transparent organization
cannot
ask anybody to be transparent you know
why
transparency gives away your power
you don't want the non-transparent
entity to keep their power by lack of
transparency while making you give up
your power by being transparent
no no
let me give you a related story
and then I'm going to tie it back in
this will seem totally unrelated and
then I'm going to find a way to tie
these back together right do you all
know Seth Abramson
prominent Democrat and attorney type and
so often he weighs in on the political
stuff that has any kind of legal
you know ramifications and
he's a little bit upset at Matt taibi
for reporting that the stories about
Russian Bots were oversold to the public
and Seth aberson is arguing no no we
always knew even back in 2018 Politico
reported that it probably wasn't a
Russian Russian Bots that were
influencing the specifically the
question was the the hashtag
release the memo
so there's a question of a Devin Nunes
memo that was classified that people
were asking Trump to release it
and that it did get released but
apparently there was a lot of social
media action behind the release and
there was a claim that the Russian Bots
we're behind causing it to be released
the counterclaim is apparently Twitter
looked at it and it looked like it was
more organic it was actually a domestic
it was just sort of a natural
right-leaning
you know amplification but probably
there were some Russian bots in there
but it wasn't necessarily the whole
story
so uh Abramson makes a correct
an accurate statement that
there were probably domestic Bots and
even at the time it wasn't as big a
story as maybe we remember it the the
Bots were sort of
you know considered some mix of domestic
and other
but here's what the claim made in
Politico back in 2018 by Molly McHugh an
expert on information Warfare
and
so she writes this article and she
talked about the Russian trolls
promoting this release the memo hashtag
and then she concludes that it worked
she concludes that it worked
and she said by the time the memo got to
the president in other words Devin
nunes's classified memo its release was
a foregone conclusion even before Trump
had read it
and she says that's a that's a true fact
based on the fact that the viral
activity was so strong that Trump would
basically be influenced into releasing
it and that he would not have been had
there not been a social media push and
had it not been bot related
do you believe any of that
that's the most
claim I've ever heard in my life there's
no even explanation of how you would
know an influenced anything
what's the mechanism
what assumption would you make would you
why would you assume that Trump would
not have released it since it was in his
best interest to release it why would
you assume anybody had any influence on
him this is the worst reporting I've
ever seen to just say it's true
with no explanation of how you connect
the dots oh it's true
and
how do you know that
that's just true
bizarre
but imagine if it is true
if it is true that means that Tick Tock
already runs our country
now I've been telling you that forever
that the social media can change the
algorithms now did it happen in this
case I think this is the worst example
of of something that might have been
from outside influence because it looks
exactly like something that was going to
happen on its own like you a good
experiment would be something that
wouldn't happen on its own
but for somebody releasing a memo that's
in his best interest to release it
how could that not be good
or predictable
anyway uh the other thing Seth sethair
Brunson said
is that um
what taivi doesn't mention and he says
this is a big big fault he doesn't
mention that
um Twitter was actually preferring right
leaning tweets
have you ever heard that
apparently there's evidence of this and
wait wait for the punch line there's a
punch line at the end so don't I'm like
leading leading you into something
illegitimate here right apparently there
is evidence
that Twitter actually promotes
right-leading tweets more than left
do you believe that
how many of you believe that's a true
statement
that Twitter even historically lasts
several years has promoted right leading
tweets political tweets over left
in the headlines and then the trending
was there anything maybe I left out
let me say it again look for the dog
that's not barking
Twitter
has Preferred and highlighted
right-leaning political tweets
more than left-leaning for the last
several years
what am I living hell
do you don't see it
what am I leaving out
oh man none of you see it this is why it
works this is why abramson's trick I'm
going to call it a trick this is why it
works not one of I don't think any of
you see it
thank you
one of you the country
it wasn't he wasn't talking about
America he was talking about the world
there are a lot of right-leaning
countries
and if you look at all of the countries
in America is just one of them
apparently there is some Trend that
right-leaning Tweets in other countries
were getting promoted and Twitter wasn't
aware of it and looked into it and you
know may have changed something I don't
know but Abramson is trying to conflate
you know uh how Twitter handled American
politics which clearly
is not going to be the same pattern as
the rest of the world I mean I think we
know that now
so that was a very good lawyerly attempt
to use the fact that people are not
going to read the article because you
had to read pretty far
like you had to get past the first
paragraph or so I think
no fact check me maybe it wasn't
um
but if you just read the headline
or his tweet you would assume it was
about America wouldn't you like all of
you did
see that's the trick it's like The
Magician's trick he made you assume it
was America but he never said that
he never claimed it was America he just
allowed you to assume it because he left
out the context
very very weasily I'll tell you if I
were going to hire a lawyer I might hire
him
because because he pulled that he pulled
that rabbit right out of nothing
so that's some good lawyering
all right well here's the thing if we
believe that or at least there's one you
know expert on information Warfare who
believes that uh even if the Russian
Bots did not influence that one
political decision about releasing the
newness memo even if they didn't
that is the thing
that could happen
and yet
Tick Tock is totally allowed in America
what's happening
what's happening
can you come up with any explanation for
why Tick Tock is completely you know as
far as I know every politician thinks it
should be banned
as far as I know I've never heard one
person on the other side
and Fentanyl everybody thinks we need to
do more but we're not
both of them come from China
right both of them have a China
connection is it a coincidence that two
things we think are like huge policies
there's just nothing happening
it's not that they're even doing the
wrong thing
they're acting like they can't work on
it it's like something you can mention
but you can't actually work on it you
can't make any legislation you can't
recommend anything
what's going on
now in the context of watching China get
away with literally murder and literally
building a user interface to to control
Congress let me say that again
Tick Tock is a user interface for China
to control Congress
too strong
is that unfair
no it's other things too it's you know a
form of entertainment for some people
but that's not too far
it is a user interface
developed by China
to control the American Congress and
other stuff too I suppose
that's what it is it's a user interface
to control Congress and Congress allows
it
why
why and it's not even it's not even like
it's it's all the it's all the Democrats
you haven't heard me criticize any
Democrats have you have I criticized any
Democrats no
when it comes to fentanyl
and it comes to tick tock
there's something going on
there's absolutely something going on
and I don't believe it's free from the
fact that the bidens have some China
connection
it might be it might have nothing to do
with that but could you assume that no
if right in front of you you see
congress not working to do your work
sort of obviously ignoring these two
things just really obviously ignoring
them
at the same time that we have a lack of
transparency about the Biden connection
to China
that's all you need to know
that's all you need to know
if you tell me that Trump can't win on
that
like all he has to do is say look uh
I'll do basically what I did before you
know what I do you know you know I'm
going to be tough on boarders and stuff
but on top of that I'll take care of
tick tock and I'll take care of Fentanyl
like actually take care of them like
like actually try to do things
how do you lose
how do you lose
do you know how easy it would be for
Trump to win if he just modified his
approach just a little bit
like I doubt he'll do it he's you know
part of why you like him is that he does
it his way you know he doesn't really
take that kind of advice I kind of like
that I like that he does it his way
but it would be so easy all he'd have to
do is be the reformed Trump
still funny
still provocative
but just play it a little bit safer
the left would be you know out of ammo
because he'd be playing it safe and the
right would be ah well that's exactly
what we wanted
the right would say oh finally you know
just just act a little bit you know less
provocative and we like that
foreign
let me ask you a thing what are the odds
that the election is really going to
come down to DeSantis versus Newsom if
you had to guess right now
what are the odds that it's both of
those two
in the in the final vote
25 percent
some say higher 75 20 percent
20.
yeah this was a tough one
it's a tough one and here's why it's
tough
be because if one of them flips I think
the other one will
so let me game down here let's say Trump
is Assuming he's going to run
and the Republicans are assuming he'll
probably get the nomination and and then
Newsome emerges as the probable
candidate let's say Biden decides not to
run
don't you think the Republicans would
say oh darn
we don't want Trump running against
Newsom
because Trump might win that
I'm sorry that Trump might lose against
Newsom whereas he could have won against
Biden
so then the Republicans to say oh shoot
we only have one person we think can
beat Newsom
and it's not necessarily Trump
so and then imagine it the other way
right now the Democrats think they could
be Trump because they did it once
but what if DeSantis emerges as the
probable uh primary winner
they would have to change their choice
too right because DeSantis against Biden
looks like a layup
doesn't it it looks like a layup
uh it's hard to imagine you can lose
so I think whichever one goes first you
know whoever calls the bluff and changes
them through candidate first the other
will have to make uh the matching move
like a coach you know put in the right
put in the right lineup
so that's something to watch
all right
um
and then
taking this all back to the wef
if the if China
let's put it this way
if we think Congress can be influenced
by an app
which it probably can and we think that
Congress can be influenced by some
Russian Bots
maybe in addition to domestic Bots
why are we okay with the wef trying to
acquire power over our leaders with no
transparency
well what would be easier than bribing
Klaus Schwab
now here let me be clear I'm not I'm not
asserting he would take a bribe
but maybe anybody would at some level
Klaus Schwab will give you a million
dollars
to destroy America indirectly oh no
there's no way I'm going to take a
million dollars I'm no I'm no criminal
they say Klaus will give you 10 million
dollars to secretly destroy America
sorry sorry I'm doing okay I got a good
job 10 million dollars is not going to
move me get out of here get out of my
office
how about a hundred million
100 million
chances of getting caught pretty high
no no 100 million I will not take 100
million I will not do it get out of my
office
how about a billion
let's talk
now again I'm not making any accusations
against Klaus Schwab specifically I'm
making a general statement that anybody
can be bought
or threatened
because it it's not always just a bribe
it could be a threat and a bribe well
I'll give you a choice Klaus we can we
can either uncover your whatever you're
doing that would look bad to somebody
else or you could take this bribe and
your life goes on and you're the
happiest person in the world
yeah everybody has a price
that's why
you need transparency
if you given that we know adversaries
would like to influence things that are
not in our best interest
we can't put up with the world economic
Forum so here's the first thing uh
imagine
can you do a fact check did Trump attend
the world economic forum
why do I not remember that
I see yeses
uh once in 2018.
and then ever again
uh what has Trump said he wanted to
destroy the world economic forum
would he vote for him
if he said I'll destroy the world
economic forum and you know Trump could
do that
don't you believe Trump could destroy
the world economic form Trump could
actually talk the man of business
because if they lose the United States
if they lose you you know Trump can say
I'll make it illegal for the we have to
influence American politics
so the ESG is now illegal because it
came from the wvf
how about that
just say anything that is driven by the
WF is illegal in the United States
because we don't have our system is not
our Constitution doesn't allow them to
run our country so the moment we see
influence coming in even branded
influence like ESG is almost like a
branded product kind of kind of you know
conceptually
just say no no no we can't ever have
anything like that because it came from
those guys
that would be fair to me totally fair
and that has nothing to do with the
value of any of those things it's just
they can't come from there just can't
come from outside the country
I don't know it feels like everything's
shaping up to just hand things to Trump
doesn't it
like why are all the stories
Trump perfect
if you said there's somebody who's
powerful and they need to be taken out
by persuasion
you think DeSantis could do that
do you think DeSantis could take out the
world economic forum just by talking
about him nope
[Laughter]
nope not at all now there's only one
person on the planet who could do that
and he's not in office at the moment
only one person
if you needed an assassin
you got one waiting now let me be clear
I've said this before
I don't want a president who's that old
it doesn't matter if it's Trump or
anybody else I don't want that but if
that turns out to our to be our only
choices
well I'm going to make whatever Choice
makes sense
all right
um
ladies and gentlemen
today being the special Martin Luther
King
episode I'm gonna make it a little bit
shorter today
uh okay
senility as a weapon okay I don't know
what that means
uh give Trump the age reboot thing you
talked about yes oh yeah so now they
have now science is coming up with a
thing to reverse your aging would that
be funny if Biden and Trump this can't
happen but imagine if they were the
first recipients of the newly approved
it doesn't exist but it's in Trials
an aging reversal drug
but what if it worked
imagine that imagine imagine seeing your
leaders younger in office
that's not impossible it's not even it's
not impossible
uh Russell Brand has his WF Royal Rumble
on Rumble now
so they're debating about whether the
DWF so here's my uh
here's my
summary of my WF thing if you're
criticizing individual things that come
out of them
you're going to have people pushing back
we don't like ESG but we like it you
know there's a tie
or you say
don't do so much about climate change
and then the other people say but we
like doing things about climate change
that's a tie
so you need to hide ground it
High Ground persuasion is
lack of transparency is the end of the
story
right everything you talk about Beyond
transparency
no impact
yeah you have to you have to make them
submit to their own standards
I assume that they're pushing ESG but
also pushing that you have to measure it
and report it and be transparent
if the WF is pushing you or anything
about you to be transparent while they
are not transparent
end of story
let me let me let me tell you how smart
people talk
like the smartest people
if you're in the room with the smartest
people
and you're saying is the WF good or bad
you just say this they're asking for
transparency from American and other
companies
while they are not transparent about
their own Financial connections
what does the smartest person in the
room say oh we're done with them
that that's that's game over
that is completely game over
no smart person no smart person says yes
to that am I wrong
show me one smart person who will
disagree with me on that point
you won't get one I could tweet that all
day long
and nobody will argue with it you know
why
because it's a high ground a high ground
can't be argued with
that's why you that's why you get out of
the weeds you've all been in the weeds
like you couldn't even convince me
that that you'll own nothing and be
happy about you couldn't even convince
me that was a problem
and I'm I'm like so primed to be on your
side right I'm completely primed
to agree with my audience
because it's good for me right it's
totally in my benefit follow the money
like bigger audience you know I get more
advertising dollars blah blah so I I'm
so ready to believe that but it's just
not it's not persuasive
it's just not persuasive so you have to
move up to The High Ground where there's
no argument by anybody and then you
don't need the you don't need the
subsidiary arguments
you and if somebody says you hey but the
WF is doing a good thing I like this
thing they're doing
you say
yeah I'm sure people thought that of
every
terrible thing at some point you know
that serial killer
you don't think he did some good things
too
probably until you found out about the
serial killing
he was a pretty good guy except for all
the serial killing
right
so
I think that's how you have to treat the
wef the stuff that they say publicly
maybe it bothers you maybe it doesn't
forget about that
just go after the lack of transparency
and especially if you don't know if you
don't know where Klaus Schwab gets his
money
we're done
right now if you notice that also in the
comments
zero pushback
zero
what's the last time I said anything you
know provocative
in front of how many hundreds of people
thousands
yeah in front of a thousands like three
thousand people right now
when it was last time I said something
political and provocative in front of
three thousand people and I got zero
pushback
that ladies and gentlemen is The High
Ground
The High Ground is when nobody can do
anything they're just like well okay you
got me that's it end of the story
a great idea for a Netflix show
yeah even the clubbers are silent so
yesterday I did an experiment that was a
complete failure
uh I went on these spaces
um what would you call it app within the
app on Twitter where you can do an audio
only group of people and you can
determine who talks and so I host it and
I asked people
to bring their criticisms to me
and uh and I wanted to respond to them
because I thought all the all the people
who had incorrect opinions about my
pandemic stuff would be coming at me and
I thought oh this is great I'll be
totally exposed
totally exposed whatever they say
everybody's going to hear it no editing
real time and I said I'm going to throw
myself in the snake pad
because here's my thinking
my claim is that their claims are
completely groundless and you know
stupid
if I if I can't throw myself into that
snake bed
and still walk out of it with no bites
they probably had a point
that's one way to find out so one way to
find out if you're in cognitive distance
is just throw yourself in the snake pad
see what happens so that's why I did
like all right go complain anything you
want no limits
I could get anybody to complain
everybody just wanted to tell me they
liked my work or you know I have a
comment about something no complaints
and here's what I take from that
here's here's my takeaway
the trolls are not real
you don't think I could get one troll
to actually speak with a real voice
yeah now they might be real people
I'm not saying that they're uh programs
they might be real people but they don't
have real opinions in other words their
opinion is more about bothering me it's
not that they actually hold those
opinions because they weren't there was
literally nobody willing to say it like
with their actual voice nobody
so I I now dismiss them as as not
relevant
all right
um what's up
your take on Trump's re-election cannot
be sincere
are you talking about me
I'm not sure what part
what's my take
my take that I have a single issue
because you know I'm a single issue
voter
um I will I will abandon Trump support
the moment somebody has a better plan
for Fentanyl
don't be surprised
don't be surprised
that's on the table that's what a single
issue voter is single issue voter means
I'm going with the best fentanyl plan
and you can do whatever you want and I I
won't even try to influence you
do whatever you want I'm just going to
go with one thing
now the reason I'm doing this
is partly because Congress isn't doing
anything and you know anything I can do
to shine attention on that would be
useful
the other thing is that you know that
when it gets closer to an election if if
Trump's in it
I get more attention right
so the people who are identified as any
kind of voice on one side or the other
they get a lot of attention when the
election gets close
imagine the the mainstream press having
to describe me
this time how would they describe me
well they probably will cheat and say
something like you know Trump's
supporter which I guess is tactically
true
but what they will have trouble with is
why
if they report why then my story gets
promoted on top of their story
I would love them to report that I'm a
single issue voter
and if they if they ask me for any
comment
my first comment will be I'm a single
issue voter it's not about Trump it's
just about he has a tougher plan for
fentanyl don't ask me to defend anything
else he's done
I won't defend him at all because I only
care about one thing now I'll probably
talk about whether you know he's
persuasive or not but that's not
defending
because I I say the same thing about
Biden when he does something persuasive
all right Morehead yeah there will be
more hit pieces
Morehead peace is on me for sure
but the the Wednesday do you know that
most of the people who are trying to
fact check me on my pandemic stuff it's
about my one tweet where I said that
after I got my second booster no the
first
I only got two shots so whatever you
call them the first two
that I tweeted that if you have your
shots it feels uh if you don't have any
shots it's like you're in the pandemic
still if you do have your shots it feels
like just a Wednesday
now people fact check that
how do you fact check my feeling
and why why would you fact check
somebody's
feeling
what would be the point of that
I said I had a feeling
and I believed that it would be common
to other people my feeling was that my
work was done
because I'd done everything that I could
do
there was nothing else I could do and
now I had my rights back because
remember that was in a that's when masks
had already been
um
were were no longer required in
California they came back
but during that period where I tweeted
it I didn't didn't need to wear a mask
for most things
and I had now ability to travel
internationally
in which I went to Santorini and Bora
Bora two of the best destinations on the
planet
and there were no other guests there
basically two world-class Resort
experiences you know like a world kind
of Lifetime experience without crowds
it was insane
so to me the pandemic was over
in that moment of time that's how I felt
but why would you why would anybody feel
they had to fact check my feelings
because that's what's happening
I mean clearly it was a it was a
description of a Feeling
it wasn't a description of a law
it wasn't description of a fact
it was a description of a Feeling
and people were really mad that I felt
that way
and I still feel like that was a valid
way to feel
with what I knew at the time
now if I'd known that the masks were
going to come back
then I wouldn't have said that
right because I wouldn't feel like it
was over I'd feel like oh damn it
there's just one more step and there are
more things I have to do Etc
so sure enough
from that day forward
um I became a anti-mask activist you
know a few months later tried to
organize a ban on mass I largely stopped
wearing them even where they were
required I won't mention where because I
don't want the businesses to get in
trouble but there were local businesses
that did allow me to be maskless during
that second phase and you know I didn't
get in trouble for it
so
for me the the pandemic was mostly over
and it felt really good and I felt sorry
for people who still needed to do things
to get to their to their personal end of
it I was at my personal end of it I was
a little bit wrong because I came back
but that's all
right
um
you had a feeling it was just a feeling
yeah Twitter is the only place that
people fact check your feelings
and they'll say they'll say uh
no your feeling is wrong
well is it
if I told you you have a thing
that would be very inappropriate
I just told you how I felt I felt I
assumed other people felt the same
and I think they did I do think that
uh would you feel the same way with the
vax paperwork and no well I don't
know what that means
the somebody is making his distinction
that I took two shots instead of one
the two shots were one shot
and it was presented as
you do these two
so I made one decision
but it was a two-shot decision just like
everybody else
yeah yeah I hate people too and that
that's just like a dick sort of a dick
coming
now I'm being criticized for my weight
that's a first
I've got a troll criticizing me for
being fat
okay
all right
all right sure
um here's a little uh provocation
so look for a tweet I retweeted by uh
Ian martusis
and you're gonna you're gonna see that
there's some I don't believe any data so
the uh
so that the big story here is that all
data is is not to be believed
but there are some
uh
some real estate not real estate some
insurance industry uh Actuarial data I
guess this shows that it seems to
indicate
the people who got vaccinated uh below a
certain age had more myocarditis
we all we all expect that right
everybody's on board
below some age
the data is starting to be pretty strong
it's turning in the direction that you
know that's creating myocarditis
but
the I the weird thing is that if you
believe the data which you shouldn't
which you should not if you believed it
it would look like uh the shot actually
protects people my age
we actually get less myocarditis
than you would if you just lived your
life without any vaccination at all do
you believe that
do you believe it's possible and by the
way you should not believe this one data
set because it was small but it does
show that you know it's one little data
set what if that turned out to be true
I think it's possible
seems unlikely doesn't it seems it seems
more likely a data thing but here's
here's why
you could imagine a situation in which
young bodies have a key difference
several key differences one of the key
differences would be at least for the
men and we know that boys are having
seemingly more problems with it could be
testosterone levels
what if it turns out that
um and by the way this would be true for
cancer right
if if you had cancer
you want
can you give me a fact check on this if
you had cancer you would want your
testosterone to not be high right
is that true
give me a fact check on that the more
testosterone the more aggressive your
cancer will be
or is that not true
for prostate cancer somebody sees yes
so yes for prostate
depends on the cancer okay
so there might be a precedent I think
there's a precedent in which you can
imagine older people who would have an
advantage that a younger person wouldn't
now that's I'm just using the
testosterone
uh I'm just using the testosterone as
one example I'm not saying that's what's
Happening Here
yeah oh it increases breast cancer risk
testosterone does
right true of estrogen also in
somebody's eyes right so you can imagine
situations at which a young body is
simply more active
right like everything is faster and more
in a young body
and if everything is faster and more you
could maybe you could imagine
you know that that uh there's a
different operation working there
I wouldn't Bank on it you know I
wouldn't make any bets that that will
play out but it is it is interesting
that we're not getting does it seem odd
to you
that we're not seeing reports of older
people getting more myocarditis
does that seem odd
because it seems like
the thing you would expect is oh it's
really bad in the young but it's also a
little bit bad for older people
isn't that sort of how your mind would
sort of expect oh yeah it's worse for
the young people but it's also bad for
old people just not as bad
that's what I'd expect at the most but
the fact that I've seen no reporting of
extra myocarditis over 65.
has anybody seen that
has anybody seen any data that's just
over 65
there's an increased risk
yeah
all right well so I guess we still have
lots of questions about this
you'd be less likely to be suspicious
about cardiac problems in older people
true
but you're more likely to check them
aren't you
aren't you more likely to do a hard
check on an older person just routinely
I know it feels like you would we would
have spotted it by now to me because
you'd be comparing to the Baseline you
wouldn't be comparing you know this
person you wouldn't say this person is
weird
it would only be the cumulative compared
to the Baseline
more Strokes was 65
really
right I'm seeing lots of requests for
Aviva and Barnes to be unblocked
what's your argument for that
why should I do that
because I don't unblock other people by
the way I sometimes I unblock the local
subscribers because that's a different
situation
uh why why should I talk to Barnes and
even Barnes
I like Viva
does a good show
a great show actually I think Viva
uh is
one of my role models for
um well I'm just going to say this the
this is meant to be a compliment
so if it comes if it sounds like it's
not a compliment I don't mean that this
is a serious compliment to Viva I
watched him from the beginning
to develop what he's developed and I
thought his early takes
were not good now I don't mean his tanks
his early presentation
because he seemed a nervous on live
stream
and his nerves came through
now here's where I'm going to give him a
huge compliment
he did it anyway
he did it anyway in other words you
could tell that he was uncomfortable and
trying to make it work and he worked
through that until now he has one in my
opinion one of the better
shows of its type
so I think he went from a really
kind of an easy to criticize situation
which is very uncomfortable
for most people
and he worked through it
so that's the difference between a
winner and a loser so like viva's a
winner he's a winner
because he took on something hard
and in public
you know with no apparently no problem
with being embarrassed you know you have
to be a you have to have thick skin
probably got lots of criticism everybody
does
and now he's developed a powerful
product which I recommend
I recommend you test them so yeah uh I'm
always impressed when somebody works
through their fear and does something
they're not naturally I don't know if
he's naturally good at it but it took
him a while to get up to the place he is
now
only Democrats block people the rest of
us just deal no you should there's a
different standard if you're a public
figure
but you can't compare what my Twitter
feed looks like compared to yours if you
have a hater you can just ignore them
okay you know because they're giving you
board and go away when I have a hater it
becomes their job like they'll set up
camp and like every day they'll Center
the computer ah let's see what I can say
about Scott today right that's a whole
different situation I have to block
people because it would be nothing but
that
yeah and generally I block people uh if
they've done something uh disreputable
in my opinion
and I think the way Barnes handled his
treatment of me when I'm easy to access
could have asked for a comment
didn't ask for a comment
basically put some opinions down that
didn't map to my actual views
and that's never cool
there's no forgiveness for that that is
an Unforgivable
error because I'm accessible
it would have been easy just to ask me
hey does this look like I'm presenting
your view
uh
yeah too much actually not enough coffee
uh I can't get over how wrong you were
about Ehrlich and the depopulation
agenda no I wasn't wrong
that's not an example of being wrong
because uh I said that nobody important
is trying to depopulate the world he's
not important
he was influential
but he didn't influence anybody
important
because there's literally nobody in
government who wants fewer people in
their country
nobody
if you can if you can find me one
elected or even unelected leader of a
country who agrees with airlock
then then you have you'll have my
correction
you'll have my correction just find me
one person who says yes the population
should decrease from today's level in my
own country
just one example
and they'll say oh shoot you're right
that Eric I had influence I say he has
no influence
on that
he does have influence apparently on you
know how we handle some environmental
stuff
that didn't move the goal post from the
very first time I said nobody important
nobody with actual ability to change
something
there's a lot of Minds being read
well let me just say this I don't have
to read anybody's mind in power I'm just
looking at what they say and do and I'm
also saying nobody would have that
opinion
nobody
you you nobody
all right Eric is clearly crazy
like he's just a nut job so I believe
that you know some citizens might have
bought into it but there's nobody in
power
who actually votes and makes laws and
stuff who believes there should be fewer
people in their own country nobody
no not Putin nobody
well Putin thinks there should be fewer
people in Ukraine I guess special case
nope China and India did not decrease
their populations
no they did not
every popular those populations are
growing
they're never going to publicly admit it
well if they don't publicly do anything
about it that's good enough for me
yeah the one child policy was about
slowing growth it wasn't about reducing
it
that they weren't they didn't want fewer
people they wanted to reduce the growth
it kept growing
yeah you can I would like all of you to
keep yelling one child law
that did not decrease
say at the moment you know that the one
child law is not in effect do you know
why
do you know why the one child effect is
the one child law is not in effect
because nobody thinks it's a good idea
today
yeah and China knows it was a big
mistake so the one child law is arguing
my side not your side
do you understand that
everybody who said Scott you're
forgetting the one child law now that's
my argument
my argument is they tried it and then it
was it caused a demographic time bomb
that is a problem
so that's the the one child law is why
people know you don't want to do it
that's proof of my argument not yours
yeah too many males
the Great lead forward did right well
but I'm not talking about the past
uh
did Barnes did Barnes apologize I don't
know
I didn't ask him for an apology
he was waiting for me
why are some people say yes
some people are saying no and some
people are saying yes they apologized
well I didn't ask for an apology
um well he does have access to by the
way Israeli do you have any problem
opening the link in my Twitter profile
where I did a write-up of my pandemic
opinions
does that open for everybody I had some
some issues
is supposed to be public but some people
acted like they were needed permission
all right so if Barnes wants to know my
actual opinions and compare them to how
he
um described me it's right there for him
you know you can just click on it and
see and if he wants to clarify anything
that's up to him
uh he wrote an explanation
oh it opens thank you
for himself oh he explained himself
so he just explained to his site they
didn't change the dependent that's okay
let me read uh John's comment I have to
shout it because it's all in caps this
is from John
Scott about that communicating his
position and spend most of his show
trying to reattate it
good comment
yeah I am trying to reattane the oat
in all caps
well I think I've done enough reitating
out
so I guess I'm done reitating out
but you got me you got me
he caught me reitating UT
I will never do that again it would be
funnier and sorry on the locals platform
you didn't see it but if you saw how
humorously
misspelled it was
am I a pilot
yes I pilot here and I pile it there
the BS that is no I'm not a airline
pilot that would not be the right job
for me
do you ever look at look at a job and
you say you know
that would be the wrong job for me let
me tell you what would be the wrong job
for me
anything in which you have to be really
careful about the details
like a brain surgeon not for me no no
no uh or a
or or an engineer or a scientist uh
probably not
the airline pilot no nope nope nope
nope that's not me
how about somebody uh
making something out of clay oh that's
me
because I'll be like how's that
no not quite how was that now that I'm
good at that
if I can iterate through my problems I'm
good at it but now getting it right on
the first try that's not me you don't
want me for that job
just like ghost exactly
why you struggle with tech
do I struggle with tech
I don't think I struggle with tackling
more than anybody else does I probably
tried more things
there is you know I do have the long
history of the Adam's luck with
mechanical objects that's another story
uh
you can sell art you know I've tried
nobody wants to buy my art
turns out the value of my art is very
low
surprise
all right
do you have any idea how complicated my
technology setup is just to live my life
I have a pretty complicated
setup oh by the way there was one story
I forgot to mention there's a product
now that can change your voice to
anybody else's voice
you know uh what are your talking
through the phone I guess
that's a little that's a little
dangerous all right I'm gonna say
goodbye to YouTube and spend a little
time with the subscribers over on locals
which you wish you were
do me a favor over on YouTube if you
don't already subscribe hit the
subscription button

bye for now
best
