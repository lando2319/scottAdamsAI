hey everybody
come on in it's time
for coffee with scott adams probably
the highlight of your whole week if not
your year
it's been a crappy year so it doesn't
take much to be the highlight
and all you need to make it better is a
copper mug or glass
a tanker a chalice a stein a canteen
jugger flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine
hit of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip
and it happens when now
oh
yeah that's good stuff i feel
the republic getting stronger with each
sip
shall we talk about the things all the
things that are happening
sure let us uh can we agree
as a country on one thing just one thing
we disagree on so many things but can we
agree on this one thing
trump is trump trump is not
sometimes bernie sanders trump is not
occasionally joe biden trump wakes up as
trump and he's trump
all day long and so all the people who
are saying
i think he should concede while there is
still
a technical way he could prevail
did you not hear the first part where i
said he's trump
what the hell good would he have been as
a president
if he would quit
he's the ultimate come from behind guy
he's been
bankrupt he's been bankrupt and came
back
he uh you know was down in the uh
polls in 2016 came back
he uh will probably uh get crushed
business-wise the trump business
probably is going to take a huge hit
but i'll bet he'll find a way to make
that bigger
maybe form a bd empire or something but
we should
stop pretending there's any chance
that trump will wake up as trump change
into some other person during the day
concede while he still has any chance
left
and then you know call it a day
that's not going to happen and you
wouldn't really want it to happen would
you
because what made trump
succeed at the things that i would say
he didn't succeed at
is this sort of thing you know it's it's
the fact that
he he finds the impossible
to be merely inconvenient
[Laughter]
i've told you that before that the most
defining
characteristic of trump as a president
is that he's no good at the easy stuff
but he keeps doing the impossible stuff
like we just saw that
netanyahu's meeting with the crown
prince of saudi arabia
looks like maybe there's something good
going there that'll be a continuation of
the middle east stuff
that looked impossible
shaking hands with kim jong-un it looked
impossible
until he did it you know getting uh
getting uh those uh vaccines
available as quickly as possible it
looked impossible
right i mean i could make you a list of
the things that looked impossible
that trump actually did even i would
argue
even the trade war with china
looked like it was impossible to win and
in the in the end i think if biden takes
over we won't win on that
but it looked like trump had at least
proven
that it was way worse for china than it
was for us
i think the experts agree on that now
right
the the economists say oh yeah it didn't
hurt us that much but it hurt
china a lot more which was the whole
point so
i feel as if trump in a situation which
looks to
other people to be impossible
is one we've seen him in quite a bit
and we've watched him succeed from a
point that seemed impossible
now when i say he's bad at the easy
stuff i mean
just not causing trouble you know you
know
just wear masks you know the easy stuff
he doesn't do the easy stuff
all right um let me give you a little
view of the world that maybe you don't
have
and it will help you for my credibility
for those of you who remember
back in 2016 when i said to you
i think there's a specific persuader
that's helping hillary clinton and i
named him eventually
i called him godzilla until i was
confident and then i named him
robert gildini now he has not
admitted that he helped consult hillary
but he's also not denied it when he was
asked directly
and that's the sort of thing where if
you didn't do it
it's kind of easy to deny right did you
did you consult for hillary clinton nope
i mean you would obviously say no
because you would never say
yes or maybe about consulting for a
presidential candidate
because people would know if you did it
would be you know
embarrassing professionally so i'm going
to assume that i'm right about that and
that i
that i picked him out of a crowd of
seven
billion people as the voice that must be
pushing
some of the persuasion i still think
that's the case
now as we're watching this
uh sidney powell sitchin situation play
out
let me tell you a view of the world that
may not be
the one you had when you woke up
and it goes like this i've made
reference to this before
that there's a uh a blazing war
happening
that you don't see there there's the
stuff
that's in the public the stuff that's in
the news
but below that surface there is just a
raging
permanent war
and various people are involved you know
spooky people and
uh you know operatives and the dirty
tricksters etc
but a big part of that is the persuaders
the people who have almost wizard-like
talents of persuasion and they come in
two flavors i would say
there's the ones who persuade positively
as in this candidate will do great that
would be like positive persuasion
but then there's also the disinformation
people
now that's the part you're less aware of
and you might say to yourself
i don't think there's any disinformation
going on
but let me tell you it's a small world
and the people who deal in this kind of
content they find each other
all right so do you believe that do you
believe that the people who
have this weird and unique skill that
they can move an entire country
they find each other because in many
cases they may have
been trained in the same places they're
watching each other they
it's a small world and they know each
other
i'm going to make a another prediction
there's probably fewer than 20 people
in the country who who had the training
and skill
to pull off the venezuelan
election machine disinformation
now i'm gonna say that i could be wrong
right but it looks to me exactly like
professional disinformation meaning it's
not just something that somebody came up
with
it's the work of real professionals
and there are only maybe a dozen
maybe two dozen i'm not saying that it's
an intelligence
agency it could be
you can't rule that out but it could be
just the democrats
because you can hire these people
they're
they're people who have a skill you can
hire them
you don't have to be you know an
intelligence agency they're for hire
so given that this has every
look of a disinformation campaign
and let's compare it to the persuasion
that's going on from the trump campaign
so now i'm going to take you from the
surface of the news
you're going underground with me now all
right so we're deep underground
with the real war not the fake one
that's all just fake news up above
now you're down in the real one and the
real one
shows the trump campaign using
persuasion
in which i've described before the
laundry list in other words they're
saying
there's a whole bunch of stuff wrong
with this election
you don't like that one well how about
this one not that one
how about this one how about this one
now the beauty of the laundry list
is that although it would not hold up in
court
in other words every claim you make
should be strong and you should really
get rid of the weak claims before you
walk into a courtroom
that's just going to make the judge
angry
i learned that from robert barnes and
and
but in terms of public opinion the
laundry list works really well it's very
it's sort of a dirty trick
because the point of it is they're not
all equally strong things on the list
but if you see enough stuff you're going
to say with all that smoke
there's got to be some fire there i mean
you know the
the sky is full of smoke got to be a
fire
but that's why it's persuasion the point
is to make it look like there's a fire
even if there isn't now in my opinion
there is a fire
but they need some time to to prove it
but in the short run you do the laundry
list you get the public on your side
and then here's the key part
alan dershowitz talked about this now
skipping some of the
constitutional technicalities and i'll
skip over a couple of steps
but there's a step of coming in which if
i understand this correctly
the house has to say the election was
clean and certified
and i believe the house with i think
i heard you know one senator and one
congress person
can hold up the process and say wait the
election doesn't look fair to us
so maybe we can ignore it and and
just go ahead with the vote and pick
president trump because he would get
selected if the house does his selecting
now or at least there are more
republicans that doesn't guarantee it
but there are more republicans
so they could if they wanted to just
vote in the president if they thought
that was the right thing to do
and they legitimately thought the
election was stolen
they'd have to actually believe that or
say they believe it
now the laundry list doesn't just work
on
you and me it doesn't just work on the
general public
it also works on congress
because congress is a bunch of human
beings
so a bunch of human beings in congress
aren't going to be that much different
from a bunch of human beings anywhere
and we're all susceptible
to the laundry list the laundry list is
really strong
so that's the path
that the president has which is keep the
laundry list going
and hope that there's enough smoke there
that people will say oh yeah there had
to be a fire and even if we don't have
rock solid proof
yet maybe you get congress convinced
maybe they're convinced a heart
so that would be a path now compare that
which is pretty strong by the way you
know in terms of a
persuasion play it's not bad now if i
had to predict
i would predict that biden will take the
job
so my my prediction is that the system
will install biden but the trump
campaign is doing everything they can to
to make a difference there now compare
that to the the disinformation
campaign and watch how how well this is
done
so today i had uh people coming after me
on twitter
to say some version of uh hahaha
and dunk on me and what do you say now
about this
sydney powell thing because the
the trump administration and the
campaign issued a statement saying that
she did not work for the
administration did not work for trump
so and i guess she agrees with that
because she was not being paid by them
she's
sort of independent but related
and so that made her story about the
venezuelan whistleblower
and the the machines etc
uh that made that look even less
credible than it was before
so people came to me on twitter and said
hahaha scott
you said that there was going to be good
information coming
and it looks like even the trump
administration isn't buying this
venezuelan whistleblower thing so aren't
you so wrong
except i'm the one who said it wasn't
true
so now i'm getting dunked on for being
right that the venezuelan whistleblower
thing was not
credible and looked like disinformation
so the people who are dunking on me
agree with me
but this is how good disinformation
works
because the point of disinformation is
to spoil the rest of the information
it's not supposed to just live alone
it's supposed to be a spoiler
so that everything else you've heard you
go ah that's probably not true either
if this part wasn't true that part's not
true
so here's what the disinformation did
it took sydney powell right off the
field
now maybe she's still got some game left
she might have some plays left but at
the moment
it really really worked persuasion wise
it took
powell off the field it divided
the trump supporters certainly within
the
the inner circle you have to assume some
of them were buying into
the venezuelan story some were not
i assume you know i don't have any
inside knowledge so it
split the team it got rid of one of
their stronger players
and it took me out it took me out
because forever now the the fake news
will record
that i supported the venezuelan
whistleblower story when in fact
the clear public reality repeated a
number of times as i said exactly the
opposite
that i didn't believe it that's the one
you shouldn't believe
right so that's how good the
disinformation is
that i was not even part of being wrong
at any point
at least in terms of that specific thing
and yet
it took me out because i will never be
able to be credible on this
topic again because i will be blamed for
something that i wasn't even part of
that's how good it is somebody says
you're lying now
now let me get back to i think i know
why you're saying that
normally normally i would block you for
just saying something like you're lying
now because that's like mind reading or
something
but i think you're referring to um i i
did say
when sydney powell was originally coming
up with their claims
i did say that that that's going to be
something
now i'm going to give you some nuance
here
that at least a third of you won't be
able to handle because
in a big crowd a third of the people
can't handle nuance
it goes like this it can be true at the
same time
that the venezuelan whistleblower is
disinformation
while it is also true that any
software-based
election system will eventually be
compromised
now i'm just saying that's the nature of
the system
is it is a compromisable system which
there is a gigantic motive
to compromise so if it hasn't already
been compromised you can guarantee it
will be compromised eventually
because it's built for that i mean it's
it's not built to prevent it meaning
that there
the system itself is not sufficiently
secure
that you could ever guarantee that at
least an
insider didn't do something right you
might be able to keep somebody from
getting into it from the internet
directly
but there's nothing you can do to stop
an insider from getting at it
and there's nothing that would stop an
intelligence agency
from turning an insider and that's
pretty
ordinary business right so it can be
true
that you don't believe the
disinformation about the venezuelan
whistleblower
while at the same time i have a high
confidence that the system was hacked
or will be hacked if it hasn't been
already
now uh here's something that the
uh the head was the ceo
of dominion voting system said
quote uh this is a nonpartisan american
company
it is not physically possible for our
machines to switch votes
from one candidate to the other this is
a ceo
of a voting system who has a
software based product who says quote
it's not physically possible for our
machines
to switch votes
okay he's lying or
really stupid because it's software
right and haven't you seen plenty of you
know
youtube specials where people were
hacking
the machines right in front of you
yeah it's the most ridiculously
ridiculously
non-believable thing in the world that
they're not hackable
of course they're hackable come on
everything's hackable do you think
google is hackable
yes do you think twitter is hackable it
happened
it happened do you think facebook is
hackable
yes do you think that google
facebook and twitter have the highest
level of technical people
compared to this voting company
yeah yeah the very best
most protected systems in you know the
commercial world
get penetrated regularly it's not even
it's not even a question so of course
our electronic voting system is either
already compromised or will be
or will be because it's not like people
are going to stop trying
and if you have a situation where people
are going to stop trying they can fail
99 times out of 100
and still succeed because they keep
trying
all right so i would say that the uh
disinformation people who by the way
just to make this extra fun
i i'm reasonably sure
that that within that small group of
people who actually
pulled this off this venezuelan
whistleblower thing i think they're
watching this right now
[Laughter]
so for if any of you are watching this
who pulled this off
really good job good job
now did the laundry list work going back
to the republican
persuasion play here
here's the data the data is that 30
percent of democrats
believe the election was stolen from
trump
30 percent of democrats
think the election was stolen so how
good is trump's persuasion
it's really good that's really good and
of course 75 percent of republicans
believe it is likely the election was
stolen
so i would say both the
both the campaign trump campaign
as well as whoever it is the the dark
forces working for the biden campaign
this is good stuff this is really
top-level persuasion brilliance
um let's talk about something that's a
little more fun
so i told you people are coming after me
now because they
they think i was buying into the the
crazy parts of the
venezuelan story so a guy named peter
wang came
after me on uh on twitter
and he said this is uh this will give
you an idea of the quality of my trolls
they're they're smart and stupid at the
same time
and peter wang says 2020 season finale
is showing us the existence of epistemic
closure so tight that even intelligent
people
will stick their heads into themselves
in awkward ways so as to turn into human
kline bottles of stupidity
not a good look for scott
not a good look for me yes if you tweet
and and your tweet has the words
epistemic
closures and klein bottles in it
you're not a good tweeter you're not a
good tweeter
and one of the things that you should
never do
is start an insult contest with a
cartoonist
in public all right now if you were dumb
enough to start an insult contest
with a professional humorist in private
well nobody would know how stupid you
were that might work out for you
but you don't want to do it in public
because
i have a little more practice at this
and so noticing that peter wang has
a first name and the last name that are
a little bit phallic
a little bit phallic peter and wang
i tweeted back this response i said
look dick dick you don't disagree with
anything in that thread stop pretending
you do
so that's the other thing my critics do
is they
they go after me personally but they
will never tell you what they disagree
with
and the reason is they don't they don't
disagree
so i asked him to tell me what in my
tweet thread
it was the thread that he's complaining
about in which i have shown my stupidity
i said there's nothing in there you
disagree with
did he did he come back and say oh yeah
here's the part i disagree with
no he came back and insulted me again
because there was nothing he disagreed
with in the tweet
he just wanted to be a a dick dick
so that's the quality of my critics
here's another critic i got so
apparently uh
i'm on china's radar now if you don't
know this
uh there there are media entities
that pretend to be you know independent
media in china
that are really just organs of the
the communist government right so
i get i i get this clap back from uh
this chinese individual chen
hua i think and when he tweets at me
twitter
uh puts a warning on his tweet
and complain as you will about twitter
with their little warnings
this one i appreciate it because twitter
is the one that made sure i knew i would
have known this anyway
but twitter made sure i knew that this
tweet came some
came from somebody associated with the
chinese government
so they they actually added that label
on the tweet good job twitter
um you know i would have known but i
don't know if anybody would
everybody would have known so that was a
good label i appreciated that one
um so this is what chen says about me
now keep in mind if he's saying it
probably he's doing it as an organ of
the
government it doesn't mean he got a
specific instruction to send this tweet
but rather he's uh he's operating you
know within that umbrella for the
benefit of the
the government and he tweets this at me
he says
can't believe so many in the u.s like to
flirt instead of learning
from china i don't know what that means
like to flirt instead of learning from
china
and other east asian nations and regions
politicizing the virus
is what made the situation in the u.s so
bad
like a failed state so
so here's an official chinese guy
who's clapping back at me and it was in
response to one of my tweets
that he wrote that so i tweeted back to
him and i said so
how do china beat the virus on all ears
now here's the advantage that i have in
this conversation
i can say anything i want you know so
long as
it's within twitter's guidelines but if
you're
sort of representing the chinese
government there's some topics you
probably don't want to get into in
public
so so watch me set the trap
okay so i asked so how china beat the
virus
because i wanted to see him deal with
this question here's how he answered
he goes the rigorous contact tracing
isolation and quarantine
which is key in china and east asia is
virtually non-existent in the u.s and
europe
it takes huge efforts not to mention the
masks and social distancing
all well observed now do you believe
that
do you believe that the reason that
china is doing so well
is that they had rigorous contact
tracing isolation and quarantine
and mass and social distancing
good do you think that explains the
whole situation
and then he went on to say that south
korea
doing great same thing contact tracing
same thing as china wear the masks
lots of compliance and then you pointed
to
indonesia i believe indonesia very
similar
right lots of masks and
probably did some contact tracing very
similar so he's making a good case right
he's made his case that the people who
acted like china
got the same result so it must be the
way china is acting
because people who imitated it also got
good results
except accept do you know who else got a
good result
japan and do you know
what japan did that is so similar to
what china did
to get a good result china got a good
result
japan got a good result how did japan do
it
nobody knows but they didn't do this yet
they didn't do the the severe lockdown
the severe masking
you know they just didn't do it i don't
think they did the contact tracing
either
so you've got another asian country that
didn't do any of that stuff
or they didn't do them at the same rate
or degree
they were i think they were closer to
maybe the european model
so i you know of course pointed that out
as well and also pointed out that south
korea and indonesia
and anything that's an island tends to
do better
now i think the island part matters
because it's easier to
close out you know outside infections
i'm not positive about that but there's
certainly a correlation if not a
causation
and so here's the part that got fun
i asked them how all these south these
asian countries did so well
and i tweeted this i said other than a
weaponized virus
and then parenthetically i put for which
there's no proof
there's no proof how to explain how
china did well in all asia this is
before i talked about japan
no matter the method so why is it that
oh this is actually after japan so so i
said why is it that
uh these asian companies countries are
all doing well
yet they're using different methods in
other words japan isn't doing what china
did
and they're doing well so
how do you explain it now here is the
persuasion part
that was entertaining to me the last
thing that somebody representing or
speaking under the umbrella of official
chinese government wants to hear
in public is that the only other
explanation i can think of is a
weaponized virus
which by the way there is no proof of
let me say that again there is no proof
of any kind of a weaponized coronavirus
no proof um
but what's the other explanation so the
other explanations that people
weighed in with is that the these same
countries had
experience with prior coronavirus or
prior other infections that gave them
immunity do you buy that
is that enough do you think that china
got down to
basically no coronavirus problems
because of their prior infections
i don't i i'm not going to say that this
is a weaponized
virus i'm going to say that all of the
other explanations don't
handle the observation okay now i think
it would be crazy
for any country to intentionally let out
a virus
that could cause this much trouble
especially if it did kill some
some people in your own country i don't
see anybody doing that
i mean i suppose anything's possible
but i don't see it it is however the
only explanation
that fits the observation that the
country is
in a certain part with a certain genetic
commonality perhaps genetic commonality
don't be they don't be so they're not
suffering as much no matter what
technique they use
to fight the virus so i don't think
chen wanted me to talk about weaponized
viruses even though there's no proof
no proof that such a thing happened
um
yeah all right so you know
i don't know about you but one of the
things i'm looking forward to
is not being in the kill box
you know if you're a prominent trump
supporter
you're just always attacked all day long
it's just nothing but attacks all day
long
and i gotta say that although my first
choice would be a second term
of trump i
i think i could be pretty happy not
being the
you know having a target on my back all
day long
i don't mind that at all um
and i was listening to biden talk
yesterday and some recorded things on
smurkonish's
um serious show and by the way let me
give a shout out to smirkanish
uh you know him from cnn
he is the most uh fair and balanced
opinion person on cnn by far
i don't know i don't know if you've
noticed that but smirkandish when he
talks about
even when he's criticizing the president
he will talk about it with objective
statements that you recognize as true
it's like oh yeah that did happen
they did do that but when other people
talk about it they
they talk about mind reading and
flailing around and all kinds of crazy
stuff he doesn't do that
smirkandish you know i feel like i can
detect his opinion
which that's no surprise you can kind of
detect everybody's opinion on
on trump but he does a really
professional job
i i take my hat off to him i was
listening to him yesterday he was doing
that again
being very professional about this and
even he was saying that biden sounds
uh weak and low energy and
he just sounds so like there's nothing
in him
and he was answering questions and it
was like uh yeah yeah we should you know
do this
and we'll do this and i thought oh my
god i'm gonna fall asleep before he
finishes that sentence
and then this morning i heard a brief
clip of
trump talking whatever whatever he
announcement he made yesterday
and then you hear trump's projection and
the energy and the power he puts into
just talking
you know just talking about an ordinary
topic and it just like
fills the room i mean the star power
you don't really understand how big
trump's star power is
until you see biden doing the job of
president
it's going to be jarring it really will
be when you see how
how little energy he produces he's like
a 15 watt bulb
all right um here's an interesting
thought
the that disinformation campaign i was
talking about allegedly about the
venezuelan whistleblower
could backfire because if it convinces
anybody in the republican
part of congress to
to say no to the election integrity
it backfired i don't know how many
people are going to believe that story
but could backfire you never know um
joe biden is picking his
cabinet and of course because it's the
simulation and i told you that the
simulation would be winking at us
more often the guy that would be really
key to negotiating with our adversaries
the guy who would be the secretary of
state under biden
his last name is blinken
the it's exactly the word that you don't
want to have in your name
if you're negotiating well
he blinked first my guy's blinking he's
blinking hard
that's just a weird simulation thing
all right here's a question for you um
trump is asking for a machine recount in
georgia they already did the hand
recount
now i can't imagine that the machinery
count is going to do anything
because they can't do a signature check
as i understand it
the the ability to do a signature check
ends
on election day because they separate
the envelopes
and signatures from the votes that's my
understanding
so is it even possible to audit
i i don't really understand
how the trump campaign could possibly
prove
that votes were illegal
if they can't audit the signatures and
that doesn't sound like that's even a
thing that can be done
so unless you had uh eyewitnesses
and even if you had eyewitnesses you
know imagine
imagine the supreme court is hearing
this story
and all you have is eyewitnesses and
you've got an eyewitness that says i was
in this precinct
and my boss said do this or that with
this little pile
of blank ballots i think
the supreme court is going to say
something like this
how how tall was that pile of ballots
and they're going to say i was about an
inch tall
that's not enough to change the election
we're done here
and that's it so the anecdotal stuff
can support let's say data or some kind
of
documentary evidence but you would need
something in cumulative that adds up to
enough votes
that it could have changed the election
and the problem that rudy and the
lawyers have
is that even if they've got 200
completely valid testimonies
probably if you added all of them up it
wouldn't
be enough votes even if every one of
them was true
and and the the judge believed every one
of them
so the the question about why um
why it's taking so long for the the good
the good argument i guess they've only
used bad arguments so far
but the good argument is going to be
both witnesses
and then the the data and maybe the
documentation
that coincides with those witnesses and
that
takes a little more time to put together
so people who are
smarter than i am about the law have
come to
dunk on me on twitter and say scott
scott scott
if they had good information
they would have led with the good
information and since they didn't
let me tell you as a lawyer this is what
people are saying to me
as a lawyer let me tell you that proves
pretty much that there is no good
evidence
because you start with the good evidence
indeed
have i not said the same thing i've said
the same thing
i think it's in my book that if you have
good evidence
you're going to lead with it anybody who
starts out with bad evidence
well you can just say all right we're
done here if you started with bad
evidence that doesn't that means you
don't have any good evidence
right makes sense you would always start
with the good evidence
so why didn't they well how about you
live in the real world
how about a normal good lawsuit takes a
a year to put together
how about you don't know which of those
statements from those sworn testimonies
are real
you got to sort of look into them
because what you don't want to do is go
into court
with your strongest case that also has
some weak
parts accidentally attached to it
because it'll make the whole thing fall
apart
so you don't want to go into with your
with your evidence until it's really
tight
and i imagine that takes a while so
does that mean that there is evidence
well the evidence that will be by far
the strongest
will be the fake ballots and the ballots
thrown away in the ballots
may have been run through the machine
twice although that seems like that's
something they could catch
with the recounts i think it's gonna be
that it's gonna be ordinary stuff
with just ballot mischief
and somebody says you don't have to be a
lawyer to figure that out i don't know
if you're agreeing with me or disagree
with me there
all right so i don't know that any of
the
challenges that the trump team is doing
i don't think they can get an audit
of the kind that they need
i i'm looking for a fact check on that
but if you can't
if you can't check that the ballots
really came from a real person
and i think you can't check that once
the signatures are removed
so that's that's the part i'm a little
foggy on
so fact check me on this is there any
way to audit this
election because i think there's not can
somebody fact check me on that
and so i think that what will happen is
that this will
go the way of kennedy versus nixon
which is kennedy took office
but historians historians could later
you know look at the the facts and say
uh it looks like
the election was stolen and that nixon
actually won
so i think that's what that's what we're
going to end up with that sort of thing
and you would probably have to do that
with the the data
analysis to show that things are
impossible
now by the way there is there is a claim
hanging out there that i've been waiting
for the debunk
and i haven't heard it so i'm gonna ask
you have you seen a debunk of the
following
claim that there are a number of
precincts which had far more voters
than they had far more votes than voters
is that a real thing because i feel as
if
that should have been debunked on the
first day
because i would think that we know how
many voters we know how many voted
so if that claim which i keep hearing
i i kept expecting that would be the
first one to be debunked
have you seen that one debunked yet
somebody says that the election can be
audited
uh not with signatures but other aspects
well
other aspects may not be enough
all right so that's enough on that
uh they're going to be some interesting
pardons
if this is trump's last few months in
office
do you think you should pardon snowden
and assange
i say yes because i think those
those two know things that we should
know
uh so yes i think trump should pardon
assange
and snowden if only because it will make
the
intelligence agencies really really mad
you know the the brennans etc are really
really going to hate that
and i think he might do it just just for
a final poke in the eye
so if i had to put a bet on it
it's looking pretty good for pardons
even if he doesn't want to
i think he might still do it even if
it's not something he personally wants
uh reuters did a tweet today and they
it's it's funny watching these news
businesses completely give up
on being objective news so this is what
reuters says they say trump's campaign
distance itself from
lawyer sydney powell who has aided the
president's flailing effort
to contest the results it's a flailing
effort
flailing is kind of an opinion word
here is how they could have said it
without the opinion
distance herself from trump's effort
which has so far
failed uh 26 and 27 lawsuits or
something like that
you could simply describe it you don't
have to call it
flailing right
you don't have to call it flailing
um i would love to see
trump get put pence in charge on the
last day
and have pence uh i don't know the
legality of this but could he pardon
trump for everything that happened
prior to and during his presidency is
that a thing
can can a president issue a pardon that
says i don't even know what you
you might be charged with in the future
but
everything from this date backwards
you're pardoned is that a thing
i don't know if you can do that or do
you need to be pardoning
with specificity all right
uh i'm seeing some yeses but i don't
know if you're answering the right
question
i'd love to see that because i'd like to
see i would like to see trump
be completely free of those risks
should he leave office i'd like that
i think it's good for the country i
would say that about any president by
the way
there's a really interesting uh opinion
piece by
shelby in the wall street journal fox
news
has an excerpt from it and let me just
read you this one
sentence from it now shelby steele is
a black man in america which is
important to the story
someday we'll we'll never have to say
that again
but here's what he wrote he said uh it's
part of a larger article but he goes yet
there's an elephant in the room it is
simply that we blacks
aren't much victimized anymore today we
are free to build a life that won't be
stunted by racial persecution
today we are far more likely to
encounter racial preferences
than racial discrimination moreover we
live in a society that generally shows
us good will
a society that has isolated racism
as its most unforgivable sin
it was that sentence that just
lit up my my brain this is such a good
sentence
like just as a writer you know if you're
a writer and you see a good sentence
you just go oh wow this is pretty good i
have to read this again
moreover we live in a society that
generally shows us good will
a society that has isolated racism
as its most unforgivable sin that is
just such a good sentence
but here's what caught my attention also
about this
so his statement is wildly provocative
right
so i'm giving you his opinion not my own
which is part of the story i can i can
tell you what his opinion is but i can't
give you my own
because uh you know i get cancelled but
he's saying that
uh there are more more likely to
to encounter racial preferences for
being black in other words
let's say getting into college or
getting hired by a fortune 500 company
that
wants their diversity to be improved
and i would like to reintroduce my idea
that to get past uh
racism as best we can you know some
things
can't be 100 solved but to get that past
as best we can we should reframe our
experience
away from racism no racism
fair no fair and and have strategic
parity strategic equality and what i
mean by that is
my path to success might be different
than your path
but we both have a perfectly good path
and there's no
there's no one is not worse than the
other so
if i were black i'd say oh i'll build a
strategy that works for me
being black so i would um
study hard in school probably get a
scholarship to a good college
uh and then get a job at a major
corporation
that's looking for people like me and
that would be my path
it's very very clear path
and a very good one like that can get
you to the top of
a big corporation very high pay it's an
excellent path and it's really available
to a hundred percent
of people who can do well in school at
the very least
so does every black person have the same
opportunities that i specifically have
maybe not
there might be some small company that
says ah
you know they're racist you know or
something like that
so we don't have the same path but
strategically they're very similar
and i think that's the the frame we
should keep in our mind
is we don't have to walk down the same
path we just want to get to the same
place
if my path goes left yours goes right we
both get there
i'm not going to complain that you've
got a path i don't have
i'm going to say i got a path you've got
a path
it's a tie and then here's the
final irony of this shelby steel piece
uh he's a really good writer
is that i couldn't have written it
so his point is that he's more likely to
encounter racial preferences
than discrimination and his his article
is an example of that because what he
wrote
i couldn't have written without getting
canceled now of course i couldn't have
written it also because i don't have you
know that experience that blah blah blah
but so i wouldn't be credible saying it
but i also couldn't
even make the point i can talk about him
making the point
but i can't make that point without
getting cancelled
so his his point is well made there are
some advantages
also disadvantages
unlike many of you i do believe that
systemic racism
is real what you do about it
i think i stand alone in terms of what
to do about it
but it's definitely real all right
and that is all i have for today
and i think it was wonderful
and uh if this if the simulation
so somebody in the comments says poor
scott
he falls for a critical race theory did
i say that
did you hear me say that so this is my
continual
experience is that uh people will
imagine i have an opinion that i don't
have i have the opposite of that opinion
and then i will get blamed for it so
even
even now while we're sitting here i'm
being blamed
for supporting something called critical
race theory
which i am definitely opposed to but
here i am being blamed for it right in
real time
i'm being blamed for the opposite of my
actual opinion
so thanks for that all right that's all
for now
all right you youtubers got any more uh
mind reading and bad
bad takes on my opinion
pardon joe biden and hunter that would
be hilarious
somebody says critical race theory
foundation
so somebody here is saying that systemic
racism
and critical race theory are basically
connected not in my opinion
so when i say that there is uh
the systemic racism is real i mean it in
this specific sense
that black people in general
started from a lower base
and that that has a ripple through time
that's all
is there anybody who doesn't agree with
that do you think that if
uh if any group it doesn't matter who it
is if any group
started with literally nothing starting
from slavery
and you fast forward 150 years would you
expect everybody to be doing the same
it's just sort of common sense now the
other stuff
you know the the details of it i don't
buy into that stuff but
certainly if you start from behind
there is a greater likelihood you're
going to stay there that's all i think
it's just common sense
um what are your thoughts on election
oversight by
comments are going by too quickly i
think we have to rethink
the whole election process and i'll tell
you how i would do it
cameras are really cheap i would say
that you can't
do any ballot handling unless you're in
a room that has
uh ceiling cameras every five feet
enough so you can actually read a ballot
i feel as if
you shouldn't be able to have a ballot
in your hand unless there's a camera
directly above you
everywhere now it can't be that
expensive to add
cameras right i mean there's a lot of
small places that maybe can't afford it
but you don't have to do all the small
ones you could just do the big
metropolitan ones because that's where
all the volume is so
i'd say camera the heck out of it that
would be one thing
uh yeah i i know i can scroll the
comments to
pause them being lazy
all right that's all i got for now and i
will talk to you
