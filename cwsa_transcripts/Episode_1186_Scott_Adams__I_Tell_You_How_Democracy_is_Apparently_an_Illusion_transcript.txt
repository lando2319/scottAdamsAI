hey everybody
come on in it's time it's time again
for the best part of the day it's coffee
with scott adams
yes now i hear from some of you
that this is the part of the program you
hate the most
you hate it when i do the simultaneous
sip some of you
some of you love it but those of you who
hate it
you know that part of the reason i do it
is that you can visually tell
where to fast forward to that's right
it's for your benefit
even if you don't like it and all you
need to do to
enjoy the simultaneous hip
is well you need to get yourself a
copper margaret glass a tanker chelsea
stein a canteen flask a vessel of
any kind
fill it with your favorite i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine hair of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and
watch it happen right now
uh-huh uh-huh that was a good one
every single time now
let us go through the things that are
happening
there are many things happening in the
news would you like
the fun things first okay
here's an idea for uh from randall
parker
on the internet on twitter and randall
says
why don't we test the coronavirus
vaccines on cruise ships
to which my brain says boing
yeah why don't we why don't we test
the coronavirus vaccine on cruise ships
can you think of a better idea than that
that's literally one of the best ideas
of the entire coronavirus
situation now there might be some
medical reason you can't do that
but i can't think of a better deal than
getting a cruise and
testing the vaccine at the same time it
feels like a natural
thing to do all right
i i was reading some of the youtube
comments on these uh live streams so i
don't get to see them all as they're
screaming by
i see as many as i can but i uh
i was reading them after the fact this
morning and boy
you can't you can't fully understand
how little people understand you what
you're saying
until you read comments about yourself
it's it's it's the damnedest experience
and one that i think gives me an
advantage in understanding people
imagine if you go through life
and you have normal amount of
conversations with people and
interactions and in your mind you think
to yourself
well obviously they understood what i
said
because it was so simple i communicated
clearly
said what i wanted to say it appeared
they were listening and when i walked
away
i think they understood what i said
that's sort of the illusion that you're
under all the time
because if you weren't under that
illusion you would go nuts you wouldn't
know how to
operate in life but if you say a bunch
of things
and then you have this unique experience
that i have every day
which is i can see what people's
reaction is
to the totally simple and
non-provocative things that i'm saying
and it's just crazy and until you
see how
crazy ordinary people can respond
to your very simple and
non-controversial statements
you don't really know how crazy the
world is you see it a little bit on
twitter
but when you're the when you're the
focus of those comments
you really see the the craziness all
right
for reasons that i don't fully
understand
my audience is just going through the
roof
now i'd like to say it's because of the
excellent content
which i provide every day but
my content isn't that much better than
last year
yeah i thought it was pretty good last
year or at least as good as this year
but the traffic went from a baseline of
er
this is youtube in particular i'm
talking about to just
it went straight up and just went
through the roof
now i think that youtube probably
figured out their algorithm
because as much as you think they're uh
they might be suppressing conservative
voices and i
imagine there's some of that going on
that they also want to monetize as much
as they can
and it's harder for them to monetize
anything that has
keywords in it that advertisers don't
like so if you use any of those keywords
the algorithm isn't smart enough to make
a a logical decision that oh yeah they
use the keywords
but it's not really that provocative
they're just talking about something
so i think they may have got on top of
that
so suddenly my youtube traffic is
through the roof
and my at the same time my twitter
followers
just screamed past 600 000 in the last
month
and i've said that your ability to
change the world
is a combination of your effectiveness
or your persuasive skill
and your reach how many people you can
get to
so i'm a trained persuader as as you
know so i've
studied persuasion i'm a trained
hypnotist so if you take
that kind of skill set whether it's me
or anybody who has a
similar talent stack and you
let them have access to lots and lots of
people
it's a pretty big force to be reckoned
with you just put
reach and talent together and suddenly
things can happen
and i've uh i've tongue-in-cheek
estimated that if i ever reached
1 million twitter followers that i could
effectively control the world
now there's no magic to 1 million it's
just a big round number
and i you know so i wouldn't take that
too seriously
but um the estimate
on one estimator is that at my current
rate i would have 1 million twitter
followers by i think
august of 2021
so what's going to happen if i have more
twitter followers
i'm actually curious myself because
you've if you've been watching me for
this election cycle and longer you've
seen
instances in which i can move the needle
or it looks like it
there are things that even right now i
can sort of cause to change
in the world but what happens what
happens if i have a million followers
do i you know does it does it increase
i think it does why wouldn't it so
we'll see what happens there yeah and
there are a lot of people who have
you know millions of followers but what
they don't have is
a persuasion talent stack but if they
did
what would happen
tim uh over on the locals platform where
where i have my stuff you don't get to
see publicly
uh over there it's locals.com by the way
it's a subscription service
so you can see more of my stuff
especially on
goals and systems versus goals and how
to succeed
i put that stuff over there anyway tim
over on locals
points out that joe biden's middle name
and i'm not making this up is robinette
r-o-b-i-n-e-t-t-e
interesting name but as tim points out
the way you read it is robin it
joe robinette biden
and it's kind of looks at least to trump
supporters like he's
sort of stealing the election and his
middle name
is robin it what are the odds
that the guy is stealing the election
according to trump's supporters
uh his middle name would be robin it
joe are you trying to steal this
election my middle name is robin it
i mean what am i going to do
i saw a story that i believe has low
credibility
so can you keep this in mind
before i tell you this story put your
low credibility
filter on this it's just something i saw
on the internet
but i think it's it's interesting enough
that even though the
likelihood that it's true might be
low-ish
not zero but
maybe 50 50. i i wouldn't give this more
than a 50
chance of being true but it goes like
this
that one of the founders and
key people at dominion voting systems
the voting software that people are
suspecting of
mischief which has not been demonstrated
at this point at least publicly has not
been demonstrated
publicly not publicly now there's
i have not seen anything that would be
considered proof
that there is mischief in the voting
systems so i say this
to avoid being cancelled on the internet
so let me say it again
i have not personally seen something
that i could personally
personally validate
as any kind of proof that there's
anything wrong with our voting system
okay we'll say more about this but i
want to be careful about what i say
next so the accusation is this comes
from
pt news some conservative website so who
knows
and and then also uh conservative daily
podcast host
joe altman i think he's been he's
already been banned from
twitter or suspended or something
so that that's the level of information
we're dealing with
one of the people has been suspended
from twitter
but the accusation is that one of the
founders of
the dominion voting systems
is antifa friendly
not a member but there are some tweets
that some people suggest are
anti-friendly
but i don't make that claim because i
don't think it's uh
you know i don't see it myself but
he's uh one of the per and i'm not even
going to say his name but one of the
principals
in that company uh you graduated from
the university of california berkeley
one of my alma maters and
here's the question he's an american
right so don't you think
that a hundred percent of americans have
a strong opinion about
politics this year maybe not every year
before that
but is it fair to say that whoever are
the executives
and their americans apparently whoever
these american founders and executives
of this voting system
don't you think they have strong
opinions
wouldn't you say i would say that
they're just like everybody else
there's no reason to think that you and
i and every single person you know has a
strong opinion
about who should be president but
they're the only ones who don't
i mean that's not believable so we have
a system
in which the people who are the the
gatekeepers of the
software the system that will tell us
who won
have a real strong interest in one
person winning versus the other
only because they're human i'm not even
making a comment
about any specific people and i think
the allegations about
antifa is probably an interpretation
as opposed to you know any smoking gun
sort of thing
but how do we live with a system in
which the principals
have a strong let's say incentive
to rig the system i'm not saying they
did
i'm saying that they have a strong
incentive and clearly
have the capability if you have both the
capability and
a very strong incentive is that a system
that you would call credible
would you trust that voting system if
it's the only thing you knew
is that the people who had access to the
the inner
gears of it had a strong preference of
who won
that's all you know
thank you for that little tip which is
not so tip
i certainly noticed that you're very
you're you're much too kind and i
appreciate it
um
so there's that um
it seems to me that democracy is now
clearly just an illusion with the
exception of
extreme cases if you have a case where
somebody wins an election 70 to 30
that probably is the will of the people
being expressed
but most of our elections at least at
the federal level
the ones that matter seem to be really
close
is it not fair to say that any
close election in this country is no
longer about the voters
because you've got your you know
persuasion brainwashing going on
in the media and that's not really about
the will of the people
because the will of the people is being
circumvented by brainwashing
that's what brainwashing is it is
removing the will of the person
and replacing it with the will of
somebody else so you know we've got
brainwashing
you know you've got all these legal
machinations including
pennsylvania maybe 10 000 votes have
been reversed
because of a technical legal ruling may
or may not matter in the long run
but it feels like it doesn't have
anything to do with voting anymore
right you've got your foreign
interference you've got your
social media memes you've got your
conservatives maybe being
throttled this all makes a difference
you've got
the timing of things you've got the
coronavirus changed the mechanism of
voting
which definitely changed the result so
the only thing that didn't matter
was the voters right wouldn't you say
wouldn't you say that the only thing
that didn't matter
in this presidential election is the
voters we literally didn't matter
at all it's a it's now just a trickster
competition
can the lawyers be more clever
than the fraudsters at the same time
that the persuaders
and the brainwashers are brainwashing
you
while the lawyers are lawyering and the
tricksters are hiding
that's all it is now there's nothing
left
of the republic slash democratic process
it's gone now it still exists
for any situation that's you know
unbalanced
like i said if if one candidate got 90
of the votes it wouldn't matter what the
news was saying it wouldn't matter
anything else because the voters would
have the power in that situation but not
this situation
not where you can't even tell who won a
week after the election
that's a that's a situation in which
democracy
is well and completely gone
but i don't know that it's bad isn't
that weird let me say the other thing
that uh maybe i'm the only person in the
united states who would say this next
thing
if you have a presidential election
where it's legitimately close
meaning that the will of the people is
uh it's a pretty split
let's say one person gets 51 and the
other gets 49.
but what if what if that little
difference
that made a winner versus a loser what
if that little difference was fraud
what if are you worse off
is the country can could you say with
confidence
that the country is worse off because it
got the 49
vote getter versus the 51.
not really it's not like the the voters
were so smart
that they knew which one would do the
better job 41-59
says that the voters have no idea who
would be better
they have no idea right so
anyway i'm sure i had some other point
there but let's move on
um part of this gigantic brainwashing
operation
involves marginalizing anybody who's
complaining about the outcome
right so if you raise your your hand or
you put your head up above the foxhole
and you're saying you know
i i would like to have a little bit of
an
audit on this result or
maybe we should do a little recount or
i suspect there might have been some
fraud we should just
look into it if you say something like
that
you are opposing the system which once a
biden
biden victory and wants it to be clean
you will be targeted
so do you think i have been targeted
does anybody
think that the powers that
you know persuade do you think that they
will target me
because i seem to be supportive of the
president
and the answer is the splc just labeled
me a right-wing social media performer
and included me in a obviously the splc
southern poverty law center their job is
finding
hate groups and reporting it to social
media platforms etc
so that those platforms can
cancel those hate groups so now i've
just been put in an article
with the president because the president
tweeted something
i said on the topic so now i'm i'm now
i'm not on a hate group right so the
splc doesn't have me on a hate group
but if you were to google my name
it would now come up i suppose you'd
have to look down a few results
but you would see that i'm described by
the southern part of the british law
center
a group whose primary mission is to find
hate groups
and they have an article that includes
me now
and they called me as i said a
right-wing
social media performer is that accurate
would you call me a right-wing social
media performer
politically i'm left of bernie but my
audience
is definitely conservative so that part
is true
it's sort of a clever way to get me on
the hate list
without any evidence that i belong on a
hate list
you see what i mean do you see how
cleverly
they they're marginalizing me
at the same time the cnn had christian
amanpour
do a uh i guess a big piece in which she
compared
trump and presumably his supporters to
hitler
with images of hitler doing stuff and
kristallnacht and and this is an actual
legitimate cnn
opinion piece with images and pictures
comparing trump's you know whatever
actions he's taken lately and presumably
his supporters as actual nazis
now why do they do that is it because
they think that is an
accurate description of what is
happening
can't read minds so i don't know for
sure
but i doubt it i kind of doubt it
i believe this is suppressive fire
the the point of it is to make sure that
if you were thinking of raising your
hand
or coming out of the foxhole and saying
you know i've now seen enough
that even i'm starting to doubt this
election credibility
i didn't before but now i'm starting to
doubt it myself
would you come out of your foxhole if
you've been labeled a
nazi sympathizer by cnn
because that's what's happening right
that's exactly what's happening so
making sure you would be labeled as a
nazi
if you disagree with the outcome which
is clearly
a non-credible outcome non-credible in
the
sense that i was just describing which
is it's a competition with
tricksters and fraudsters and lawyers
and
rule makers and persuaders it has
nothing to do with democracy anymore
so that's just an illusion on top of it
uh the department of homeland security
is getting in on the action
listen to the specificity of this
statement
because it's funny all right so the
department of family and security says
they issued a statement saying that the
2020 election was
and i quote the most secure election in
history
do you think that's true do you think
that the 2020 election was the most
secure system
in history now i assume that they mean
american history right maybe it means
world history but
let's let's take it in the smallest
meaning of american history
do you think it could be true that 2020
was the most
secure election in history
i do i believe that completely
i think that is a completely true and
i'll bet you could even objectively
prove it
i'll bet if if anybody challenged
this claim that this was the most secure
election in history i'll bet they could
prove that
i'll bet they would say look you know
this used to be less secure and we fix
this or we check this or we're using
this kind of system and it's better than
the old system
i'll bet it's true i'll bet it is the
most
secure election in history
i also believe it was fraudulent
those two things can be the same do you
believe
that our elections have been fair in
history
do you think we've ever had a fair
election in this country
my guess is no my guess is we've never
had one
we just didn't know it here's
my theory about why the inner cities are
doing
so poorly uh without getting into detail
i have just enough personal experience
to know
that you really can't work with these
cities even if you wanted to help
you can't really work with the cities
because the local city governments
are completely corrupt they're just
thoroughly corrupt
now how do you get inner cities that are
thoroughly corrupt
and it lasts for years
wouldn't you expect that a thoroughly
corrupt
government would do a bad job everybody
would see it was a bad job
hey the murders are going up and and the
economy is going down and they're
you know people on the streets everybody
would notice
if the government did a bad job you
couldn't
not notice it so how would you explain
the governments that do not just a bad
job
but horrible job i mean the worst job
you could possibly do
for years and years and years and years
and their party still gets elected
how do you explain that there's only one
explanation
the free market would have eliminated
the bad politicians eventually
maybe not in four years but we're
talking about decades
over a period of decades bad people
would be replaced
under a democratic system where you
could see the results of their work
oh that's not good work i guess we'll
vote for somebody else
the fact that that hasn't happened
in decades pretty much guarantees that
we've never had fair elections
at least at the local level now if the
local level
you could say at least from an
observational standpoint
without the benefit of having specific
evidence in my hand
it seems obvious that none of these city
local elections have been fair
maybe for decades what are the odds
that all of those local ones would be
fixed
but the national ones would not be
what are the odds of that if the only
thing you knew was that each of the
local
city elections were rigged if you knew
that was true
let's take that as a hypothetical if you
knew it was true
why would you believe the national
elections had not
fallen to the same the same thing it
wouldn't make sense
of course it would if it works locally
you just do the same thing you're doing
locally when there's a national election
do you know what it looks like when you
vote locally
let me give you an example
here's here's the ballot box this will
be conceptual
here's your vote here's you sticking it
in
that's that's what a local election
looks like what does a national election
look like
same ballot box same voter
here's your vote for the national
election
put in the box it's the same freaking
thing
how in the world would people who were
fixing
one local election after another
not fix the national election of course
they would
of course they would has it ever
happened now
wouldn't you say to yourself scott scott
scott
we are being told repeatedly and from
all the right people the people who
actually would know
you'd think that there is not any
widespread
fraud of the kind you're talking about
it just doesn't exist
so if that were true you certainly would
not have any
examples of it because if it doesn't
exist how could you have an example of
it
well here's an example of something that
doesn't exist
you've got a former philadelphia
election official
has pleaded guilty to taking thousands
of dollars in bribes
to stuff the ballot boxes for democrats
in local races
between 2014 and 2016. so this is not
about this election
but 24 2014 through 2016
not too long ago not too long ago was it
um he is he's pleaded guilty
all right so there's no longer any
question about whether it happened
he's charged with the crime he pleaded
guilty
you certainly wouldn't plead guilty to
stuffing ballot boxes if you didn't do
it
who who would plead guilty to that
because
unless they have pretty darn good
evidence you're not going to go to jail
for
not stuffing ballot boxes just because
they said you did
so i think we could say that in
philadelphia
huh coincidentally one of the within one
of the states that are
close for trump that in 2014 and 2016 we
do know
that somebody took thousands of dollars
to stuff ballot boxes for democrats
so i would say that that's now just a
fact
all right um why would somebody
pay anybody thousands of dollars to
stuff a ballot box
would you do it because you think it
works
maybe would that be the reason because
you think it works
so obviously the guy who who stuffed the
ballot boxes
he probably thinks it works the people
who paid him
they think it works why do all these
people think it works
what do they know that you don't know
now he did get caught
but do you think that the guy who got
caught and pleaded guilty to stuff in
the ballot boxes
do you think that there's something
natural in the way that
voting works that he had to get caught
in other words
is this a is this an example of the
opposite
of what you think could it be that the
system for catching cheaters is so good
that this one guy who tried to cheat
well it was pretty dumb of you one guy
because we caught you so maybe this one
example of
of this guy is the only one right
maybe we caught the only guy who tried
do you believe that
in in all of your experience on this
earth
do you believe we caught the one guy
no no there's no chance he's the one guy
there's no chance of that do i have
evidence of that can i prove that there
are more like this guy
nope don't have any but i have been
alive
for a while i have existed in the real
world
and let me tell you um something that
i've said before
but it's it's it's good to reinforce it
that whenever you have the following
situation you can predict what's going
to come out of it
and the following situation is you've
got
an opportunity to cheat so there's an
opportunity it can be done
the philadelphia example shows you that
it can be done
right and i would guess that not all the
people who did it got caught
but it can be done it also has a
gigantic upside potential
what would be bigger than changing who
is the president right
so the potential upside is great
and there are a lot of people involved
now the reason i add that one is
if you only had one person who had the
opportunity to cheat
nobody else could do it it was just that
one person you could find
that you found the only honest person or
the one person who didn't have an
incentive to cheat perhaps
so if it was only one person you'd say
well might be fair
maybe you got a fair person in there but
if you have a lot of people
as you do in an election there's always
somebody who's willing to cheat
a hundred percent of the time a hundred
percent
not 99.9 100 of the time
as long as you have enough people
involved in the system
so that ex describes our election system
very high upside from winning pretty low
chance of getting caught
apparently and lots of people involved
under those conditions massive fraud
should happen every time every time
as long as those conditions are met
you can't even stop fraud it's pretty
much guaranteed
you just don't know how much now over
time you'd expect that if it works on a
small scale
that it would grow right but it can't
grow
beyond the point where you notice it
right
so your fraud only works if you know to
take it well
up to the point of winning but not
beyond that point you don't want to
overshoot the mark because then it's
just a little too
obvious right well here's the
here's one uh hypothesis
of what we observed in this election
probably there are lots of different
ways that
one could cheat in an election
hypothetically
you could get into the software you
could create
fake maybe fake ballots
you could count ballots that shouldn't
be counted and i could probably
list a half a dozen other ways that you
could cheat
if you were if you were inclined to do
that
i'm guessing that because this president
trump was painted by the press as a you
know
a hitler existential threat my guess is
that
every one of those ways of cheating were
activated this year
so if you're saying to yourself which
way did they cheat
you're probably asking the wrong
question
in all likelihood everybody who knew how
to cheat in a certain way
did it so if there was anybody who knew
how to cheat with software
they did it if there was anybody who
knew how to cheat
by getting dead people to vote they did
it
if there's anybody who knew how to get
fake ballots printed and i don't know if
any of this is possible by the way
i'm just saying that if any of it were
possible
oh it happened it happened
and again it could not happen
it couldn't not happen
because the incentive and the
opportunity were off the chart
there's never been this much incentive
to rig an election
never close in the united states you
know maybe
if if hitler had run for office you know
maybe there'd be
that much incentive to get rid of him
but trump was painted as hitler
of course the democrats cheated and let
me say this
if they believed if the democrats
believed
their own news and they actually thought
that trump was
all the things that the news says about
him if they believed that
sincerely and i think they did i do
believe that they thought that
sincerely they are patriots
they're patriots wouldn't you cheat
reverse the situation and put yourself
in it
let's say you uh let's say you had come
to believe that joe biden was
literally the devil not not figuratively
literally he was the devil come back to
the earth and you were sure that was
true
would you if you had the ability would
you rig the election to keep
satan from being elected of course you
would
why because you're a patriot that's why
of course you would look to save the
world
because you're a good person you're a
good person of course you would
so here's the thing that you could
almost guarantee is true
that the the incentive for cheating was
higher than it's ever been
the opportunity for cheating certainly
exists
you would have to be a idiot to
think the opportunity
doesn't exist now you also have that you
know the press will cover for your
for your uh for your deeds now what
would you expect
to see if my hypothesis is true
what what signals would be there to say
ah you might be right about this scott
it might be cheating in every way
possible and it all happened well one
thing you'd expect to see
is that biden would get more votes than
anybody ever got
because the people doing the individual
cheating wouldn't know how much cheating
the other cheaters were doing
because i doubt that they had meetings
right do you think that the people who
knew how to
let's say get uh fake ballots if that's
a thing
do you think that those cheaters were
having a meeting with
hypothetically if such people existed
people who were tweaking the software no
they don't even know each other they're
just people who know what they need to
do
everybody knows that you need to get rid
of hitler do you need a meeting
with like an agenda item three on the
agenda
let's agree to get rid of hitler no you
don't need a meeting for that
you just do what you're going to do so
indeed we've got
a joe biden with a suspiciously high
number of votes
suspiciously so suspiciously that i
don't think it could possibly be true
might be right i guess you can't rule it
out
because there was so so much
demonization of trump
that uh you can say to yourself all
right well they were so afraid of trump
that it was the highest turnout of all
time
but i don't believe that it would be
that much higher than obama
do you because obama was more of a
positive things like
hey let's let's get ourselves an obama
president
people said so
um so i guess arizona has been called by
the media anyway
for biden there's eleven thousand point
eleven thousand vote uh difference
do you think that there's any fraud in
arizona
that would be big enough to cover
eleven over eleven thousand eleven point
five thousand
votes does that sound within the realm
of doable it's completely within the
realm of doable
the the thing that the fake media has
been brainwashing you
is to think that past elections
are an indication of this election
everything i just told you
tells you that whatever happened this
election it's definitely not like any
other election
so when the fake media says we've done
recounts before
and they only turn up a few hundred
votes
so you know why bother thinking it could
change this time
because a few hundred is much less than
the 11.5
000 or so you might need in arizona
but how many of those
mail-in votes do you think can be
eliminated
if you if you actually followed the
letter of the law
so i assume that in every state the the
law is very specific
about how it must be filled out and what
time it must be received
do you think they can find over 11 000
um physical ballots
that have something improper on it that
would eliminate
eliminate it according to the laws of
the own state
what are the odds of that if i had to
put the odds on that
it's close to 100 percent
because 11 000 just isn't much if you're
looking at
all of the ballots that were mailed into
the state we've never had this many
mail-in ballots
and that's where all the problems are so
if you take the
mail-in ballots that have been rejected
and let's say i'll just put a fake
number on it let's say it was one
percent were rejected
you don't think that a recount where
you're really looking to see if
if the ballot should be counted or not
you don't think they can find 11
000 of those bet they can
i'll bet they can so how about georgia
14
000 same thing you don't think that in
georgia you can find 14
000 ballots they have the wrong address
or they forgot the address or
signature doesn't match or something
like that of course they can
i don't even think it's going to be hard
i don't think it'll be hard and by the
way you wouldn't even have to find any
fraud
it looks to me like arizona and georgia
are both close enough that if all you
did
if all you did is look at the ballots
and be a little bit more restrictive
about which ones were accepted
still compatible with the law but just
you know more
more compatible with the law i feel like
they're both going to flip
now that's not even counting any fraud
that may have been
alleged right um
i have uh increased the slaughter meter
to 95
based on these uh presumptions my
presumptions being that
uh large fraud is guaranteed under these
circumstances the fact that it has not
been presented to the public yet
which is true by the way if you're a
member of the public
you probably have not seen really good
evidence of fraud would that be fair to
say you've seen lots of things zooming
around the
the internet that you don't know if it's
true or not
but that's probably not technically
untrue
that that the public hasn't seen that
but you will um
i can promise you you're going to see
more so
that's the only thing i can promise you
for sure
that what you've seen so far isn't
really close
to what you're gonna see and it's gonna
happen
fairly quickly the next week or two
um all right now
so trump tweeted uh and again this is a
trump tweet so you don't know what the
the source is etc he said there's a
report
again we don't know how credible that or
you don't know how credible
um the dominion deleted 2.7 million
trump
votes nationwide trump says that data
analysis finds 221 000 pennsylvania
votes
switched from trump to biden and 941
thousand trump
votes deleted and that states using
dominion voting systems switched 435
000 votes from trump to biden now
would you say that those are all proven
statements
no no these statements are not proven
but here's what they do they change the
argument
do you remember what the old argument
was the old argument was
well yeah there's always a little bit of
fraud
but it's not going to change these
elections that are off by tens of
thousands
you know you get a few hundred a little
bit of fraud a couple of stuff ballot
boxes
if you added it all together it's it's
just nothing anyway why are you wasting
our time
well trump has changed the argument
now you could still say of course it's
either true or false
his the claims that he's making they
could be false
they could be true but they're big
so the old argument of all the things
that are being claimed are too small to
make a difference
that's out the window now if this claim
is true
the election was definitely stolen and
if these claims are not true
well then you're you're back to you know
show me the proof
so let's find out i think we're heading
toward this
weirdest situation in the world
in which the most important person on
the planet
will be the facilities manager for the
white house
you know every big building has somebody
who's like a facilities manager
and they're the ones who uh tell you you
can move an
office you can get your phones installed
you can put your name on the
on the door they're the ones who make
sure you have a chair
they're the ones who decide what office
goes to whom
what's going to happen if trump approves
his case
and biden gets gets uh sworn in anyway
because i think that's going to happen i
think we're heading toward a place
where the media has gotten so powerful
that trump could could prove his case
that the election was stolen and they
will just report that it didn't happen
and they will just act like biden is the
official winner
and i think we'll have two presidents
and the only person who's going to
matter is the facilities manager
because whoever moves into the white
house you're gonna treat as your
president
right because you're gonna act
you know at least in terms of the way
your your mind is organized
whoever's in the white house is going to
be the president
so what happens if the facilities
manager is asked by the biden team
hey look we you know biden's obviously
your president he was just
sworn in so let's
let's move all these trump offices out
and we'll be moving in
and can you give us a schedule when
that's going to happen
and then trump goes to the facilities
manager and says
we just proved we won the election
here's the votes
the court just ruled for us we have more
votes
in the electoral college i it's not my
fault if they swore in the wrong person
i'm the president now what does the
facilities manager do
would would the military get involved
i think no i think our military
and this is the most i guess this is the
biggest compliment you can give your own
military
they would never attack citizens
it just can't happen so i don't think
the military would be involved is there
any like
local obviously there's local security
you know for the white house what would
they do
what would they do i have no idea i
think they would say to the facilities
manager
uh we've got competing claims
what do we do and the facilities manager
will decide who is the president of the
united states
now if you've worked for a big company
you're laughing right now because you
know that this is closer to actually
being true
then anybody who has no experience with
the big company realizes
let me tell you something else you
didn't realize
whoever writes the speeches for a
politician
has a lot of power because the way you
word things
if if you word things in a way that the
public picks up on and they like and
then the news likes it
you've determined the policy because if
something works the politician will do
more of it
so it's the speech writer who's trying
stuff out well let's try this
let's try this framing if something
works they do more of it
so the speechwriter like the facilities
manager
in my example you don't realize it but
their power is
extraordinary you might pick your next
president
he or she um
apparently the trump accountability
project is dead that was the
they were going to make a black list of
people who had helped the president
and those people would be marked for
destruction
career destruction nobody would ever
hire them again
i guess they decided not to do that
their explanation is
because biden called for unity and i
thought to myself you had to wait for
biden to call for unity
to decide that was a bad idea
feels like a cover story i think they
realized it was a bad idea based on the
response to it
which is that it turned them into nazis
everything's a nazi
everybody's a nazi um
here are some of the things that the
media has disappeared
and to me this is the most interesting
part of the whole story
is that the media can disappear a story
and they've they've demonstrated that
now
so glenn greenwald writing on sub stack
because he uh he's no longer with
the intercept because i guess he was too
honest
um he said that uh
he was talking about the fact that cnn
still puts adam schiff on television and
listens to him uncritically
and this is something from uh
greenwald you need to follow him he's
terrific as a writer
he says wolf blitzer uh asked um
asked who was he talking to let's see he
was talking to
adam schiff so will flitzer talking to
adam schiff and he asks adam schiff
this rhetorical question see if you
think this sounds like a fair question
right because this is just hilariously
it's just so bad uh so wolf blitzer says
to adam chef
does it surprise you at all that this
information rudy giuliani is peddling
very well could be connected to some
sort of russian government
disinformation campaign
talk about leading the witness that it
could very well be connected
everything could very well be connected
to something
how about some evidence this is the news
you don't just say something could very
well be connected to something with no
evidence whatsoever
but he did and this is what
schiff replied to that he stated
definitively that
quote we know we know
that this whole smear on joe biden and
this was talking about the hunter biden
stuff
comes from the kremlin and he added
clearly the origins of this whole smear
or from the kremlin and the president is
only too happy
to have kremlin helping him amplify it
uh and he goes on there it is in the
oval office another wonderful propaganda
coup for vladimir putin
seeing the president of the united
states holding up a newspaper promoting
kremlin
propaganda now
what evidence does adam schiff have of
any kremlin
involvement none and they put that
 on tv
to tell their viewers that the kremlin
is behind this
completely made up and of course he was
even prompted by wolf blitzer
now this is an example of brainwashing
and propaganda
it's not even close to news but the
thing that's funny and i'm going to say
something that's
that will be hilarious to people who
have watched the show
what we do in the shadows if you haven't
seen that show
the next thing i say won't sound that
hilarious
but if you have seen it you're going to
like this
when i think about clapper and brennan
and adam schiff i see that show what we
do in the shadows and i see adam schiff
as they're familiar
now if you if you hear adam schiff
as the familiar for uh
clapper and brennan and if that isn't
funny to you
well you've never seen that tv show but
you should all right
um the other things that they made
disappear just think about this
where is the story about british
interference in the 2016 election
it just sort of didn't happen did it but
yet we had this
you know christopher steele and x
intelligence person from great britain
you've got all these great britain
connections
if you're a consumer of the news it's
completely obvious
that great britain interfered in our
election completely obvious
but the if the news doesn't make it a
story
it just sort of disappears so
so they can just disappear the whole
british involvement in our election
oh well um how about this one
how about the fact that this election
apparently had no allegations of
russian or chinese interference
how'd that disappear
[Laughter]
how did britain i'm sorry how did russia
and china just stop interfering for the
first time ever
and that the news is treating it like it
doesn't exist
because if they did then you know maybe
you would question biden's legitimacy
and they don't want that to happen
so how mind-boggling is it
that they made foreign interference in
our election
just disappear they just disappeared it
that is the scariest that is some scary
stuff
um all right
here here's some other uh stories of
trump supporters being taken out so in
pennsylvania
joel reports this in breitbart
that uh
pennsylvania some of the lawyers there
are lots of lawyers working on stuff
but some of the lawyers withdrew from
helping
trump on the pennsylvania challenges
because they got too much pressure from
the press and the public so even
helping trump on the legal challenge
which everybody agrees is acceptable
it's completely acceptable to do a legal
challenge
right that's the most acceptable thing
you could do in the world
the whole point of the legal system is
to be used
exactly in these situations so
these people just doing their job the
job of being lawyers
were sort of forced out of helping trump
just because of politics
and and that of course could be
disappeared too
if you know joel hadn't done the story
you wouldn't have even known about it
all right here's another one here's
something else the press disappears
and this comment was on twitter by david
boxenhorn
and he asked this question and it'll
make you laugh when you hear it
or it should because you didn't think of
it
he says why is it that we never hear
about the good things
that are happening because of climate
change surely there must be some
of course there are the point of climate
change
is that not everything is just getting
worse but rather there would be
the claim is that some places would get
worse but by coincidence
some places would have to get better
because it's all different situations
some of them could use a little extra
warmth some of them would be harmed by a
little extra warmth
so why are we only seeing stories about
fires in california and
hurricanes which you know there's a
there's an iffy connection to any
climate there so
understand that that's um disputed
but wouldn't we also see a story about
iceland is growing a lot of weed because
it's now warmer
i'm making that one up right but
wouldn't you see
that there was a a place that became
better
a tourist destination wouldn't you see
stories about our food
crop is way better because the co2
right where are all those stories
there should be for every
you know there might be a ratio problem
but for every
uh bad story about climate change where
somebody says we're observing
something that went wrong in real time
there have to be good ones there have to
be
in order for the climate change story to
even be real
there have to be big conspicuous
countries that are better off where are
they
where's the story it's disappeared
so foreign interference disappeared
climate change advantages
even if those advantages are far swamped
by the disadvantages surely they exist
and they would be big so
that's uh uh interesting here's a story
that i think might be
closer to fake news than real news uh
oncologist dr zeke emanuel so he's one
of the advisory members that biden wants
for his coronavirus task force
and he has suggested at some point
that if a vaccine is available in the
united states
that we would not maybe it would be
better if we didn't hoard it all
for the united states even if it's an
american company that makes it
but rather that we should uh use enough
in the united states to get our own
r value below one in other words so that
the virus won't spread easily if it gets
under one
and then if you reach that point then if
you still have vaccine available
you might make that available
intelligently to other countries
now that's been reported as you know
america last
why would you give it to other countries
it's an american company
shouldn't we you know take care of
america first and obviously that's a
good question to ask
but i think the argument is more
is more mathematical than
nationalist or anti-nationalist i think
that the argument goes
that it wouldn't help you as much as you
think to hoard it all in your country
if you didn't take care of your
neighboring countries there would still
be enough getting in
that even the vaccine wouldn't help you
as much as you want
so if you get to our r1 let me put it
this way
if canada was raging with virus
would it make more sense that we do what
we can in the united states to get the r
under one and then say you know we're
not out of the woods
until we help canada because there's
just too much you know
cross-contamination
so maybe the little extra goes to canada
and mexico would that be smarter or
maybe it goes to europe because there's
lots of
international travel so i would say i
don't have an opinion on this
but i would say because it's it's purely
a model decision
you know it's it's math it's a model i
haven't looked at the models
but i wouldn't completely rule out
that the the united states would be
better off
if we got our r value under zero and
then did
neighboring countries as the next
logical thing
i would i'm at least open to the
argument is anybody else open to that
argument
am i the only one because i don't think
that's exactly
america first or not i think our our
interests could be served
possibly by being a little bit more
generous about helping our neighboring
countries
so i'm open to that but certainly
america first if if it's a tie
if it's a gray area if it's a gray area
maybe a
lean america um
all right those are the things that i
wanted to say today let me
see if i forgot anything but i don't
think it did
don't think it did got it all all right
we did good today
so congratulations on
sticking it out and making this
periscope
so darn popular i appreciate that
and i will talk to you tomorrow
and you youtubers um
i'll stay with you for another minute
here see if you have any comments or
questions that uh
you'd like answered boy the comments go
by so quickly on youtube it's hard to
hard to catch them you gotta got to
pay attention you know the other thing
if joe biden
goes goes nuts with testing
especially the cheap testing you can do
at home if he does a big push on that
i am going to say he did a better job
than trump
all right so i want to warn you in
advance if any of you are
trump supporters and you're wondering
where it's going if biden gets in
and um he does more on cheap
home testing approvals than trump did
i'm gonna i'm gonna look very favorably
on that because i think that was a
a a weakness in the trump administration
response
but we'll see more lockdowns coming i
think that's inevitable
i went to a restaurant last night and
ate indoors
in my local community here it's the
first time i've been
indoors in a restaurant since
february maybe
and it was 25 capacity we had tons of
distance
from other tables but i don't know how
the restaurant stays in business
there's no restaurant that can stay in
business with 25
capacity through the holidays so i don't
i'm not even sure
restaurants will survive through the
holidays
um yeah the slaughter meter is 95
based on the assumption that massive
fraud will be discovered
uh but has not has not been presented to
the public in the way you can see it yet
i do have i do have
sources that you might not have and my
sense of it is
there's some big stuff coming pretty
soon
um have i seen elon musk talk about the
tests
yeah i'm i'm not sure i'm on the same
page with him about the tests
is self-hypnosis worth it yeah it's
actually good stuff
it's better than meditation but in order
to do self-hypnosis
you almost have to be hypnotized the
best way to learn
self-hypnosis is to have somebody who is
a hypnotist
hypnotize you and then give you the
suggestion that you can do it yourself
that's the way i i learned it so when i
learned hypnosis
part of what we did is that the
instructor hypnotized the class
and then told us we could get back into
that mode by
hearing his voice counting you know one
to twenty and i can still do that
decades later i can hear his voice i can
count to twenty
and my body just goes down into total
relaxation
but it takes practice um did i get
mentioned on
alex jones yesterday somebody said that
uh
i was mentioned scott can
anyone be hypnotized um the answer is
yes but not to the same level
so anybody can be hypnotized to let's
say learn self-hypnosis
anybody could be hypnotized to let's say
be more comfortable as a public speaker
that sort of thing but only about 20
of the public can be hypnotized to see
something that doesn't exist or to have
a profound
you know experience about 20
uh but everybody uh oh i was mentioned
on
alex jones as someone that trump aligns
with i'm being told in the comments
uh will i please hypnotize you
it's a lot of work hypnotizing one
person
is really a draining thing for the
hypnotist
one of the reasons i didn't want to do
it professionally when i learned it in
my early 20s i actually had considered
maybe doing it professionally but it's
hard
it's just not a fun day because it's
very draining to put that much attention
into another person it's it's it's a big
load quick tests are already available
for purchase
somebody says i don't think that's true
but i could be wrong i don't think you
could buy a cheap test
if the if the ones that you could buy
now are probably the kind you have to
mail in for a result
right i think that does exist but the
kind where you can get
your own result in 15 minutes without a
machine
is the kind of need
why is trump so quiet
trump is only quiet in public
uh i can confirm that below the hood
there's a lot going on and he's very
connected to it
so uh quiet trump is dangerous trump
because transparent trump at least you
know everything that's going on
you know what he's thinking you know
what he plans to do so
transparent trump and loud trump
is less scary than this trump because
when he gets quiet
you don't know what's coming and
i think what's coming is a lot of fraud
allegations
is what's coming
here's a little trick if you ever get
yourself in a tense
situation i use this same technique
on people who could beat me up is you
get really quiet
because people who think they might be
getting in a fight with you soon
really don't like it if you're not
talking because you're talking
is what gives you some clues about what
they're dealing with
like are you gonna kill me are you
tougher than you look
are you mad enough to fight are you are
you
smarter than me you know there are a
whole bunch of things you could learn
if somebody is talking so if you find
yourself in a situation where
you know you're facing off this is
mostly for guys it doesn't
doesn't matter for women i don't think
but for guys
if you're in that situation where
somebody might start punching
if you stop talking the other person
will be scared to death
because they want to hear some talking
so that's my little
little tip for you just get real quiet
make direct eye contact but don't talk
it'll scare the crap out of people
trust me but you still might get beat up
anyway
all right that's all for now i'll talk
to you
later
