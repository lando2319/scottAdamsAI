let's try to do a show it'll be amazing
let me check the stocks um the S&P 500 it's up a little bit
tesla is down a little bit but I had a big run yesterday
and my nuclear stocks are up 7% today nice not bad
all right let's get your comments going and we'll have the show that you deserve
really it's the one you deserve it's that good
[Music] so anything happened in the news
good morning everyone and welcome to the highlight of human civilization it's
called Coffee with Scott Adams and you've never had a better time but if you'd like to take your
experience up to levels that nobody can understand with their tiny shiny human
brains all you need for that is a copper mug or a glass a tankered chelstein
a canteen jug or flask a vessel of any kind and fill it with your favorite liquid i like coffee and join me now for
the unparalleled pleasure it's a dopamine at the end of the day the thing that makes everything better it's called
the simultaneous sip and it happens now
go
oh that was good good stuff all right well
um you may have heard that the U war between Israel and Iran
might be over um there's a ceasefire declared
i'll tell you my favorite parts about that um my I think my number one
favorite part is that Trump has already branded it the 12-day war
now is that perfect or is that perfect the 12-day war the 12-day war
is just such good branding that I think one of the reasons he was angry that uh
that both sides were cheating a little bit in the ceasefire is that it was turning it into a 13-day war
and that's really bad branding nobody wants to have a 13-day war
12-day war [Music] 12-day war that sounds like you meant
business and you got stuff done so yeah that's a good brand
well as you know uh uh Iran had to had to respond by firing
14 ballistic missiles at a US base but we were warned in advance so there was
no no damage all the all the all the missiles got shot down
now I'm talking about uh God things are happening so fast was
it yesterday morning
so I'm talking about Iran responding to the bombing of Fordo and the other
nuclear sites they had to do something but they had this narrow little window
of what was possible without making things worse and so they did some Kabuki theater
uh pretend attack and they warned the US first through I guess through a cutter
and uh next thing you know they're like all right we're good we're good are you
good we're good uh but then there was still a war between Israel and and Iran
and uh apparently Trump has brokered a ceasefire
now will it hold well we'll talk about that but JD Vance says we have destroyed the
Iranian nuclear program and zero Americans have died
now if the ceasefire holds and for at least the foreseeable future
Iran does not try in any visible way to recreate its its threat to its neighbors
um that might end the question of who was our best president of all time
it's going to put Trump right at the top of the best president of all time right
if it holds now anything could happen you know maybe things go wrong but at
the moment um it's probably one of the most impressive acts of presidenting
you'll ever see in your life and I don't know if there were better presidents before I was born when the media was
different i don't know but wow am I impressed we'll we'll talk about that
so just uh Monday that was yesterday Israel Israel was still attacking um
some of the symbols of the Iranian regime they they blew the the front gate
off the Evan prison where the Distance were being held i don't know if any got out
um so that would release the uh anti-regime people if it worked and I
don't know about that uh they struck the revolutionary guard units this is all
before the ceasefire and some other place that was involved
with Iranian regime security so it looked like Israel was doing its best to
maybe create a situation for regime change without being too directly
involved on the ground because it was just bombs falling from the air um I
don't know if that would have worked but I doubt it i doubt it would have been
enough for a regime change but then Trump on Sunday he teased the idea of a
regime change but he didn't say America would do it or Israel he just said uh quote "It's
not politically correct to use the term regime change but if the current Iranian
regime is unable to make Iran great again why wouldn't there be a regime change?" Now that was very clever
because if you're in Iran and you see the president of the United States who
just dropped um 12 bombs through six holes
which is really impressive that your military can pull that off and 14 14
bunker busters uh in total and then uh you see that same guy
talking about regime change even if he's just sort of talking around
the edges of it how does that make you feel it makes you feel like he can wake up in
a in five minutes and just say "Do we have one more of those bunker busters because we know
where the Supreme Leader is?" And probably we do we probably know exactly
where he is so did that make a difference it might have it might have
made a difference so if you're if you're doing a uh persuasion filter on this the
persuasion filter this is brilliant it's brilliant to say
that regime change is in the offing like it's one of the options but without
saying that you would be part of it knowing that we could we could be part
of it so I think that might have been one of the uh one of the most important
parts of getting to the ceasefire maybe that Trump kept it in play the idea that
regime change you know I'm not saying I'd do it i'm not saying we should do it
i'm just saying that why wouldn't it happen i mean it'd be good for Iran
wouldn't it so that was probably just perfect for the for the time the time
and the place and the person and the situation perfect
now apparently uh Iran never really had u much of a option for mining the
straits of Hormuz or closing that off because they would have destroyed their own economy and the US and Israel would
probably go so the uh the two entities that Iran was
most angry at the US and Israel not terribly affected if the straight of
Hormuz had been closed and we probably could have opened it up again with you
know a certain amount of work and um it just would have made all the
neighbors more angry at Iran than they already were so that wasn't really much of an option and apparently having
Russia as one of your closest uh allies
doesn't help at all it didn't help Syria
and apparently it's not helping Iran they they got zero military help from
from Russia all right you probably heard that uh
after the deadline for the ceasefire that Iran um fired a missile that killed
some uh family in Israel and Israel just
decided that it would uh stop it
and then Israel how can somebody know me and not know that I'm on a a live show at this time
of day every day how in the world anyway
don't message me this time of day anyway um Trump was very unhappy that uh Iran
broke the ceasefire according to Israel and then Israel apparently unloaded
every missile it had while the clock was still ticking on the ceasefire
and uh Trump was very angry he was very angry at Iran which you know is baseline
but he was really angry at Israel for basically embarrassing him
because he'd already named it the tw the 12-day war now that's not the big problem but he probably said to himself
what you and I are saying to ourselves which is if Trump pulls this off
it's it's going to be hard to not count him as best president of all time and it
looks like he might pull it off it's It's looking good at the moment anything
could happen but uh if you caught his uh brief
presser where he was talking to reporters before he got in the helicopter he's he's heading off to a
NATO meeting um he used the F-word and I got to say you know I I I don't
want to make this whole podcast just praising Trump but it's hard not to i
mean he did so many things right and continues to do so many things right
on this situation that what am I going to do like even even the Democrats are
saying "Oh okay that was pretty good." So here's what I like
um so this is what uh Trump said uh I want
to get his exact quote um
well he just said he he dropped the fbomb for some reason I didn't write it down
but he said he's he said that the two countries have been fighting so long that they don't know what the
they're doing and he used he used the actual f-word on a live interview before
he got in his helicopter now if you were I I think that me that message was more
to Israel than it was to Iran but you know because Iran seemed to be
signaling that they really didn't want a ceasefire and why wouldn't they really it would make sense that they would want
one but Israel you know may have had a
little you know maybe they had not achieved all of their goals you know Israel might
want to continue taking out the ballistic missile manufacturing i don't know if there's any left but they had a
uh a sub goal of making sure that Iran didn't have the ballistic missile
capability either and then we speculate but it was not directly said that Israel
might really want a regime change and they're the recent bombing would suggest that they were kind of interested in
that so so uh Trump's in this situation
where everybody wonders hey is Israel wagging the dog here now let's see are
they the tail wagging the dog and is that the right use how many times how many times have you
said to yourself "Hey looks like Israel is you know sort of manipulating our
government." It's one of the most common things you see right at least in social
media oh Apac is controlling our government and um Trump is just doing
what Israel wants well here was the situation where maybe Israel wanted to
go a little bit longer and get a little bit more done maybe we don't know um and
it looks like Trump was saying "If you do this you're going to snatch away from
me one of the greatest accomplishments of any president ever."
And just imagine those those two possibilities one the greatest president ever pulling
off the Kobayashi Maru the impossible the impossible ceasefire
maybe the other possibility was was that
Israel would embarrass him in public and that would be his brand forever that
Israel pushed him around and he was just a puppet to Israel those were his two
possibilities and when he said to the press
that they've been fighting so long they don't know what the they're doing and that it was reported that he had
what is being described as a firm phone call with Netanyahu
do you think he used any any fwords when when he was talking to Netanyahu
oh I'll bet he did i'll bet he did and he's really good at knowing when to drop
the the f F-word so Trump was put in a situation where he
could be forever one of the greatest presidents doing one of the most impressive things you've ever seen any
president ever do or he could be turned into a chump by Netanyahu
so how would you like to be Netanyahu and be on the other end of that conversation
you would not you would not so I'm pretty sure that
Trump you know made sure that Israel knew that there would be a price and I
don't know what that price would be but I'm sure he suggested that there would be a price and not a price that
Netanyahu would want to would want to pay so at the moment and things are
changing by the minute but uh has the has the firing of missiles and bombs
stopped can anybody confirm to me in the comments
i think it might be maybe it's not nighttime so maybe there wouldn't be any missiles anyway
i don't know what time it is over there anyway so here's my take on Israel
influencing America versus America influencing uh Israel i
feel like it's more of a sibling situation meaning that yes it's true that APEC has
a big influence on American policy about Israel it's all you know overt it's
transparent it's legal we can talk about every element of it
there's no surprises there but it's also true and I think we're seeing it in
spades here is that the United States has so much to
offer in terms of being an ally of uh Israel that uh sometimes we're going to
insist on stuff and Israel's going to say "That's not the fight I want to fight." This is probably one of those
so no it's not true that Israel pushes America around in every situation
whenever they want it's definitely true that they influence American policy
and it's definitely true that you just watched Trump very much influence
Israeli military and political policy right there
so it's a two-way street so more like siblings you know you can influence your
sibling your sibling can influence you nobody thinks there's a problem with that so maybe it's not so maybe it's not
as bad as we imagine it to be it works both ways
anyway um let's see what else is happening
so one of my questions about Iran is we haven't seen the Ayatollah he's
allegedly in a bunker somewhere and he is 86 years old and he might not
be totally with it so one of the possibilities is that the Ayatollah is
in Joe Biden territory where basically the autopen is deciding
Iranian policy and I'm joking about the autopen
but imagine you were the the top the top rung of uh let's say you're the second
rung of is of Iranian leadership so you're not the supreme leader but you're
the next level down you know the dozens of people who are the next level down
and let's say you got him into a bunker
what power would he have if he said "Uh bring me a telephone i want to make some
orders." What if you said no what if you just said "No you you don't
seem like you're in good shape maybe you should take a nap maybe we'll put out
some orders and say they're from you." I wonder if maybe part of the reason it
was hard to get a ceasefire and part of the reason it seemed like we were getting mixed messages from Iran is that
there were mixed messages and that there might have been uh maybe some insiders
who were trying to minimize the supreme leaders position maybe some of them were
trying to support him and if I had to guess we would not have a
ceasefire if the Supreme Leader was still in charge
because I just don't think at 86 you can change your ways i just don't think he
would do a ceasefire but would the leadership who was getting uh murdered
every day and they needed a ceasefire to keep their own families alive would they
have said "Hey you know there there's 20 of us here and uh if we all changed our
mind about who's in charge you would have to go." So how about we we make the
decisions on this one and you set this one out i feel like there's a really good possibility
and this is just speculating because he's 86 and we watch the you know the
Joe Biden situation so that's weighing on my my opinion but don't you think
there's some possibility that the reason that Trump is not interested in regime
change and I think Israel just said they were not interested in regime change
although maybe they were but they're saying they're not do you think one possibility is that
it's already changed not changed in terms of you know the people on the street rising up but
changed in terms of maybe the second or third in command who is a little more
rational about you know Iranian long-term survival you know maybe maybe
number two or number three has just said "All right we're done you know what the
the supreme leader is going to get all of us killed and it's going to happen pretty quickly so let's let's lock him
in that bunker take his phone away and if anybody asks we'll say the Supreme
Leader said this we're just passing it along so I feel like we might hear
something about the leadership in in Iran in the next few weeks that's my
guess anyway so Trump has said he doesn't want to see regime change
um CNN and MSNBC um I went immediately to their coverage
today to see how they would handle what might be the the most impressive
presidential thing that anybody ever did um and they were of course having
trouble with it so they would talk about well we don't know if all the nuclear
facilities are completely destroyed because that would take you know it
might take weeks and somebody would have to be in the ground and you know it's hard to tell you can't tell by looking
at it from the outside and you don't know if they moved anything you know maybe they relocated some stuff maybe
they had some centrifuges that were not installed
but were manufactured what if uh this is me talking not not
the CNN or MSNBC but what if um Iran had moved its enriched
um uranium and what if they had a few centrifuges that they had manufactured
or somehow purchased and they were not yet hooked up well if they were not yet
hooked up they could have been just in storage in some innocuous warehouse and
then whenever they wanted to reinstitute their nuclear program
all they'd have to do was say "Uh how about a ceasefire?" Yeah you you totally you totally
destroyed all of our nuclear facilities oh even if we wanted to we couldn't
build a bomb now no no no no we could never do it but at the same time uh
they're being consistent with their past practices they might use the ceasefire
just to have time to reconstitute their nuclear threat i think I saw some
estimates that it might take a year or two to get back to where they were to which
I say I'm pretty sure they would be willing to wait a year or two you know
even if it's 5 years um don't you think they would have
planned for how to reconstitute before they lost everything do you think
there's any chance that they didn't at least plan to move the enriched uranium
so that nobody knew where it was now I heard some people say online and this is
a terrible take Scott you fool don't you
know that Israel was watching everything from the sky and there's no way there's
no way they could have moved that uranium because it would have been spotted by Israel and they would have
bombed those trucks well was it the New York Times that was reporting
that there was a just dozens of big trucks that pulled up to the Ford
nuclear site before the bombing and if you were going to move some
uranium and you had let's say 40 trucks and all those trucks could carry all of
the uranium would you spread it across let's say
three to five trucks and then all the rest could be decoys
could it be that the US is not the only one who uses decoys you know we use those decoy B2 bombers what if
um Israel was watching and they saw 40 trucks pull up and they they thought uh
we don't know what's happening with those trucks and we don't know what's on them and we don't know which ones are
full of uranium potentially and which ones are decoys
so is Iran capable enough and do they plan ahead enough um are they motivated
enough that they would have had a plan to save their program to make it easier
to reconstitute well of course of course they are now I
don't know if they did but yes they they are capable enough and smart enough and
it would be consistent with everything we've watched that they would have put
some amount of effort into protecting what they had in a way that would make
it easy to reconstitute now some people said "Oh you'll never move those those
enrichment facilities because once they're installed it you know it just be too hard to rip them
down and move them." But remember if they had those in the first place it
means they know how to get them or make them and so maybe they had a few extra
laying around that had never been installed you don't know so I ask you
this question who benefits the most from a ceasefire
um Israel probably wanted to go a little bit longer even though they said two
weeks so it would have been good if they stuck to two weeks but they might have
wanted to do a little extra the US we're better off with a ceasefire
uh unless Iran you know rebuilds its uh offensive capabilities
but Iran is the one who wins wins the hardest right because they stop the
immediate bleeding and they still have a you know full
possibility which they may not pursue to rebuild their facilities now Trump has
said um there's no way that they're going to rebuild their facilities things are completely demolished
i do think that maybe the fact that we acted so uh effectively against what
they had and the fact that Israel has penetrated their um their spies have
penetrated Iran so effectively that we wouldn't know if they plan to
reconstitute so it's very much in leadership in other
words the second or third in command might actually be in command we just don't know it yet
and we might have found we might have found somebody who said "You know what none of that worked none of that
building a nuclear deterrent worked it was terrible you know what none of our
proxies turned out well they all just got destroyed by Israel and you know
what their spies are so good that we can't make a move without them knowing
it so there's a very good chance that Trump
has pulled off the impossible which is convince Iran not to
reconstitute their threat um and instead to rebuild and just enjoy
the prosperity that could come with being part of the rest of the world and
remember it's not like Russia helped them out militarily
or really much in any other way i don't think they're giving them much money or anything
so we'll see but uh CNN and MSNBC as Trump pointed out at the presser are
going hard at him and talking about you know how it might have failed or might
go wrong and maybe maybe but at the
moment it looks like one of the greatest things any president ever pulled off and
I don't know if you can win I don't know if you could win the Nobel Peace Prize
if you ended a war by bombing the other side really really good
i don't think it works that way right i think the the only way
the only way you get a Nobel Peace Prize is you have to be a liberal
and you have to get there by talking even if the talking didn't really give you a lasting peace but if you've got a
a lasting peace by dropping some precision bunker bombs
I don't know if the Nobel committee considers that Nobel Peace Prize material even if it is because the hard
part was telling Israel to stand down there's no other country that could do
that and even I might argue there's no other president who could have done it i
don't know if you know any of our prior presidents could have said to Netanyahu
"All right you're going to stop right now and then make that stick." I don't
know maybe like I said it's a sibling kind of relationship so maybe any any
president could have done it but it doesn't feel like it it feels like an only Trump situation so he'll he'll
benefit from that all right um
so Iran has not denounced their nuclear program
do you feel that that's necessary it sounds like the US feels that's not
necessary because we denounced it for them that there's no there's no
denouncing that needs to be done because there's nothing they can do so
maybe that became irrelevant i don't know but it's notable
that Iran has now said we we have no plans to do this again it's notable so
they're at least keeping their options open and they might not they might not
know um how well they could reconstitute their threat until you know some time
has passed because even they don't know what got destroyed
so um yeah so Trump said in a truth social
Iran will never rebuild their nuclear facilities maybe
um there's a very good chance he's right oh here's the here's the exact quote
israel and Iran have been fighting so long they don't know what the they are doing god I love that
that that's the Trump I love i I love where it's not that he swears
it's that what he does it is so well chosen you know even when he would do it at rallies every now and then he'd drop
a Sbomb or an Fbomb he swears so
persuasively perfectly that was exactly the right
time for an F-bomb so his Fbombs are as good as his bunker buster bombs
all right so let's uh check my predictions shall we back on June 14th I
made several predictions uh two of which Trump totally ruined by his amazingly
surprisingly great work so here are my predictions
number one I said there will be no organic popular uprising that removes
Iran's leaders that one was right so I made four predictions it looks like I
got two on a four right so there was no no popular uprising
and that was based on the fact that you don't get a popular uprising when you're being bombed now maybe at
some point in the future I don't know but uh at least I was right
about that um I said that uh Iran will not return to the negotiating table and
give up its nuclear ambitions and mean it so even if they did say they would negotiate that they wouldn't mean it now
they did not so technically is that prediction correct they did not and
still haven't they still haven't said we give up on our nuclear ambitions so I
think I think I would give myself the win on that one so that's too correct
here's what I got wrong i said Israel would not stop attacking
until they've achieved everything they want did they well I don't think they
achieved everything they wanted because they might have wanted a little bit of
regime change we'll never know i mean they they say they were not aiming for regime change but you know governments
say things but privately did they want a little bit of regime change their their
bombing in the final days look like they were bombing specifically to try to make
it more likely that there would be a popular uprising and regime change so I
don't think they got everything they wanted and I don't think that they destroyed I'm just I don't know this for
sure but I don't think Israel destroyed all of the uh ballistic missile making
capabilities or their stockpiles maybe they did or maybe they got enough
of them that they feel comfortable now but I would say that uh Israel did
because of Trump i think they did do a ceasefire that maybe was just short not not that
short but just short of maybe everything they wanted would you agree is that fair
so I would say I was wrong about that because Israel got very close to
everything they wanted but maybe just short so I'm going to say um I was wrong
about that one and I said that uh my fourth prediction is that Israel will
not be done in two weeks 12 days
so if I wanted to be a jerk I'd say I told you they wouldn't be done in two weeks they were done in 12 days but I
won't be that jerk not today so I'll just say "Wow it looks like Israel is
going to be done in two weeks." So um I would have said two months minimum now
is it possible that there could be some more firing coming up soon well I'll
tell you what even if Israel takes another hit from
more Iranian missiles Trump is going to be on the phone with Netanyahu in about two seconds saying
"Did that Iranian missile you know kill anybody?" Well maybe yes
u you're going to stand out so I I feel like Trump can keep Israel
from continuing even if they wanted to and we don't know if they wanted to because it was an expensive you know
operation so I'm pretty sure that Israel is also happy that they're not spending
more money on that so meanwhile Iran is uh I saw this on Mario
no post but uh one source says that Iran
is going to throw a victory party in Thran and the victory would be that they
I don't know survived the war and um got Israel to back down so they're gonna
spin it in some way that makes it look like something good happened on their
end that's probably a good sign now I don't know if this is true because I saw
from one source I'd never heard of but if they do if they do have a victory
celebration that would really suggest that they mean to you know honor the
ceasefire because you don't have a victory celebration about something that's going to keep going so that might
be good news and let's talk about all the uh the
disunityity in the Trumpup supporting world the MAGA people as you know there
were a number of notable personalities who were uh very anti-war
and anti- US being involved directly so Tucker Carlson comic Dave Smith you know
Marjgery Taylor Green Steve Bannon uh they are some of the strongest Trump
supporters in general but uh they had some legitimate
um legitimate complaints and they had some legitimate
criticisms and here's my take i feel like it's time to get the band
back together you know it's sort of like well the band broke up for a little bit so they could
argue with each other about what song to put on the album but now it's time to put the band back together uh I saw a
comic Dave Smith do a post on X that uh I I can't paraphrase it but essentially
he was giving uh Trump credit for what looks like a speedy end to the conflict
and I expect the other the other people who had been doubting the wisdom of
getting involved i suspect that they will all come around to the point of view of well you know
there was a risk and we did not necessarily trust that Trump could get
this done but damn it he did so it's time to get the band back
together if you're gonna spend even one minute saying that other Trump
supporters are pieces of crap and they got everything wrong you you're going to
be like the the vaccination people don't be like the vaccination people let it go
just let it go he He He did the impossible you didn't expect it now
again if if we're being realistic it could come off the rails right it's
possible that it won't work out in the long run but at the moment it looks
amazing and I think I wouldn't waste one minute
saying "Oh Tucker Carlson you were so wrong and evil and anti-imega." Don't
bother because Tucker will be on your side on probably the very next issue and
you need him steve Bannon one of the smartest people in all the media landscape was he wrong don't know you
know one of the things I always say is that when people make a prediction
that's statistically based and things go the other way that doesn't
make them wrong let me say that again if Steve Bannon and and Tucker and comic
Dave Smith and Marjgerie Taylor Green to name a few if what they were saying is
that uh history tells us that getting directly involved almost always goes
wrong and then it goes right are they wrong
they're not they're not wrong they they did not predict the right
outcome but they're not wrong if they say every time we do this it goes bad
that's true if if Trump is the first person who can
kobayashi maru this situation and make direct military involvement go right
well that's the unexpected you know low percentage bet if you said
to yourself I trust Trump so much that I think he can defy all of history
and do the Kobayashi Maru if if you're new to this that's a Star Trek reference
to doing the impossible the Kobayashi Maru it's a an intentionally impossible
situation that Captain Kirk still still made work um they're not wrong so don't
throw them under the bus what we needed was uh really strong
critics because every time the US says should we get directly involved in a war do you
want everybody to line up and back behind the commanderin-chief every time even if they're they're big
fans of the commander-in-chief do you want them automatically to say "Yeah yeah let's let's drop some bombs let's
get involved i don't I do not I would say that the
critics um they were they were kind of like the uh what sharpened the knife do you think
it made Trump try harder because the the power and credibility of the critics i
think it did did it did it sharpen our ability to understand the entire risks
so that when we got into it we knew what we were getting into yes so if you're saying to yourself
these MAGA people I will I will push them off to the garbage dump for being
wrong about this i I think that's the wrong take
the right frame is that every single time the US wants to drop some bombs or
get militarily involved you want critics you want strong critics you want strong
critics who used to be your best friend on everything else that's what we need
so I would ask you to just be a little bit magnanimous about the fact that
having people on both sides of an issue that important very important very
useful so patriots all right
um Trump is mad at Thomas Massie
for for getting everything wrong according to Trump so he wants to oust
Massie because I think Massie doesn't like the big beautiful bill and he was against um Trump having the control to
do the military action without Congress and uh so Trump vows to ou Massie in the
next Republican primary all right my take on Massie which you've heard before
similar to my take on the other critics is I love the fact that there's a Thomas
Massie because although he does look like he's a impediment to Trump doing everything
he wants there's enough there just enough Republicans where things will
still go Trump's way but you can hear the other side i like that i like the
fact that he's a principled um and consistent he's principled and
consistent in what he's pushing for now there there are times I disagree with
him and that's okay because you need a
you need a messy so I could see why Trump doesn't love it
because it makes Trump's job much harder because Massie is very effective at
getting attention and his views are principled
um but at the same time I love that he exists so he's a he's a good good voice
of reason and if Trump can't overcome that voice of reason to get what he
wants well I would say that that's a bar that's not too high
he can overcome it if the reason is good enough and his instinct you know
suggests he should uh Lindsey Graham he was pushing for
regime change and uh but I guess he's not now he said uh on Hannity he said
"Let's put this in context in a few hours Donald Trump reversed the damage done to America by Biden's withdrawal
from Afghanistan." Well is that going too far
do you think the military's massive failure in withdrawing from Afghanistan
which we would call Biden's failure um do you think that the massively
successful bombing kind of neutralizes that a little bit a little bit it's not
the thing that I would have focused on it's not the thing that I would have said "Oh let's talk about how this makes
the Afghanistan thing go away." that that wouldn't be where my interest was
but yeah a little bit then uh Representative Hakee Jeff
um he's still on this point he says "The use of military force which is offensive in nature must be approved by the House
and the Senate that's according to the Constitution it's not optional Donald
it's not." How many how many voters
give a about that you know one of the things I say all the time is that success fixes everything
so we've got this weird situation where Congress doesn't seem to be as involved
as they should uh according to our system when they when a president whether it's Trump or
par presidents get involved in military action
now if the military action had failed spectacularly
then probably a lot of people would have listened to Hakeim Jeffy's opinion and said you know if the Congress had been
involved maybe we could avoided avoided this problem but it didn't go that way instead it
looks like a massive success for Trump and the military now when you have a
massive success like just mass massive do you think the public says "Ooh but
you know they they didn't they didn't cross all the tees and dot all the eyes
uh there there was a constitutional step they should have taken."
Well maybe some of them but I would expect that Trump's approval
level is going to go up a little bit i do not think that the Hakee Jeff Oh sure
it was one of the greatest successes of any president plus military that we've
ever seen and then say "But he shouldn't have done it he should have consulted with us
first." The the Democrats are just so consistent
at finding the only thing that nobody gives a about and turning that into their main issue
and there uh let's see what else the Democrats are doing that's funny so Rosie O'Donnell uh who's at her
uh her hideway in in uh in Ireland
she according to uh Breitbart she's promoting a recount of Trump's victory
over Harris in 2024 what could be better i can't think of
anything that would be better for Republicans than for famous Democrats to be
questioning the integrity of our elections
i feel like Hakee Jeff you know is going to want to fly over to Ireland and and
start slapping Rosie O'Donnell and just say "Shut up shut up."
Because you can't say that you can't suggest that Trump stole the election in
2024 without simultaneously saying our elections are vulnerable so good luck
Rosie um Trump says that oil prices have dropped which I imagine they have
because the risk is now lower so Trump's got lower oil prices he's got the he's
got the victory of all victories if it holds um and Poly Market says that the
odds of Trump getting a Nobel Peace Prize have surged to a new record high of 10%
it's only 10% um I saw a uh post on X by a user called
uh Chevarestas who points out that uh the bombing of
Iran's nuclear sites did not create a single protest
uh in Saudi Arabia Turkey UAE Qatar Iraq Jordan Lebanon Syria Kuwait Yman Bahrain
Yemen and most importantly in Iran itself so
how close is Trump to uh to improving the Abraham Accords to
get Saudi Arabia and everybody else in there really close
because what you don't realize because we're focusing on the the you know the bombs the ceasefire if it holds is going
to make it possible for the um the Abraham Accords which already have some
of the Middle East countries involved it's going to allow the rest of them to join because it's going to look like
Iran which was always the fly in the ointment it looks like it's been neutralized at least for now so there is
a part two of this uh victory that's as
big as this and it's not guaranteed
but it's pretty close pretty close to being guaranteed uh I would say that
Saudi Arabia has probably already decided to you know join the Abraham Accords and
you know they're waiting for the right moment and the right way to do it
and uh whether you think this is good or bad uh Gaza has been largely forgotten
now I don't want to minimize the you know tragedy and the death and despair
that's going on there but uh our attention has been completely diverted
and uh that's good for Israel for doing what it wants to do in Gaza i don't know
if the Gaza situation will prevent the uh Abraham Accords from growing to their
next obvious level it might but at the same time it looks like the the Iranian
situation is bigger and I've got a feeling that something
good is going to happen really soon with the Abraham Accords we'll see
meanwhile Trump is over at uh going to NATO he might be there already um no
probably not there already but close and he's set to meet with uh Zalinski of
Ukraine so do you think is it possible that
because of Trump's big victory with Iran
do you think that that would make him more likely to get something done with Ukraine
there's no reason it should right they're completely unconnected things
but sometimes psychology is is a real lever
do you think that uh Putin and Silinski are so impressed
with what uh Trump just did in Iran are they so impressed that it's easier
for them to say "All right it's time." Maybe i wouldn't bet on it so you know
if if my money were involved I wouldn't bet on it but it does feel like the
psychology has moved so so firmly in Trump's favor that anything else he
wants to get done is a little bit more likely and like I say there's no
connection between Ukraine and you know Israel and Iran there's no direct
connection but in your mind it's hard to disconnect them because we
you just watched them do the impossible and so you say to yourself can he do
that again is it can can he do that twice
maybe so we'll see if anything happens there um the Supreme Court also gave
Trump another win he's having one hell of a week what a week uh the Supreme Court ruled that Trump is
allowed to deport violent illegals to countries that they are not from
so I don't know how much they wanted to do that but it's legal now and even so
there's a Boston judge who's decided to overrule the Supreme Court and not allow
it so I don't know what happens to a Boston judge when the Supreme Court has
ruled and you decide to you know directly and grossly go against this
ruling but we'll find out so that's another big win for uh Trump
and then apparently the Trump administration got a pledge from 75% of
the health insurers to get rid of some big bureaucratic mess that was
preventing people from getting good coverage uh something to do with uh
reducing uh insurance companies prior authorization requirements
so I don't know the whole details there but apparently this so-called prior
authorization requirement was causing people just not to get the health care they needed and uh it looks like the
Trump administration has got them all to say "Yeah we're going to take care of that."
that also as Axios is reporting um there is some chance I don't know the
odds that Trump's big beautiful bill gets approved before July 4th
now I don't think it needs to be you know approved before July 4th but one of
the things that uh I think I've taught you persuasion wise is if you put an
artificial deadline on something it makes it more likely to happen like way
more likely now is July 4th a natural deadline or a totally artificial
deadline it's totally artificial it would be nice but it's not necessary
however the fact that it's nice and not necessary might make it a lot more
likely that it happens so it's possible that Trump will also
get the win of all wins by getting his big beautiful bill passed now I have my
own criticisms about the spending but there's no doubt that it would be seen as a a giant victory for uh Trump and
MAGA if he gets that pass so again I say
Trump is having the summer of all summers like I've never seen anything
like this really this this is really impressive so we'll see if he uh keeps
up the winds um I hadn't talked about this before because I thought it was too
much of a local story in New York but apparently a socialist
might become the next mayor of of New York this guy Zoran Mumani a 33y old guy
with a very light resume for politics um but he's a socialist and what he's
promising which apparently has brought him to um at least in polling um looking
like he might win uh over who he was who is he running against uh Andrew Cuomo um
so here's what he's promising for New York City
he wants uh he he wants to freeze rents
on rent stabilized apartments he wants to invest 70 billion I don't know where that comes from in publicly subsidized
housing he wants to open a public land for housing developments and more he
wants uh free bus rides and government-owned grocery stores government owned grocery stores you know
I've actually thought about that idea before well you know I know all of you are
going to say "But Scott you can't have government-owned grocery stores they
will ruin everything they touch." To which I say "H I wonder I wonder if you
had a government-owned grocery store that didn't have all the products
maybe it didn't have you know cleaning products and all the the extras but what if it had like a really lowcost good
protein and what if it had only food that RFK Gay Jr would say you know what
if you eat this food you're going to be a lot healthier and so they wouldn't necessarily focus on just price which
could be lower but maybe also health and maybe if people spent a lot of time
shopping there it would cause the uh it would cause the uh forprofit stores to
compete so maybe someday you don't need the government store maybe the regular
stores say "All right we'll have a section with lowcost high protein good
for you stuff." Maybe so the the trouble with all these socialist ideas
is they they tend to sound good on paper and if you don't live in a real world
but in the real world the government does ruin everything it touches and uh
if you put restrictions on um the price of rentals
nobody's going to increase the number of rentals so
uh the uh the newspaper in Chicago who has their own they have their own
socialist mayor Brandon Johnson this is what the Chicago Tribune said about the
possibility of New York getting a socialist mayor
uh so Chicago Tribune says um that the ending isn't pretty
the ending isn't pretty the first part is very pretty oh wow so I'll be able to
rent an apartment without it being too expensive huh I like it oh I'll be able
to ride a bus for free oh good idea i love it oh I'll be able to go to a
government grocery store and get lowcost groceries oh love it very pretty but as
the Chicago Tribune points out the ending isn't pretty
because they're at the ending point and it's not pretty all right meanwhile um
as you already know the Tesla robo taxis have rolled out for testing
in Austin and how big a deal is that well uh
here's a post by Bindu Ready who says uh if Tesla robo taxi beats Whimo and Uber
on price and speed it will become the world's most valuable company
so Tesla is on the cusp of being the
world's most valuable company that's before robots
let me say that again tesla is on the verge of becoming the
most valuable company in the world before they've even rolled out a robot
and the robot business could be bigger than anything they've ever done
now I should tell you that I do own Tesla stock so I'm not unbiased at all
but watching uh Elon Musk make all the right moves on the biggest stuff
um uh largest uh
so I see a post i don't know when this was but it looks like uh Israel's
looking to drop some bombs and Trump is warning them again i don't know if that's new that might that might be old
news i we'll catch up on that afterwards meanwhile in Florida um according to
Newsmax Florida is going to build a holding place in the swamp for migrant migrants
they want to detain that need to be shipped back I guess
and the only reason I'm reading the story because there's nothing interesting about a migrant facility is
that they're going to call it the al the alligator Alcatraz i just like the branding alligator
Alcatraz so that's where uh I guess that was nicknamed by the
attorney general James Omeer the alligator Alcatraz
and then uh Ukraine is reporting according to Newsmax that they thwarted an assassination
attempt against Zilinski and there was some Polish guy who was working for
Russia who tried to allegedly he tried to get a drone
um to kill Zalinsky but they foiled the attack now my my prediction is I feel
like all politicians will be too vulnerable to drone attacks when they're
traveling maybe not so much when they're in their own you know in their own
headquarters but I don't see how leaders can go out in public in like one year a year from
now uh every individual who wants to assassinate a world leader will be able
to launch a drone that can't be jammed
and they'll just say "All right here's the GPS coordinate." But if that doesn't
work just use facial recognition and build a little AI into it
i I feel like the ability to assassinate a world leader is going to go to Yeah
you can do it every time they go out in public because the drones will just be that good
um anyway uh par according to Waller Hub the Epoch
Times is reporting San Francisco is America's worstrun city
uh I like to uh mention all the times that that my uh state is considered the
worst of the worst but there it is however I would tell you
that San Francisco has been bad before and got over it um I lived in San
Francisco in the 80s when I was very young and first came to California and
here's my record so in the 80s living in San Francisco I got robbed twice at
gunpoint when I was a bank teller in downtown San Francisco uh once by a gun in a parking lot after
work once by a large knife on Market Street got mugged
uh that one I got away that's why I didn't give him any money and uh my
apartment was burgled once and my car's stereo was robbed I think four times so
I think there were four times I walked outside and saw my window broken and my stereo gone so that's what it was like
in the 80s and it got way better so there's still some chance it might
improve but it's not looking good at the moment meanwhile New York State is planning to
build a nuclear power plant uh the governor just announced which would be a
big deal and probably it would not be possible
uh except Trump had done a bunch of executive orders to reduce the
the regulatory burden so New York may be benefiting from Trump's uh getting rid
of the regulatory burden if if in fact that worked
and then the coolest invention I've seen lately I don't think I mentioned this
before but there's a company called New Scale that's in the nuclear power plant
um advanced technology kind of the new way to build a nuclear power plant but
they're engineering a system they haven't built it yet but they're looking to integrate the the production of the
electricity in their atomic plant nuclear plant but they would match that
with water desalination desalination
and production of hydrogen which could be used as a green fuel so they would
make electricity clean water and hydrogen all at the same
time so whatever is happening in the nuclear
field it's really big and it's really dynamic and uh I I also have some investments in
um one fund that is a a fund that has a number of nuclear nuclear assets in it
so I'm not objective but I think it's a safe bet that the nuclear industry
is going to get a lot bigger it just feels like there's no way to stop that
all right ladies and gentlemen that's all I have for today it's another another wonderful day we'll
follow the news and find out if Trump's victory is holding
um there will of course be challenges to it i would not be surprised if there are
some breaks in the ceasefire but um I think there's a good chance that Trump
will be able to hold it all together so we'll see all right I'm going to talk to the uh the beloved local subscribers
privately and the rest of you thanks for joining i will see you same time
tomorrow all right locals coming at you privately
