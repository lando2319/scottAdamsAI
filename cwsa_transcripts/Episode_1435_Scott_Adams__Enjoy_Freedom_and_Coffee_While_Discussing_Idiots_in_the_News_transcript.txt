hey everybody it's time for coffee with
scott adams
best time of the day uh let me check
researching researching yes yes it's the
best time of the day
confirmation not confirmation bias
and all you need is a copper mug or a
glass of tanker chelsea's dianetic
canteen jugger flask of vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid i like coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine of the day the thing that
makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and
it's going to happen right now go
ah yeah yeah that's really good
really good or as joe biden would say
about his coffee
it's really good it's it's really good
yeah that's all you need to know so i
saw a story that i'm not sure i want to
believe yet
that there were some kind of wuhan
military games
some kind of athletic event in wuhan a
few months before
wuhan was known to have the virus and
some of the athletes
came down sick and they report that the
city was sort of closed down
now if any of that is true it would
suggest
that china's government knew about the
virus well before
they let us know but i think this story
is sort of a wait and see
i don't know that i would necessarily
believe this one
because it's a little bit too on the
nose
you know you know what i mean it's a
little bit too exactly what you want it
to be
so maybe it's true maybe
where's locals locals is up and running
right now so i'm
live streaming on it and you want to go
to scottadams.locals.com
and that'll take you to my feed
so rasmussen polled people on the
door-to-door vaccination push that the
biden administration wants to do
and ask people is it a good idea is it a
good idea to knock on doors and ask
people if they've been vaccinated
now to be clear they're not knocking on
doors and forcing people to be
vaccinated
they're just making it available and
informing them and stuff
but they're also persuading right so let
me talk about that after i give you the
the details so rasmussen said that
37 of the public said that's a good idea
and 53 said that's a bad idea
but what would make it a bad idea if
it's not being forced on people
you open the door well you're a little
bit bothered right
but it is a national pandemic you know
well it's a
pandemic so it's everywhere and
certainly if somebody's going to knock
on your door
wouldn't you when you want it to be
about something this important
so i would say on the first the first
part of it is
an intrusion that's unreasonable i'd say
no
you know given the stakes that are
employed here
people knocking on your door is not a
big deal
i'm seeing hipaa concerns somebody
doesn't want their medical
information known but it's still
optional right
so since when is your government doing a
bad thing if they're simply giving you
information and they're giving you
opportunity
to get the vaccination or not
simply making resources available is
that bad
well here you get into the weird
hypnotist dilemma now
is there anybody watching this who
doesn't know i'm a trained hypnotist by
now i say it so much it's just like
disgusting every time i say it
but it's important that you know that
because when i make my next
point you need some some context
and here's what i've said before in
public that once you become a trained
hypnotist
and you actually understand the power of
it
it's hard to use it because it becomes
immediately unethical
when you're that good at it so likewise
if a professional boxer gets into a
you know a bar fight and kill somebody
that boxer is in trouble because their
their hands are lethal weapons whereas
the average person
not so much so like a boxer
a hypnotist has to have some
self-control
some moral or ethical you know limits
to what you're willing to persuade other
people into
so for example i would be hesitant
to do anything in sales because i'd be
too good at it
do you know what i mean does that make
sense that
if you're simply selling something
without any special
kind of talent you're just a good
salesperson let's say
that seems ethical you know we've all
agreed we know what a
salesperson is we know they're trying to
persuade us
it's all part of the system and you know
maybe we get talked into things we don't
like sometimes
but we accept it within the ethical
domain but what happens if you
convince somebody to take a medical
procedure
such as a vaccination and what if you're
wrong
and what if that person has a bad
outcome either way
you've convinced them to take it or not
take it
but is that moral is it ethical
because when the government knocks on
your door don't you think that's pretty
persuasive
it's the government how many how many
senior citizens
could say no to the government knocking
on their door
right now even if most people could
let's say 80 percent could say oh
i'm not going to change my mind just
because you knocked on my door get out
of here
but i'd say a solid 20 of any large
group in the public will simply be
persuaded by that
setup it's the government the government
knocked down your door
makes you feel important offers you
resources
makes the case there's nobody there to
make the opposite case right
what if i told you about listening to
one side's argument
worthless one side's argument about
anything worthless no you should say
tell yourself you've been misled not
informed
if you hear both sides of an argument
you might at least be approaching being
informed
but if you only hear one it doesn't mean
it doesn't matter which side you hear
that's just misinformation or at least
you should treat it that way even if
even if by chance is right
so i do have a ethical
problem with the government knocking on
doors and
offering optional optional vaccinations
because a solid 20 percent of the
country won't understand it being
optional
they might hear the words and they know
what the words mean but it's going to
feel
coerced a little bit right to 20 percent
of the public
so i think people who are against that
have a pretty good argument
um on an ethical level
the gateway pundit reported today and i
want to see how good you are
with reasoning and statistics okay
so put on your smart hat all right all
of you go into rational mode
i'm going to give you some statistics
here and see what you make of it
so gateway pundit pointed out uh
that there were 15 over 1500
uh coveted deaths in the united states
last week
all right so for the entire week last
week a little over
1500 covades but according to the
vares website where adverse reactions to
vaccinations are reported not very
accurate
but it's the one place that you know we
know to look
so we don't know if this these numbers
are half as much or 10
times as much but it's the only place we
have them and it says that 1750 deaths
were due to the vaccine the vaccinations
themselves
so last week there were more deaths
from vaccinations according to the vares
which
you know could be off by a bit but the
the main point will still be sort of
intact even if that number's off uh
and that's more people dying from the
vaccination
than died from covet itself
okay more people dying from the
vaccination
allegedly allegedly right
then the vaccinate than the disease
itself
so put your logical hat on what does
that tell you
what do you deduce from that
should you make a conclusion from that
did that tell you that the
vaccines are more dangerous than the
than the coven itself
because covet killed fewer people than
the vaccination did
all right here's how you should think of
that do you know why there were only
1500
deaths from covet last week
because the vaccinations work
the reason the cova deaths are so low is
exactly because the vaccinations are so
good
did they also kill 1700 people or so
don't know the the vares database really
isn't good enough to tell you that
but probably probably
some tens of people or hundreds or maybe
even low thousands
may have actually died from the
vaccination totally possible
right but what you should see here is
that comparing these two numbers means
nothing that's what you should have
concluded
you should have concluded that it means
nothing
except that the vaccinations work if
that's what's happening
all right all right uh so don't make
anything out of those
that comparison uh here's some fake news
um there's reports that the
biden allied groups so this is not biden
himself but groups allied with him the
democratic national committee for
example are talking about
uh fact checking more aggressively the
social media platforms
including can somebody play some ominous
music
oh is that ominous
[Music]
sort of ominous including your
text messages what
they're gonna start effect checking your
private text messages
what
are you okay with that all right
i think this is fake news because the
way it's being interpreted
and i think politico reported on this
first
the way it's being reported is as if
your
private text messages are going to be
read by people
and maybe even blocked if they say the
wrong thing
i don't think that's what's happening
here my guess
is that at most maybe they would talk
the social media
platforms into looking for keywords
maybe links to things that they know are
bad links
and simply sending a message that says
hey here's the true story on
vaccinations or whatever
but i don't think there's any way
that anybody is seriously talking about
blocking your text message
because it said the wrong thing so i'm
gonna
i'm gonna die on this hill that says
that this is fake news
and that the only thing that would ever
be talked about
is your algorithmically having the
computer look for a keyword
send you a little reminder that maybe
you should look at this other source
before you say stuff like this
now separately you could ask is that a
good idea
because what if they do more of it right
if you tell me oh we're going to do this
one thing in the context of a pandemic
and that's the only time it'll ever
happen i'd say well maybe
you know maybe because it's short term
i'm generally
favorable to anything that's short term
you can you can sort of measure how it's
going
so you can stop doing it anytime i
generally
am okay with testing things and you know
let's see what happens
but what happens if it works they get
the result they want
and then what happens if they want to do
more of it next time
what if there's another another topic
let's say
election integrity suppose
the next thing they want to say is if
anybody texts you about the election
being unfair
that they start putting in little
warnings to say that's not true
this election was perfect what if you
start talking about climate change in a
skeptical tone
privately on a text message will they
say well climate change is as important
as the pandemic if not more
so if we did this text stuff with the
pandemic
why wouldn't we do it with climate
change why wouldn't we
right so i think you have to look at
this as
uh you know i don't believe in the
slippery slope per se
but certainly in the case this clean
where if it works in one situation
that's an emergency
the pandemic why wouldn't it work in
another one
such as wars and and
climate change and anything else so i'd
worry about that quite a bit
about that going but i'm not worried
that your message will be blocked
and i'm not terribly worried that a
human will read it
although that's always a risk i feel
like all they want to do is
pick up the key words and make sure that
you know what the other side is saying
i don't know could be terrible could be
good has a lot to do with implementation
well jenna ellis um who had been
attorney to president trump um
she just quit the gop because apparently
there was this
republican national committee chief
counsel guy justin riemer
who had uh there's some email had been
uh
surfaced that he had mocked the legal
team
for promoting the
election lack of integrity stuff
and so jen ellis says uh no more of this
no more of this the gop the party
um essentially acting in ways that i
imagine she thinks is against the
interest of
the members um so she
made some made some news by quitting
now i got to say people who spend time
around
ex president trump they pick up his
tricks
and this is a really good technique
because she became the
the number one headline today and it
shaped the news really well
so from a persuasion perspective
jenna ellis especially you know being as
close as she has been to trump
quitting the republican party highlights
this issue
and probably helps trump
because it's you know it's furthering
that divide between the
anti-trumpers and the trump supporters
and i think the president likes that
right now
you know get a little energy going a
little bit of conflict
and i think he has to defeat the gop
before he defeats anybody else
right so um in terms of persuasion
jenna ellis gets an a plus for this move
um
all right so that that happened
meanwhile in the least surprising news
you've ever heard in your life
it turns out that members of that haiti
hit squad
that executed the president assassinated
him
it seems that a number of those people
had
dea or fbi informant
connections
yeah so now we have it looks like
confirmed
i mean it's still he do you know fog of
war so maybe that's not true yet
but it looks like the fbi and the cia
knew some of the people how well did
they know them
to be determined now the fact that they
knew them does that mean that they were
behind the plot
no not necessarily
but makes a lot more likely
if you had to put odds on it the odds
are increasing
and what about this uh the so-called
doctor
who was allegedly the person who would
be installed as the new president
does this seem to you that that doctor
didn't quite know what
was going on almost as if the doctor was
a pawn
and not really intended to be the new
leader
but rather maybe somebody just wanted to
execute the president
and convince this doctor that he was the
leader of the gang
and got the doctor to organize it so
that whoever really wanted to
kill the president of haiti is
sort of free
so uh what do you believe about this
do you believe that the united states
backed these uh
plotters and that they were just trying
to get rid of the president of haiti and
they did it this way
what odds would you put on that now
let's see in the comments
show me the odds that you think it was a
uh
let's say a cia backed plot
i'll just read off i'm seeing 75 95 85
74 5 90 30 85
50 50 60 75 percent
uh 25 that's low zero percent somebody
says
uh 25 yeah
okay you can stop putting this down um
somebody says the cia killed jay guevara
i don't i don't know is that true i
wouldn't know about any of that
yeah and somebody says it's the clinton
faction that did it
okay um
we live in a country in which the
president of a neighboring country
you know a nearby country let's say can
be assassinated
and our own country believes that we're
guilty of it
how would you like to be biden when
you know over you think there's a more
than 50 percent chance he just
murdered the president of another
country
john mcafee did it
that would be amazing if john mcafee did
it but i don't think so
uh robert barnes suggested that clinton
is involved
ah you know i don't think we have
evidence of that
but maybe we have something that looks
like a possible motive
so that story is going just the way we
imagined it would go
let's talk about hunter's emails because
can't get enough of that so
uh on hannity and then it was reported
in breitbart
this fellow named peter schweizer who's
the president of the government
accountability institute
sounds important the government
accountability institute
said yesterday that his organization had
confirmed that president joe biden was
the direct beneficiary of hunter biden's
financial deals with foreign interests
now apparently they have access
they say to all of the emails on the
laptop which they have confirmed
to be true because the emails match up
with where hunter and his
security were at any given time now
how persuaded are you
that peter schweizer the president of
the government accountability institute
says this is confirmed so it's confirmed
right
because he's the president of the
government accountability institute for
god sakes
what exactly is the government
accountability institute
how about you don't know
about i don't know but do you think it's
part of the government
i don't think so i think it's a private
group that gave themselves a important
sounding name
so how uh how persuaded are you
the one person who saw the emails on a
laptop thinks that
there's a certain conclusion i know lots
of people saw those emails
and i don't think that they have other
information that we know about
so i would give that a very low
credibility at the same time i would say
it does seem likely that
hunter biden was making deals that would
benefit the whole family
that seems pretty likely but i wouldn't
take this source too seriously
i saw ben shapiro tweet that
now that cuba has closed the internet
because there's a lot of
revolting going on there it's a
revolting island
um that apparently we have some
technology the united states does
that we could provide internet to the
island
i don't know what that would look like
exactly
but is that true do you think do you
believe that we could actually
provide internet let me ask this
question
what is the name of elon musk's company
is it starlink
is a star link that's going to have the
satellites everywhere
so there will be low earth satellites
and that's elon musk's company right
starlink so you could have these tiny
satellites in low earth orbit basically
everywhere when they when we get enough
of them they're launching like crazy
uh once you have them everywhere can
any government turn them off because i
don't see how
because won't it be sending the um is it
wi-fi
i mean what kind of signal is it sending
exactly
if it's sending wi-fi and i don't know
if that's the case but maybe it is
is it wi-fi can somebody tell me is that
would starlink
be sending wi-fi or does it send its own
kind of special signal
like like a cell phone signal or
something
somebody says it's not wi-fi it's radio
not wi-fi
but how will your will your regular
phone be able to pick it up
oh it's just cell service somebody's
saying it's just going to be like a
regular cell phone radio
signal that would make sense and then it
would be linked to other cell services
so that it's basically just a big
phone network in the sky
uh well now somebody else says it's
wi-fi
huh maybe it comes down to sell signal
and then you can hot spot it and turn it
into wi-fi or something i don't know
but here's the thing how can any country
turn off its internet in the future
doesn't seem like that's oh you need a
small dish somebody says
i don't know but the point is i don't
think you could jam all of it
because you'd have to jam the whole
country
i think this is a big game changer right
because countries need to be able to
control their own communication
to to have a dictator situation
what happens when everybody in china can
get all the information they need
so i think i think we may if we don't
have the technology right now
we're probably pretty close maybe a few
years away
and what do you think of the idea of
turning on the internet for the cubans
assume that our cia is all over this
right we'd like some kind of a good
outcome in cuba but uh
i don't know it feels like an act of war
doesn't it
would you say it's an active war to
provide internet to a country that's
trying to prevent its
uh its people from seeing the internet
would you call that an act of war
because somebody might
i mean you're giving them free stuff
but it's going to feel like an active
war similarly
if china gave us lots of free fentanyl
it would feel like an act of war because
i've called it that
all right remember i said that
republicans would be hunted
i'd like to ask once again how many
republicans are in jail
right now because of the capital
protests i just like to bring that up
every day
are there hundreds in jail
for being part of a protest is that real
like i don't even know if that's real
because that sounds like
not the united states that sounds like
some other country
that would do something like that are
they not at least out on bail
so um i'm going to say that
that republicans are haunted as long as
those folks are in jail i'm going to say
that that's just the case
you live in a country where you can be
jailed for being republican
here's a some interesting statistics
david blake
phd says on twitter and i haven't
confirmed this but maybe you can
that uh reported yesterday that there
were 258 cova deaths in the united
states
and over 99 of them were unvaccinated
in other words basically two people died
yesterday of covet in the united states
who were not vaccinated
two now do you take from that
whoa those vaccinations are working
really well
well a few caveats number one yesterday
was monday and i think the reports
lag because of the weekend so
so when we say how many people were
reported dead yesterday
that doesn't mean how many died
yesterday that just means how many were
reported
and maybe the weekend is a lagging
report so maybe that's behind a little
bit
so we'll see if that changes because of
the weekend but
would you be willing to say at this
point
that although infections are going up
all right let's let's take two data
points infections are going up
everywhere that they've
loosened restrictions and basking
would you say that the the first thing
is correct and that that's happening
at the same time that it's summer so
this is the natural low point for the
virus
is that would everybody agree with those
two statements
that the virus has a natural low point
in the summer
but we can see quite clearly the effect
of
getting rid of masks and loosening up on
travel and stuff like that
because the number of infections is
starting to spike exactly like you'd
expect
even in the summer so the summer should
be the lowest but we're still getting a
spike
does that tell you that the
social distancing and the masks did make
a difference
and the moment we took them off you saw
exactly the spike in infections that you
would expect
so does anybody have a counter to that
how would you counter the fact
that while infections should be going
down for all the natural
summer reasons they're going up anyway
and the only thing that's changed is the
delta variant i guess
so that has to be in the mix um
maybe it's just the delta variant yeah
that would be a good answer
you might be a i i think that would be a
good answer you could say no no all
you're seeing is the delta variant is
picking up
and you're not seeing any difference
about masks or anything else
that would be a good argument i would
accept that as a a reasonable
counter-argument and how about
how about vaccinations if the only thing
you knew
is that only one percent of the people
who were
vaccinated actually got actually died
from it
yesterday if that were true would that
convince you that vaccinations work
you still might have issues about
long-term problems right
but would it tell you that vaccinations
work i'm seeing a no
explain why not give me your reasoning
i'll accept a yes or no because i asked
a yes no question
but i'd like to see your reasoning
if anybody has any um
i'm seeing yeses and no's but give me a
reason somebody just give me a reason
um no we're not talking about long-term
effects that's
important but a second separate question
linked to a study death rate was less
than one percent before vaccinations
[Music]
wait are we looking at the same thing if
if of the people who died only one
percent of them were
unvaccinated now you're not comparing
the right number here
um what do you mean when you say the
vaccine works what i mean in this
case working would be that the only
people who died are people who didn't
get the vaccination
for all practical purposes you know if
two people got vaccinated and died
maybe they didn't die of the coronavirus
right
maybe there was a lot of comorbidity
going on there and maybe
maybe nobody died
all right well i just put that out there
to to wrestle with
and let's compare that
to what alex berenson is saying so i was
just reading his
sub stack now you might know alex
berenson as
maybe the most notable um let's say
critic of science and um
government specifically in the
coronavirus
situation now a lot of what alex
berenson said is
is worth looking at and um
and i i like the fact that there are
critics you know you need
you need some critics all the time to
you know keep everybody sharp
but here's some things he said and this
is a current writing
so this is as of right now i believe
this would be alex berenson's opinion
he wrote and i quote no serious person
thinks masks protect their wearers for
example
but we mandated those for more than a
year so as
of today alex berenson says
no serious person thinks masks protect
their wearers
would you agree with that statement now
you're not you're not agreeing with the
statement about whether masks work or
not
we're only agreeing with the statement
that no serious person
thinks it protects the wearer as opposed
to protecting other people
let me look at your comments i see you
agreeing with him
saying yes yes true true
yes i don't know what to do about this
people people
there are serious people who say masks
protect the wearer
do you know who those serious people are
all of the top medical people
everywhere that's who says it
all of the top experts
everywhere say that masks do protect the
wearer
this is fairly new this is this is
really only in the last month or so i
think
because it used to be that these smart
people said no it's only for the benefit
of the
other people but as of today
i'm pretty sure that almost all of the
major
experts would say it also protects a
little bit
the wearer not in every case
not if you're marinating in it but
again i'm not saying they work and i'm
not saying they don't work that's a
separate question
i'm saying who says it works pretty much
every expert everywhere but alex
berenson writes
no serious person thinks masks protect
their
wearers what do you call a serious
person
now again i'm not saying that alex
berenson
is right or wrong about masks only the
question about whether serious people
disagree with him
i don't know how you could write that
sentence
anyway um here's something else that
alex says
he has debunked the following statement
all right so he says what he says about
the statement i'm going to read
is that it now appears provably
incorrect
so provably very high standard right so
this is not maybe incorrect
according to alex this is provably
incorrect the following statement
vaccines do not eliminate all cases
but they work very well especially
against severe disease or death
do you think that you can say it's
provably
wrong that vaccines protect against
severe disease and death
do you know who disagrees with that
statement
every expert in every country
but alex berenson writes this like it's
just a fact
like it's provably correct but he
disagrees with every expert
in every country and yet when you read
this
if you haven't heard the counterpoints
you'd say well it looks pretty good to
me
so this is this is the problem of of the
one expert problem
and it has nothing to do with alex
berenson it has to do with if you listen
to
just tony heller you will believe that
climate change isn't real
if you listen to just al gore
you'll believe it's real and the end of
the world is coming pretty fast
never listen to one person and
alex berenson has that that issue
which is he's one person you know one
person can't be more than one person
so you hear his opinion he's very
persuasive
is he persuasive yeah yeah he's really
persuasive
and but if you believe him
because he's persuasive you're making a
big mistake
and it wouldn't matter if it's alex
berenson or anybody else
if you believe one person because
they're really persuasive
you've made an analytical mistake
so um given that only
one percent of the people who had
coveted
yeah only one percent of the people who
died of covet were unvaccinated
i feel like that's pretty good evidence
that the vaccinations work
the counterpoint is that i guess great
britain
and israel who are quite well vaccinated
they're sort of case studies and how to
get everybody vaccinated quickly
they're also having an increase in
infections
so does that mean that the vaccinations
don't work or don't work well enough
well it probably just means that
everybody opened up a little bit
we know you can get the infection even
if you're vaccinated we've got the delta
variant which is more spready
i feel like what we're seeing in israel
and great britain are completely
explained
it's explained by opening up it's
explained by the delta variant
that's why you got the spike even in the
summer
and yet the death rate is super low
because the vaccinations work
and the therapeutics work i mean i would
say
everything we see is explained by the
official explanations at this point
doesn't mean they're right right it
could still be completely wrong
ever see anyone with gillian bars so yes
there's a a rareish disease
called is it gillian or jillian bar
but some number of people who are
getting the vaccination and i believe it
was the
j and j one yeah so
and of 12.8 million people vaccinated
about 100 people got this rare
neurological condition which is largely
recoverable i don't know if largely
recoverable means
most people get over most of it but it
still lingers forever
or if most people get over it completely
which is a pretty big difference but
this sounds pretty nasty
but what do you make and what do you
make of 100 out of 12.8 million
if you knew that that was your risk the
risk is
100 people and of 12.8 million would you
incorporate that risk in your decision
all right let me ask this just very
limited question
if you knew that your only risk let's
say there were no other risks
of course there are other risks but i'm
just going to keep it simple
if the only risk were a hundred
people out of 12.8 million getting this
largely recoverable neurological
condition would you
include it in your decision go
would you include it in your decision at
all
i say yes i see somebody saying
unnecessary risk
so that would be a yes
i'm saying lots of yeses all right
here's for those anybody who said yes
do you include the risk of dying in a
car accident
when you go to the store when you decide
to go to the store for something maybe
you don't need as a necessity
you know you'd like a loaf of blue red
but you're not going to starve without
it
do you include the risk of dying in a
car accident
before you decide to go get that loaf of
bread
probably not right and i think that the
way to approach these
is if the risk rounds to zero
just ignore it it doesn't make it go
away
but all of your life is filled with that
kind of a risk
and the only way you can navigate life
with these tiny tiny risks but
everywhere
you know you're just surrounded by tiny
risks
you've got to kind of ignore them that's
really the only way to make the decision
so forget about what is true or false
about vaccinations i'm only talking
about decision making
when it comes to decision making when
the risk is that small
just ignore it all right now of course
if you're the one who gets it
it makes it sound like you made a
mistake but you didn't
all right the what's really
oh let's talk some more about this so in
california
we know that the cdc said that kids
don't need mass
go back to school but california
required them
so as of now california says yes masks
what do you think is going to happen so
you've got a governor who's going into a
recall election
governor newsom so the governor needs to
stay on the right side of the people
right
do you think governor newsom is going to
continue to
go against the cdc
and require masks when almost every
parent in california
would like to kill him for it right
i mean when your government does
some things you know makes you really
mad
but if your government is making your
kid wear a mask in school
you just want to kill that person not
literally right but
but your hatred for somebody doing that
to your kid
is pretty high right and i think you're
going to see the march of the cairns
you're going to see the white mostly
the white moms just rip the
out of the governor newsom
especially right around school school
time
now already we saw softening because
hours after california public health
officials posted the new school
guidelines meaning the mask
requirement um
they indicated they might change the
rules so as soon as the rule came out
there was so much blowback that they're
like well we might
here's the rule but we're going to
reconsider it a little bit
here's my prediction
compare the attitude just read the room
right
just read the room all of the parents
of all those kids who are going to go
back to school
how do they feel
pretty raw you know the way they feel is
pretty raw isn't it
and pretty strong now compare
whatever small political advantage if
any i don't think there's any
that newsom might get by pushing for the
masks
i think you have to predict that the
mask requirement will be dropped
i don't know if you'll get enough
parents to send their kids to school
you i've already heard parents say well
then i won't send my kid to school if
they have to wear masks
we'll just keep doing learn at home
remote learning
how many kids would have to stay home
and say we'll
we'll just do remote learning thank you
we'll just keep doing what we're doing
how many would have to do that before
the schools would have to say ah damn it
we'll get rid of the masks so i predict
that the mask requirement will be
dropped
if not before school starts in
california which is only
a days away but certainly
soon after i think it'll have to happen
now here's a question i asked
for a school age kid only let's say
under 18
is getting coveted infection the same as
getting a vaccination
effectively why do we call it
getting kovid if you're under 18.
is it do we call it that because that's
what we call it when somebody older gets
it
if i get covered i got a disease
right if a 12 year get gets covered
they got vaccinated let me say that
again
if i get coveted let's say i hadn't been
vaccinated if i get it
i've got a disease if a 12 year
old gets
covered they just got vaccinated
am i wrong why do we use that why do we
use the word
you know they got a disease if they're
12. they didn't get a disease
they just got vaccinated they just got
vaccinated by nature
the fact that we're even using the same
 word
for kids is why we're not doing well
here here's a little uh lesson on how
the brain works
that until you hear it the first time
um well this this this could blow some
minds
you think that the way you come to your
decisions is some kind of logical
process happening in your brain right
you think you look at the facts and then
you imply your rational brain and
that's how you make your decisions well
not really not really because most of
our decisions are irrational
and then we layer a rational explanation
after the fact so your decisions are
pretty much all
irrational whenever there's any emotion
involved anyway
fear and of course all the the coveted
stuff is all full of fear and emotion
so those are not rational decisions but
here's a little thing you might not have
known
that thing that you think is your
rational mind
is just language
it's just words if you put words
together in a way that forms sentences
that humans understand
they feel as if there's a reason
grammar looks like logic
to most people think about that
simple grammar just putting words in in
a way that they
make sense in the sentence looks to
many people and maybe most maybe all
it looks like logic so
your choice of words becomes the
pseudo-logic
that people use to make decisions let me
give you an example
hey bob i'd like you to drink some
poison
here you go drink some poison
would you do it no
you don't drink poison but what if that
was just the word i used
what if what i gave you was a delicious
glass of fresh water
your logic should have said it doesn't
matter what word you use
this is a delicious glass of water i've
just tested it myself
yum but as soon as you call it poison
a certain part of the population will
never touch it
they'll say well you wouldn't call it
poison unless you know some reason
so putting the wrong word on stuff
becomes a logic it's not a real logic
it's the
the crazy irrational logic that our
brains do
so when we say that a kid who's 12 years
old
gets the coven 19 and we say that kid
has a disease we have substituted
words for thinking
because that kid didn't have a disease
that kid got vaccinated
if we had used the word vaccinated as
just a standard for anybody who
came in contact with the with the virus
under the age of 18
would we be deciding what to do about
school
nope because you would say to yourself
wait a minute my 12 year old can get a
free vaccination by just going to school
and hanging around with infected people
sign me up let's get that kid vaccinated
get this over with right
now you're saying to me but scott scott
scott
the vaccination could give you a side
effect and kill you
you got to include that right nope
because the risk of it is too small the
risk is so small that you should just
round it to zero and act like it's not
there
but how about the risk of dying from
covet itself scott
kids are not immune from getting coveted
dying
right should you consider that risk if
they're not vaccinated
no no you shouldn't because it's too
small
all of the risks that are too small you
just treat them like they're zero
you can't compare them i've heard people
say
well you know the risk of getting the
vaccination is unknown
so it's bigger because it's unknown
no it's not it's just unknown
might be smaller might be bigger
just don't know
so that's my statement on that if we
started talking about these kids as
getting
nature's vaccination suddenly we would
just feel different about it
and all the facts would be the same all
right
lastly i love this story about the
the uh the democrats lawmakers
in texas decided they don't want to be
part of the vote
for uh what the governor of texas abbott
believes would make the election um
safer and more secure but the critics
say it's really
voter suppression in disguise and so the
democrats
because they're in the minority and they
would lose the vote just a bunch of them
got on a bus and decided to go to
washington d.c
because there would not be enough
lawmakers in the
in texas to pass anything there just
wouldn't be a quorum
but here's the great part apparently
they can be arrested when they come back
to
texas
i don't know exactly what the law is
that allows them to be arrested
but i saw this reported without any
pushback so maybe it's a real thing
can the governor have these lawmakers
arrested when they get back to texas
it would have to be in texas apparently
but
what exactly are they being arrested for
what's the name of that crime taking a
bus to washington dc when you're
supposed to be working
is that a crime so i hear it being
called an insurrection
i like that i like where you're going on
that yes
the democrats are literally
involved in an insurrection against the
government of
of texas i feel like insurrection is the
right word right
is there anybody who would quibble with
the use of insurrection
if the lawmakers refused to do their job
and
and leave there's a precedent for it i
hear
interesting some kind of precedent for
arresting them for leaving but i still
don't know what the crime is
um interfering oh interfering with the
political process
could that be the crime i can see
that i i can see that being exactly what
they're doing because
they're transparently doing that i don't
think that they're
trying to fool anybody they're
transparently interfering with the law
making
all right that is all i have today
for this fantastic episode
of coffee with scott adams one of the
best things you'll have
experience all day all right i'm going
to say goodbye to
youtube and i'll talk to my locals
people here in a moment
