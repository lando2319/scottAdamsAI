[Music]
do do
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of humans civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams I'm
pretty sure you've never had a better
time in your life and it's going to get
better
at the moment we're going to levels and
nobody's ever even heard of in their
entire life all you need is a copper bug
or a glass so take your Chelsea style in
the canteen chugger flaska vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure it's the don't be
the end of that day the the thing that
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip
join me now go
oh
everything in my life is a little bit
better right now a little bit it's
really all directional you take that a
sip of coffee
and you're at least heading in the right
direction for a change huh am I right
well I've got an update
um I've decided that instead of having a
mere live stream or some some would call
it a podcast that doesn't sound cool
doesn't sound cool at all
so instead I've decided that at least
the people who are on the local
subscription site we're going to form a
cult
occult now we're not going to require
you to shave your head
uh you know unless you're going to
follow the leader sort of thing but you
know I'll just shave mine the rest of
you you can shave anything you want
it's uh it's free forum if you think it
needs shaving shave it
you could wear anything you need you do
not need to wear flowing robes
pajamas are recommended but not required
however there is one requirement for
being in the
Scott Adams coffee with Scott Adams cult
you have to get our vaccination we've
developed our own vaccination
and it's just just for people in the
group and if you're worried about the
safety don't be because we tested it on
six mice
so our vaccination was tested on six
mice
five of them survived so I'm feeling
pretty good about that so that's a
requirement if you want to join the
coffee with Scott Adams cult you've got
to get our vaccination
which was successful in five out of six
mice
well one of the big questions we've had
is what is a woman
I know Matt Walsh has asked that
question what is a woman and a lot of
you were saying Scott we can't figure
out what is a woman will you finally
settle this for us
so I have
a lot of people would ask that question
they they just fall apart
so uh what is a woman well uh let's see
you've got your chromosomes and your
genes but then your preferences but then
you wake up in the morning and you you
feel more like a woman so you put on
lipstick but you could have felt more
see that's no good no good
that's how people answer that question
I would like I'd like to now model for
you the correct way to answer the
question what is a woman because you
might get trapped
somebody might you know put a microphone
in your face when you're walking down
the street excuse me ma'am or sir can
you tell me what is a woman
and so I'd like to show you the correct
way to do this
we'll be using Dale
excuse me sir could you tell me
what is a woman
and then I say yes and I always take the
microphone out of their hand because you
want to take the power away yes
um
definition of a
definition of a woman is a defined a
woman as anyone who doesn't think about
ancient Rome once a day
and
and scene
if you're not thinking about ancient
Rome at least once a day
can we really call you a man
you would only be sort of a man
if you think of it five times a day like
I do all man
totally male
all right how many of you have seen the
video new video of Tesla's new robot
they're working on called Optimus and
watches standing there like a person and
sorting blue and green things into
different bins
now the amazing thing is not that it
looks exactly like a person
now it looks like a robot but the way it
moves
is kind of exactly like a person now you
really I don't know if you could tell
the difference
as as hands and a body and everything uh
but the thing that's new about it
because they've had robots that could
sort of things before
but what's new is they taught it to do
this by video
so they just showed it a whole bunch of
video of stuff and then it knew how to
do the stuff
this is a whole new world A Whole New
World
I want one of those robots so badly
now I don't know what the first
Tesla robot's gonna cost what would be
your guess has that ever been published
if you had to guess
the first humanoid Tesla robot
you're saying fifteen thousand
I was thinking quarter of a million
I was thinking more like a quarter
million dollars for a robot
for the first ones you know someday
there'll be fifty thousand someday
they'll be ten thousand but
I think the first ones are going to be
industrial only and they will replace an
employee
if you get a quarter million dollar
robot
how many years do you have to use it in
replacement of a person before you get
your money back
it's not that long
because a quarter million would be two
years of a high income or a higher
income person you know with Benefits
because remember there's no benefits
either well there's maintenance I guess
so that's sort of an offset but I would
think you could price these things the
first ones
at about a quarter million a piece
because they're going to do dangerous
work that you don't want to hire
um Regular humans to do anyway so if
you're thinking it's going to be ten
thousand
maybe it might be
I mean you know it's Tesla and it's Musk
so if Elon Musk thinks that a low a low
price is how you get more
you know more immediate
stuff
then maybe it will be but let me ask you
this how many millionaires and
billionaires would want to get a a robot
that could actually just walk around and
hang around with them
I think a lot I think there are actually
way more people than you think who would
pay a quarter million dollars for the
first robot
I think there would be quite a few I
wouldn't but there will be people
all right uh MIT has some big
breakthrough in the the hardware part
for AI
just to make sure that you could learn
and process faster and something like
several orders of magnitude better
so who knows if that'll turn into
anything but it does come from it's an
MIT team so that's good and uh
it's just sort of a sign of where this
could go
as interesting and good as AI is at the
moment
here's one just one technology that
might make it a hundred times more
efficient to learn and become an AI a
hundred times better
and that that's happening the same year
the AI became a thing
then somebody figured out how to make it
100 times better or at least more
efficient
all right I have a question for you that
I was mulling this morning
I'll just put it out there all right the
large language model AIS
um as you all know by now it creates
something like intelligence just by
looking at the combinations of words as
those words have been used by humans
so it can find intelligence just in the
combination of words now here's the next
question
words
as they're represented on a computer
could also be thought of as numbers
right
you can think of it as you know you
could change any any word into a number
and then do math on it and stuff but
you can at least turn it into zeros and
ones
so
it's amazing that you could make
intelligence out of words but it's even
freakier when you think those words
could be represented in zeros and ones
and that a combination of zeros and ones
which is also words and then the
combination of those words is
intelligence but if you take it all the
way back
all you needed for intelligence
was zeros and ones in the right
combination
how freaky is that
it was just zeros and ones in the right
combination made intelligence
I don't know yeah I mean it's it only
works because it's based on human
intelligence if you didn't have that to
see it it wouldn't work but it's just a
combination of zeros and ones that's the
most
the the if that makes you think your
intelligence is special
maybe not
maybe that's why I like uh drumming
if you look at drum beats they're
they're just left and right left right
left right and sometimes kick
all right well that was uh that was sort
of a dead end I didn't have anywhere to
go with that but I just thought it was
amazing that intelligence could be just
zeros and ones
all right here's let's talk about all
the fake news CNN has a big article
about uh Biden doing a bunch of useful
things to secure the Border
now since you're all suspicious and
skeptical news observers what do you
make of the fact that that the Biden
Administration is doing several things
working with Mexico specifically to
reduce immigration
what's the first thing that you say by
that
the first thing you say is
well that's interesting
number one why does why does Mexico have
to do everything instead of us
now maybe you say well it's just easier
you just get a sooner or you know our
laws don't apply if it happens down
there so we don't have to worry about
our own laws getting in the way like
Asylum and stuff that all makes sense
but
why is it that we have to depend on
other countries to secure our border
isn't isn't one eyebrow just going up
it's like let me understand this
can you think of any other country who's
having a border problem and the way they
solve it is they go to the other country
and they say could you act differently
so that we don't have to close our
border
who does that
right there's something just naturally
wrong with the story isn't there
just just something like missing in the
story
like we can't close our own borders you
have to you have to beg the other
country to completely change their
processes so you don't have to control
your border
okay so that's the first head scratcher
the second one is
why now
why would they be getting serious about
now
the only reason is because it's making
Biden Paul poorly and you know for the
presidents it obviously has to do with
2024 and obviously
is being driven only by politics which
suggests that the people behind you know
border security are not interested in
actually securing the Border
because if you require the politics to
even be interested in it
there's not much interest there in just
doing your job
you know it's not until you're
threatened that you do something
but I'll tell you what the most amazing
thing is about this story and I wonder
how many of would have mentioned would
have noticed
do you remember when RFK Jr did his
documentary little film about the Border
and although he's Democrat so you'd
expect him to you know buy into the
Democrat Narrative of everything
when he reported he told us something
that I didn't I did not know
that almost all of the immigration was
from countries outside of Central and
South America
that was coming from Africa and some
parts of I don't know Eastern Europe
and Asia
now according to RFK RFK Jr it was
almost entirely that group
yeah a lot a lot of Africa China Etc uh
Middle East almost entirely
and it was actually very little from the
actual region so when CNN does their
story
it's a big story about how a bunch of
stuff is being done on the border and
that the U.S is working with Mexico to
keep people within Mexico so they don't
cross over
what part of the story mentions that
the people are not coming from Central
and South America
well I read it quickly but I didn't see
it it wasn't mentioned
so somehow CNN wrote this major story
about immigration and the Border without
mentioning where the people are coming
from
does that sound right
is there like obviously something that
they've left out of the story or did RFK
Jr just make it up
did RFK Juju just like do a film and all
of it was fake
and there really are coming from Mexico
and Central America but he reported the
opposite
is that possible
I don't know
seems unlikely if I had to bet who's
lying to me RFK Jr where he's showing
his work or CNN where they're just
talking to you
with RFK Jr on this one
so that's some serious propaganda e fake
news because let me ask this how do you
feel about immigration if you know it's
coming from you know people who live
south of our border versus how do you
feel about it if it's military age men
from all over the world
completely different right
how you feel about it is completely
different because we're we're a little
bit used to immigration from our
southern region and we know what
problems and what benefits that brings
it's is well understood but as soon as
you say military age men from all over
the world
I assume some number of them are
terrorists and some of them were a lot
of them were were caught as actually
terrorists now how many of the
terrorists got through I would think the
terrorists would be trying pretty hard
not to get caught
you know even harder than the regular
immigrants
because regular immigrants don't mind
that much getting caught right
because they still get released into the
United States but if you are an
immigrant and you're a terrorist and
you're on some list you get a really
really really try hard to not get caught
I would think
so how many of those got away
I have no idea could be could be
thousands of you know
military terrorists in the country we
have no idea there's no way to know
so that's less than awesome
but look for the dog now barking which
is CNN not telling you the nature of the
people coming into the country
let's talk about the Washington Post
The Washington Post is flailing like
crazy because they've been totally outed
for being a disinformation source but
apparently they're writing again Mike
Benz is all over this on Twitter you
should follow Mike
b-e-m-z he's the one who explains to you
how the misinformation media works and
how it's part of the intelligence
operation so you can see all the gears
of the machine
um but as he says in his tweets since
Washington Post is attempting a 2.0
attempt after getting blown out last
time
um watch this master class and so why
the Washington Post is flailing around
to try to create this narrative that in
the world there's all this
misinformation
and there are these Good Guys forming
entities that the government is funding
I guess and these good guys are the ones
who'll be like Watchdogs against the
misinformation now what Mike Benz
teaches us is that's exactly what our
intelligence people do in other
countries to control them we create fake
organizations in other countries there
seem to be the disinformation Seekers
you know looking for all your
disinformation but in reality from the
start they're designed to create this
information they're just propaganda
entities and now we see that the the
same system has been fully implemented
in the United States which is completely
legal apparently it's totally illegal at
the moment
so the CIA or somebody of that type is
working apparently with the Washington
Post that would be the accusation the
allegation and that they always have and
that the
the news media and the intelligence
people have closed ranks and decided
that misinformation only comes from one
side of the political
sphere just it's just people on the
right with all their misinformation
and the people on the left will never
know
that this is all fake and it's all a you
know an OP they'll never know because
they don't watch this and they you know
if they don't follow Mike Benz if you're
not actually
following somebody
who knows how well this stuff works how
in the world would you know
how would you ever know
all right so every time you see
disinformation studies or disinformation
and researcher those are your keys that
it's a propaganda move
and not just I want to be clear about
this it's not just something that's
happening and I've decided to label it
as propaganda it's propaganda by Design
from the start
with lots of moving parts
right so we're not interpreting it it's
intended to be this and built to be
propaganda and it's in our country so
our news industry is essentially done
I think I could call that the death of
the news industry today
you know I'm not sure what day it died
but we don't have any we don't have
actually a news industry at this point
let me say that as clearly as possible
we don't actually have
a news industry
there's no industry that's called the
news anymore it's only propaganda now
that's not to say every member of the
news
is a propagandist there are plenty of
good people who are trying to break
three but they can't really break the
the corporate you know corporate cage so
as long as you work for some big
employer you're
yeah you're pretty much constrained
all right
so we don't have news anymore that would
suggest that people like me will
systematically be squashed
do you see that happening
do you see people like me being
systematically squashed
well let's uh game it through
so I've been canceled in newspapers
but and and Publishing but I was able to
recreate myself within the locals sphere
and also a subscription within the X
platform
and I don't know if you know but the
locals platform
um is part of Rumble so Rumble is the
parent of all that
so as we speak
um Rumble is losing its advertising
because of Russell Brandt
now that's the given reason so Burger
King and a few other companies are
pulling out their advertising from
Rumble because Rumble has not canceled
Russell Brand
right but just think about that now if
Rubble loses enough advertisers
Rumble goes out of business
if Rumble goes out of business remember
they own the locals platform the primary
way that I could make money because I'm
canceled
so I'm right at the edge
depending how you know financially
strong Rumble is I also own some stock
in Rumble because I had invested in
locals and then that got taken over into
Rumble that stock is worth a lot less
than it was less than half I think of
where it was but
um so right now Rumble is the last place
along with the X platform where you
could say you could say something that's
not approved by the you know the
intelligence sensors basically
and it looks like that's seriously under
attack
so if the locals platform goes down with
Rumble because there's some organized
thing against the advertisers that would
be one of the biggest blows to free
speech
ever
but I remind you that the ADL driven by
the Democrats tried to put Twitter out
of business
by organizing the boycott so the other
place that I could make money
on the X platform and I do
is under risk of never being profitable
and therefore it's an existential risk
if you're never profitable even if
you're owned by the richest man in the
world
you know something's going to happen
so the only places that you can be free
at the moment
Rumble and locals which are the same
thing
and the x-platform
are both under massive Advertiser
pressure
and uh gonna have a little trouble being
profitable which means their existence
is questionable
so
um I am actually impressed at the the
level of completeness of the evil that's
happening right now
because we've really lost the entire
news business the fact that people on
Rumble
can still say some things that sound
free
how many people on the left will ever
hear that
how many people on the left follow me on
locals
very few maybe almost none
how many follow how many people on the
left follow me on the X platform
very few
very very few so the first thing you do
is make sure that the dissenting voices
Are Walled off
because then they they're only just
talking to themselves
and then you can do whatever you want
with the rest of it which they've done
but then once you've got that you've
taken care of the rest of the media It's
all under your control which it appears
to be
then you've got to go after the bubble
because you don't want the bubble to
have a breakout moment so now you can
see that the bubble is being squeezed by
the advertisers who's being squeezed by
the Democrats who are being squeezed by
intelligence people so
it looks like there's something like a
complete
um a complete loss of uh First Amendment
that's coming up
it's almost complete because I don't
have any ability to talk in most of the
media would you agree I can get on
podcasts
but they have their own their own little
audiences but do you think that CNN's
going to invite me on to give my side of
things
I don't think so
the only reason anybody would invite me
on the the massive part of the media
would be to try to further degrade me in
other words it would be hippies
but they would never have Beyond just to
talk those days are over
think about it free speech actually is
gone except for the few little bubbles
that they're Exterminating at the moment
that's actually happening in your life
do you remember
some points in your life you heard
stories about the so-called blacklists
in Hollywood you know back in the the
dark McCarthy era and people were being
canceled and their lives were ruined for
allegedly being communists
ruined all kinds of lives do you
remember your thoughts about that when
you were reading it about history
I remember mine
thank God that'll never happen again
that was what I thought I thought well
that could never happen that McCarthyism
and here I am
I got McCarthy like personally not only
did I not think that it would happen
again
in the world I'll tell you the last
thing I thought is that it would happen
to me personally
I really didn't see that coming
I mean I knew I was flying close to the
Sun
but I really didn't think it was going
to go full McCarthy and take down free
speech in general I mean I really didn't
see the end of Free Speech but here we
are
here we are
all right
here's some fake news about Newsome
and I'm part of sending something else
some fake news
so you might know that there was some
legislation that knew some vetoed
by not signing it and the thing he
vetoed would have given
um
essentially preference to the parent in
a custody dispute preference to the
parent who accepted the gender
assignment of their child in other words
what the child said they were if the
parent accepted that they were more
likely to have custody
and the law would say that should be
taken into account
now Newsome declined to sign that and
people like me were fooled I was totally
fooled and thought oh wow he's
moderating because he's thinking about
running for you know a higher office so
he can't be so left he would do
something that was so it just we just
way over the line
so he's got to moderate that to run for
national office that's what I thought
I was very wrong
that's not what happened at all that
didn't happen it was a weasel trick
now Joel Pollock points that out
and the weasel trick was that in his
veto letter
Newsom said that he vetoed it
and in part because it's already the
career process
that the current rules and regulations
allows you to take into account
which parent was the one who accepted
the gender assignment
as one of many variables
so Newsom is Newsom did not veto
something he simply said it's already
the case
that's really different than vetoing
something
you didn't need a new law when it was
basically the way people are already
acting
oh that was a good weasel now I have to
say
what percentage of the voters
would be aware that this Law happened in
any vetoed it at all not many 10 maximum
do you think not even five percent five
percent maybe were even aware that you
vetoed something
and then of the five percent who were
aware he vetoed it what percentage of
the five percent
found out later that it was a trek and
he wasn't really vetoing anything
because it was already in the process
probably one percent of five percent
right I think it's hard for those of you
who watch this content every day it's
hard for you to understand
how little the public knows about
anything
in terms of politics I mean I'm I'm
barely keeping my my nose just above the
water line with all the legal stuff
you know trying to figure out who's
suing who for what and who got indicted
where for what it's like really hard for
non-lawyers to keep that straight if
you're a lawyer you're probably in
pretty good shape but for the
non-lawyers to keep all those different
legal Shenanigans in your mind it's
almost impossible
so it almost has no effect because it's
beyond our ability to process that we we
can't put it in a in a box
all right there's a
so so those are three really obvious
examples of fake news
is any of the news real
I don't think so I don't think any of it
is real why would it be one once the
intelligence agencies can completely
control the news which is largely the
case
um why would they ever do real news what
would be even the point of it there
would be no real point of it it would be
all narrative
all right
um
I saw some disagreement online about the
current divorce rate so I Googled it to
find out what it is
let me ask you what do you think is the
current divorce rate of people married
for the first time
give me your estimate before I tell you
what percentage of people who marry for
the first time eventually get divorced
all right answers are all over the board
somebody said a hundred percent but I
think that's yeah you always die
uh the answer according to Google
the answer is between 30 and 50 percent
of first marriages end in divorce or 35
to 50. isn't that too big of a range
how in the world would we not know
how many first marriages have ended in
divorce so far I guess you've got to
estimate the ones that are married that
have not yet
so how exactly do you do that
it that's sort of a big range
all right so up to half of first
marriages end of divorce that would be
the on the high side half
well second marriage is all right let's
see if you know this fact
our second marriages more likely or less
likely to divorce
more likely or less likely
it's way more likely
like a lot more likely
so second marriages have a higher
divorce rate of 60 to 70 percent
almost 70 percent of second marriages
do you know why that makes sense
because my theory is that people who are
good to be married to
are always good to be married to
and people who are not good to be
married to for anybody
are never going to be good to be married
to so a lot of the people get divorced
is because nobody could be married to
that person no we can nobody it's not
it's not a compatibility thing no no
it's not about your Chemistry it's not
about whether you went to you know
divorce counseling now there are some
people that nobody should marry a lot of
them and after they get divorced what's
the second thing going to be they get
divorced again and they just find that
again
yeah so
marriage is a system that you would
never design
well let me put it this way if you were
going to design a system that was the
main operating system for society
and marriage is that still
on paper wouldn't the current system the
way it exists the financial part the way
people are you know there are
opportunities on paper this wouldn't
work if there were no such thing as
marriage and nobody had heard of it and
you had a chance to design it and you
designed it and you showed it to people
they'd look at them they'd say
well this couldn't work how in the world
would this work
this is the worst idea I've ever
received on paper
you would never approve this plan you
know but we we got there through
history
and I don't think that people understand
that marriage was historically you know
for economic reasons and to make sure
that you were really the father and some
protection reasons and it's just
completely different reasons you know
today you're supposed to get married
because it feels good
am I wrong
marriage was designed as a utility
it was about keeping you alive and
making sure your economics worked and
protecting your unit and stuff like that
making sure you had somebody to take
care of you when you're old
right so those were pretty much economic
but somewhere along the line we got sold
on the idea
that it's something about God you know
that was always part of it but it's more
about how you feel
you know do you feel complete
how in the world is that going to work
so we have we have a process that was
designed for utility
but we're told that we should use it
because of the way it makes us feel but
it wasn't really designed to make you
feel good
I mean it does have that quality for a
lot of people but it wasn't really
designed to do that it's just not the
point of it
so it would be weird if it did because
that would be a coincidence not not a
design
all right well there's a poll ABC
Washington Post poll that shows Donald
Trump leading Biden by 10 points what
does it tell you when there's one poll
that's way different than the others
because the other polls are closer to
even
but it could be because it's newer
it did something happen in the last two
weeks
that would have changed things this much
did I tell you it's a Washington Post
ABC poll
Washington Post what do you know from
that
right so this is probably what the
intelligence people in the country want
you to think
because it comes to the Washington Post
um
and they would like you to think that
Trump will absolutely clobber Biden in
the election why why would anybody who
is on Biden inside
want to release a poll that says he's
going to get absolutely trounced
because they're trying to remove him
obviously obviously they're trying to
remove him early enough that they can
get somebody else in
what else could it be
what else could it be
oh oh I know stop it stop it you're
gonna say what else it could be is that
that's the data
right one possibility is well that's
just that's how the poll came out
there's no there's no clever plan or
intention they just did a poll and it's
wildly different than the other polls
but you know sometimes it happens
does anybody believe
that this would have seen the light of
day this poll unless the people in
charge thought it helped their narrative
now do you know what would have happened
under normal times if you saw a poll
that's so wildly disagreed with the
other polls do you know what would
happen
you would say you did it wrong and you
throw it away
now I don't know that that's true but
I'll bet if you talk to Rasmussen or you
talk to somebody who's just a pollster
right they're not political they're just
pollsters and you said if your poll came
back and it was wildly different 10
points is wildly different than the
other polls all of the other polls not
just something about all of the other
polls and you're wildly different do you
just publish that thing
you tell me those of you who have any
kind of experience in the real world do
you publish that
no
not in the real world in the real world
you assume is wrong
you assume it's wrong you might poll
again to see if he got the same but
you're not going to publish that you
would never publish that if your job was
just polish
that's my contention
that no professional would publish a
poll that was wildly outside the bounds
of all the other polls you would just
you would pull it back and you say we
better take a week off
because next week it'll either still be
there in which case
you know we've confirmed Israel or by
next week we'll find out it's not there
because you know we try again and it's
just not there but nobody would publish
that poll
for news purposes
you just wouldn't do it
so you would have to have some other
purpose
what would be the other purpose
it's obvious the other purpose would be
to discourage Biden from running
it's very obvious
all right
um
and of course you know Biden was down on
all of the various issues let's see if
you can guess the result on this one uh
asked about Biden's handling of
immigration situation at the border uh
what percentage of people said they
approve of Biden's handling of
immigration at the board oh yeah good
guess it's 23 percent
23 percent
and once again my audience is so smart
they knew the answer before I asked the
question yeah that's how we roll here
well Microsoft is going into the nuclear
power business
did you see that coming
Microsoft the company
is going hard they're not just tiptoeing
it they're going hard into building
nuclear reactors
do you know why
it's the only way that they can Empower
their data centers in a green way
it was the only way
so Microsoft is uh all in on nuclear
being green
and they're all in on micro reactors and
modular reactors
how do you get nuclear approved in a
country that takes 20 years to approve
anything
you make it modular and you make your
micro
so those were always the paths
the reason the companies didn't do it is
they they didn't have the they didn't
have the cover they couldn't do it you
know partly the technology had to
develop to a certain point but partly it
would just be too hard to be a
corporation and say you're going to do
something with nuclear you would just
get hammered
but apparently the message that nuclear
is green and not just green it's your
only hope
it's like your only hope for green it's
the only thing you could do maybe fast
enough and big enough and reliable
enough now of course I think Elon Musk
would say you could get there with solar
and batteries
but I still need to see a debate on
nuclear versus solar Plus batteries
alone
it's it's entirely uh
yeah it's entirely possible that musk is
right and that solar Plus batteries gets
you a better end state but I'd love to
see that argument and part of the part
of the reason that you can't be sure
is that you don't know what happens with
the economics of solar in five years
in five years there could be a
breakthrough that you know doubles
capacity or you know gives you
aluminum-based batteries instead of
lithium and suddenly all the economics
are completely different
so both nuclear and solar could undergo
like massive massive changes in
economics
you know in the next five to ten years
and they could they could LeapFrog each
other it could be that they're kind of
similar now but you know what Innovation
makes solar ten times as good but it
only lasts for a few years and then
somebody figures out how to make modular
Gen 4 nuclear stuff get a government
approval for every state to override the
state approvals and suddenly nuclear is
100 times better
than the best you know solar so I don't
think that anybody is smart enough
to do an economic projection of which of
those technologies will be the winner
in 15 years
there's no way to do it it's just not
it's it's an undoable
projection so do both that's the only
answer
well there's a fourth whistleblower
saying that uh Garland or the doj were
slow walking and trying to thwart any
any uh
investigations in Dubai into Hunter
Biden
so I would say at this point we have
complete confirmation
that the the Garland organization A.G
Garland was and try was trying to slow
down or stop or thwart the investigation
but listen to what Garland says
um
he's trying to answer the question if he
said that the prosecutor I guess it was
Weiss had all the authority he needed
but yeah wise seemed to not act like he
had all the authority he needed and
indeed he had to get more Authority as
he has now so uh Garland was asked about
that and uh
um
so Jim Jordan asked him uh he said uh
you said you you told the Senate under
oath that Weiss had complete Authority
and
and that no one had authority to turn
him down
and but they could refuse to partner
with him Garland said
so here's Garland's answer
that Weiss had all the authority
so long as the people in the states
agreed to to work with him but since
they had the total power to not agree to
work with him
that's what happened
so yes it was true that he had all the
authority he needed so long as states
with their own authority which would be
separate so long as they were working
with him but they had also the power to
just say no
and they said no we won't work with you
and then Garland uh
Garland explained he says you can use
whatever language you don't refuse to
partner is turning down oh Jordan said
that so Jordan says it's you know it's
the same thing that's the same as saying
you don't have the authority if you
can't do it you don't have the authority
and garlands tried to weasel and say you
do have the authority
but other other people have the
authority not to help you which
effectively stops you
and he tried to sell that
with and he actually said that it's not
the same under well-known justice
department of practice Garland claimed
now if you and I are watching this we
don't know what well-established justice
department policies are
so you just hear this you go ah I don't
know
but to me it sounds exactly like they
were thwarting him and I think the
whistleblowers are being completely
accurate on this that's my take
so if you're wondering if the Department
of Justice and Garland were crooked I
would say that's confirmed
is that does that feel
fair enough I would say that four
whistleblowers and then listening to him
explain himself would confirm that he's
crooked
and it's funny that we can say that with
confidence
you don't even have to wonder at this
point you know everybody's innocent
until proven guilty but I'd say he's
proven guilty
he was innocent in my mind until
four whistleblowers said he wasn't and
then we heard his explanation it was
obviously so under this
conditions yeah he's proven guilty he's
corrupt absolutely
think about the fact that he could have
been on the Supreme Court
he could have been on the Supreme Court
and we have confirmation that he's
corrupt
confirmation
it's right here so the news it's under
every news site
and he could have been on the Supreme
Court unbelievable
well what other is happening
there's a how many scientific papers
do you think we're let's say withdrawn
or retracted in 2002. of course there's
lots of papers so the answer is in 2002
there were 119 studies
that turned out to have been published
and peer-reviewed but later turned out
to be flawed or absolutely fake 119 of
them in 2002. that's a lot
right
it feels a lot 119. so that was in 2002.
how many do you think were retracted in
2022
last year
five thousand five hundred
fifty five hundred faulty papers were
retracted
now do you know why the number wasn't
higher
because there's a team of people looking
for fake papers
a little small team
let's see the data colada is the name of
the little group and there are
scientists who are just looking through
the literature to find the fake ones and
then surfacing them and they're getting
retracted now
it looks like it's only I think three
people primarily
and there were 5500 papers retracted
what if the people looking for fakes
were as well funded as Ukraine or
climate science or any of that imagine
if there were
imagine if you know the the people who
are looking for racism like the ADL they
find it everywhere don't they
because they're paid to look for it
so if you're paid to look for something
you're going to find it everywhere
but these three people who are doing it
not for money they seem to be doing it
because it would be good for the world
I found found 5 500 papers or they
contributed to the 5500 retractions
now out of 5500
don't you have some questions
don't you wonder if there was any domain
in which there were more fakes
yeah you do you do wonder if there's any
domain in which there were more fakes
what about the social sciences
do you think the psychology related ones
were more fake
of course of course they were
do you think that anything related to
vaccinations or climate change
do you think that might have a little
extra a little extra fakery in those
groups I don't know my my guess is
probably
because there's more money involved
wherever there's more money involved
and it's a hotter topic you'd expect
more
more shenanigans
so that's your situation I don't know
what percentage of papers get retracted
I heard at one point in 50 percent but I
felt that was low
the 50 percent that were retracted
are just ones somebody caught
it's not like there's somebody looking
at all the papers that's just the ones
they caught
so
yeah I don't I don't trust anything
anymore in science
so uh Jonathan turley's uh all over this
uh Bob Menendez situation so Bob
Menendez
member of Congress the senate senate the
Senate Foreign intelligence committee
who was ahead of it which was also Joe
Biden's old job
in the Senate
and apparently it's well understood
that if you're in that job you're
dealing with other countries in which
bribery is a normal way of business
right so he's the he was like a one of
the focus points in our government to
deal with the countries that bribe
and then it turns out that he was
accepting bribes
and of course we we believe that Biden
was doing something similar with the you
know the Biden crime family
now here's the question that Turley asks
that I think is a pretty fair question
this is not the first time Menendez has
been accused of wrongdoing of this
nature
he was already highly suspected of being
this kind of person
and yet he was put in the job where it
would be easiest to be this person
and as Jonathan Turley accurately points
out
why would anybody put this specific
person in that specific job
can you think of any reason
I can
whoever wanted him in that job was
getting a taste
can you think of another reason why in
the world would you put the most
suspected
Crook and the job were a suspected crook
would really like to be
yeah had to be intentional
there's no way it was an accident
so you have to assume that anybody who
approved it
is in on some kind of grift
that would be the reasonable expectation
all right I'm reminded that in a 2021
article
um
there was a survey that found that 34
percent of white students who applied to
colleges
falsely claimed they were a racial
minority
34 this is in 2021. why is it not a
hundred percent
what is wrong with white people
the 34 would suggest you've got 66
percent of white people who are stupid
that might be about right
I'm not sure that's wrong
but under under today's rules
you would be actually an idiot
to say that you were a white person on a
college application
because there's no penalty for being
wrong
and apparently the uh the way they're
doing it is saying they're Native
American like Elizabeth Warren
uh-huh
that's the perfect way because unless
you've got your you know unless
somebody's going to do some research
to actually go and talk to the tribe
that you claim to be a part of and maybe
you don't know what tribe because they
say I don't know a tribe and then
they'll say but you're not really Native
American unless a tribe says you are
that's the way it works right
that's my understanding you have to be
claimed by a tribe or you're not Native
American
but if you were filling out these forms
would you care about that distinction or
would you just say it's my impression
that I'm Native American
because I have Native American ethnicity
and the Forum is asking me about my
identification it's not asking me who
else identifies me it's not saying do
Native Americans identify you no it's
asking me what I identify as
so I'm going to identify as Native
American
get myself some money get accepted into
college you'd be pretty stupid not to do
it
I saw a comment I think it was a locals
there was somebody who's a pilot who was
filling out some internal forms and it
was a some white guy claiming to be some
other ethnicity and apparently all the
pilots are figuring out that they have
to claim to be another ethnicity too so
the pilots are teaching other Pilots had
a claim to be not white
and how to get away with it
so let me ask you this
in a world in which we have all this
systemic and direct discrimination why
is nobody trying to claim to be white
do you remember when people tried to
pass as white
and I think there's a fairly obvious
answer to that question because being
white is not an advantage
if it were people would be pretending to
be white but they're pretending to be
non-white
because everybody everybody knows that's
an advantage everybody
anybody who doesn't know that's an
advantage in 2023 is a idiot at
this point
so um
77 percent of the white applicants who
lied about the race on their
applications were accepted to those
colleges
interesting
so now I'm going to go to the Whiteboard
I'm going to tell you where things are
headed you ready
whiteboard time
well I'm old enough to remember
as many of you are as well
let me give you a clearer look here
when uh
if you're talking about discrimination
um the biggest topic of discrimination
was usually white versus black
so there was a time when it was just a
white versus black conversation but as
you know that was not good enough and
that eventually evolved into something
called intersectionality
now if you're not aware of this term
this is
intersectionality means that you might
be discriminated against for more than
one reason for example you could be
black but also a lesbian
so that's the intersection
and that's important because the the
problems of just being black would be
different from something who's black and
lgbtq
let's say you could throw disabled in
there you know people are differently
abled so you'd have a number of
categories that you could be more than
one you could be several things right
now why is this better
why is it better to look at
intersectionality
versus just to see things as race
well I'll tell you your common sense
is is very clear on this which is that
it's not close enough
that the the people who have these
unique problems
have problems that are pretty unique
right if you're if you're a Hispanic and
lgbtq and you've got a disability
your situation isn't quite like anybody
else's would you agree you you have some
things in common
but your Situation's different
so it makes sense I think everybody
would agree left and right it makes more
sense to get down to some granularity
so suppose we wanted to improve on this
yet again
right so just looking at black and white
it was too big a category you can't do
enough with it go to a little more
granularity well you might be black and
also this
or this and also that that's better
wouldn't you say
more granularity
yeah if you could just fix the problem
you want to understand it as well as you
can understand it and this moves you
closer to understanding
so what would be the the next logical
place that this should go
if we continue to be rational
people
or actually a person
because it's individuals
individuals
now if you understood
discrimination and everything else in
terms of individuals
which is really where this was getting
to it was getting closer to the
individual but if we go all the way now
we can really do something because if
this is the problem
white versus black
what are you going to do about it you
know what's your plan to make that
better well there's some things you can
do you know improving education Etc but
doesn't seem to be working
so them getting to you know more
granular well maybe we can do something
if we understand it at this level but
how about going further how about going
all the way to the individual
because each of these individuals has
unique problems and it's not just their
color and their sexual preference or
anything like that they're just
different people
so how about creating a strategy
that is the right strategy for each
person
which takes into account far more than
you know the Discrimination it takes
into account where they live
how old they are you know what's their
parents situation is there a good school
in your town
um what's your what's your personality
what's your character what things do you
need that you don't have these are all
solvable problems
if you give me an individual they might
not take my advice but I can certainly
tell them what to do
I don't know how to solve these other
things like I don't know what I could do
as an individual but if a person
is in front of me and they're not
they're not succeeding in life and they
want to know how I could totally help
that person
so I would say that the left and the
right were accidentally heading in the
same direction
which is the framing of white versus
black wasn't getting you enough what do
you do about it
the instinct to go to the next level of
detail was the right Instinct it's the
right Instinct it just doesn't go far
enough got to go all the way to what
makes every person unique and then you
can solve their problem
now
here's the persuasion frame on this
do you notice that there's a whole lot
of making you think past the sale in
this
especially the the white black model but
also the intersectionality model they
both have the same characteristic
the characteristic is
they they ask you to accept that this
was the right way to look at it in the
first place
if they're if they're making you talk
about
if they're Mikey you talk about the
difference between black and white
performance or outcomes
then then they've already made you think
past the sale that this was ever the
right question in the first place
you see that
so every time somebody gets you into a
conversation of outcomes or differences
in the average white or average black
they're talking about somebody who
doesn't exist
there's no average white person
there's no average black person
there's no average person
we're we're not just different on race
and we're not just different because we
all have some different
intersectionality thing going on
we are infinitely different
we are infinitely different
so if you accept any of these frames
you're accepting an absurdity
that looking at the average of white
people an average of black people tells
you something you could or should do
something about
do you know what I care about the
average difference between any two
groups
nothing
I don't care I have zero interest in
fixing this average
now that makes me sound like a terrible
person doesn't it but the reason I have
zero interest in this is that it's a
trick and it gives you no solution
it only gives you a victimhood and
transfer of money it doesn't give you a
system to fix it so you have a goal
it's a goal you would like you know
different groups to have similar
outcomes that's a good goal but what's
the system
the the system you don't really have
let's say you go to the next level and
you complicate it or go down to more
granularity
is moving in the right direction I think
but it still doesn't give you a system
what are you going to do about it all
right so you do have a an albonian
disabled bisexual
so
and they have different outcomes than
the uh Asian American
um
I don't know
uh
non-binaries or something
so
what are you gonna do with that
makes sense that isn't discriminary but
let's say you take it to the next level
of individuals
so all right so individuals have
different outcomes
so Scott you know you keep complaining
about systems what's your what's your
system just because you divided it this
way
well my system is sitting behind you
right there
now these are two books that I wrote but
you wouldn't have to buy buy books these
are both teaching you how to develop a
system for your own personal success
so
if you divide it by individuals
you don't just have a goal
but you have a system oh there there are
self
um there are basically skill development
books of all kinds
there are probably 10 books that if you
read all ten
your odds of succeeding are close to 100
percent
right unless you get sick or you have
some terrible bad luck but if you just
did the things that
people who are successful advise you to
do and it might not be my advice
you know I don't call myself advice for
there's a reason for that but you have
so many different sources for how to fix
your individual problem
you also have an infinite number of
mentors
that would be willing to help
what can a mentor do if you're looking
at the world as it's black versus white
what does a mentor do
it's hard to be a mentor in that world
and the same with intersectionality but
the moment you say everybody's
infinitely different and my problem
isn't like your problem just because
we're both albonians I have a different
problem than you do as soon as you go to
that then these systems open up oh
here's here's the system for building
skills here's a system for networking
here's a system for improving your
educational outcomes here's a system for
studying here's a system for your
Fitness so because that helps you in
every way here's the fitness for your
diet right here's a fitness for your
appearance
so until you get to the individual level
there's no system solution and this
cries for a system solution
and that ladies and gentlemen
is my whiteboard
for today
um
and I would further encourage you if you
want if you want this
kind of frame to be the dominant one
that when somebody tries to bait you
into a conversation about the average
difference between black and white
performance
tell them you're not interested
but tell them you are very interested in
the success of any individual
for which you could probably help with
some advice I mean if the only thing you
did is say hey you need help succeeding
yes I do well I'm not much of a mentor
but I could recommend five books that
would really get you going
so every one of you can be a mentor just
because you know of a book to recommend
probably more than one
right so do not buy into the frame of
what the average non-existent imaginary
person is doing compared to the average
non-existent other person is doing
just don't buy it don't let them make
you think past the sale
individuals are the only frame that's
worth talking about everything else is
political manipulation
yeah we'll probably clip this all right
um
and that ladies and gentlemen
is my Blockbuster
live stream for today
yeah let's uh we'll clip that part out
and make that available
uh
Marxist say thinking about the
individual is bad
who cares
and by the way here's a little uh tip on
making people go away uh try to sell you
stuff
if somebody's trying to sell you
something let's say a telemarketer and
you want to tell them to go away but you
want to do it in the best possible the
most effective way
the phrase not interested
is devastating
so if somebody's trying to sell you
something and you go oh I you know I'm
not looking to buy today
they'll still keep at you if you say oh
you know I can't afford it they'll tell
you that you could make payments over
time
so anything you say that's like a
regular objection then a salesperson has
as a counter to it the one thing that
they can't counter is a lack of interest
and they will give up right away
a lack of interest is the end of the
 conversation
and and I sometimes you have to say it
three times
but by the third time you say it it's
over
yeah would you like to yeah I'm not
interested well but did you know yeah
I'm not interested
I'm not interested okay thank you
three times an hour works every time
I've never I've never seen it fail and
it works when somebody is standing in
front of you at your door you ever
accidentally opened the door and it was
a salesperson
and you can't make them go away just
look them right in the eye and go yeah
yeah I'm not interested
it's not impolite you have no obligation
to be interested in what other people
want you to be interested in none you
have no obligation for that just look up
in the eye and say yeah I'm not
interested
it'll go away right away
so when somebody brings you the uh the
the average person in this group uh
didn't do as good as the average person
in this group so we have to just say I'm
not really interested in that
conversation
yeah that's those are people that don't
exist I'm not interested in non-existent
people and solutions that can't work
all right that's all for now YouTube
thanks for joining
I'll see you tomorrow
for more excitement
