good morning everybody
and welcome
to coffee with scott adams and it's
going to be a barn burner today
so
protect your barn
if you don't have a barn you probably
won't even notice the difference
it will be the highlight of civilization
no matter what and would you like to
take it up an even
higher level
yes you would
and don't worry that some of my
sentences leave out key words
when i realize i've left down in a word
in my sentence i just keep going i hope
you don't notice
yes we're going to talk about tucker
carlson but first all we need is a
copper mug or a glass a tender chelsea
steiner canteen joker flask vessel of
any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
it's the dopamine of the day
it's the thing that makes everything
feel better it's called the simultaneous
step go
justin the european parliament backs
listing nuclear energy as green
bouillee well the winning just keeps on
coming
it's one win after another
i feel
like some good stuff's about to happen
i do
and today i'm going to make you feel
good
about the good stuff that's going to
happen
and it all revolves around a little
thing i like to call
the adam's law of slow-moving disasters
because as you know we're in the middle
of a
five
i don't know i'd have to count them up
are we in the middle of five slow-moving
disasters at the same time
where are we
you know the pandemic was a fast
disaster that that really caught us off
guard but the slow ones
right so we got the economy the inflate
you know that maybe recession maybe
inflation
we've got a supply chain problem
is it going to be nuclear war i don't
know
we've got a lot of problems but we'll
get through
all right uh here is the biggest
non-surprise in the world
why is it
that medical
science
always follows the direction of greatest
profitability
for people who work in the medical
sciences community
is that a coincidence
that no matter when they do a study
the result will always be that somebody
gets to make more money if it's true
well
here's one
apparently the more you get covered
the worse your permanent problems are
so the so-called long covent so if you
get this omicron once
some number of people get long-term
long-covet problems but if the same
person gets covered twice
apparently statistically they're more
likely to have long-term problems and if
they get it three times
even more than twice
so since you've got like the two levels
that you can measure
it seems kind of convincing right
that at each at each new infection
your long-term problems increase and
that's what the study says so does that
show you
that the more you get omicron the more
problems you have is that what they
proved
if you hear that that's the result is
that what they proved
well here's the question
why is it
that something like and maybe this
number has changed
15
of spouses gave it to their spouse
like one five now it might be you know
25 percent but it's the same point
how do you not give on the crown to your
spouse
i mean really if if you're most
infectious before you know you have
symptoms
doesn't every spouse get it
i mean
who spends so much time away from their
spouse that they can't give them
uh covet
i mean does anybody
it's hard to imagine i would think that
every household everybody would get it
right but it didn't happen it didn't
even come close to that
so there's some gigantic
variable about the pandemic and about
covent that we still don't understand
right and the one we don't understand is
bigger than all the ones we do
right
the
the things we understand about covet if
you put them all together everything we
understand is still smaller than the
thing we don't understand which is
why doesn't the spouse get it
that's the biggest question we don't
have we don't have a clue
here's my guess so this is my
non-medical
non-scientist
non-reliable guests so i wouldn't put
too much
uh into this it's less than a hypothesis
but it goes like this
and of course it comes it springs from
the worst possible place
my personal anecdotal experience
so so let me make a global
scientific proclamation
that affects all of you all seven
billion if you based on my one
experience it goes like this
uh i got covered
the one time i was completely aware that
my um
my immunity was very low
in other words it was a period where i i
was traveling i went to hawaii and i got
i was really sleepless because the time
changed and stuff
and i was completely aware that out that
my
ability to fight off anything
was real down
now wouldn't that explain everything
wouldn't it
everything that's still a mystery
would be explained by just that one fact
that you can't get it unless your immune
system's been whacked
right because that would explain how one
spouse could get it because they had a
you know bad week lost some sleep
whatever stress
and the other one didn't
now some of you are saying vitamin d and
there's there's definitely a correlation
but not the correlation that you think
there are two correlations
one is that people who are naturally
unhealthy also have low vitamin d
so if you find that only the people with
low vitamin d get it
you might not be finding out something
about vitamin d you have to be careful
about that one you might be finding out
that vitamin d is just a signal for
somebody who in general has a low
immunity
so i feel like
low immunity on any given day is what
gives you covered
i know that's just based on one
anecdotal experience and then
generalizing it to the world
the only reason i would hang anything on
that is that it answers all the
questions
everything that's still a mystery
would be answered by that one thing
if your immunity is good you just don't
get it
that's it
but
um and that may
you know there may be lots of other
reasons for that but just to guess
um i also will
take you back to why is it that every
study is good for somebody's
income but not yours
suppose it's true that every time you
get a omicron infection it makes your
long-term
prognosis worse
who would make money from that huh
could it be whoever is coming up with
the next vaccination for this next
omicron strain
yes
there is an entity that will make
billions of dollars if this is true
because if it's not true people are
going to treat it like the common cold
and they're not going to get vaccinated
but if it's true
that you're going to deal with a lot
more than a few days of isolation and
and some aches and pains
then you'd better get that vaccination
huh
so big coincidence
there was a major study
that somehow was compatible and agreed
with
the entities that would make the most
money if it were true
huh
now it doesn't mean it's not true it
just means you can't trust it whatsoever
it doesn't mean it's not true
it means it's not credible
anytime something coincidentally lines
up with exactly where you would have
guessed before they did the study
huh
i wonder where this will end up this
study
well who would make the most money under
what situation well the most money would
be made by the pharmaceutical companies
if it turns out that the more you get
omicron the worse off you are given that
we know they can come up with some kind
of vaccine for it
so
there you go
you could have predicted the end of that
study without
any scientific background whatsoever
because just follow the money it just
keeps working
i'll i'll challenge you find me a place
that didn't work recently
give me an obvious case something we've
all heard of some headline situation
in which knowing where who made money
didn't work and didn't didn't explain
the situation you can't find it
sometimes it's coincidence maybe but
it's a pretty big one it's a pretty big
one
well there's news that joe rogan uh said
that he doesn't want to interview trump
because he doesn't want to help him get
elected
he says
directly he's not a trump supporter
and don't want to help him by having him
on the show basically
now how important is that how important
is it if joe rogan does not want trump
to run for president
now he did indicate
that if it came down to trump versus
biden that biden is basically brain dead
and then i guess it gets complicated but
i i if i interpret rogan correctly he
doesn't want trump to even be in the
race
but if he were in the race well then the
decision gets complicated right so he
didn't really tell you what he would do
if if he were in the race
how much difference do you think it
makes
that joe rogan
is not supporting trump
in the comments you tell me yeah we've
made a big deal that joe rogan is
sort of a king maker you know he can
make or break stories
a lot of you say none
but some say a little
some say a lot
he supported bernie last time
so actually most people are thinking
none interesting so have we decided that
joe rogan is like the master of
media which he sort of is at this point
but yet he's not a king maker
are you telling me that joe rogan has
all this influence like the biggest
podcast
everybody talks about him and you know
all we care about is what did his guest
or what did he say about a topic
and yet all of that all that attention
we give him and you're telling me it
would make no difference to the election
it's a bold that's sort of a bold
opinion
you might be right by the way i'm not
i'm not going to disagree with you you
might be right
you might be right all right let me let
me throw it a little more
let's say
that mike cervich also is anti-trump now
so far that seems to be his position i
hate to characterize
anybody who's that smart
because you always get it wrong you know
there's always a nuance you might miss
but my understanding is that mike
cernovich would not be supporting trump
now again i don't know what that means
if trump gets the nomination
you know i'm not sure what that what
that does to anybody's opinion
might change it i don't know
but
do you think that cernovich's opinion
would change an election
suppose you added cernovich and
rogan together do you think that the two
of them would be persuasive enough
to keep trump out of the election
almost all say no almost they'll all say
no
all right i'm going to add a third
persuader
do you have a suggestion who would be
the third person to add to this
if those two together don't make a
difference
all right we'll throw me in the mix
it is my opinion that trump should not
run for reelection
that's my opinion have i ever said that
directly
giving you a fact check if i ever said
that directly
that's my opinion
trump should not run okay i guess i have
now my opinion is really based on age
and based on we don't we don't need
a repeat of the trouble that we got last
time and the fact and the fact that
there's a
an alternative
if you couldn't get
if you could not get trump-like
effectiveness
in any other way
then i'd say well
darn it you have to consider it
well you can right the the republicans
now have
formed a
let's say a character if you will
that is so influenced by trump it's sort
of trump's party at this point desantis
would always be looked like looked at as
a
let's say a trump-influenced
person i mean they might say worse than
that but he's at least trump influenced
you know he learned
what works and what doesn't from
watching trump and and he did it well
so i would say the age alone
um i'm going to be consistent i said
that
the the last election i said neither of
them should be running
does anybody remember me saying that
because of age
it has nothing to do with policies or or
even competency has nothing to do with
the competency when they're running the
problem is what happens they get an
office and things go
go downhill quickly that's your risk
so i never support a president that age
period so i'm going to be consistent
i'm never going to support
a candidate that age
but if that's all you have i like
everybody else i'm going to have to pick
the lesser evil so i might be in that
situation too so in my opinion trump
would be uh
has this gigantic gigantic market
opportunity
to become the king of political
commentary
i mean he could just walk right into it
and he would be the biggest in the
business on day one i think because he
would be the best honestly it's not just
because he's trump
he could do it
better than anybody can do it right so
that has to be that's to be considered
because i think he would be attracted to
things
that would be high attention high
profitability
you know could could uh you know maybe
rehabilitate some of his brand for his
business etc it's the biggest
opportunity i've ever seen anybody ever
have really it'd be hard to think of
anybody
in the world who has a bigger chance
for something that's just perfectly in
their strike zone
and all they have to do is say yes
basically
so
i think he could have even more power as
a
political opinion maker than he even
would as president because as president
all day long all he has to do is fight
off attacks and fake news but if he's
the one making the news
he gets to be king
so i would if if i were trump i would
take the promotion but
he hates to lose so maybe maybe just
winning again is all that matters
could be
you know it's it's the
be careful what you wish for a situation
with trump
when you say to yourself i want somebody
who's a fighter and never gives up
and then you got one
well what are you going to do about it
you got what you asked for
if you get somebody who's a fighter and
never gives up and you're still bitching
because he's complaining about the 2020
election
what the hell did you think you were
electing
who did you think you were voting for
did you think you were voting for the
give up guy
he doesn't give up
that's like the most important thing you
have to know
if you don't understand that one thing
he's not going to stop
he's not going to stop then you don't
know who you voted for
all right want some good news
cnn had a long story about how close we
are to recession et cetera but toward
the end
uh in a very helpful way they compiled a
number of things that are trending right
now i'm not sure if you knew this
because you know good news doesn't break
through
but i'm going to give you some economic
good news
that falls perfectly within the category
of the adam's law of slow-moving
disasters
and and the the rule is that if a
disaster is obvious and everybody sees
it coming it's like oh my god everybody
can see this coming like a recession
that humans are really really good at
adjusting
but they just need time
so time is the only variable it doesn't
matter how big the problem is
if you give us enough time we adjust
that's who we are
right so my prediction is every time you
see one of these
all you have to do is look at the time
and say okay
we have a year yeah we can do a lot of
stuff in a year
pandemic we didn't have a year just bam
it was there and what the hell are you
going to do all right so that's the bad
one the good ones everybody sees coming
like the year 2000 bug
and we saw it coming for a few years it
looked dangerous and we took care of it
that's that's the way it goes with
humans
all right so here's more of that
so this is just a bunch of things that
are working going in the right direction
the inflation rate implied by
tips it's a type of treasury security
thing
basically an investment vehicle uh
issued by the us government over the
next five years uh has fallen from 3.1
percent to 2.6 percent in last month
down from a peak of 3.7 now that's
that's an implied inflation rate so in
other words investors are buying this
type of security the type of investment
but in order for them to be
smartly buying it in other words the
the professionals who know the most
about this sort of thing
we'll tell you that if they're buying
this investment at this rate
it means that
there's an implied decrease in inflation
coming
that's big
that's a pretty big change because look
at this
went from 3.1 to 2.6
now remember you should look at the
percentage change of 3
3.1 to 2.6 which is pretty big
percentage you know it's tiny if in the
absolute but only percentage matters for
this conversation right so that's a big
that's a big drop in implied
implied inflation
so this is indicating that inflation may
have peaked
what what would be the biggest problem
with inflation what would be the story
that would say oh we're dead
versus the story that says oh it looks
like we're okay
all that matters is it peaks that's it
there's one thing you need to know
did we reach the top
or is it still going up
if it's still going up
you might be
if it peaked and this this is a pretty
strong indicator it's not it's not
confirming
but it's a strong indicator it peaked
we may have actually gotten top of it
now it still takes a lot of work to you
know ride ride that inflation wave until
you you know you get it down to the the
beach level
uh but we'll talk about the other stuff
okay
there's new supply chain data from the
new york fed
indicates that
supply bottlenecks are easing
supply bottlenecks according to one
important indicator again it's just one
indicator
the supply chain problems are easing now
this is exactly what the atoms love
slow-moving disasters would predict
it would predict that there would be a
lot of adjusting
and that that adjusting would cause
short-term inflation
here's what i mean
i'd like to buy some stuff to to build
something so i want some raw materials
but the raw materials i can't get
because there's a supply chain problem
so what's the first thing i do
the first thing i do is i look for more
expensive alternatives because it's my
only choice
so inflation goes up because my demand
for those alternatives drives you know
other people are looking for the same
alternatives so the price of the
alternatives goes up in the short run
because it's your only choice
and then the quality of the product
might go down a little because you don't
like that substitute
but in the long run
you didn't run out of stuff because you
adjusted to other materials your price
went up but only in the short run
because in the long run other producers
will say wow
look at how much they're selling that
stuff for so we will make some too
so the the free market
if you see that inflation has peaked
it should be about the same time
that your supply chain problems are
easing you get that they're related
right the supply chain is causing prices
to go up because people are all
searching for the same alternatives
but if you've seen that inflation has
already peaked it might be telling you
and this is compatible that the supply
chain problem may have peaked
those two things you would expect to
peak around the same time like within
the same year or so right
now somebody says supply is also reduced
so far that hasn't really happened
that's been the surprise
the consumer has been strong all the way
through and is expected to stay strong
which is
sort of unusual
you know normally you expect the problem
is there's not enough demand but
apparently there's plenty of demand
which is weird
so there's plenty of demand
and as long as soon as the supply can
can fit it then the prices should start
going down
all right
here's some more good news
in
oh u.s inflation expectations as per the
st louis federal reserve
have dropped to their lowest levels in
the early year right so this is
expectations so
expectations do drive the reality right
because people will raise their own
prices
if they think well this is just the way
it's going to be i guess i got to do
what everybody else is doing but they
won't necessarily raise their prices if
they think that in a few months
everything's going to come back down to
where it was
because then they don't want to have to
go through the raise the price lower the
price sort of thing
so what people expect about inflation
probably does matter and that's looking
good
all right here's another one in june the
university of michigan survey of
consumer long-term inflation
expectations fell from 3.3 to 3.1
not a big percentage or or absolute
number but it could indicate indicated
peaked
the thing you care about it's not going
up
listening to scott talk about economics
is painful
that's how economics is
is there a fun way to talk about it
and oil prices are down you know since
june 8th 10
but again that's not a big drop
but it might be a peak
so some of our most important indicators
about about supply and about inflation
look like
the miracle of the free markets have
done exactly what they were supposed to
do in fact that inflation should be
signaling to you that people are
adjusting
the supply chain
it's not the only thing in the inflation
number of course
but
but you're actually seeing good news
being sold as bad news
right
if you if people can charge more and
give you an alternative then you're not
in that much trouble but if you couldn't
get an alternative at any price you're
in a lot of trouble
right so apparently we were in less
trouble than we thought because people
were more clever about alternatives
well tucker carlson's making news
talking about that weirdo shooter guy
i think i'll just call him the weirdo
shooter guy
i don't want to use his name
uh in highlands don't want to give him
too much attention all right
but tucker's take on this is
uh um that they're angry that there are
young men who are angry and this is
tucker's take all right so i'm not i'm
not giving you my opinion
it's just notable because tucker is
saying it
and when you get to when i get to the
end of what tucker is saying here
you might stand up and applaud tucker
carlson even if you hate him
that's a strong claim
i would say even if you're a democrat
when i tell you what tucker carlson said
last night
you might
stand up from your actual chair and
applaud him for being a patriot
right
big claim because people don't like
tucker if they're on the right
that's my claim that even the democrat
will stand up and applaud him when i
tell you what he said
all right so he starts out with some
stuff that you maybe you wouldn't agree
with all right we're going to build into
the part you do agree with and he says
talk about the young man he says and of
course they're angry they know that
their lives will not be better than
their parents they'll be worse
that's all but guaranteed they know that
they're not that stupid and yet the
authorities in their lives mostly women
here's where otaku gets provocative he
says and yet the authorities in their
lives mostly women
never stop lecturing them about their
so-called privilege
you're male you're privileged
he says imagine that try to imagine an
unhealthier unhappier life than that
so a lot of young men in america are
going nuts are you surprised
and then he went out to list several
mass shooters who had been prescribed
antidepressants
all right so his first point
is that there's something about the
let's say female control of society this
would be his take not mine
something about the female control of
society which is telling this young men
that not only are their lives absolutely
but they should have some of that
removed
[Laughter]
whatever's left should be removed
because they're privileged
yeah your life is absolutely garbage but
it's still a little too good you're a
little too privileged
imagine what that does to your brain
this is a good point
i don't know that that has anything to
do with the shooting do you
so i think connecting
connecting his observation that you know
women are having you know extra control
in society lately
and that men are feeling a certain way
that's probably true ish
for some number of people
but i don't know that it really explains
why they become shooters
but let me extend that thought a little
bit with my own thought
is it part of the general degrading of
the value of men
is it part of the general degrading of
the value of men
and are we just seeing a natural outcome
of men being called worthless
yeah
do you know one reason that men are
worth less in 2022 than maybe in prior
times
give me a reason that men
young men in particular do have less
value than any time in
human civilization
any time in human civilization not
because of low t
not because of sex not because of
vibrators good guess though
yeah somebody got it right there's no
wars
we're not sending young men to die
unfortunately war siphons off
our most dangerous people into a
different activity and we don't notice
it
i wonder how much of that is going on
if you were somebody who thought to
yourself you know
i actually don't mind shooting people
and even if i got shot
i really wouldn't mind that
much what what do you do in a normal
time wouldn't you join the military or
maybe you'd get drafted and you'd be in
the military but i feel like the most
violent
thinking young men
would have joined the military in in a
prior time
and you wouldn't notice that they were
violent
because that's their job
and if they got killed
you'd just be a statistic
but if you take the you know if you take
a world where nothing can be siphoned
off none of that energy could be
siphoned off
um
i've got a i've got a feeling that
you're you're asking for it
now what happens when
the quality of women
goes way down
so you're a man and you basically live
to you know mate because you're designed
that way even if you're not thinking
that way
you're you're designed to look for a
mate and you know it's just your
evolutionary drive but what if the
quality or the availability of women
where you live
goes to the point where you don't even
want them
and they definitely don't want you
now when i say the quality of women went
down
i'm not going to direct that just to
women i think the quality of people in
america went way down
and there is a growing feeling
that people who are not born in this
country
but came here you know after they've
been raised a little bit in some other
country are just better people
if anybody had that conversation
have you ever sat around and said you
know
what i think about the people who suck
versus the people who are kind of
awesome in my life
it's hard for me to know not notice that
there's a correlation
where i live there are just tons of
people were born in another country and
grew and then you know their adulthood
is here
and those people tend to be
universally kind of awesome
people born in other countries and
there's something about the warmth
that i don't know what it is
something about the warmth or the way
they deal with people especially the way
they deal with male female situations it
does seem different
and i and i've heard lots of people
lately
stating an absolute preference for
people who were not raised in american
culture
has anybody else heard that
yeah
it is something that's being talked
about now that american culture is
ruining not just women absolutely not
just women it's ruining everybody
so
so tucker said that
but that's not the part you're going to
applaud him for
in fact you might not even like that
the part you're going to applaud him for
is that he went after
the news business being supported by
pharmaceutical companies
now he alleges that we should be worried
no he doesn't the legend tells us
directly that we should be concerned
about the the number of uh
is it s
ri no ssris
what is it the
antidepressants so apparently the
antidepressant s ssris the
antidepressant prescriptions are you
know up three thousand percent
at the same time that these this
violence is up
so do you think it's a coincidence
that drug prescriptions and violence are
both going up now the suggestion would
be
that maybe the drug drug companies might
have something to do with
the increase in violence
i would argue that that is not clear
from the data rather there are two
possibilities that the data suggests
one is that people are being driven
crazy by something else
and so more of them need drugs but it's
not the drugs that are making them crazy
or violent it's just there's more
craziness and this is really all we have
to do to deal with it is drugs
so
i'm not sure i buy
the
i don't buy the correlation as being
causation
but it could be
it could be now here's the part where
you need to
stand up and applaud tucker carlson
he went directly at the networks for
using pharmaceutical companies as their
main
backers for commercials
now
am i wrong that fox news also has lots
of pharmaceutical advertisements
am i imagining that
now i don't think that tucker carlson's
show necessarily does
because i feel like i always see you
know my pillow and patriot this and
you see all the weird commercials that
don't run anywhere else on fox news
but i believe that all the networks are
running pharmaceutical commercials
did the biggest name in
news
opinion
just go on the news and tell you that
the whole system is broken because his
own business is funded by the
pharmaceutical industries
he just did that tucker carlson
just went on the air and said his own
industry is completely
uh non-credible and the most important
problems his own industry
and really he didn't name fox news but
did he need to
because the the indication is that if
you take advertisements from
pharmaceutical companies you're not
reporting the truth
that's that was in that was the
implication
that if you take money from that source
you literally are going to lie about the
news
and and somebody who knows way more
about the news than you do
who knows more about how news works
tucker carlson or you
tucker carlson knows more about that
say what you will about him he's an
expert on the news business right
you're not
you know i'm i'm close i mean i know
more than most of you about the news
business but i don't know what he knows
like whatever the hell tucker carlson
knows is a lot more than you know and if
he's sounding the alarm
and he's basically telling you the news
is fake
because it's it's
it's altered by the advertising
uh
i think you've got to stand up and give
that a hand
no matter what you think of tucker
carlson's other opinions and by the way
i don't agree with his other opinions in
a number of places
so i'm not going to tell you i'm going
to agree with this we're giving a
standing ovation because tucker is
he is probably the most gifted person
doing his job
at the moment i don't think anybody's
doing what he does better than he does
it
but
this
is
a service to the country
let me ask you this
follow the money
tucker carlson just spoke out against
pharmaceutical companies that fund his
industry
was he following the money
do you think that was a clever play
to somehow make more money because it
will become more popular because he said
something you like
i don't think this is good for him
i do not believe that there's any way
tucker carlson could be anything but
hurt
by talking out against advertisements
from pharmaceutical companies
it seems to me
that you just watched a rare example of
somebody who didn't follow the money
and i'm trying to think of a second
reason that he would do that
besides he actually wanted to make
something better
can you
give give me a second hypothesis for why
he did that
credibility
somebody says
credibility that's what that's always an
important variable i'll give you that
one
job property of cnn altruism
kill the competition no because fox news
i'm pretty sure it takes pharmaceutical
advertisements
plans to run for president no i don't
see any indication of that
here's my hypothesis
we're not mind readers right we're not
mind readers but when you see somebody
conspicuously ignore following the money
he's actually running away from the
money
now he can afford it we assume like he's
not going to be poor
but people don't do that no matter how
much money they have they don't run away
from money
and he just i think he's just he's doing
it
jumping off a sinking ship no fox's fox
is killing it fox is doing great
um
scott is talking like a canadian
so i'm going to give tucker a standing
ovation
because for this one thing
just calling out the the
corrupt situation there all right
standing ovation talking carlson for
calling out
the pharmaceutical companies
thank you
and by the way
this is actually standing out of respect
right
that's not that's not even just
showboating
that's actual respect
because if other people in this country
could you know have the balls to do what
he just did
well maybe we'd be in better shape right
would you love to see somebody on cnn
just say you know
like we've been saying x and y but i
just got to tell you it's i gotta tell
you the truth and just like come out
with the truth
like this
world would be a better place
all right
i'm going to take a uh radical turn i
think i've made you all feel positive
now
don't y'all feel positive
all right i'm going to tell you the
biggest problem uh one of the biggest
problems that we have
for young people in america social
problems
and the shooting is a perfect example
of the dangerous young men now they're
also dangerous young women but we're
going to concentrate on men just for
statistical reasons
um
there's there are two problems that are
kind of conflated one is
the the fentanyl you know drug addiction
problem
and the other is the school shootings
here's what they have in common
they're both cases where you can know
there's trouble in advance and there's
nothing you can do about it
so you can find that this
let's say a teen is saying that they're
going to do something dangerous you send
the police they take away the guns he
gets the new ones there's nothing you
can do about it
this the highland situation is really
really good evidence
that we don't have any systems in place
that can deal with that specific kind of
situation a dangerous young male
who hasn't yet broken a law that's the
important part a dangerous young male
who's clearly dangerous
but has not yet broken a law there's
nothing you can do
now here's another one
suppose you're teen and i'm going to say
male between 14 and 19 just so you can
have a visual of this
male between 14 and 19 and they get on
drugs what do you do
what do you do you got a teenager on
drugs what do you do
which uh which program do you access
which government program somebody says
rehab
um
so so you've got your rehabs right
does rehab work
sometimes
hardly ever hardly ever does it work for
a teenager
let me let me give you uh my impression
of my conversation with my stepson
before he went into rehab several times
so we tried rehab several times here's
how the conversation would go
all right you know
that you can never do another drug of
any kind again right because you were
literally an addict
and you know
rule number one there's no such thing as
a little bit of
drugs for an addict you know
you know you have to be completely clean
of all drugs i'd say to him and he'd say
yes i do know that i completely
understand that and that's why when i'm
out of rehab
all i'm going to do is maybe a few beers
a little bit of pot that's all i'm going
to do i'd say i feel like you didn't
hear a word i just said
really really zero is the only thing
that works
one percent is a complete failure your
life is over you're dead
have one beer you're probably
dead you get that right and you say i
totally get that i totally get it i'm an
addict i can't stay away from drugs so
um i'm just gonna have a beer or two
with with my friends and i'd be like i
don't know what's happening i don't even
understand what's happening here
and he would look at me and just say no
there is no way in the world after rehab
i will not do more drugs than alcohol
and i would say
why why am i spending money on this
and he would say i can't imagine a life
where i could enjoy my social life
without drugs and alcohol i don't have
any way to even imagine it
and he said there isn't any way i'm even
going to try it
couldn't possibly work
and so sure enough he got out of rehab
went immediately back to use him
and now he's dead
and
so
i get a lot of helpful advice
from other adults
and the helpful advice i'll get is all
the things i could have done differently
but let me tell you there's nothing you
can do
there's nothing you can do
somebody says apply that to yourself
scott no i'm not an addict
so you can't make a comparison between
somebody who doesn't have an addictive
personality
and someone who does
right
so i tend to be addicted to you know
doing live streams and exercises and
stuff like that
so
um
i just did a long twi twitter thread in
which i tried to give people some tough
reality
which is that these
these people cannot be addressed with
any program
or any technique
there's no tough love
there's no rehab there's no program
there's no therapist
there's no law there's no there's no
court system
a lot of people will tell me scott why
don't you just have
the people who come in they'll kidnap
your team
at night you know with your permission
they'll take them to their secret
facility and make them ride horses and
act like cowboys for a year and then
when they come back they'll be all fixed
have you all heard about that
where that program where you know you
hire somebody to come in basically
kidnap your kid
take them sometimes to another state
like to some rural place and they'll
they'll make them do you know outdoorsy
things until they're right
all right let me tell you what you need
to know about that program
here's the most important thing you need
to know about that program and by the
way i'm going to swear so there's some
cursing coming
because it's the only way i can answer
this question
so that that that program where they
capture your teen and take them to some
place where they can fix them for their
drug problems
it doesn't exist
it doesn't exist it isn't i
don't know if it's ever existed but in
california there is no such thing as
completely illegal if it existed it
would have to be shut down tomorrow all
of your helpful suggestions
about scott why don't you just give him
a little tough love have him taken to
that you know special place that's like
when your dog dies and you say
he went to the farm right it doesn't
exist
there's no farm where your old dog goes
to live forever your dog is dead
and there's nothing you can do
when your kid is on drugs
there's no program there's no therapist
there's no rehab there's no government
program there's nothing to protect you
in your own home
that kid is a danger to the parents
like a real danger they can't do
anything they can't even kick the kid
out of the house
do you know why
it's illegal
it's a minor
you can't even kick your own kid out of
the house
there's nothing you can do it's like
somebody saying well here's this
murderous uh
rapist and the law says they have to
live in your house
what
yeah yeah it's just the law
the law says so the law says you have to
live with a murderous rapist so no
so deal with it no if your kid they're
not murderous rapists they might be
murderous but if you put a 14 year old
male addict in your household it's
ripping the house apart guaranteed
your family is ripped apart and there
isn't a thing you can do about
it
i've looked everywhere
right i have resources
i'm smart
my ex was very smart very capable very
capable looked everywhere did everything
tried everything there's nothing to help
and you're gonna say well maybe that's
about your son or your stepson
no
no
it's everybody in this situation has the
same conversation all the parents who
are having this are having the same
conversation there's no help
none
nothing
nothing you could do
and if you don't get that
you don't understand anything about the
situation there is nothing
nothing there's nothing that might help
nothing that could help there's nothing
to even try
there's nothing to even
try
yeah this isn't the feel-good part
i'll tell you what i would do
and this is kind of tough
i think the people who can't be fixed
have to be separated from society
but not in jail necessarily
because they haven't necessarily done a
crime yet well one that they've been
called for
so i think that we need to
find some camping ground somewhere and
just say look you don't have to get off
drugs
but you can't live with other
people you don't have to get off drugs
but you can't be around other people
except other people like you
so we're going to put you in this place
where
we can make sure no drugs get in
but it's not jail
all right you're there's some kind of a
life you might be living in a tent but a
nice one you know you're not suffering
and
and just make them live in the forest
with other people who can't live in
society they have to be separated from
the rest of us
they have to be separated physically
from the rest of us
and there i don't think there's another
way to go
if you do
i'd sure like to hear it
but i think they have to be separated
and if the as soon as you saw this kid
doing this violent stuff
i i think you just got to put him with
the
the other people and say all right
this is your new life
um unfortunately
there should be some way to like recover
and get out of there but all right
here's my tip for the day that will save
some lives
i like doing this if you have enough
viewers
if you have enough viewers these little
tips
will be meaningless to most of you
but i could actually probably save a
life right now so i'm going to do it so
i'm going to give you a tip that might
save a life here comes
did you know
you probably knew that fentanyl is the
the most dangerous of the drugs but did
you know uh that it could be in
the fentanyl could be inside heroin
uh cocaine molly meth
and counterfeit pills like oxycontin
adderall and xanax
basically if it's a powder or a pill
and it's 20 22
probably has fentanyl in it and you
don't know how much
now
that knowledge
might keep
one of you alive
because one of you probably has somebody
in your life who's taken some pills
and doesn't know
that it's just
it's russian roulette you don't know
which one has fentanyl in it or too much
in it right
so
just knowing that it's in all the drugs
if it's a powder or a pill it's probably
fentanyl
probably fentanyl just know that that
simple knowledge might help somebody
stay alive
that is my
positive upbeat
thought and i'll give you one other
thought that's upbeat on the economy
uh what is warren buffett's primary
investment advice
warren buffett has lots of advice
but there's one piece of investment
advice that sits above everything else
no it's not hold it's not buy and hold
you'd think so but it's not buy and hold
he does talk about diversification yes
but there's one there's one thing he
said by railroads that's funny
because it's true natural monopoly is
okay so he has lots of investment rules
but there's one that sits above all of
them
it goes like this
don't bet against the american economy
that's the number one rule
he hasn't been wrong yet
from the time that warren buffett was
born
to today
his his advice never been against the
american economy
if you had simply done that
and nothing else you would have been
rich too
it's the best advice anybody ever gave
and the reason that you don't bet
against the american economy is because
we have a degree of freedom and
flexibility
that just apparently doesn't exist
anywhere else now we do have our own
problems we're getting a little ossified
and
too many rules and regulations and you
know we're
we're
so inside each other's pants that we
can't get anything done lately
but we're still america
we're still america
you can throw a lot of problems on top
of us and i'm sorry if you know people
from other countries are watching this
of course so it sounds a little
a little too uh
jinguistic or whatever word you want to
put on it
but batting against america has just
been a losing proposition forever and i
also think that it will be a losing
proposition for a long time it's not
because of our system
it's because there's something about
americans
and it's also something about the the
immigrant community who's
who comes here
is that they're risk takers
and they're problem solvers
am i right
we have the biggest collection i would
say the best the best collection
of problem solvers
because there's there's a
there's an entry test to get into the
united states
did you know there's an entry exam
everybody who gets to the united states
almost almost everybody who gets here
from another country they had to pass a
test
the test was
can you go into a situation where you
don't know what it looks like
and make it work
can you leave your bad situation take a
huge risk to come to another country
maybe not even knowing the language
can you come to this country not knowing
the language having nothing except the
you know the address of a relative you
can stay with for a while that's all you
have
you'll you'll trade everything for that
we have a country
built by those people
right
and and we keep renewing it with more of
those people and we keep looking at the
wrong variable
the variable we you know because we're
all trained to look at race
so you got all the uh you know the the
racists who are looking at immigration
and saying wait
you know white people built all this
cool stuff
but then you're letting all these brown
people in the country to replace us say
the
right-wing racist types and that's going
to go bad
but here's here's the counter to that
what do all of the immigrants have in
common all the way back to the colonies
they were all the risk takers
they were all the ones who were
confident enough in their own abilities
that they could jump into
a really
murky situation and they thought they
could make it work
and then they did
we have
we we have accidentally
attracted all the people who can pass
that test
and we've left behind all the people who
couldn't pass that test
the people who said well
maybe i'll just do tomorrow what i did
today
right
the people who stayed
that's who is running those other
countries
the people the people who had all of the
qualities it takes to pack up your
and move to the other side of the
country when you know the other side of
the world when you don't even know the
language and you've got like two cents
in your pocket
do you want to get in a war
with people who are comprised of those
people
good luck
if you're going to get in any kind of a
competition
and the only thing you know
is that there's one country where they
all passed that same test they had to do
something super ballsy that was hard and
they all got they all made it work
and you're gonna you're gonna fight
against a country that's the people who
were left behind who didn't have that
quality
who's gonna win
the colonists right because because
they've got balls
men and women will make this non-sexual
they got balls that are bigger than the
other countries
just by luck because our system you know
sort of accidentally created this test
all right so that's the the good news
there is something special about the
american cult
character and we always overlook it
because we're all we're all hung up on
rays and we're hung up on economics and
you know we're looking at crime those
are all important
you know they're all variables right
it's all in the mix
but the one thing we ignore is the
important part
there's something special
about somebody who would take on that
kind of risk and then make it work
right that is special and that is what
makes up the american dna
is people who will do what tucker
carlson just did
right tucker carlson is descended
from people who had this characteristic
you just watched him
piss in the face
of his employer and the entire system
right
now i i also have an impulse toward
trouble and risk-taking
that i i deal with all the time because
i just like to get in trouble i like to
take risks you know not physical risk
i'm not so much about you know extreme
sports that doesn't make sense to me
but i do think that
taking a risk to get something done
i can't stop doing it
so if i could take a risk
that would maybe be bad for me but
somehow it would work out for you you
the the public i'm at that point in my
life where i think i'd do it
and that would seem like a reasonable
trade-off for me
and we've got a country like that
we gotta we got a country that has that
in their dna all the other stuff not so
important
not so important
all the other stuff you could add it all
together and it would be smaller than
the fact that we attract a certain kind
of person
from every country every culture
every every gender that you like we we
attract the best ones
let me give you another example
well can i do this one
um
yeah all right i i haven't thought about
this but i'm gonna just throw it out
there
so in the united states we probably have
one of the most progressive used or the
lgbtq community is that fair to say
would be among the top countries in
terms of acceptance at this point
would that be fair
now think about how much talent that
unlocks
think about it
that the lgbt community in the united
states can just go do whatever
whatever is you know their calling is
they can be at the top of tech they can
be at the top of government at this
point
and
how much talent did that unlock
right that's the american thing that's
that's the thing we do we we find this
talent and we go you know why we unlock
this boom there it is
so
i think we're really good at unlocking
talent and and attracting it so that's
our lasting advantage and it's why the
adam's law of slow-moving disasters
continues to prove out
we're really good at solving problems
and it's not an accident
we collected the people who are good at
solving problems in one place and said
we're going to give you freedom now
how does that not work
put all the people who are good at
solving problems in one place
and say you have your freedom now
that works
pretty much every time
all right
um
am i talking you into the golden age
yes i am
do you know how the golden age happens
you first imagine it
here's here's a little uh tip for you i
guess it's a persuasion tip but it's
also like a super important life tip
it sounds really simple but when you
when you see how
how it affects everything
here's the tip
people only do what they can imagine
that's it now that doesn't seem like
much does it but if you unpack that i
know people hate that term it's like a
corporate buzzword let's unpack that but
it works in this case
unpack it works when there's like a
small thought but really if you start
looking at it it really affects
everything so that's what i'm talking
about
you won't do well you can't imagine do
you know how that's important
okay right now i have a number of
as always i have choices in my life
right we all do at any point when i
imagine the choices
i imagine the outcomes
i have some choices that i can imagine
the outcome with such specificity it's
almost like it's a movie or a picture i
could just look at
there are other outcomes that seem more
conceptual
like i can't picture them
for whatever reason the ones i can't
picture
they're definitely not going to happen
now that's based on a lifetime of
experience the stuff i can imagine the
clearest
seems to happen
so the first thing is it's a way to
predict what you're going to do
sometimes you say to yourself i don't
know what i'm going to choose
yes you do
you do know which one you're going to
choose you just haven't admitted it yet
here's how you know it's the one you can
imagine
the one you can imagine most clearly is
the one you're going to pick so when you
say to yourself i haven't decided yet
that's not true
you almost always have decided and the
way you know how you've already decided
is this one you can imagine the most
clearly
now you might want to overrule that like
once you know that that's the rule you
might say oh that has some downsides so
we don't want to do that maybe but just
be aware of it that the thing you can
imagine is what happens now
in the in the terms of influence if you
want to persuade somebody
you must first get them to imagine it
you want them to visualize it see the
characters have names and dates involved
you know really really imagine the
details and if you do that then people
can move in that direction
but people will not move in the
direction of things they can't imagine
i see what you're saying but it's just
sort of a concept i don't i don't even
know what to do about that it's just the
concept
so
the the indication before it was that
somebody asked me am i trying to create
a golden age
by persuasion and the answer is yes
yes and the way i'm doing that is by
describing what it would look like
so the more the more detail i put on it
the more detail will be in your mind if
you're listening and you and as it
starts to come together you know the
first time you heard it it's a concept
the golden age okay
this is
sounds good but what's that mean and
then i start putting some meat on it
and then you start imagining it
you start imagining you know the let's
say a place that people who have
addiction go
or you imagine a
time when we're all 3d printing and we
don't need manufacturing from china you
can actually visually imagine 3d
printers
making stuff on demand
and you can imagine ships coming from
china and not coming anymore
like it's physical so whenever you can
make somebody imagine something specific
the odds of them moving toward it are
much greater
so i
and it's so it's so obvious that this
connection exists between imagination
and then actual future actions
that it makes me wonder if it's the user
interface for the simulation
in other words maybe
you were literally unable to imagine
things that are not going to happen
you can't imagine things that are not
going to happen
maybe
while bill says is this guy on drugs
no you should see me on drugs
if you really want some fun
you should see me when i have my drugs
this is without drugs imagine that
all right well never bet against the
american economy that's my
final happy thought for you
and
successfully persuaded him to imagine
going to high school
your son isn't going to high school
that's interesting
a micro lesson on betting
yeah don't do it
um you're better when not on drugs
so somebody said that i'm i'm better on
my live stream when i'm not on drugs how
many of you would agree with that
marijuana is the only drug that i would
do
there's a little disagreement there all
right so here's the question how would
you know
how would you know if i were on drugs or
not
because there was one time i told you
but i'd also taken the wrong drug so i'd
accidentally
take an indica
had i not taken accidentally the wrong
drug
do you think you could tell
slurred speech yeah on the wrong drug
you speak faster when not on drugs
depends on the drug
yeah i don't think you would know if it
was sativa
well let me ask you this what percentage
all right i'll ask the youtube people
because i think the locals people know
the answer to this what percentage of
all my live streams this is a question
for the youtube viewers what percentage
of all my live streams do you think i
did while under the influence of sativa
marijuana
what percentage do you think in say the
last three months
i'm not going to read the percentages
over on locals
because you know too much
all right so on youtube i'm seeing 75 25
10
26 so you see how your numbers are all
over the place
the fact that your numbers are all over
the place
somewhat suggests that you can't tell
the difference
now it could be that some of you can
but i wouldn't know which ones are
actually right and which ones are lucky
you imagine that uncle scott cares about
well i do
i do
that is literally true i do care about
you
um
one million percent that is the correct
answer
yeah i'm a slow speaker generally
that's why you should always listen to
this at 1.75 speed
all right well i don't know what the the
real answer is myself
probably 50
i think the real answer is probably half
something like that last three months
but um i guarantee that the days that
people said
wow that show was good so i get feedback
after the show typically and people
either contact me and say oh that was
really good or not
and there's no difference
in the feedback no matter you know what
situation i'm in no difference
the first time i learned that was when i
was trying to decide
what comics to submit to become a
cartoonist
and so this was 1988. i put together 50
sample what became the dilbert comic and
i was going to send them off to the
cartoon syndicates to see if they would
you know give me a contract to be a
cartoonist
and i would have my friends over and i'd
take these 50 comics i'd made and i say
can you help me weed out the good ones
from the bad ones and
then i'll just send in the good ones
so i had all my friends come in
individually so they couldn't be
influenced by each other and they would
sort them into the good or the bad pile
and what i noticed was there was no
correlation no correlation at all not
even a little bit there was nobody who
thought my best con there was no comic
that everybody thought was a good one
some people loved this one some people
loved that one it was completely random
no correlation whatsoever so you know
what i did
i sent all 50
because i didn't know
which side the editor would be on would
the editor be on you know one of the
ones who said they love these or hate
them
so i just sent all 50 and got a contract
to become a syndicated cartoonist
so
you should be aware that people are
really really really bad at
you know perception
the editor was impressed by productivity
i think so i think so yeah that was my
instinct my instinct was that
proving you could do a lot of it would
be as important as proving you could do
you know some good work
because there are cartoonists i'm not
going to name names
but within the cartooning industry
all the cartoonists know know who i'm
talking about
there's a specific cartoonist probably
one of the one of the best you've ever
seen right i'm not going to be specific
but let's say one of the definitely one
of the
top 10 or 15 of all time
and
that cartoonist is really good
but really has trouble meeting deadlines
and it's just a constant like struggle
for the the publishers and the you know
that and the syndicate
so yeah it does matter it really does
matter so quality is great but you got
to be able to produce quantity as well
don't
now
i'm only going to tell you what name it
isn't
because i don't want you to have that
impression stefan postus is the most
productive cartoonist
since me
[Laughter]
you know he does more side jobs he's got
he's got an entire he's got an entire
line of children's books that's a huge
success on top of a comic strip that's a
huge success he's working on a movie
he does speaking gigs i mean he's got
all kinds of stuff going on
all right no more guessing
and that ladies and gentlemen is the
conclusion of the best thing that's ever
happened in the history of civilization
and i'll talk to you tomorrow youtube
