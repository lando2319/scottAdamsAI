good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams there's
never been a finer thing
till tomorrow
and
how many of you would like to see if you
could boost not only your attitude
but everything that's good
yeah you would and all you need for that
is a copper mug or a glass of tanker
chalices dye in the canteen jug or flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine here
the day the thing that makes everything
better is called the simultaneous sip
and it happens now go
ah I'm working on my uh Joe Biden
whisper whisper talk we go real high and
get real angry
and then you whisper because people
really pay attention when you do that
foreign
well
you know sometimes
uh do you do you like it when you see
behind the scenes of how things are done
on locals don't tell them don't tell
YouTube
that I'm setting them up for a joke they
don't know what's coming just be cool
don't say anything do you like it when
you look behind the scenes
you can see how things are done behind
the scenes
yeah
it's called Uh
watching how they make the sausage
and it's a good idea unless it's Jeffrey
tuben
because you don't want to see how he
makes a sausage
am I right am I right
okay I just wanted to start with that
um I saw a tweet from uh internet
sensation and Musical
phenomenon
I don't know what they call them zubi
what do you call zubi
the zooby's another one of those talents
that guys
where
where he's good at so many things from
Fitness to social media to his main
other is his main job singing I guess he
does so many things well it's hard to
tell him what he does
but Zoom between it today I think it's
weird that people think it's weird that
I don't drink alcohol
and then he says poisoning yourself
intentionally is a weird Flex in my
humble opinion but I support your right
to do so
remember I asked yesterday well you
didn't see it the YouTubers didn't see
it
but I asked the locals people who
subscribe and have followed me for a
longer time
I I asked them how many had quit
drinking alcohol
because of a reframe that I talk about
all the time which is alcohol is poison
just in a sentence alcohol is poison
because if you think of alcohol as a
beverage
then it's just one of the things to
choose when you're having dinner
but if you think of it as poison
you put it in a different category it's
just easier to deal with it now that's
like one small example of what my
upcoming book will have it'll have
130 or 40 140 of them I think
um or something like that
so that's how powerful uh reframe is
just one sentence and sometimes one word
and I don't know if I've ever adequately
adequately explained why a reframe Works
have I ever done that
if I ever explained why a simple
sentence like alcohol is poison works
here's the quick explanation there's a
longer one in in the book but the quick
explanation is that words carry a
program
and and the program of a word is
independent of one sentence you put it
in
that that's why that's why hypnotists
will tell you uh don't say you're not
ugly
because because people hear the word
ugly and ugly carries power but the word
not
is sort of just a meaningless connector
word at least the way your brain
processes it so
so words you have to see them as
independent programs that's even
different from and could be opposite
from the sentence that they're in
so this is something they have to just
understand that the choice of words
can be as powerful as the sentence you
put them in
and that's why alcohol is poison just
connects the word poison which is never
good in any context would you agree
there's no such thing as good poisoning
you know then and don't tell me about
Botox okay
maybe sometimes there is but the point
is your your brain automatically thinks
negative when it thinks of poison
so you just pair that word poison with
anything
with anything it doesn't have to be
alcohol that's just the one I used you
just pair it with something and there
you go now alcohol alcohol had the uh a
little bit extra kicker in it
because uh
because because it was already reframed
was framed incorrectly as a beverage
so it's easy to reframe something
if it's original frame
looks sketchy to begin with right so
that that one was easy
all right did I predict that the
headlines would tell you
that there's way too much rain in
California
and we're still in a drought
do you remember me telling you that
Wall Street Journal one of the wettest
two-week periods on record in California
brought much needed water to its
reservoirs and snow to its mountains but
researchers and officials said it would
take several more Winters storms to make
a dent in the drought
so there you go
only California can have massive
rainfall
and droughts at the same time
now I think it's actually true like I'm
not I'm not saying it's untrue but you
you could have predicted that
100 miles away right
it's just a pattern that we repeat too
much rain and too much drought
uh Believe It or Not China is Banning
deep fakes on social media
that's right China is Banning deep fakes
so if somebody creates a character that
looks like a real person and acts like a
real person that would be illegal
in China
now you might say to yourself huh
China sounds like they are good stewards
of their social media
sounds like they want to make sure that
nobody is influenced in the wrong way
is that what's happening I don't think
so I think they're afraid of the deep
fakes being used against them obviously
since they have an authoritative
authoritarian government
imagine how much Havoc you could create
with a fake president XI deep fake
because people are going to do whatever
the you know president XI says yeah
they're not gonna you know so all you
need is one tweet that says everybody
quickly turn out the lights or whatever
and people would immediately walk over
to the light switch and turned off the
lights I mean that would be an
interesting test wouldn't it
here's how you could test it
make it deep fake of presidency I'm not
recommending this really this is a
mental exercise don't actually do this
like literally don't do this right
there's just a mental exercise but you
could test the power of a deep fake this
way you can make a deep fake that looks
like President XI and put it on social
media and that's probably too late
because he's already made them illegal
but even even if it's illegal it's going
to spread before they catch it right
and have him say at uh like midnight
in China
everybody turn out their lights for 10
minutes or one hour or something
everybody turn out your lights for one
hour and then come up with some official
sounding reason
like uh we had we're having trouble with
our grid
you know the energy grid is being taxed
so turn off your lights for one hour
from Midnight to 1.
and then actually watch China from a
satellite
I'll bet you the lights would go off
I'll bet they would now you wouldn't
really hurt well ideally you wouldn't
hurt anybody I mean I'm trying to think
of an experiment where nobody dies but
probably somebody would die if you
turned out the lights at the same time
but that's not the point the point is
you could probably test it
and I'll bet you a deep fake of a
dictator would change the whole country
immediately
you know if it were a bigger ask it you
know might be a bigger problem but I
think you get you know half of China to
turn off the lights at the same time
with a deep fake does anybody disagree
with that
do you do you think that could be done
if if they didn't police for the Deep
fake
and it became viral before the
government you know figured out how to
turn it off
I think the lights would go off
because imagine imagine thinking that if
you don't turn off your lights
the government will open your door and
drag you to jail
because if you're Chinese and you think
the government just told you to turn out
you'll turn off your lights for an hour
I'll bet you do it because it would be
so obvious if you didn't do it
right if you were the only one on your
block with the lights on you tell me you
wouldn't be afraid
you would be afraid
because it'd be so obvious you were to
find the government if you thought the
government ordered you to do that it'd
be an interesting test
I'll bet somebody will test it someday
all right um
SpaceX somehow I wasn't entirely up to
date on this story I didn't realize that
SpaceX was making a reusable uh Starship
that can carry up to 100 metric tons of
cargo
and grew for launch and that is reusable
and they've got this giant Tower that's
got these two chopstick-like arms that
come out
and apparently as the rocket is sort of
coming back down you know not not
perfectly stable it's going to fall
right between the Chopstick arms they
grab it and put it back on the ground
oh
is that actually going to work
is that going to work
that is so counterintuitive
of how you would engineer something but
I'm sure it will I mean obviously SpaceX
knows what it's doing and and to be
honest I didn't think they would ever
make a reusable rocket
I mean the fact that they could land a
reusable locket rocket upright blows my
mind the fact that they figured out how
to do that
but something tells me this will work
too
have you ever noticed that uh one of the
characteristics of Elon musk's companies
at least his two biggest ones maybe his
three biggest ones who became starlink
that they all kill people
have you ever thought about that
and and I'm going to spin this in a
positive way even though I'm starting
with killing people there's no question
that the Teslas
because of their unique design different
than regular cars you know in terms of
electronics Etc
may have killed some people who would
not have died if the Tesla didn't exist
I'm not saying Teslas are dangerous that
I don't have any data to support that
I'm saying that if you make a car
company
it wouldn't matter if you're forward or
anybody else you're making a product
that's going to kill somebody would you
agree
that just making a car company
means your product is going to kill some
people now it's usually their fault but
sometimes not right so you know
sometimes Ford will make a Ford Pinto
and they didn't intend anything to go
wrong but it had
right
um yeah now do crossing the street right
so everything's dangerous but here's the
thing I respect the most about
um well it's one of the things about
musk's you know big projects
when talking about going to the Moon I'm
sorry when talking about going to Mars
and and settling it
must says flat out people are going to
die
he just says it right now yeah people
are going to die
because we people always die when you do
something that you know that pioneering
anything that pioneering is going to be
expensive in terms of lives
and uh but imagine imagine having the
stones to build companies that are
definitely going to kill some people
but the benefit from them is is so much
larger than the cost this is still worth
doing
that takes a lot of stones
to actually know that your actions will
kill people not not guessing
he's not guessing the the odds of that
being true that people will die going to
Mars is
it's got to be close to 100 right a few
people we don't know how many
but you know
just think about how happy you should be
that there are people who are just
willing to do the hardest thing you can
do
how would you sleep
if something you created killed some
people
and you watched it on the news
horrible
horrible
do you think that Elon Musk knows that
someday he's going to watch that on the
news you know you could argue maybe he's
already seen news about Tesla's
exploding or something so maybe he's
already seen it but certainly in the
rocket
you know one of these days one of them
is going to go wrong
and he's gonna have to watch that
he's gonna have to watch that on TV now
he signed up for that
like he know he knows I'm sure he knows
because he said it directly he knows
what the downside is for him personally
and the upside I don't know does he need
any more upside than he already has
can Elon Musk you know do better I mean
if he's doing better than everybody else
on the planet I mean
you know he could he could take his foot
off the pedal if he wanted to
no I I just love the fact that he exists
I love the fact that nothing is well he
just won't stop for anything
he won't stop for his own personal risk
and he doesn't look like he's chasing it
just for his own personal satisfaction I
think he's actually in it for exactly
the reason he says
good for the world and that makes him
feel good
so you know let's let's be glad that
exists
I was watching uh Peter Zay and on Rogan
I don't know how recently he was on and
he was talking about uh China had 10
years left do you believe that
China has 10 years left before they're
in so much trouble they'll never look
like China again for a long time
now here's the argument
that that China's been lying for years
as much as by a hundred million people
what their population is
so they might already be in population
inversion meaning they have too many old
people and not enough young people to
support them
and not enough people in the middle to
buy the products that young people might
make if they do a startup or something
so that there's actually no economic way
for them to fix it but
um the thing that makes it worse says
Peter Zan is that China is unable to
Pivot quickly
because that would require a president
XI to get good information from his
advisors and we believe with good reason
to believe it that he's not that people
are afraid to tell the truth sort of the
Putin problem
now here's my first comment
I feel like we always say that about
every dictator
is it always true
like Putin is too insulated Kim Jong-un
is too insulated president XI is too
insulated
name some who else name another dictator
name a dictator that we don't say Biden
Yeah we actually say it about Biden
Castro we used to say it about Castro
right
uh I don't know about Trudeau that's a
stretch
Maybe
all right
so
um I'm not entirely sure that the these
dictators are not getting the right
information
I'm not entirely sure it's definitely
possible
I I would say it's well within the
you know easily believable
you know the the explanation of why it
could be so makes sense Etc
but I feel like their incentive to have
the right answer is so high
that they would just force it somehow
I don't know
so I guess I'm skeptical that she isn't
getting the right information but he
might not have the flexibility that
other people have for a variety of
reasons who knows
so we'll see
I don't know I've been telling you that
China is unsafe for business but
even I didn't know how it wasn't safe
and apparently they're going to have a
technological technology collapse as
well
because of the sanctions that we put on
their chip business I guess
all right we'll see
um
I saw a tweet from Machiavelli's
underbelly today who said
quote I believe this is a simulation
meaning a reality I believe this is a
simulation because I experienced the
world in a way that is not plausible
now
I I've often read tweets from
Machiavelli's underbelly account
and I can confirm that his life is not
plausible
I mean only the even just the stuff I've
seen it's not plausible because one of
the implausible things is that he
influences me almost every day
like his content almost always
influences me
and
I believe there's evidence that I'm
influencing other things
so his life is actually implausible and
and he's had a number of experiences in
his private life that he's tweeted about
they'll also look pretty implausible
like very implausible and so I was a
uh boosting that thought because in in
my case my life is so implausible
everything about my life is completely
implausible it just doesn't make any
sense
um
yeah and specifically the way the way my
life
unfolds
is like there's only 12 people in the
world who matter
and that's not the case there are eight
billion people who matter but it seems
like every time there's some big story
in the world
somehow I'm in the middle of it
that's not possible that's completely
implausible like you can imagine you
could imagine you know somebody being in
in the middle of a few stories
a few right you can imagine that
um
but it's way beyond that and it doesn't
make any sense at all
right and I'll give you more on that
later
but I just want you to keep that to
standard in mind that people like Elon
Musk musk is a great example Elon musk's
life is completely implausible
like not just one or two things he did
but just all of it like the whole thing
is implausible
so the people have been plausible lives
the people with implausible lives
probably are more likely to believe that
God is guiding them or has chosen them
or they live in the simulation it
definitely influences your your beliefs
all right actress uh Gabrielle Union
is getting some trouble on social media
because of course they misinterpreted
something she said
so with your permission
I would like to continue my role as
public defender
of the people who need some public
defending
not because I agree with them because
later I'm going to say some things about
Andrew Tate and you know I'm not a fan
right but when people are illegitimately
accused of things be they celebrities or
politicians be they politicians I like
or not be they people I hate or love
in all cases if there's an obvious
defense I'm going to present it
because I feel like the world is a
little bit better
if we you know assume innocence until
proven guilty and if people get a fair
airing of their of their side it's just
a better world so I'm gonna like try to
fill in a little that as I can all right
so here's what Gabrielle Union was uh
getting crap about before I defend her
uh apparently she uh cheated wildly on
her uh husband I don't know if it was
her first husband or what her current
situation is but um cheated wildly on
him and the comment that is getting in
trouble is that uh
Union added that she also felt
comfortable with doing what she wanted
meaning cheating since she quote paid
all the bills
so since she was the one who paid the
bills she felt
that you know cheating was a little bit
more allowed now does that story sound
true
does it sound like anything might be
missing from the story
yeah here's the part that's missing from
the story
her husband never stopped dating after
he got married
that's a small detail
small detail yeah she says she says so
directly that neither of them neither of
them
neither of them stopped dating after
they got married
and she thinks maybe that wasn't an
ideal situation but on top of the fact
on top of the fact that they both dated
now her her argument is that you know he
just he was doing these things and so
she thought she could match him
so you know you have to question whether
he did it first or not
I don't know if he did it first that's
impossible for us to know but that's the
story
if you leave out the story that the
husband had been dating since he was
married
it looks a little different doesn't it
now Imagine The Story Once you know the
context
once you know that they're both wildly
cheating
and she also was bugged by the fact that
she was paying the bills
not only for herself but for the guy
who's cheating on her even though she
was cheating on him now I think she
probably could have left out the paying
the bills part you know that that part
didn't help her but that part got
elevated to be the story and that's not
the story the story is there were two
people who were not monogamous
that's the end of the story
two people who are not monogamous
you don't need to know anything else
so I defend Gabrielle Union as just
somebody who is in a suboptimal marriage
and that ladies and gentlemen is the
entire story
all right favorite story of the day the
United Kingdom teachers in the United
Kingdom
have a problem apparently
I have to get ready for this story
because this was this was just too good
uh they're trying to deprogram the young
boys in the United Kingdom the teachers
are because they've been too influenced
by Andrew Tate
so Andrew Tate apparently has influenced
these young boys and uh
so they're they're trying to re-educate
the teenage students and so they they
had a group of them I guess 30 of them
and they were sort of trying to
deprogram them and find out what they
thought about Andrew Tate and uh
apparently the the conversation drifted
into rape
and the boys were adopting the lit 10 of
the boys at a 30 which is a lot we're
adopting the Andrew Tate
take on it which I I'm not promoting
I'm just saying he says it that uh women
are sometimes bringing problems on
themselves now you know you're not
supposed to say that
but Andrew Tay said it and 10 out of 30
of the boys that they talk to uh were on
that page that maybe the women should
take more responsibility for being in
the situation now there are all kinds of
reasons why that's not a good standard
do you agree there are all kinds of
reasons why the the Tate version of
things is not the one you want to teach
to your kids
but he's very persuasive
and here's my take on the story
number one
Andrew Tate's persuasion is way more
powerful
than the education system of the UK
he's just better at it that now I'm no
fan and you all know that right I'm sort
of anti-tape just for by personal
reasons for personal interaction not not
from public stuff
so just from you know my own experience
I know him to be a liar
and I know him to be a weasel
but it is nonetheless true
he's super talented meaning that his
persuasion game is one of the best I've
ever received
and part of the reason it's so good is
his physicality
because he and and also the the things
he's combining with his persuasion
because he has apparently a great grasp
of social media
and figured out some system to get lots
of clip or clip retweet retweets and
postings I think that was a big secret
to his viral success so that was all
skill right he knew how to make
something viral that was skill that
wasn't luck he knew how to make a
message that would travel
and he does it over and over again
that's skill that's not luck
and uh he acted on a new technology
these reels and Tick Tock that's
opportunistic it's smart it's not locked
and on top of that because his mat his
his sort of a manly message
is backed by his his persona
so he's a you know physically his
physicality and his you know fighting
credentials
match really well with his persuasion
so if you're a young boy
you say suddenly see somebody who's
strong and successful and Powerful
and anything he says is just going to
sound good to you anything he says so he
has the whole package and you can see
why it was so successful because he he
checked every box
for the people he was trying to persuade
now women of course are having a
different reaction to him but it wasn't
who he was talking to
yeah maybe he picks up a few women but
mostly he was talking to these young
guys who were emulating his his model it
was mostly a thing for for guys
so the first thing is I don't think the
UK has any idea
how powerful that message is and if
they're going to try to erase it it just
might get more powerful
because if they make it like banned oh
there's no teenage boys who want to look
at stuff that's inappropriate
I don't know how I don't know how in the
world they could possibly combat his
message he just has too much Firepower
they're overwhelmed they have no idea
what they're up against
anyway
um
here's the question they should be
asking themselves instead of
reprogramming the boys
why is Andrew Tate's message so powerful
they're asking the wrong question the
questions they're asking themselves is
how can we reprogram these boys
wrong question
right question is why was this message
so easily easily picked up
it's because those kids were ready for
that message
they were ready for that message
why
why were they so ready for that message
what what was it
in the environment that made them
susceptible to the first Andrew Tate who
came along because if it had not been
him
could have been somebody else because it
was the message that they're grabbing
onto it's not really the personality
they should ask themselves that question
what are they doing wrong
for boys
that's the question what is the
education system doing wrong
for boys
that Andrew Tate looked like a better
option than what they were providing
if you don't ask that question
you're not much of an academic group are
you
all right
um now in the context also of
being the public defender
for people who can't do it themselves
Andrew Tate is allegedly in some kind of
detention in Romania would you agree
that he cannot defend himself
in public
true right he has a great disadvantage
he could maybe do it through third
parties in an awkward way but really
he's he's at he's at the mercy of the
public
okay and in those cases
I provide my Public Defender Services
not because I think he should be free
not because I think he's innocent of all
things I don't know how would I know but
because he's in a position which no
citizen of any country should be it
which is uh being accused of the worst
possible crimes and be unable to speak
for himself
that's the worst would you agree
if you just put your side but for a
moment your feelings about him
individually to the side which is hard
let's give him what every citizen
deserves all right and I saw today a
tweet which is a smart question
and it showed Andrew Tate seemingly to
admit to crimes
seemingly and then we'll talk about
whether he actually did
seemingly
he well he said this but we'll we'll
talk about whether it's described he
said that he has these cam cam girls
that he has trained to lie to the guys
that think they're maybe getting into a
relationship with him and then they'll
say things like well
I would love to meet up with you in real
life
but I don't have a Visa and the flight
would be expensive and I'd need money to
get together so send me ten thousand
dollars and so they send them ten
thousand dollars and then he teaches the
girls to the women he teaches the women
to lie and say oh another thing came up
first I need a medical procedure or
whatever it is so that they just keeps
stringing along getting money now
illegal or legal go
crime
crime or no crime
you presume it's a crime right
you presume it's a crime
I don't know
I don't know
but I'll let me give you the counter
argument you know you can you can make
up your own mind
but I'll give you the counter argument
because you've never heard it all right
now just consider the fact that you've
never heard this I'll bet right
um number one could you ever make it
illegal for women to make romance
related promises to men that they don't
incl that they might not intend to keep
could it ever be illegal
for women to lie to men in the domain of
romance
for any any possible reason for for
money for anything could it ever be
illegal for women to lie to men about
romance related stuff
it's a slippery slope
you could try
I mean you could try but how would you
ever enforce that
you know wouldn't everybody take their
girlfriend to court
how many Ordinary People had their
spouse or girlfriend lied to them
about what they would do in return for
money
it's the most common thing in the world
You couldn't possibly make that illegal
could you
like if you made it illegal you'd have
to look for something like a conspiracy
right
and then and then Andrew take could just
say well
you know I trained him how to do this
but I didn't tell her to do that
specific thing
and then what is he at fault if he
trained them to on a general technique
and said if you use this technique you
will make more money
for yourself and then I'll share some of
it
is that illegal
because he wouldn't be forcing him to do
it I suppose if he forced him to do it
then it looks different but if he just
said this is a method you could make
more money and then I would make more
money too
because that's that might be how the
girls the women I start to keep saying
girls but that might be how the women
um
feel they're making more money maybe
they thought it was a benefit who knows
now as far as the guys
here's my second argument all right the
first argument is There's no practical
way to make it illegal for women to lie
to men in the context of romance would
you agree with that
would you agree with that the basic that
it would be really dicey to make that
illegal
now there might be some law that covers
this
and I don't know Romanian law so there
might be some law but just in general
don't assume it's illegal
like we we all assume it's illegal the
moment we hear it
but dig down a little it might not be
and and let me ask you this
does Andrew seem dumb
to you
because what we see is him apparently uh
apparently
admitting to a crime in the most visible
way you possibly could would he do that
he might I mean anybody you know maybe
you know hubris or something right you
might
I I wouldn't rule it out
but you have to ask yourself if that's
compatible with everything else he's
done
because everything else he's done seems
you know maybe he's selfish and sketchy
but well thought out
do you think you wouldn't think that
through
Maybe
maybe he's smart in a whole bunch of
ways but dumb in one specific way that's
the thing that could happen
it just seems unlikely
so if you're just assuming
that he knows it's illegal and he
admitted it you know directly
Maybe
that's possible I just don't think it's
the most likely explanation but it's
definitely possible here's my better
defense
did you know that in the in in the
context of entertainment
it is perfectly legal to lie to your
audience
did you know that
how many of you knew that
if if what you're selling is
entertainment
is completely legal to lie
no I don't mean satire I don't mean
parody
I mean if you're a TV game show
you can pretend that the participants
don't already know the answer even when
they do
that's legal
you could rig a game show as long as
it's entertaining
how about a magic act on television
a magician can go on television and say
I promise you
that this is not a camera trick like you
know it's not real magic but I'm doing a
magic trick that would look just the
same if you were here in person
but really it's just a camera trick
totally legal
it's a complete lie but it's in the
service of entertainment doesn't matter
the law allows that completely
how about having a sporting competition
that's actually fake
would that be legal
yeah pro wrestling
it pretends to be like Israel but it's
not but as long as it's entertainment
it's fine
that's fine
how about uh have you ever seen a
musician lip sync
go to a concert and somebody's lip
syncing
but they don't say they're lip syncing
they they pretend like they're actually
singing is that illegal
no no in the context of entertainment
perfectly legal
uh let's see how about a reality TV show
thanks Jeremy how about a reality TV
show
presented as true
blood is largely scripted right the the
problems they have are largely from the
producers
so
once you understand that at least in
America it might be different in
different countries I don't know what
the law is everywhere but in America is
perfectly legal
to lie to people if your context that
you both understand is the context of
entertainment what is a cam girl
business
It's Entertainment
he runs an entertainment business
which a hundred percent of the people
using it would understand this
entertainment
if they see uh women on camera
they know that that woman is wearing
makeup
like the whole thing is is like a
presentation for effect everybody
everybody involved knows that
so I would like to at least put out the
uh possibility
number one that women lying to men in a
romantic concept content
context
might not be illegal because it might be
too hard to make it illegal and secondly
if everybody knows it's an entertainment
product it might be legal to just say
anything you want as long as it's in the
context of entertainment
so
if it turns out that any of this is
illegal
don't tell me I'm wrong
you get that right
I'm just introducing uh Reasonable Doubt
because Andrew Tate cannot speak for
himself at the moment
all right so you tell me was this a
service
a service or no
was it useful for me to
defend him in public even though I hate
him
I genuinely hate him
yeah
this is the way I'd like to see the
world work and by the way if this ever
happened to me you know here's the
here's sort of the the Golden Rule thing
if I ever got put in jail
and you know accusations were spinning
around
I was sure as hell
want you defending me
and then I would want Andrew Tate
defending me too although I hate him
right I'm not sure he would but but why
Andrew Tate to defend me
if the situation were reversed no matter
how much he disliked me
so all right
is your nose blocked yeah always
all right
um so that was your service for the day
now
um I'm going to talk about the clot
birds for a moment because I had a
I had a realization
remember I told you I couldn't figure
out why people were so mad at me in
particular
right it seemed like the the the
anti-vaxxers had sort of targeted me
like more than other people which was
weird because I was never against them
can you confirm
uh I'd like a confirmation at least from
the people who have watched me the
longest can you confirm that not once
did I say a negative word about people
who refuse the vaccination
or The Masks or the mandates
or
the alleged
um what do you call the passport
I never said anything bad about anybody
who was opposed to any of those things
confirmed right confirmed now
so you can see why I was confused
I was confused why is it that the person
who does not say bad things about them
is getting so much heat like that I
couldn't but I finally squared it
and I'm going to explain it to you and
the and I think you'll learn something
from this I think you will
um as you as you just witnessed with my
defense of Andrew Tate
I realized that uh much of the audience
that only dips in and out you know maybe
they see me only on Twitter they don't
understand that I defend the strongest
point
on both sides of most of the big issues
now
can you confirm to the the club Birds
that you've seen me over and over defend
the strongest argument on both sides
of the big
big thing you've seen me defend Biden
happy not you've seen me defend Trump
and also criticize both
you've watched it you've seen me say
that the best reason you should get a
vaccination and the worst
you've seen me argue against masks and
for them
because I give you the best argument on
both sides now if you dipped in and only
saw me arguing the side you didn't like
let me let me put you in the heads of
the people that I'm not okay here's a
good experiment for you or a good
practice
if you don't understand why something's
happening just spend a little time
literally imagining what it's like to be
the people who are mad at you
just imagine what their life is like let
me take you through this imagine you
were an anti-vaxx person at the
beginning of the pandemic
like when that when the vaccinations
let's call them shots or Jabs when the
shots first rolled out
what was the mainstream media saying
about you
if you were anti-vaxx from day one
they said you were anti-science
they said you were a damn
right they said you were killing grandma
and you probably should not be allowed
to participate
info can't do it don't want to swear
they said you couldn't participate in
society
you couldn't even be around good people
that's what they said about you
now imagine all right put yourself in
the head because if you got vaccinated
you can't understand this put yourself
in the head
of the people who took the the most
radical stand which is yes I know all of
science is telling me to do this but I
don't trust you here are the reasons I
don't trust you
and they're pretty good reasons
pretty good reasons because Pharmacy big
Pharma has lied to us lots of money is
involved nobody trusts politicians
all the good reasons to not do it right
now imagine
that you had been brutalized by the the
good people in society
for a year and a half maybe two years
how long has it been how long have the
vaccine the Jabs been available like two
years
for two years you've been treated
like the of society
right you all saw it it was brutal it
was brutal
and then
you recognize that the best strongest
argument
against your point of view
came from me
at the same time wait at the same time
the data was starting to turn your way
right because that's what happened the
data started to turn their way
you can't deny that the data definitely
turned in the direction of the
anti-vaxxers now you could argue whether
it's turned all the way you know whether
you still argue whether older people in
comorbidities should have got the jab or
not but the argument of whether young
people should have been jabbed
I think it's over
I think it's over
would you agree
young males
I feel like that argument is over now we
haven't changed the policy
but I don't think the argument has much
life in it right so now okay go back put
your put yourself in the head
put yourself in the head of somebody who
got on
for their opinion
for two years
you know kept away from society couldn't
fly didn't have the normal rights of an
American citizen for two years
and then they see this me
and they don't know the full context
but they've seen a tweet in which you
know they saw me argue one side but they
didn't see me argue the other side and
they go this is Enemy Number One
because the thing I didn't understand
you know because they don't see me
arguing the other side the the thing
they don't understand
and maybe the rest of you don't
understand is how would that feel
how did it feel
now now take the next step now imagine
if they they've incorrectly identified
me as their enemy when I'm closer to the
opposite
but having having incorrectly identified
me as their enemy
how would they feel if they could get
revenge
meaning dunking on me in public how
would it feel
really good right
it would feel good yeah it would
literally be like a like a relief
it's like oh you people because people
would incorrectly lump me with the
Mandate people I was anti-mandate from
the start but to the extent that people
could quite reasonably imagine I was on
a different side because they only saw
half of my argument they lumped me with
the people that they hate
and they say not only are you with the
people we hate but you have the
strongest argument against us because I
do I also have the strongest argument on
their favor
but they haven't necessarily seen that
so
doesn't that make sense
so it makes sense that I would generate
an unusually
rabid response
but the the club Birds became a big part
of my life cope cope
and
here's how I know I live in a simulation
are you ready for this
so literally as I'm walking around
thinking about the clot birds and I was
literally having this the thoughts I
just expressed we're going around in my
head I'm thinking wow
why do so many people think that Scott
Adams is
a clot they even call me claw Adams
like that's that's the nickname they
could be Claude Adams and as I'm
thinking this
this is not a joke
this next thing actually really happened
in whatever this is
all right this actually happened
I turn on the television
to Fox News
and there was a weather report
and the name of the person doing the
weather report was
I'm not making this up this is his
actual name
Adam klotz
k-l-o-t-z
that that's a real thing
that as I was thinking about CLA Adams I
turned on the TV and the weatherman's
name was Adam klotz
check it for yourself
he's a real person
that really happened
okay
I I think also that the Clockworks make
an assumption that I would never make
which is that maybe I see myself as a
role model
because as they know when I you know
when I was forced to make a decision
finally after putting it off as long as
possible for international travel same
decision that Dr Malone made that they
might think that I saw myself as a role
model
because I got the Jab
is there anything I've told you more
often than don't see me as a source of
medical information
is there anything I've said more often
than that do not get your medical
information from a cartoonist maybe the
only thing I've said more often than
that is don't get your uh your
investment advice
the two things I say the most don't get
your financial advice or your medical
advice from me
but you could easily imagine because
other the other celebrities
correct me if I'm wrong
probably almost every celebrity who got
the Jab
uh promoted it as they were role models
for you am I right
every celebrity who got the Jab
promoted themselves as role models
in other words they actually gave you
medical advice
celebrities
were massively giving medical advice
foreign
this is a defense of the clot Birds
see how I do this the clappers were my
big enemies and now I'm giving them a
Public Defense
right imagine if you saw one more
celebrity and I'll put myself in that
category for conversation who got
vaccinated and then talked about it
because I talked about it
wouldn't you assume I was holding myself
out as a role model
if that's all you saw you know if you
didn't see the context of me always
saying don't look at me for that yeah
Jimmy Fallon example right so it is is
perfectly
um reasonable and now finally
finally I think by putting myself in in
their mindset like spending a little
time like okay what would it be to like
look through their eyes for a little
while totally get it
totally get it
how many how many how many of you think
that I've expressed the situation
correctly
does that does it ring true or no
okay I get more yeses mostly yeses right
now
does this
does this um excuse me
is this like an excuse
have I excused myself from all
responsibility for the confusion of
course not
of course not
this is totally my responsibility
as as the communicator
this this pointed out an obvious problem
with what I do but at the same time I
don't know how to solve it easily
because it becomes tedious if every time
I talk I say but you know I'm also going
to talk about the other side or you know
remember that yesterday I talked about
the other side
it becomes tedious
so I don't know exactly how to solve it
but I accept it as my responsibility
everybody okay with that
I consider that myself responsible for
the misinformation I'm doing what I can
to correct it
but
um I also don't know how to fully
correct it in the past or the future
so but the fact that I don't know how to
fix it doesn't make it not my
responsibility can we agree on that
I'll take responsibility without knowing
that I can succeed because I don't know
a better system really I think the
communicator has to be responsible
all right
and that
oh we got some more stuff
um
so there's some new information Dr
Malone has he's leading looks like he's
leading a group of doctors who want to
ban the shots or at least ban them for
some portion of the public
and he says there's some new information
that says that uh that getting boosted
makes you less likely
getting boosted makes you more likely to
catch the virus
the more likely the people who are the
most boosted
also have the highest infection rate
what is your interpretation of that
the more boosters you have the more
infections you get which means how do
you interpret it
give me your interpretation to that fact
well the way the doctors are
interpreting it is that the more boosted
you get the more likely just from the
booster itself the more likely you're
going to catch the virus
do you think that's the best
interpretation of that data
because I have a different one
who do you think is most likely to get
boosted
right now uh I'm over 65 and I might
have a comorbidity if if asthma counts
and if I really have asthma there's some
there's some questions there but even I
didn't get boosted
because the once it was Omicron
and once I had a little natural immunity
because I got infected too
um I didn't see the benefit of getting
boosted
but if I weighed 300 pounds would I have
gotten boosted
let me ask you
If I weighed 300 pounds everything else
is the same
probably
you don't you don't think that the
people who were most likely to get
infected and also they thought they were
the weakest are most likely to get
vaccinated
to me it looks like the doctors have
confused correlation and causation
now I don't know that for sure if I said
that as a fact that would be Adeline I
don't know it as a fact I just know that
the most likely explanation for the data
is not mentioned
that's the dog not barking right now if
it turns out that my criticism you know
is very surface level criticism it just
looks like correlation and causation
were backwards now if it turns out that
I'm wrong which I usually could be
shouldn't that be the first thing they
mentioned
the first thing I would mention if I
were communicating this because remember
I just took responsibility for my own
communication problems and I think
that's a good standard for everybody
when I listened to Dr Malone
say here's our correlation
and therefore we are assuming causation
I say to myself you're going to have to
say more about how you rule down
correlation because correlation is the
obvious explanation
all right let me say it again
in a different way
if you had a job where you worked at
home
are you as likely to get boosted as if
you had a job where you're let's say
around people in close contact and lots
of different people all day long
I feel like I would more likely get
boosted if I had more chance of
infection
and the more people you're around the
more chance of infection
so
and then let me ask you this do you
think that
fear drives vaccination decisions yes or
no
do you think the fear is why people give
vaccinated mostly
mostly yes who's the most afraid
somebody who is in perfect health
or somebody who knows they have some
comorbidities
who would be more afraid
I assume the people with comorbidities
so who would you expect
to have the highest death rate
the people with the comorbidities even
vaccinated
versus people who are perfectly healthy
and didn't get vaccinated
whether vaccinations have any any
protective value or not
in all of those situations I would
expect the most of vaccinated people
to be the ones who are most afraid
and the reasons they were most afraid is
that they knew themselves and they knew
their comorbidities
so
shouldn't this be exactly what we'd
hoped to see
given that we know that the vaccinations
so-called don't stop the spread that
part we know
but wouldn't you
logically expect
more deaths among the people who are the
most vaccinated
that's the most reasonable thing you'd
expect
right so when Dr Malone doesn't explain
away the most reasonable explanation for
the data and he goes he goes directly
and strong to the second most reasonable
explanation because it's a reasonable
possibility that the the vaccination is
making you weaker in some way
totally possible just because it's an
unknown new thing there's some spike
proteins floating around and God knows
that sounds bad
so
the well the social contagion is part of
the fear yes
yeah now those who say they're bored
with the subject
I understand the point but do you
understand this none of this is about
the pandemic or the vaccination or masks
it's only about decision making
is that coming through
am I being clear that I'm never talking
about your decision because I'm actually
not interested
I I am I'm deeply and aggressively
uninterested in your vaccination status
there's nothing that could interest me
less than that
your personal health decisions
keep me out of that keep me out of that
 I have no interest in that but it
turns out that the the the vaccination
and the whole pandemic situation is just
a it's a gold mine
of uh examples of good and bad thinking
so given that my you know my sweet spot
for everything is where people are
thinking about it wrong
that that's my territory this is the
most Target Rich environment so I
totally get it if you feel like I'm
trying to influence you to make some
different decision I'm not
I never have
I'm trying to influence you to see that
correlation does not equal causation and
maybe we should care about that
well did I beat it to death because this
is a new story
I haven't talked about this before
and the more examples you see I think
the better case anyway so I leave that
to the end so those of you who are done
with that
um all right here let me give you one
more example
um
this is something that a Twitter user
named Blake said right so they've
studied the outcomes of vaccinated and
unvaccinated people and Blake says this
and this is going to make you mad that
it wasn't obvious
all right watch how you feel when I read
you Blake's comment
one thing these studies fail to mention
or take into account is that many of the
unvaccinated cohort are no longer with
us especially the elderly in that group
so what you're left with is an
unvaccinated group of survivors with
natural immunity
so yeah there's a little problem with
the data
did you ever think how did how do you
get data on dead people
all right let me let me ask you
something else
um imagine you're uh an anti-vaxxer
and then over here there's a a pro-vax
person
the pro-vax person gets the vaccination
and uh the system knows that because
they keep track of who's vaccinated then
that person gets
gets covered
and the medical system records that
so now the medical system knows this
person's name got covered got vaccinated
boom connect them
now let's say you're anti-vaxx
and you get some symptoms at home
so you get yourself a test kit you know
if you're smart you have somebody else
get it for you you test yourself and
you're positive
and you say ah no problem
I'll get a little time off from work
so you stay home nobody knows you're
positive
nobody knows you're unvaccinated
so how how did Dr Malone's data capture
that person
nobody ever talked to that person then
you say to yourself Scott it's easy they
just do a poll
right they're not looking for every
person they just call you and they say
are you vaccinated or are you not
you know did you get an infection did
you not it's easy right
how did they interview the dead people
yeah you did can you get a good
interview with a dead person
the dead people are the biggest part of
the data and nobody's talking to them
all right now let me say this the phone
rings at home
it's a landline
you answer the phone
and says hi I want to take a poll of
your vaccination status
uh do you mind answering a few questions
about whether you're vaccinated and
whether you got infected
your your pro-vaccination
what do you do
oh yes yes in fact I did get vaccinated
um yes yes I did I also got infected all
right all right thank you yes good have
a great day click
now let's say same thing but you're
unvaccinated
hello
hi I'd like to ask you a poll about
click
am I wrong
You couldn't possibly pull this
is unpollable
because all the anti-vaxxers are just
going to hang up on you
I'm not wrong
so so without even looking at the data
what should it show
the only way you could connect the
collect the data
and the only and given what kinds of
people are more likely to be vaccinated
the only way this data could have gone
is to show that the vaccinated people
are also the most effective there's no
other way I could have gone
and it doesn't mean anything about
causation there's just no other way it
could have gone
am I wrong
cope
so to the uh the club Birds
they have a couple of uh
key slogans that I like to emphasize one
is you are wrong
and it works best without reasons you
were wrong and also cope cope
I like hope as a rally cry cope
something we can all we can all identify
with cope
all right the great white cope
[Laughter]
stop it I already gave them the name
claw Adams and they haven't stopped
about it yet all right I'm gonna
I'm going to say this
for all the coke births if you would
also like to call me the
great white cope
that is acceptable
that is acceptable
under under the rule which I tell you
often
uh if it's not funny if so if a topic is
not funny I prefer you to understand my
actual opinion
or what I've actually done in real life
however if it's really funny
I do not encourage you to seek the truth
because you know Funny's good so great
white cope
thumbs up
you should use it a lot
yeah that's copies Copa septic copacet I
can't say that word suddenly
all right uh
um YouTube blocked you well I wonder why
I wonder why
uh somebody thinks anti-vaxxers should
go to jail
Scott's not up on corporations and how
people had to get vaccinations to keep
their jobs Lisa B says
now Lisa B
uh do you know what I do for a living
have you heard of my day job
because there are quite a few people who
think
that I don't understand how corporations
work
good insightful comment Lisa
I'm not sure I would have said that one
in person do you know how many people
have accused me of not understanding
that businesses don't make efficient
decisions and I just listen I go
you know what I do for a job right
literally the most skeptical person on
the planet when it comes to corporate
Behavior you can't you can't I was
skepticize me on that of course I knew
what the businesses were doing
the the reason I got vaccinated is
because one business the airlines didn't
let you even ride yeah of course I do
that
uh
yeah Dr Scott Scott Atlas as an expert
that people kept confusing with me yeah
that that didn't work out for me
all right
um
have I covered everything
sorry about the Lemmings okay
scat Atlas
oh The Tick Tock influence story
uh didn't I talk about that yesterday
Forbes Forbes had a big story about Tick
Tock influencing people I talked about
that already
um
the user what
is my my book's already showing up
online on Amazon oh my God
I didn't realize my book already shows
up on Amazon it's just a placeholder
it's that's not the real cover or
anything
uh watch Dr Drew interview with Dr
zlinski he's Linko
all right
book yeah my book will be out in
September I think
Adam Schiff Twitter blocking what's that
about
all right I think I covered everything
all books are in Amazonia
yeah you know all these governments
Banning Tick Tock only on government
devices
they're so weak
that's weak sauce
uh who leaked the Dobbs decision I guess
we don't know
starseed says Scott's greatest
exaggeration is his self-proclaimed his
skepticism
well starseed I don't know if you've
noticed
I actually doubt you exist
like actually literally
like I don't even think you exist as a
like a thinking human to me you exist as
an NPC
at the same time he was telling me I'm
not skeptical enough
I don't believe experts I don't believe
the government I don't believe the
critics who criticize them I don't
believe the old data I don't believe the
new data
and I don't even believe you exist as a
real person other than in my subjective
experience
so your point is I'm not skeptical
enough right
good good
what's this
Scott's what
huh
yeah all right you're blind to your own
biases
does anybody think I'm blind to my own
biases
what would you say let's get an opinion
here am I blind to my own biases
yes by definition of course
that's just what those words mean
yeah yeah if there's anything I tell you
often it's that
cognitive dissonance doesn't have
favorites
like do you think cognitive this is Taps
out at some IQ level
it's like oh I didn't know this guy's
120 I'd better not not give him any
cognitiveness no it doesn't it's
completely independent
yeah of course confirmation bias
cognitive dissonance
I've told you the only defense you have
against confirmation bias and cognitive
distance the only defense you have is to
expose yourself to as many other
opinions especially from smart people
to doubt your own ability to perceive as
as hard as you can so to not trust
yourself
I I did a tweet where I said that no
matter what you did during the pandemic
you had to depend on something you had
to trust something you shouldn't have
trusted
and then a bunch of people said oh no no
I didn't trust anything I shouldn't have
trusted
totally the opposite I trusted my gut
instinct
and I trusted myself
I didn't trust that stuff I shouldn't
trust like your data and your experts no
I didn't do that
you trusted yourself
is that how you do all science
do you make all your decisions that way
you talk to your lawyer then say you
know
I'm going to take my own course on this
do you trust yourself every time you
talk to the doctor or do you call your
shots
every time
yeah you never you never say to yourself
you know
have you ever audited how right you were
about everything in the past
the lowest standard of credibility is
yourself
we just said that no matter how smart
you are you can be under cognitive
dissonance and Confirmation biases it's
we're all under that
if you're trusting yourself
over the body of information that at
least has some chance of triangulating
toward the truth
that is the worst standard for decision
making you could ever have
now I don't think you should distrust
your instincts or what you feel is your
common sense those are magical thinking
but you shouldn't distrust anything that
sends a signal
now if if you said whoa there were all
kinds of signals
that things were sketchy you were right
there were all kinds of signals you read
those correctly but it's not the whole
story
but the signals you saw them correctly
yes we all did
uh
oh and then I said that uh that no one
regrets their decision
and then people gave me examples of of
the opposite so some people said no
Scott I did not take the shot and boy am
I happy
boy am I happy
so that's the case of people would not
agree got it and then the people who
took the shots some of them were saying
oh I didn't regret it because there's
some people who had some um
apparent side effects that they think
were of Acts related they say yes I did
regret it
but if you compared the people who got
vaccinated and then regretted it
would that be bigger or smaller than the
number of people we saw uh
drawing their last breath in the
hospital
unvaccinated and then dying
I don't know
but I but I withdraw my statement that
nobody regretted their choice because
there were you know probably
five or ten percent
but it's definitely not nobody
um
yeah
oh so I released
um people on locals you don't know this
yet
so if you're not in locals I do a comic
called robots read news
in which I do things that generally
could not be published in normal places
so that usually I just publish them
within the subscription site locals
uh but I often ask them
if they would be willing to let me share
them
so I made those shareable but I'm not
going to Tweet them because I think the
I'll let the people on locals decide if
they want to share it or they want to
keep it to themselves but uh
they're some of my best work
maybe you'll see it maybe you won't
so I I changed the sharing
um on those two most recent robot reads
news so you can share them with your
friends or anybody else you want on
social media
a few people asked if if it turns out
you don't like me sharing those
because you you like having your special
you know environment there I'll be happy
to do that because you're subscribers
just let me know I'll probably just take
the majority on that
all right
um
you may also know the locals people know
this but I just
forward to Dr Jordan Peterson and I also
pinned on my site the first draft of a
comic in which I'll be mocking
the Ontario College of psychologists
psychiat psychologists
um who are apparently requiring Dr
Jordan Peterson to come back in to get
re-educated on how to use social media
foreign
this is also one of my favorite stories
have you have you noticed something
about the trend in the stories
there's there's definitely uh some kind
of a peak wokeness situation going on
is it just my confirmation bias it looks
like
the the the stories about wokeness have
left the domain of politics
and they've entered the domain of pure
humor
I'm not imagining that right so the
story about the Ecuadorian man who who
identifies as a woman so he has better
chance of custody over his kids than a
divorce that's just funny
right
that's not even a political argument
that's just funny
and uh when the Ontario College of
psychologists decided they needed to
re-educate the most effective and best
uh the the best brand ambassador for
Canadian psychologists there could ever
be in the world
ever the most productive useful
beneficial to Ordinary People
highest credibility
you know genuinely High character person
the best Ambassador they could ever have
for Canadian psychologists
well they decided they better they
better re-educate his ass
that's just funny
right if I could make a if I could make
a Dilbert comic about it without even
trying like I basically just transcribed
the situation and it's a joke
I think we've had Peak wokeness
right remember the story of the uh
the individual
who was wearing the gigantic prosthetic
breasts I think also in Canada
and there was some question about
whether that was serious or not serious
but whatever that situation is
can you admit
it's funny
right like it might not be funny to him
it might be serious we don't know what's
going on in his head but to The
Observers
the walk this thing just became funny
that is the last gasp
the last gasp of oldness is where we get
a good laugh out we're at now remember
I've been through this cycle before
in the corporate world do you remember
uh there was there's things called
re-engineering and some other Trends and
and I would just Dilbert crap all over
them until they became laughing stocks
and then nobody wanted to admit they
actually liked it in the first place
yeah that's where the walkness has gone
it it has now entered pure humor
territory
if if you see a
Libs of tick tock video
are you gonna like get all political
about it or are you gonna have a laugh
You're gonna laugh every time
it literally is an account that does
nothing but show you what's actually
happened with no commentary no
commentary just shows you the actual
video and then it's it's comedy
right
that's where we are
the the I think the club birds have
turned into a
different kind of troll for some reason
all right
um
call them Scots debris
that's funny
all right that's all for now and I will
talk to you
later
and Jared your questions are all stupid
bye for now
