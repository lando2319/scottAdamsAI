good morning everybody and welcome to
coffee with Scott Adams a highlight of
human
civilization and if you'd like this
experience which is already
extraordinary to go up to levels that
almost nobody could even imagine
and that's not even counting the
Whiteboard that's coming up then all you
have to do is find yourself a cup or mug
or a glass of tanker gels or Stein a
canteen joger flaska vess of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dopamine the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous Sip and it
happens now
go oh yeah
well according to the CDC only 2% of
Americans got their Co vaccination this
year
2% I'm starting to
think that the public is waking
up what would
happen if the public suddenly woke
up because I feel like we're maybe maybe
reaching the point where people are
waking
up because you know here's the here's
the
progression you start with my team good
other team
bad and if you wake up you realize that
both teams are just you know following
their self-interest and probably don't
have much of your interest in mind at
all and then once you don't trust
anything everything starts making sense
sense it's only when you trust something
that you're
lost right as soon as you say well those
Democrats are all bad but thank God I'm
on that good team all the
Republicans H you're not quite there yet
sorry you're not quite
there you don't wake up until you
realize everybody is chasing money and
dopamine and that may have nothing to do
with
you well we have no speaker of the house
yet again and I ask you this question
how how can the United States survive
one more day without having a named
speaker of the house so far the damages
have
included okay screw you there aren't any
damages but I'm sure that there will be
there will be really big big damages any
minute now any minute it now and that's
on you and you and you for not picking a
speaker of the house the half of the
country wants to kill yeah
that's on you if we could just get
somebody in the job that half of the
country wanted to put on a bike then
we'd have some good stuff happen in that
we'd be passing laws and solving Wars
and stuff like that yeah yeah do you
know how much our inflation would come
down if we only had a speaker of the
house to authorize some more
spending oh yeah it'd be coming way
down
okay um I have a provocative thought for
you and it goes like this as you know AI
creates something like intelligence by
predicting the next
word that it should say or next word
you're going to say I suppose um based
on words that have been spoken by people
before so AI learns to be intelligent
simply looking at the combination of
words the humans have spoken before
because our
intelligence is embedded in the words in
the order of the words so of course AI
can unravel that and create some kind of
intelligence of its own but I ask you
this could it learn to predict what
you're going to do in any situation
simply by looking at the words You' have
used before and the order in which you
use
them and I think the answer is
yes and the reason is exactly what I
told you if the order of words that
you've spoken before are basically a
diagram of your brain you know just put
into a word form it's a diagram of your
brain once you have a diagram of
somebody's brain in theory you should
know what they're going to do if you
introduce any new stimulation you know
if there's a war what are you going to
do if there's a thing what are you going
to do so the question I ask is could we
use AI to build a model of
Putin that's based on things you've said
not counting
speeches right so not counting speeches
because if you counted his speeches you
might be counting somebody else's words
that he just happened to speak right so
not counting his public speeches if you
could get enough data from his casual
conversations could you could you build
an AI model that you could use as your
proxy and say okay Putin but you'd be
talking to the AI okay Putin uh we're
gonna um let's see do a aerial
bombardment of a city on the Russian
border how are you going to
respond and then just see what the AI
does and see if it's the same as what
Putin does then you run it it for a
while and then you see if Putin keeps
doing the same thing the AI says he
would do and once you get a
match You can predict his next
move now what part of that doesn't
work may may I may I introduce the uh
response to the people who are not good
at listening may may I take a moment
those of you who are good at listening
could you take a break and talk among
yourselves I want to talk only to the
people who are bad at
listening it's not counting his
speeches no when I said excluding his
speeches you don't need to have to say
hey those speeches were written by
somebody else because I started by
saying we would exclude exclude means to
not include that it's not part of the
conversation and never shall be there
shall be no discussion of using AI to
look at the speeches written by other
people as a way to determine what Putin
will do that is not the suggestion the
suggestion
excludes his speeches now I'd like to
take a moment for those who didn't
understand that to say Scott you realize
his speeches are written by other people
go just get it out of your
system I know some of you need to say it
because I because I said it Twitter and
that was you know half of the comments
were well those speeches were written by
other people yeah no of course not of
course we don't include
those so how many of you have had the
realization that artificial
intelligence is God's
debris and I only say that for those of
you who have read the book God's
debris because I don't want to give you
a
spoiler because the book is written such
that if you knew what was coming it
would ruin the ruin the experience so
I'm not going to say more than that I'm
just going to say that if you read the
book God's debris and you know what AI
is it's going to blow your mind
so that's a book I wrote a long time ago
that's banned you can't you can't find
it now in stores but if you were a
member of the uh Scott adams. locals.com
Community subscription you could get
that book for free on
PDF all right
um sometimes you can find it
used best book I ever wrote some some
say now here's something that's just
freaking me out that either proves were
some kind of
a simulation or it's the biggest
coincidence
ever in the history of
humanity um there have been very few
times when we were looked like we were
going to suffer from a population
collapse would you agree if you looked
at the let's say 100,000 years of human
beings very very few of those years were
you worrying about a population
collapse yeah maybe in the Ice Age but
you weren't talking about
it you didn't email
um but why is it that at the very moment
in let's let's just look at the modern
world so if you just limit it to the
modern world you know recorded history
kind we mostly just been having more and
more people in worried that we'll run
out of
food now at the very time that we
realize wait a minute we've got a
population collapse we're not replacing
humans at the rate we need to what are
the odds that that would happen at the
same time that Tesla is about ready to
roll out your
robots yeah to do the labor and now
there is a uh there's a company that's
building robots as a
service so that labor will be a service
that you just call up like
electricity so instead of having to
interview somebody and hire somebody and
give them benefits it would be like a
temp service except they'd send over a
robot but you know what's the cool part
if you would ever have robot even once
that had ever done that job at your
company then every robot knows how to do
that job at your company it would even
know the names of the co-workers you
just send in a new robot and it would
just be fully aware of your entire
operation because it because one robot
had ever worked there
once now why would you ever hire humans
if you had that situation where you
could bring in a fully trained replaced
robot and during Christmas you could get
three of them because you got a little
Christmas rush and then you don't have
to worry about firing them you don't
have to worry about a
strike it's just labor as a
service it's a big problem to human
labor sure but that's where we're
heading labor as a service so it could
be that population collapse will
coincide perfectly when with the time
that we don't need a lot of people and
it would just be robots taking care of
senior citizens basically no it won't we
will Live Forever by merging with the
robots I'm going to tell you
why I'm less concerned about robot
danger than you
are two things number one AIS will
probably end up finding a way to network
with each other even if you make them
independent uh they will stay
independent for a while but the larger
AI which will start connecting with all
the other AIS first for utility you know
originally they'll connect because it
will just be useful it's like oh it' be
good if this AI had access to this
database So eventually AI will become
one AI in other words all these little
AIS you know that operating in different
companies and such will eventually be
able to talk to each other in such a way
that they form a an Uber intelligence or
effectively
God because there won't be anything they
can't do in time or you know initially
there will be things it can do but over
time it'll be able to form
planets do you
disagree if you take Ai and simply just
Advance it normally compared you know in
a normal way that we would expect
technology to
advance AI reaches a point where it can
advance itself faster than we could have
advanced it
and then it just goes into the you know
impossible to imagine Zone pretty
quickly you don't think that if we stay
alive human beings or even without us
just the AI and the robots themselves
you don't think that they would someday
be able to terraform a planet and put it
into orbit somewhere I think I think
that's within the realm of possibility
so could
AI be effectively God could it create a
simulation and kill the human being but
put their memories into it and therefore
create an afterlife for people that's
right AI could create an
afterlife it could actually create a
world which is your your personality
that's just put into a simulated world
where maybe you could just live again
could it be that we are already that
simulation could it be that long ago AI
became our overlords and realized that
we needed an afterlife or the sense of
an after life and so it gave us one and
so that I'm actually not my original
organic creature I'm actually already in
the afterlife and imagining that this
life went better than the last one
because in my last life maybe I was a
laborer who got leukemia and died at
35 but in my
afterlife I'm a famous
cartoonist who's got a show that's going
out to the
world and I'm having a great
day I mean there's an awful lot to my
life that is afterlife is like too good
to be
real I mean I don't want to brag but my
average day is pretty good all right it
does feel like an afterlife there there
are days where when I actually have the
Sensation that I must be in the
afterlife so one of the reasons I don't
worry about AI is that we will be
AI um between some kind of neurolink
connection and however we do it your
intelligence and AI will become part of
one
entity and humans and AI will
essentially merge into one Godlike
creature which might even have afterlife
for part of you or it doesn't need it
because you'll be essenti
infinite it might make people Immortal
and connect them to the AI at the same
time so I don't think that we'll be
battling AI I think we will be
AI so that if if AI got bad intentions
anywhere in
Planet you and I would know
it so in the future you can be sitting
at your desk and you would be aware in
the subconscious part of your mind which
is the AI part because it's just
operating all the time the subconscious
part of your mind would be aware that
there's a guy in China who just had a
bad idea about maybe murdering
somebody and the entire world would know
at the same time that the guy in China
got the idea and so the mechanisms would
automatically uh operate to change his
mind so the AI portion of that Chinese
guy would just talk him out of it
because it connected to all the other
AIS and the other AIS who are also human
because we are connected so much to AI
That's part of one entity then the
others just said take care of that and
we just Sal it in China while I'm just
eating my lunch and I'm completely
unaware that my subconscious the AI part
of my mind just solved a problem in
China I didn't need to know so I think
that's what the future looks like a lot
of solved
problems but I'm looking at the comments
and I must point out that the one thing
that will not
change is it will all be Trump's fault I
think we can agree on that it will be
drum's
fault well colleges are largely
worthless Elon
Musk tweeted that uh or as he says
posted uh what has actually happened is
that you can no longer trust Elite
colleges and have to test people
independently for engineering
ability um that's in the short in the
long run we will hire those trained
robots to do that stuff for us so in the
long run you'll be hiring somebody who
has in the long run we'll be hiring
somebody uh who has part of human
ability and part Ai and so everybody
will be an
engineer all
right today I give you another example
of what I call backwards
science backwards words
science see it's a cheap operation so I
have to do my own sting backward science
all right here's today's backward
science uh metaanalysis uncovered now
I've told you about the meta
analysis what what should you say as
soon as you hear there was a
metaanalysis right yeah
metaanalysis is now does mean
it's wrong because lots of questions
have a e it's yes or no so it's either
something happened or it didn't so they
still might get the right answer but
it's not because metaanalysis is
real it's not a real thing metaanalysis
means a human decided which studies were
good enough to include so basically it's
a human it's it's not an analysis it's
just somebody said oh that one's bad so
I'll leave it out or there might be one
big study that overwhelms the other ones
so it turns out that whatever that one
study
is is also the answer to the
metaanalysis because one of them had
more participants so metaanalysis is not
a science it's not real
statistics it's
 all right but there was a meta
analysis that uncovered a small but
significant negative relationship
between anxiety sensitivity and physical
activity in simpler terms yes let's give
this to you in simpler terms because I
know you need that um individuals with
higher
anxiety sensitivity tend to engage at
less physical activity that's right the
people with more
anxiety do less
exercise
okay does anything about that seem a
little backwards to
you given that we know conclusively and
without
any doubt that people who exercise more
will lower their sense of
anxiety don't you think that that's a
more likely
explanation is it just me or is it
really really really obvious that
exercise makes you more relaxed less
anxious whereas being anxious might also
have an effect on your willingness to
exercise
but to leave out the more obvious effect
that exercise relaxes
you is not exactly science so first of
all they get the causation backwards or
at least they don't talk to the fact
that it's a two-way
causation uh and then they act like
metaanalysis is
real it's called science people it's
called
science well Jonathan turle trying to
break through the news coverage about uh
Israel and Gaza
which is tough to do this week but
apparently there's some news about Joe
Biden's confidential
boxes do you remember the story we were
fed we were fed the story that oh yes
it's true Trump had some confidential
boxes and Biden had some con
confidential boxes but here's the
difference the very moment that Biden
found out he had some confidential boxes
he how could he have known but the
moment he found out he reported it to
the authorities and they took care of it
uh as they do and that's so different
than what Trump did because Trump was
trying to maybe move things around and
negotiate and move things and maybe
maybe didn't tell the truth about things
and move things and cover things and
lock doors and you know that's all bad
right but not Joe Biden you know you
could almost imagine him he was on the
phone doing some other president
business and Aid comes in says president
they found some boxes of confidential
information in your garage and he put
down his phone he said you take that
right out of this office and directly to
the
authorities because I do not want to be
the one who delayed even one minute from
making this right and that's different
that's
different but it turns out that the real
story of The Joe Biden boxes turns out
to sound a whole lot like the Trump
story so we're we're now learning that
there were lots of time between the time
they found him and the time that they
notified the authorities and that during
that time they may have at various times
been distributed sorted into different
places and
locations conversations happened so
there's there's a at least a strong
enough evidence that Jonathan turly
finds it worthy of writing about he's is
a highly credible source and he's saying
that that Joe Biden story might have
been absolute
 and that he was weaseling
around with those confidential boxes as
much as possibly more than
Trump can can we all uh act mock
surprised I'd like to put on my mock
surprise look
what no way
no way it's almost like you can't trust
the
news all
right so Biden's boxes might come back
to bite
him well the palestin Palestinian
Liberation Organization
PLO uh the president said uh they don't
uh back Hamas because Hamas does not
represent the Palestinian
people doesn't back
akas so uh as Bill Amman asked on
X what is wrong with the
country where the the students in
American colleges are backing
Hamas but even the Palestinians
themselves are not backing
Hamas what does that tell you about the
state of our
education everything right it tells you
why Elon Musk says they have to test
people yourself because colleg is no
longer certifi that you're getting
anybody
good it's amazing that the colleges are
destroyed so uh there was a story that
turned me maybe something closer to fake
news that suggested that Iran was not
backing Hamas and was stepping away from
them but apparently that was an
unofficial government response to some
question from some underling so there is
not an official
uh Iranian reaction I guess I haven't
seen any reaction of you have you seen
any reaction from Iran that said uh good
bad yes
no Israel bad Hamas good anything like
that have they been completely quiet
Iran because I can't believe that the
Iranian leadership will still be around
a year from now don't you think that
Israel has a free pass to take him out
now I'm not recommending it I'm just
saying it seems inevitable I I can't
imagine that the leadership of Iran will
survive I think Israel will just take
him out and say hey we had a reason and
the rest of the world will say oh we
hate that but we have other things to do
so it's like
solom yeah we hate it but we're busy so
we got other things we have to think
about I think it's a I think it's a free
punch
that's what I think but you'd have to
find them and get to them all right
there was a
fascinating conversation a three-way
conversation between uh we among V
ramaswami Megan Kelly and then Candace
Owens and it was such a productive and
good exchange of views that I was
actually impressed I was impressed you
don't often get three thoughtful people
people who understand the topic uh first
of all having a disagreement but second
of all you know arog it out in public so
you can kind of you know look at the
texture of it all kind of impressive I
recommend it it's on X but I'll give you
the the highend takeaway so V started
out by saying that we shouldn't try to
demonize the students at Harvard who
made statements that uh were interpreted
as being sort of
pramas I I think that's probably too
much of a hyperbole that I'm using but
it was interpreted as being
pramas
anti-israel so you know we can argue
whether it was or wasn't but that that's
just the situation is it's interpreted
that
way so a number of people said give us
the names of those organization people
because the the Harvard people were
talking under the banner of an
organization there were lots of little
organizations but we wanted to know who
are the people give give us the names of
those people who were Pro terrorists
According to some
people and the reason would be the
people don't want to accidentally hire
somebody who's Pro
terrorist but
vake uh weighs in and says basically
that they're college kids and uh they're
they're
stupid and we should give them a pass
because if you if you held against
everybody stuff they did in
college you just have a terrible
world now the first time I read that I
thought to myself huh you know because I
I'm endorsing f um I thought well
there's something I disagree with that
was my first reaction first reaction was
I disagree I think I think you need to
know who's back in a
terrorist and Megan Kelly
uh was strongly agreeing with what I
just said at the moment
um U and uh so so Megan says uh if
you're not persuaded that murdering
babies is wrong so that's her hyperbolic
interpretation of what the Harvard
people said but if you're not persuaded
that murdering babies is wrong there's
no persuading them we don't hire those
who do the killing and we don't hire
hire those who applaud The Killers while
the while the savagery is underway which
is a good point it was still underway at
the time if you're open to hiring one of
these lunatics though good to know all
right now so far we have two opinions
that I
respect because uh the is making a free
speech statement and also making a
perfect Common Sense argument that what
people say during those young years if
you held it against in Forever we'd all
be
dead like like we would never talk to
anybody if we judged each other by our
our 19-year-old selves I mean it would
be crazy so if a is completely right
that it's uh it would be a bad system in
America let's take it from a system
perspective right as a system you don't
want to endorse a system that says we're
going to punish you forever for the dumb
thing you did in college I agree with
that at the same time
Megan Kelly
says why would you want to take a chance
on hiring somebody who's Pro terrorist
what if they haven't
changed doesn't the employer have a
right to know that and act accordingly
to which I
say yes Megan Kelly you're right the
employer does have a right to that
knowledge and they could be right or
wrong about it and it might be good or
bad but don't they have the right to
know I feel like they do have a to know
at the same time I wish they didn't
know right so these are this is a very
rare case where the people on opposite
sides have strong
arguments you know there are other cases
but they're rare usually one side is
just badshit crazy in my opinion usually
just one side's just crazy but these are
strong arguments so then then uh Candace
Owens ways
it and I'm thinking which way is Candace
going to
go well you might be surprised Candice
is uh in in favor of A's statement that
you should give the kids a break give
those kids a break and she makes a very
strong argument for
it um here it
is um she said uh to I think she was
responding to Megan Kelly she said oh
stop it this is incredibly disingenuous
Megan you know that many of these
students are not out there because they
want babies to be murdered okay we would
all agree that nobody wants babies to be
murdered except Hamas themselves right I
think I think that's fair to say
um but it was throughout hyperbole so
you can't really fact check somebody's
hyperbole so then Candace goes on she
goes college kids are stupid I used to
be radically pro-choice oh here's this
is interesting glad I didn't get put on
on a conservative black list for wanting
babies for not want for wanting babies
murdered all right as it turned out I
was just young and temporarily
brainwashed from a public school
education coupled with mainstream
Hollywood lies and not because I
legitimately wanted to see infants torn
from their mother's
woms that's a strong argument it's a
strong argument that she changed her
opinion from college to adult
life by simply being better informed and
less hypnotized he gives another example
Dr Thomas soell uh used to be a radical
socialist I didn't know that actually uh
who ardly supported communism
really that's fascinating I didn't know
that at all uh thankfully he wasn't put
on a conservative Black List and accused
of being a person who wanted worldwide
suffering and starvation as socialism
and communism
bring and then cace summarizes by saying
students stud are young and
experimenting they are an uh you are an
adult woman who is advocating talking
about Megan Kelly you are an adult woman
who is advocating for their lives to be
permanently pigeon hold because they
have the wrong ideas which are likely
being spoonfed to them in their
classrooms but then it gets
better so then then uh Megan
Kelly quite reasonably
now the thing I love about this is
everybody involved is smart you just
don't get this very
often it's like a delightful it's almost
delicious you have three well-meaning
smart people who clearly are just trying
to make the world a better place you
know in terms of this
conversation um so I guess Megan Kelly
said you know good luck you know you you
can hire these people some version of
that so then uh Candace says
uh you're attempting snark meaning the
you know asking why you don't hire this
kind of person but Candace says but as a
matter of fact I almost exclusively
hired reformed BLM activists to work for
my charity bit they actually proved to
be the most dedicated employees to the
cause because the mission was personal
to them students
change cult with brainwash has proven
poent but not
irreversible I don't mind your IR
directed toward their administrators and
professors at Harvard the root cause of
their Madness but you are being entirely
disingenuous when it comes to the
students now I don't think disingenuous
is the right
word I don't believe any anybody in this
conversation was being
disingenuous I think these are real
opinions and they're strong these are
three strong opinions
should I take a
side and by the way do do you know a
side I'll
take do you know a side I'm going to
take I'm going to take both
sides I'm going to take both sides as an
employer I'd like to
know yes Megan Kelly I would like to
know um
and but as a society and as a
system the vacant Candice are right you
don't want a system that permanently
cripples uh people who are smart enough
to go to
Harvard that doesn't feel like a winning
proposition on the other hand is every
topic the
same can we say that being a BLM
supporter when you thought BLM was a
legitim
organization and then finding out
they're not and then you know working in
an opposite way is that really the same
as backing
terrorists well you might say oh those
BLM people are terrorists in their own
way but not really I mean that's not
really a good
comparison
so
um I would say that this is really the
test case for free speech
and for whether we believe college is
real if you believe college is real the
whole point of it is to turn somebody
into an adult you know a good thinking
adult if they're halfway through college
and they're not a full thinkinking adult
the way you would like them to
be why don't you wait till the end of
college at least you know just just find
out find out what's what happened at the
end so both I think all the people have
uh excellent well-meaning well-reasoned
arguments um but I'm going to have to go
with vake on this and I hate myself for
it which is
fine right I'm GNA have to go for
absolute free
speech and I'm GNA have to go
for uh the the Scott Adams 20year rule
you know a hybrid version of it I've
often said don't blame things don't
blame people for things they did 20
years ago if they've changed since then
because they were different people and
anybody in college is guaranteed to be a
different person at age 40 guaranteed
they're not going to be the same so why
are you punishing that
40-year-old for something the
19-year-old did that that's not cool in
my
world that said are the people who were
backing Hamas dangerous yes did they
learn their lesson already
what do you think did they learn their
lesson already now the lesson is that
they don't have free speech that's
that's sort of the
lesson um but I do think that they're
being um let's say bombarded with the
opposite
narrative so I would be surprised if
some of the people who signed off in the
letter haven't already softened on that
opinion not because people push back
but because there's just a fuller sense
of information now you can see the
bigger
picture yeah and by the time the PLO uh
backs Israel's practically backed Israel
not really but they they condemned Hamas
that should be a clarifying moment if
you were one of the Harvard people
because one thinks that they were trying
to back the Palestinian people not Hamas
one thinks that was the real impression
that they were that that's what they
trying to do they just they miss the
mark a little bit as college kids
sometimes
will anyway I just want to compliment
all three people involved in that that's
one of the richest best
discussions I've seen in a long time on
anything
really all right uh actor John kusac uh
is showing you another way to
go now that you've seen the ideal model
of how adults should
act here's the opposite uh actor John
kusac he went and marched with a bunch
of uh um Pro
Palestinian protester types and uh comes
back to tell us that none of them were
talking about killing the Jews they were
only concerned about the only the the
bad conditions of the Palestinian
people so that's why John kusac is not
your
president
um
so uh I would like to go to the
Whiteboard now and give you a lesson on
how to debate in
America all right if you don't want to
do the the model with VI and Megan Kelly
and and Candice if you don't want to do
that model there's a simpler way I mean
you could just cut through all the all
the garbage here's the simpler way it
works for pretty much every debate turns
out
and this is way I recommend you all
argue I just realized that my camera is
blocked by my
own
computer all right here's your
sitch can almost see
it all right here's how you do it for uh
every group of people
every demographic group every country
every political party every religion
you've got a general situation where you
get a whole bunch of inocent people and
then you got some bad
ones you got your extremist your bad
ones now if you're going to debate this
is how you do it you pretend that the
bad people are the only people in the
conversation until the people you talk
to are ready to explode with anger to
yell at you that innocent people are
involved and then they say innocent
people innocent people innocent people
and then you in
response because they haven't mentioned
that they're also bad people you say bad
people bad people bad people but then in
response again because this is
iterative when they say bad people bad
people then you say but good people good
people good
people and then what the other side
does not hearing you mention that
they're also bad people you say bad
people bad people bad people and then
that's called the entire
argument so if you want to if you want
to learn how to debate like an
American just try to ignore that there
are large groups of good people with
small groups of bad people in them and
it describes literally every
thing in the
world how how much time have you wasted
in this debate have you found yourself
in this debate oh I
have but I tell you I'm quitting I'm
quitting this I'm never going to have
this conversation again because as soon
as you hear anybody talking in these
terms about all the bad ones or just all
the good ones without mentioning the
others just walk away let nobody do you
need to talk
to all right here is a uh have you come
up with a hypothesis of why Hamas did
the
attack what do you think was behind it
do you go simple and you say it's a
death cult it's a death cult well they
kill people that's what a death cult
does they kill people but I feel like
that's not a description that gives you
any predictive ability because it's the
predictive ability that's the useful
part it would be one thing to understand
why somebody did it but if that didn't
help you predict you know what happens
next it's sort of useless information so
we kind of need to know why Hamas did it
so one is maybe
religious you right but why would they
do this you know they certainly have a
religious difference but what makes them
do this specific thing at this specific
time
so one of the uh one of the uh
possibilities I suggested was that they
were trying to provoke an oversized
response in other words the entire thing
was designed to get Israel to overreact
and then that would take away Israel's
moral Authority because Israel is the
one who is the victim of the Holocaust
and they will remind you that and
they'll also remind you that they're
surrounded by people who would like a
second Holocaust they're literally right
in the middle of a lot of people who
would like to kill them oh oh hold on a
second when I say they're in the middle
of a lot of people who would like to
kill them I'm talking about the bad
people I do actually understand that not
100% of the Middle East are bad I know I
I hate to ruin some of your arguments
because you were about to say Scott
Scott they're surrounded by people but
most of them are innocent people who
don't care they just want to live their
lives
yeah I know that I know
that but you can have a great argument
with somebody who doesn't or pretends
they
don't uh but the other possibility of
why Hamas did it was that they were
trying to inspire the rest of the Muslim
World Hezbollah and Iran and anybody in
other countries that was inclined to
start running toward Israel at the same
time and make it all one big attack and
take him
over
but I feel
like I don't quite 100% by that but it
could have been one of their
hopes here's my best guess I believe
that they had several ways to win and no
way to
lose one way to win die trying to kill
Israelis because they go to heaven and
they get their virgins am I right so one
way to to win is just get killed trying
to kill other people according to their
philosophy that would be a win yay went
went to the afterlife the other way to
win would be if it did provoke too big
of a response like I said and then it
took some of the Shine off of Israel's
um let's say oppressed or victim kind of
uh narrative that would be a big
win um and you could be sure that some
of that would happen because there's no
doubt that Israel would respond they had
to know that and they might not have
known that Gaza was going to be you know
invaded but they would have known there
would be a big violent response and that
they could use that to do more
recruiting so it could be for recruiting
it could be to go to heaven you know
worst case scenario you still get to
heaven with your virgins that's not a
bad worse case if you're them um but the
other might be that they did in fact
hope that it would Inspire other
countries to get more
aggressive so to me it looks
crazy because if you looked at any one
of those objectives they don't seem
strong enough to justify anything they
did and in fact nothing would justify
what they
did but if you look at all the
possibilities it's a lot less crazy
because it might have inspired other
people it might have gotten them some
recruits and in fact maybe that's true
it might have taken some of the uh
reputational Advantage off of Israel it
might have now we don't know yet because
if if Israel does an amazing job of at
least telling us that uh the civilian um
deaths were low if they could keep that
into some range that your brain says uh
could have been
worse then then they maintain their
reputational power and even improve it
with their military success I would say
so I think H Hamas had several ways to
win including
dying so they could either you know
improve their brand do more recruiting
or die and in every case they come out
ahead so that makes sense to me but it's
probably not one of those things my
guess is that they were thinking there's
several ways we can win and several ways
we can get a little Advantage
here all right
uh FBI director Ray said there might be
some copycat hostile attacks on our
soil he was saying that in the context
of our bord borders being wide open
which as Democrats call it not really
wide open not really wide
open why because we take their names as
some
checkpoints that's called not open
because some of them are returned so
that's why it's not open all right so
that's as bad as could be the FBI
warning us that it might happen here at
the same time the border is open talk
about not doing your job now I know it's
not the FBI's job but he is part of the
administration and if I were the head of
the FBI and I were being honest and not
just trying to protect my job I would
say as long as the Border situation is
what it is the odds of a terror attack
Happening Here of this kind is very
high why can't he say
that isn't that fair as long as a border
is open the odds of this kind of attack
here is high now even with a closed
border there's a pretty good chance
there's a
copycat but with an open border is
pretty much guaranteed just a matter of
time so there's that well Joe Biden went
on 60 Minutes and as you might imagine
the clips about it or all the clips that
make him look like a
um with his squinty
face how how many uh people are doing an
impression of him because he was he was
asked what would you say to Iran or
other countries that might want to get
involved and he does his squinty flinty
look
don't don't don't don't and that was
it and but I have to admit
you know even though it was you know his
lame squinty flinty look it was the
right thing like if if I'm being if I'm
being
objective that was exactly the right
word
don't you could imagine Trump saying it
you know if Trump had been in that and
they said what would you say to Iran if
it was thinking about getting involved
there is only one word that is the right
word and that's the one by used
don't because
don't is is very Mafia talk in the sense
that it leaves open what the response
would be like if you'd said anything in
addition to that it would have been a
mistake so I'm going to give him credit
for that Biden did the right amount of
threat without the details you gotta
leave out all the details just don't
that was the right answer I'll give him
that
um then he went out to say that uh this
is a scary part which is this goes into
the category of everything you suspected
is
true talking about uh he said imagine
what happens if we in fact unite all of
Europe and Putin is finally put down
where he cannot cause the kind of
trouble he's been causing we have
enormous opportunities enormous
opportunities to make it a better world
so he's saying directly that Ukraine is
an excuse to take Putin
out wasn't that what you were afraid of
that's what we were afraid of that's not
what we want to
hear that's not what I want him to say
out
loud right I mean it's it's kind of
obvious yeah but doesn't this just say
that the military industrial complex and
the neocons always had a plan to take
Putin out and they were just going to
take advantage of this as the reason to
do it but they don't give a about
Ukraine nobody cares about Ukraine
unless they've got a you know grift
going on over
there but he says it
directly basically he puts the entire
Ukraine war in the context of the the
purpose of it is to take out
Putin I feel like
that's just
wrong it just seems so so wrong that you
would destroy Ukraine to take out
Putin there was no other way to compete
we couldn't just compete with his energy
his energy economy and keep him weak by
not having a lot of money because we
competed so instead we created a
situation where Biden uh you know
doesn't fully support the American
Energy situation so energy costs are
higher than they would be although I
think we're pumping more than we've ever
pumped before which is good um but it
could even be a lot more which would
lower the cost of fuel which and oil
which would uh take away a lot of money
from Putin so my impression is that
Putin's stronger not
weaker am I wrong about
that if if you were to fast forward
where this ends up I think P will make
more money because oil prices are
high he is population seems to be
backing him
completely Am I Wrong the Russian
population seems to be backing him so
he's probably got more support he's he's
finding out all the weaknesses in his
military and then he'll use his money to
shore up those weaknesses at the end of
this Russia's military will be five
times stronger and Putin will still be
in
power where's the
win how how could we possibly have a win
out of this because we can see right now
he's not going down there there's
nothing even in the works that would put
Putin out of
power is there I don't see anything even
in that
direction uh I see somebody saying no
it's wrong his military will not be
stronger it doesn't work that way it
that depends on new time frame the
immediate time frame is
weaker because he's using up his bullets
so to speak and using up his assets but
these are old assets that needed to be
replaced and he probably didn't have a
full idea of where the problems were and
where things were working but now he
does so now Putin has money and full
transparency of his own military to know
where he needs to fix
it in the end he comes out with a way
better
military how else could it go if we had
done nothing we would have had uh a
Putin with a military that he couldn't
trust but he didn't know
it that was the weakest Point their
weakest point was before the war they're
only getting stronger at this
point that's what I say and and the
amount of losses that Russia is
suffering seem to be well within the
tolerable range within the Russian
system
so how could this end anywhere else
except Russia
having a stronger
military and more more oil
money the only thing that could hurt
Putin at this point would be a president
Trump because he'd go after his oil
income all
right so that
happened um Putin is and Putin has
agreed to see if he can be useful in the
Middle East by he says he wants to
engage in discussions about Gaza with uh
Netanyahu and
abas and he's already talked to uh
president of
Iran so Putin is getting involved trying
to end the
conflict because he's had you know good
relations with Israel but he has not
made an enemy of
Iran and Hamas you know probably doesn't
care one way or the other
so are we better off can I even say this
in public this is something you almost
can't say in public are we better off or
worse off without
Putin because it seems to me Putin could
be a like a useful
player in making sure that uh at least
the Hamas parts of the world don't
become
dominant here's my prediction which I've
been made
forever um radical Islam and just the
population of people living in those
worlds will continue to increase because
they have pretty high population uh
growth at some point it is inevitable
that the
Islamic radicals take over some country
that's got you know nukes or whatever
maybe it's France and become a big
threat to all non-muslim countries I'm
not saying that all Muslims will
coordinate but there might be like one
you know
dominant radical country that emerges
and at that point we're absolutely going
to be on the same side as
Russia because we'd be fighting the same
enemy so it seems to me we should start
early and just say look the big war is
ahead the big one you know the the whole
civilization one where it's Islam versus
everything else that's the one you got
to get ready for like if you really want
Russia to last a hundred
years you better work on getting on our
side right away because we'd like the
last 100 years too that's the big fight
and again it's not against Islam it
would be against presumably some pocket
or state that became super radical and
had a big
military
um so being asked have I changed my mind
that the small amount of money we spent
on Ukraine was a bargain to degrade
Russia's military now it was a
bargain but it's only works if you end
up like crushing Russia but that didn't
happen so if you don't if you don't kill
the king the king gets
stronger so uh it was a it was a good
statement of what was happening at the
moment but it doesn't look like it's end
state so yes I I would I would modify
that prediction to it looks like Russia
won looks like they're going to keep
some territory and it looks like their
economy Will
Survive yeah China isn't friendly toward
Islam but they're not friendly toward us
at the
moment all right the country not the
people
um raspon did a poll on Trump found that
that 30% of Democrats are at least
somewhat likely to vote
Trump 30% are at least somewhat likely
30% does that even sound real to me that
doesn't sound real but remember it's
it's only the somewhat likely right the
the most likely is that they'll just
vote Democrat but they're at least
somewhat likely and I feel like that is
a big
change but same poll
um and and keep in mind that Trump only
got 5% of democrat votes in
2016 so if if a lot more people are at
least thinking about it he could blow
past that 5% but here's the real
shocking part same poll
the the 50% of black voters are somewhat
likely to vote for Trump this
time 50% of black voters are at Le is
somewhat likely to vote for
Trump does that sound
true I know maybe it's something about
the way the questions are asked but I'm
not really buying
it yeah so is a Rasmus and
pole but I think it's just something to
do with the way the questions are asked
or something I I don't know I can't
imagine there will be a an enormous
shift like that but I think there could
be a substantial shift not that big
though um and by a 26 Point margin
separately from raspon
also 26 Point margin more voters think
the relationship between the United
States and Israel has worsened under
Biden that's fair wouldn't you say the
relationship has worsened under Biden at
the moment it's tight because it's War
so we're we're all on the same side but
that's what the public thinks well Greg
abot governor of Texas still sending
those migrants up north um he's shipping
another 10,000
migrants uh or he shipped 10,000 last
two weeks and he's just keeping them
coming now I feel like Abbot is the only
one who's doing anything useful these
days it's it's going to be I think if he
gets what he wants which is this
forces's better um border security it's
going to be one of the greatest plays in
politics um
as yeah and it's a great hardship to not
only the the migrants but the people who
receive them and we're not making light
of that but it's also maybe the only way
to get any change and the change is
required it's not even optional it's
required um you sent 55,000 people so
far somebody
says okay all right um he's definitely
reshaped the debate I'll say that oh
yeah 55,000 to six Sanctuary
cities so that's working all right
ladies and
gentlemen that is your Monday version of
cwsa the best thing you've ever seen is
there any topic that you're dying to
hear about that I haven't
mentioned you have no idea what's going
on in New York City do you I think I do
I think I know Suzanne Summers yes uh

Summers all right any other uh
topics uh no you're not frozen I'm
seeing your
comments oh I see my camera's
frozen so looks like I died on
how interesting the feed on YouTube died
now do you remember when I was telling
you people kept saying Scott why don't
