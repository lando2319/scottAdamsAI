and watch me pause another moment
until the youtube feed catches up
because it clips off the first part here
and
now
all right
good morning everybody and welcome
to the best thing that's ever happened
to anybody ever wear it ever everywhere
let's make that a word
you've heard of anywhere you've heard of
nowhere but
introducing today a new word called
everywhere
wait
i don't know what the hell i'm talking
about today you think i'm stoned
you think so
but i'm not
maybe i should be
because something's not working this
morning
um everywhere yes everywhere
correct everywhere is the new word thank
you
thank you in the comments
you know
have you realized that what we've
created here collectively
is like a new kind of intelligence
think about it
because
your old kind of intelligence was just
stuff happening in your head in the old
days
and then you got you know a smartphone
or a computer and your intelligence was
a little off-loaded but you had to do
some work you know you had to go search
for stuff
but
we've created with this model here with
the live stream and the instant comments
we've created a situation where i simply
think
i i need to know something
i say it out loud or even sometimes i
don't say it
and then the new information appears for
me on the screen
because many of you are anticipating
or correcting me as i go
so my my brain is actually
now extended to those of you who are
watching live and commented live
the system is almost instant now
it's kind of weird i mean you could
argue that this is a form of
intelligence because i don't think i've
ever seen this before
if if i give a speech in a
let's say a crowded room
you know people can make comments but
not in any efficient way
that's just me talking
and if this were recorded of course it
would just be me talking those of you
watch it later
but when it's live
there there is actually a
collective intelligence that is
literally happening you know it's uh it
makes me
like amplified in a way
but
what is more important than the
simultaneous step yes
dennis dennis reminds me
that we should be doing more sipping and
less talking
and i think that's fine advice and i'm
going to take it all you need is a cuppa
mug or a glass of tanker chelsea stein a
canteen jogger flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day
yeah the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous sip
and let's go brandon let's sip this baby
go
oh yeah
i think we sipped the hell out of that
you know sometimes you're just sipping
along the edges
you know bury your bro you're almost a
spectator to your own sip
but not today i think we went deep today
there was some serious sippage
penetration
into the deeper deeper meaning of life
yeah that just happened
what else happened
well netflix has a big hit
with a show
called squid games not only did 100
million people 111 million people at
least sample it which is a new record
but
i don't know why
i don't think i've ever seen
a trailer for a movie
that made me or a series
that made me
less want to watch it
so here's
here's seriously
here's actual advertisement this is how
they're trying to sell you
to watch squid games netflix
it's about a bunch of people who are
badly in debt
either in desperate times they're badly
in debt
and they're somehow collected together
to play some deadly game where
them die i guess
now
good times
if any of you are feeling bad about
yourself or your
your situation
i can't think of a more entertaining
thing than to watch
people in desperate financial trouble
playing a deadly game because it's the
best chance they have
um
don't watch this show
don't watch this show
now i get that you might enjoy it
while it's happening but how could that
possibly be good for you
compare these two uses of time
one hour a day trying to meditate
which i'll talk about in a moment
meditate for one hour a day
or watch a show about people in
desperate financial problems who are in
great physical risk and many of them
dying
for fun
which one of those would help your life
a little bit more
well i would like to refer back to
naval ravikant who is a big proponent of
meditating
and let me just give you an alternative
because i like it when some percentage
of my listeners
go away with a better life
i can't get you all every time right so
i'll pick off a little
little sliver of the viewers every time
make your life better
here's where some of you will get a
better life right now
listen
you might want to google him but look
for naval n-a-v-a-l
ravikant
and
read what you can about i think he's
been interviewed a number of times but
on podcasts about
meditation
now the big thing that he brings to the
meditation
conversation
is he tells you don't bother trying to
clear your mind
that's that's the dumb part
i mean the dumb part of meditating is
when they tell you
clear your mind
that's not a thing
who the hell
is teaching you to meditate by clearing
your mind
the only way you can clear your mind is
by being dead
it's not a thing
so
so there's this like illusion
that's kept i don't know
seven billion people from meditating
it's the same illusion the illusion is
that the point of it is to stop thinking
and people think well that's not going
to happen
i can't make that happen and if they try
they realize quite quickly they can't
make that happen
so what is the great innovation that
naval brings to this
that it was always an illusion that you
needed to stop your mind from thinking
it was never possible
it was never a thing
and it was never even desirable or
necessary
the important part is to sit quietly for
an hour a day
and let your mind do what it wants to do
for an hour
that's it you just let it play
just stay awake
sit comfortably
do it as a habit don't you know don't
skip days
just every day
sit there for an hour and let your mind
play
the
the belief the allegation the
the uh let's see
the proposition if you will
is that that will fundamentally change
your entire mental outlook in a positive
way
now
i i have you know great faith in neval's
opinion and recommendations
have i tried this technique
nope
because i don't know how i would get an
hour a day to sit there
i guess that's the hard part
if you can figure out
how to
any way
to fit an hour a day of unmolested
time if you can figure out how to find
an hour a day to do that
good luck
that's the hard part
so forget the squid games uh even if
it's entertaining it's gonna put bad
thoughts in your head you don't need
that
instead spend that same time one hour a
day trying to meditate
about one percent of you your lives just
changed isn't that cool
i mean most of you you know you're gonna
do what you were gonna do and this made
no difference whatsoever but about one
percent of you
your whole life just changed
seriously
about one percent of you your whole life
just changed because that's about how
many people are saying you know
i i might be able to
find an hour
i'll give it a try
and try it for about two months
if you haven't tried it for two months
you haven't tried it all right that's
the other technique so this is
so the thing that naval brings to this
is the simplification
and the removal of the illusion
that's a big deal
if that seems like a small deal
it's not it's a big deal
you got rid of the illusion that you
have to clear your mind you're now
you're free of that
uh and he's he's described it in a way
that you can't do it wrong
do it an hour a day for a couple months
see what happens that's it
that's it everybody can do that if they
have an hour
all right
um the most important story in the
country and i think you'll agree is that
there was an elk
that sometime in his early life got his
head stuck in a tire
so had a tire around his neck for
however many years it had been observed
for a long time
but finally i guess they tranquilized it
and cut off its horns and got the tire
off now you might say to yourself
that was the way to get the tire off
you had to remove the elk's horns
that
you couldn't think of another way
to remove a tire from the neck
i'm just going to brainstorm here for a
moment
cut the tire
i don't know did they think of that one
got the tire
i mean maybe they didn't have the right
tools or something
there may have been some practical
reasons
now
just for full context i'm told that the
antlers fall off once a year anyway
so the the elk would not be damaged by
the removal of the the horns because
they just grow back next season i'm told
i think that's true
but
still
still
is it just sort of messed up
don't those those horns have some
purpose
like to
protect them in a fight with another elk
that does have his horns
i mean i feel like
it was just a messed up thing to do
and why do they go into this project not
having a tool that can cut a tire
i mean i feel like they should have
brought a a tire cutting tool to the
project i mean they had some planning it
wasn't like off the cuff hey let's drank
an elk and see what happens
but the most important thing about this
story is the puns that's right
uh the worst part for this poor elk when
he had that tire around his neck is that
the other the other elk would tease him
yeah it was almost sort of a rudolph
situation
rudolph the red nose reindeer the other
reindeer would tease him
well you know how it went for the elk
the other rain the other elk teased them
they say stuff like
hey carl
you look tired
that's just messed up
they're bullies really is what i'm
saying
yeah they'd say stuff like
hey carl
did you have a good year was it a good
year
that's just messed up
you you shouldn't say something like
that to an elk who's having a tough time
with a tire around his neck
and then of course you know there was no
inner tube in the tire
which means that this elk had no problem
with inflation
no problem with inflation see that's not
funny
this this is just bullies elks making
fun of another elk i don't approve of
this bullying um and then somebody
suggested that uh he may have
voluntarily been wearing that
tire because
wait for it
he's had it for years
and his antlers fall off
every season
now the tire was not stuck on the neck
it was sort of loose fitting
and his antlers would fall off every
year
what would happen when the antlers fell
off
and the elk bent down to eat some food
it's almost as if the tire would fall
off
like maybe he liked it
like maybe
he was wearing it like a crown
because he was the king of the elks
and we just ripped him his crown off
i didn't make that one up somebody said
that on twitter
but i liked it it could have been an elk
crown we may have changed the entire
royal family situation for that elk
group
yeah
well maybe enough about that story
let's uh take a look at this story
remember i ran through the uh
the fake news filter which you can find
on my
twitter feed i tweeted it out so it's a
checklist to see if something is fake
news and i ran the pilot sick out story
through there
and what do you think
do you think it's true
that pilots are
calling in sick or taking personal days
and that's the reason
the southwest has slow flights
well
it is not being reported by
either fox news or cnn
to be true
somebody fact check me on that
i need to fact check but i think
because i'm saying i didn't see it so
maybe i missed it but i don't think that
cnn or fox news are confirming
that southwest had a problem because of
the coveted mandate
the tucker is an opinion guy the opinion
guys
are not relevant to this
truth filter because the opinion people
are opinion people i'm talking about the
news
right
um
and cnn reports it uh basically as a
false claim they just report that
gensake says
that it's not true
but also according to the ap news they
looked into it
and here's what the ap says
they say the airline this being
southwest its pilots
and the federal aviation administration
denied the claim
circulating online that the so-called
mass account was over the mandate
so the federal aviation administration
the pilots i don't know how many they
talked to
and the airlines have all denied it so
basically everybody who's close to it
denies it
but there are pilots who say it's true
right
haven't you seen that online you've seen
individual pilots say oh yeah it's
totally true
and when you see that do you see the
pilot saying it
no you see somebody saying they talked
to a pilot who said it
i haven't seen a pilot say have you i've
seen people say they know a pilot
i know a pilot and the pilot said it
but i haven't seen a pilot say it
so
do the pilots believe it
now i would definitely believe
there are some pilots who believe it's
happening
why would they believe it's happening
they saw it online
they saw it online same as you did so
they believe it's happening i mean if
you were just one pilot you knew a few
other pilots you would only know what
you thought but if you read online that
a bunch of pilots at southwest are doing
this you know fake
sick out thing
or personal day thing you'd probably
think it was true too
so that would be your interpretation
even if you thought it was some other
reason before that
all right i'm going to call that fake
news preliminarily doesn't mean it's
guaranteed to be fake news it does mean
that uh the odds are against it being
true
all right um and by the way i'm going to
go back to
let me ask you this
i'm often asked this question
how do you know if somebody's lying
how do you know to trust somebody just
like an individual i'm not talking about
organizations or fake news but just an
individual
how do you know if they're lying
and the answer is you can't
most of the time most of the time you
can't tell sometimes you can but most
time you can't tell here's what you can
know
the only thing you can know for sure and
even that's you know not 100
is that people will be the same people
they were yesterday
if somebody was a giant liar yesterday
well probably today too
if they were always honest every day of
their life up till yesterday
probably that last thing they told you
is true too or at least they think it's
true
right
so you can depend on people being like
the way they've been before do we have
any history that southwest airlines
is a gigantic liar
such a big liar
that they would lie in a way that they
could easily be discovered
really
southwest airline
they have one of the best employee
reputations of any company in the united
states
year after year after year they're in
the top rung
of
somewhat trusted well-managed
straightforward companies
do you think they suddenly became
gigantic liars and such liars
that they're telling a lie that's easily
discovered because it would be
literally what tens of thousands of
witnesses that they lied it would be all
the pilots
because the pilots would say oh my god
if they're lying
my company's lying
would they do that
it doesn't make sense to me that anybody
would tell a lie a corporate corporate
entity would tell a lie that's so easily
discovered as a lie
that would be crazy
i don't think southwest changed
overnight
from a company that we trusted relative
to companies right it's still a company
uh to a company we trusted to one we
totally wouldn't trust overnight
i don't think that happened it could
have i mean anything's possible but that
would be really unusual so i'm going to
say it's fake news until something
changes my mind
all right here's another story
see if you believe this one
a biological male in a skirt assaulted a
student in a bathroom
in virginia so a female student
was uh allegedly so we're using the word
allegedly in these stories sexually
assaulted by a biological male male
wearing a skirt
in a restroom at school
or false
run it through the fake news filter
which of the checklist
fits this
uh which of the
you got it two on the nose
two on the nose
what story
did you most
not expect but fear if you were
conservative
if you're a conservative
and you're sort of worked up about you
know the trans issue let's say you're
not as pro-trans as
as a woke person should be
if that's what you are already worried
about
what kind of story would play perfectly
into your bias
the story of a biological boy
putting on a dress
for the purpose of going into a
woman's facility locker room or bathroom
for a sexual assault
that story
is exactly
exactly on the nose
for what people feared
the slippery slope
i mean people who were drawing this
direct slippery slope line okay if you
allow this
the next thing you know they're going to
be assaulting people in the restrooms
slippery slope well there it is there it
is proof
there it is somebody put on a dress
just to assault somebody in a restroom
i'm seeing a lot of people saying it's
true
why do you say it's true
do you say it's true because it was on
the news
or do you say true because they're
the father of the alleged victim says
it's true
and the
victim alleged victim says it's true
the police report the police report says
it's true so you believe it because it's
in the police report where did the
police get their report from did they
watch it
did they watch it happen
or did somebody tell them it happened
everything you know about this is
somebody told you
you didn't see it
you weren't there
and the people who told you
how much do you trust them well we don't
know anything about the alleged victim
if if you told me the alleged victim had
never told the lie
i would say she's never told a lie
before
do you know that
has the alleged victim ever made a false
accusation before
has the alleged victim ever told a big
whopper of a lie
i don't know and i'm not alleging that
there's anything
up with the victim i'm just saying we
don't know
the the attacker did it twice
same way
wearing a dress
now here's what i do believe
i do believe it's likely there was an
assault
i don't believe the assailant was
wearing a dress
do you
if somebody says somebody got sexually
assaulted i'd go well probably because
it happens all the time unfortunately
but
somebody says this fits your bias
does it
am am i the one with the bias because
i'm saying that unusual things don't
happen very often
is that a bias
that unusual things
don't happen for that's almost just the
definition of unusual things
somebody says a scottish kilt
doubt it
all right let me ask you this
imagine you're this kid you've got bad
intentions and you're thinking to
yourself i think i want to assault
somebody
would you put on a dress to do it
would that be your plan
i think i'll put on a dress nobody will
even know i'm a man
and i'll walk into that restroom and
i'll all be doing some assaulting
or do you think it was a genuine trans
person
who was identifying as female
but still wanted to do some raping
of of a woman
with
male equipment
i don't know
none of it none of it checks out does it
so i'm gonna go on record okay so this
will be a test of the fake news filter
so
as far as i know i'm the only one saying
this
can can anybody
can anybody uh confirm
that there's nobody else that you know
of at least nobody
who's got a show
is there anybody else saying that this
is almost certainly fake news
not the assault
i'm not questioning that an assault
happened i'm questioning that it was
a boy dressed as a female so he could
use the ladies room that part
no
yeah on the skirt detail i think is fake
news
let me ask you this
how many of you have done a uh
a kid pickup
at school
took your car there picked up a kit
you see hordes hordes of kids walking by
lots and lots of kids
how many of the girls are wearing skirts
how many of the girls
are wearing skirts
none
none
the girls aren't even wearing skirts
so he's going to wear a disguise as a
girl
or whatever it was and he's going to
dress in the most ridiculous way
ridiculous in the sense it would be
non-standard even for the the females
right
no
none of this story makes sense
it doesn't
maybe he had a you know a sweater
wrapped around his waist and it looked
like a skirt i don't know i don't know
what happened but
i don't believe any of the story and i'm
going to go on record saying it's
probably fake news and you're probably
going to find out now given that i'm the
only person in the country saying it
right i think i'm the only person saying
it
just like i doubted the you know the
havana syndrome secret sonic weapon only
person in the world saying it
so
that's a good challenge isn't it good
test to the filter i'm the only one
saying
so if the filter works it will it will
have caught this one and if this turns
out to be real
well then we have to revise the filter
right
all right
suddenly you saw this in the news that
suddenly a whole bunch of countries
are real serious about nuclear the
united states being one of them biden
administration has gone strong on
nuclear which i credit it with
but also france has decided instead of
phasing them out they're going to go
hard
great britain and several other
countries have lobbied
to have nuclear power labeled as green
technology
or zero carbon i guess or green i don't
know whatever green technology i guess
to which i said to myself what
are you telling me there's any official
body
that didn't already include nuclear
energy as green technology
did you know that wasn't already a thing
i just assumed they thought that
because it is
it doesn't produce
you know i mean it's it's probably the
best green technology of all
i had no idea that it wasn't considered
green i thought they didn't want it for
maybe other reasons
but i didn't think it was because it
wasn't green
how wrong could they be but now they say
it's green as of course
so what changed
let me ask you
what what made everything change
like over it seems like overnight
doesn't it
we went from i don't know
to
somebody says the science changed
somebody says that the generation four
but we haven't built a generation four
yet there are no operating generation
four
uh somebody said covet
change things
uh the wind didn't blow right so the the
green technology didn't
didn't do its thing the space race
uh so
some say it's me but i don't think
that's the full story
um
bill gates
no not trump i don't think trump had
anything to do with it you should have
and i i fault him for that
mike schellenberger yeah
mark schneider so i'm not sure it was
one thing it could be that a whole bunch
of things happen but here here are some
of the things that happened
to make it look like there was an
overnight change
the number one thing i have thing that
happened
was the trigger
the trigger
is the the brownouts and the blackouts
and you know china having to fire up
their coal plants so all over the world
now the stories are that uh the classic
green energies didn't work
so we know that just solar and you know
adding solar and uh
and wind power can be awesome
but it doesn't cover you if you need a
you know if you need a little surge
so
so the first thing is that we had
triggers that happened about the same
time all over the world where it was
proven that the way we were doing it
wasn't working the second thing is that
the media
has decided that climate change will be
another focus it's been a focus in the
past
but
you know it's it is a focus
someone also mentioned space
right space is very much on our mind now
because of all the flights going up
uh i guess shatner's going up there
today or something 90 years old so when
you're talking about space you have to
think nuclear
and i think every country is realizing
that if they don't have a
uh in a
domestic nuclear
skill set
that they're not going to be part of
space
it's just a it's a base requirement as
far as we know
for getting into space and being
productive up there
so there's that so you've got a bunch of
things that sort of coincidentally
happened
but i think there's something else
happening that the argument against it
was slowly chipped away
by i'm gonna call it reframing
reframing so
um as you mentioned mike mike
schellenberger i think one of the
biggest effects here
um mark schneider also very influential
uh to me and you know through me to
other people etc
so there definitely was a more
productive communication and reframing
that happened
meaning that um
the idea of the newer generations being
safer
i think that message finally got through
yeah nuclear the old kind
had some problems
but even even then it was safer than
everything else
even the old kind with his problems the
meltdowns et cetera the fukushima's the
et cetera
even all of that was still safer than
all of the
you know other alternatives
and but now we have the newer
technologies the generation three that
this kind you would build if you built
one today has never had a a problem
they figured out how to do it safe
enough and the generation after that
would be
so safe that it won't be an issue after
that and the generation after also will
eat the existing waste
as part of its fuel
so we we have a technical solution
coming online
for the waste
solution number one is you store it at
the facility that created it because
it's already a nuclear risk if you will
and that's been working
and then the fact that we might be able
to eat that waste with new generations
of plants that looks pretty good
so i think i think that
there was a whole bunch of persuasion by
all the right people
to finally get the message to congress
and
you know i think other countries were
having the same realizations so i think
it was a whole bunch of things happening
at the same time
but essential to it is that it got
framed correctly for the first time
if you were thinking of nuclear as safe
or unsafe
that was the wrong frame
it got changed to
climate change solution or don't solve
it
that's a big difference
because once the left had decided that
climate change was their big existential
risk
it was over
you could you could then you know see
the future
as soon as they had said it's our
existential risk they didn't have any
other solution
there was only one solution
once you said this is this could end you
know civilization and you're all afraid
of it it had to go this way all the time
you do it just had to be greased
so the people like you know sheldon
berger
you know greasing it
and
mark schneider and you know i tried to
help and i know a lot of you who are
even watching this would retweet us and
you know boost the message
so i would say
that this is yet another example of the
the social media effect
being productive
because i think that smart people you
know got to people who were influential
in terms of persuasion influential
people like me
and between the
the technical know-how
and the reframing
it made it safe
for politicians to say hey
now we're thinking about climate change
and we love science because they already
said the left said we love science
and they were denying science like mofos
you know if they were against nuclear
they were just denying science because
we knew it was the safe alternative
relative to the other risks
so
so that's all good but it's interesting
to watch it all come together at the
right time
i think the lights had to actually turn
off before we got serious about it but
that happened
um i did a little research
on
i try to try to figure out where ideas
come from
especially ones that i'm involved in and
here's a i'm going to give you a uh
a little history of this idea the the
idea of using small habits
changing a small thing to get some
incentive or get some
get some momentum going to get something
done
um
there was a book in 20 2012 a book by
charles duhigg
the power of habits giant bestseller
and the power of habits talked about how
to how to change your habits or modify
your habits to to get what you want now
i don't remember it talking about small
changes maybe it was in there i'm not
sure
now uh here's something you don't know
that the author of that book spent a
full day with me
so charles dewey came to my home and
just spent the day with me
interviewing me about the things he
thought would be irrelevant to his book
now i didn't make it into the book
so i don't think there well i know that
there's no mention of me in the book but
he just spent a day with me um
sussing out my habits for success
because i've been talking about and
blogging about them
in october of 2013
now if you're an author you know that
it takes over a year to write a book and
get it published
so when when he was talking to me was
about the time i was putting together my
book had failed almost everything and
still went big and there i talked about
micro steps
taking the smallest step and getting
some momentum going
so that was 2013 all right so power of
habits duhigg was 2012
roughly the same time and he interviewed
me roughly the same time
how the fail came out talked about
microsteps
and then this is what i found out today
uh on december
just a few months after that
an e-book came out now you can do an
e-book pretty quickly because you don't
have to wait for the whole printing
publishing cycle
and just a few months after my book came
out
uh stephen geiss
published many habits
which is this concept you're getting a
little habit going to to move you in the
right direction
so that was just a few months later
and then after many habits came micro
habits
by brian ledger
and then came
he was in 2015 i think that was an
e-book too and then came small habits
big changes how the tiniest steps lead
to happier health of you steve handel in
2018
and then atomic habits
october 2018.
uh now these were obviously being
written about the same time because they
came out pretty close to each other
so and then on top of atomic habits was
a huge best seller and i think that's
the one that moved the most the needle
the most on this topic
and then
right after that
was tiny habits
by bj fogg
now here's the question
listen to these books power of habits
then mine how to fail then many habits
micro habits small habits
atomic habits and tiny habits
yeah is nano habits taken
now here's the question
did i cause all of these
or were they going to happen anyway
did i cause them or were they going to
happen anyway
what do you think
just looking at your
comments
zeitgeist good answer that's where i'm
going to go with this too
so
um you accelerated it so something some
some people think i had a role in it
some don't let me tell you the story
about uh
isaac newton
my favorite story about isaac newton you
know
of course you automatically think
gravity with newton
but my favorite story about isaac newton
is that he invented calculus just to
solve the problem he was working on
he invented calculus
just to solve a problem he was working
on
now
the fun story about this is that
somebody else invented calculus at the
same time
in the 1600s
two people
independently
invented calculus
at the same time in different countries
i know they didn't know the other one
was doing it
and they didn't share it that yeah there
was no communication
what's up with that
right
um somebody will give me the name of the
other guy leibniz thank you
i knew it would take about
five seconds for you well-educated
people to give me that name yeah leibniz
another was he an astronomer or
scientist i don't know what he was
but he invented it at the same time so
they they get sort of co-credit so
here's the question
how in the world do you explain
calculus being invented at the same time
in two different places
well here's one explanation
it was just time
you know there there was enough other
stuff happening
that the idea of calculus could have
been
thought of by other people in other
words the the environment of whatever
scientific mathematical things were
floating around
was suggestive enough that two people
got the same idea at the same time
from maybe the same kinds of influences
maybe or they were trying to solve the
same kinds of problems at the same time
so maybe it wasn't a big coincidence
maybe the environment just suggested it
and two of them picked it up
likewise
there is something about the environment
that changed to make all this micro
habit
tiny habit stuff make sense at the same
time
and the thing that changed was life got
really complicated
life got too complicated
that's the thing that changed everywhere
at the same time
so does it make sense that
there would be more than one person
who would say how do you solve all this
complicated life stuff like what do you
do about it
and one of the solutions is to make
small steps because you know
it seems overwhelming to do anything
bigger than a small step
so
it could be that the environment
certainly just served up a situation
that people like me and people other
people said you know
i can only think of one way to approach
this and we came up with the same idea
you know i'm not i'm not going to
compare this idea to calculus right
so i'm not comparing myself to
isaac newton somebody's always going to
say that i think he compared himself to
isaac newton no
no i'm not doing that i'm just saying
that people think of the same ideas at
the same time
um the other possibility is that i did
have some influence on it
i can't rule that out either
well it turns out that
mike pence was right
so the new york times commissioned a
poll and found that a majority of women
and
nearly half of men said it's
unacceptable to have dinner or drinks
alone with someone of the opposite sex
other than their spouse
oh oh
i am so going to have to complain
let me listen to this again
and you should be offended on behalf of
other people if not yourself
it's unacceptable to have dinner drinks
alone with someone of the opposite sex
because that's the only people we have
sex with right
the only people you have sex with are
people of the opposite sex
so so i can go to dinner with a gay guy
and my wife won't care
so when when did uh
when did the only kind of sex we think
about turned into heterosexual sex
uh
you think you can be woke
i will overwoke your ass so hard you
can't overwoke me no
new york times
go back to your troglodyte world crawl
back into your caves and don't ever
don't ever darken our door away with
your misogynistic
anti-lgbtq
crap
your crap
you can have sex with anybody you want
it's 20 21 and you do not have to
limit yourself to the
opposite sex and by the way
what is the opposite of sex
correct me if i'm wrong but
the idea of an
opposite sex
suggests there are two
genders
which i don't i can't i can't buy off on
that
i believe there is infinite variety
and that we are all special
in our very different and unique
sexualities i don't have an opposite
for god's sake
what is the opposite of bisexual
i think this opposite stuff is very
anti-what can i complain
by the way in an unrelated
uh view i've been very jealous of the
black community
because they can sing all of the lyrics
of their favorite songs when they come
on the radio or on some device
because most of the
um best songs lately
have the n-word in them
and if you are black you can just sing
the entire lyrics including that n word
but if you're white you can't even sing
your favorite song
i'm assuming your favorite song has
those words in it
if you're white you can't even sing your
favorite song out loud
so
i thought
well i do agree that
that
black americans they could have their
reserved word
and i agree with it it's an ugly word
and if they want to reserve that word
for just themselves and they have some
historical
you know reason for it everything i'm
i'm all for that
no objection whatsoever
but
why can't white people have a word that
they can use and nobody else can
why can't we do that
and so
i did a little brainstorming and i
solved it
i was going to say cracker
and say hey hey i can call myself a
cracker and i can call other white
people crackers
i mean i could if i didn't identify as
black but you get the point
but cracker
it's not really
it doesn't sound good if it's in a song
it needs to be kraka
because the n word it has you know an er
ending but also an a h ending or an a
ending
so instead of cracker which is not cool
at all it's going to be kraka
kraka and instead of the b word which
you'll hear a lot in popular music
i don't like to use that word i feel
that's very disrespectful
so i want a
sort of a white version of that and i
think karen would do it
so i'm going to write a white rap song
in which it uses the word kraka quite a
bit
and refers to women as karen's
because i don't want to use the b word
i think it's going to be a bestseller
we'll see
anyway mike pence was right um you don't
want to have a meal with somebody that's
going to get you in trouble
um i have i have adopted the mike pence
um philosophy i don't know if i've
mentioned that to you but as a married
person i would not have drinks uh well i
don't drink but i wouldn't have drinks
or
dinner with a woman alone nor a gay man
nor a gay man
nor a um
anybody else who
who might want to jump on me
because you know that's a big problem
the women they just want to jump all
over me
no it's not a big problem turns out it's
not a big problem
all right the rolling stones have
decided to retire their song brown sugar
the biggest surprising thing about this
is how did they get along with it how
did they get away with that song as long
as they did
isn't that the surprising part of the
story
for the longest time i've said to myself
is there anybody except the rolling
stones
who could have done this song you know
into the 2000s
i don't think so i don't think so i
think they did have a like a protected
status there now part of it is because
nobody is nobody is wondering if uh
you know mick jagger is a racist
like literally nobody thinks that i mean
if you look at his dating history and
everything else it's pretty obvious that
he's not a racist and we assume the same
thing about the rest of the stones in
fact they're the stones are the most
probably the most biggest promoters of
you know black music and they say they
borrowed slashes stole it and and
they're very generous about saying who
really you know muddy waters and
everybody who should get the real credit
so we know the rolling stones are
nothing like
racist in any normal way that we think
of the word
but i did wonder how they got away with
that for so long now i am aware
that it's a anti-slavery
lyrics
if you actually knew what the lyrics
were about you would understand it was
about the horror of slavery and
therefore
there's no bad messaging intended
but
i didn't know that
i've listened to that song about a
million times i had no idea
i had no idea
that it was about
slavery and the you know i just thought
it was a little
sort of not current way to
refer to each other if you know what i
mean
so they decided to retire it i think
that's probably a
reasonable decision there'll be a lot of
a lot of pushback on that i think mick
jagger's take on it was it just wasn't
worth the trouble
if people were going to complain about
it it was too hard to explain that you
know we're all on the same side here the
song isn't what you think it's just too
much work so so i think i agree with
them on a business level that just
wasn't worth the effort they have other
songs
rasmussen says there's 68 of those
polled either strongly or somewhat agree
that the heated encounters between
concerned parents and school boards
is protected speech
yay
two-thirds of the country still likes
protected speech
now of course things can get heated and
you know there has to be a limit
but uh
good news two-thirds of the country
still like free speech
um biden's poll numbers are still are
plunging 38 approval
that's based on doing everything wrong
if you do everything wrong
all right there's a there was a study
that came out that said baby aspirin
might help a lot for covet it was not a
randomized large controlled trial
so it's a study which does need
confirmation you should not be taken
baby aspirin because you heard that
there was that one study
but
here's the weird thing
at about the same time this news was
reporting that aspirin could be like a
real godsend
for people with uh covet because
apparently it reduces blood clots
at the same time we heard that
unconfirmed right yourself to wait for
the real randomized trial
at the same time
just about the same time it was
announced that
the medical community says you should
not be taking
a baby aspirin every day to prevent
strokes and other problems
is it a coincidence that the moment it
works for covet
or it looks like it might unconfirmed
is the same time that the drug industry
says stop taking it
and of course all the conspiracy people
say
uh
that's just so you'll sell more vaccines
right
you're trying to make people think that
they can't easily
treat it themselves or reduce the risk
by taking an aspirin
well
i don't know that those are connected
but you sort of suspect it don't you
we live in a world in which that's a
little bit too big of a coincidence so
i'm not going to say that's a
coincidence
i'm also going to not not gonna say it's
not
it could be i'm not gonna rule it out as
coincidence
but it doesn't look like one does it it
really doesn't
um but here's the most confusing part of
the story
the rest of you just learning that
uh baby aspirin is not recommended
um
i learned that years ago
on the news
and then i asked my doctor
and my doctor said yeah we don't
recommend that don't take that
and yet today
people are treating it like it's new
news
years ago we do this
right
now was the problem
was the problem
that
it wasn't promoted as strongly as it was
because they were selling a lot of baby
aspirin maybe
maybe the maybe big baby aspirin was
behind it i don't know
i don't know how exactly that would be
the case
um doctors still prescribed it so here
is the deal
how many of you
were still on baby aspirin as of this
morning
in the comments
how many of your from the doctor let's
say a doctor recommended
how many are on doctor recommended baby
aspirin as of today
a lot of you
a lot of you
look at the comments it's just streaming
by yes yes yes yes yes my spouse
i am i am yes yes yes a lot of no's
but the
how many of you went to a doctor who
didn't know the aspirin was no longer
recommended
here's a little wake-up call for you
let me show you just what just happened
to all of you who are still taking baby
aspirin because your doctor recommended
it
may i do uh
this is my impression of what just
happened to you
right now
[Music]
what
i would do it again but it kind of hurt
your doctor
didn't know as much as i did about baby
aspirin if you're still taking it
because i heard this a long time ago and
you can see in the comments many many
people were aware of this for years
years
it's been in the news
this is not new
i don't know what's going on are we just
being gaslighted in some weird way
anyway link to a study
i don't have one um
you heard there was a big crash of a
twin-engine cessna crashed into some
buildings and a ups truck
in san diego the driver of the ups truck
was killed by the
airplane now let me tell you
if you're a ups driver
and you're putting in a million miles a
year on the road
and the thing that kills you as an
airplane
it was time
i don't mean to be insensitive to the
family
but
talk about when your time is up your
time is up because a million miles of
driving a ups drug didn't seem to phase
him
but the airplane got him all right
what question do i ask myself when i
hear that a small airplane crashed
what's the first question i asked myself
i mean after i asked myself if my wife
was in it because she flies cessnas so
the first thing i ask is
where's my wife
so i want to make sure she wasn't in it
the second thing i ask is
what kind of doctor was he
yeah that's the second question what
kind of doctor was he
do you know why
well i don't know why
but doctors crash a lot of airplanes so
much so that when i heard this i said
and i'm not i'm not joking
the first thing i thought was what kind
of doctor is he he was a cardiologist
now the airplane is not the
there's a brand of airplane i won't
mention it because i'll probably get a
suit or something but not the cessnas
the cessnas are actually easy to fly
so a doctor in the cessna
should not be crashing
but a doctor in another airplane that i
won't mention
sometimes called the doctor killer
more common
but it was still the first question i
asked what kind of doctor was he sure
enough
i don't know how to explain that exactly
do you
i don't know why doctors crash more
airplanes than other people maybe they
can afford airplanes is that it
so columbus got canceled
um
but there's still a lot of people who
are pretty happy about it we changed
that to indigenous people's day
uh i uh
i have some slightly mixed feelings
about columbus
but i'm okay with canceling them
i'm okay with canceling columbus
columbus was
horrible
i don't know if you've ever read
you know the things that columbus and
his actual crew
did
to the locals
i mean i read a story where they used
them as horses
they actually would have them carry them
on their shoulders
so that you know columbus's men didn't
like i don't get their feet dirty or
something
yeah they beat him and killed him and
tortured him and treated him like horses
basically
now
if there was anybody who should get
cancelled i would think it would be
anybody involved with something like
that
so
i mean it's a little bit like saying you
know
hitler did a lot of bad things but you
have to look at his accomplishments too
the volkswagen
i mean it feels a little like that it's
like yeah the volkswagen's cool
i don't know if it's true that hitler
was behind the volkswagen you know it's
probably not true but just using it for
my example
i don't know that we can say columbus
did some awesome stuff too
first of all he didn't find the right
part of the world and second of all he
was like a major torturer what he was
so i guess i'm in favor of indigenous
people's day
you know i it feels like everything
white and european is getting cancelled
but seriously he was a torturer
i mean that's got to count for something
desantis went the other way because he's
so good at this
uh populist stuff
but he characterized columbus as quote a
singular figure in western civilization
who
who
exemplified courage risk-taking and
heroism in the face of enormous odds
a visionary
etc now those things can all be true
but can be said of other people who did
bad things so
you remember the story about the trans
employee who got
um suspended at netflix allegedly for
complaining about dave chappelle's show
but that was fake news she did not get
suspended for complaining netflix says
that and they've reinstated her
but uh the
the complaint was that she got on some
kind of a zoom call that was only for
executives
but it turns out she was invited
somebody sent her the link so some
executive
or somebody who had the link seems to
have invited her and she didn't know she
couldn't be there
so there wasn't any bad intention and
once uh netflix looked into it they just
didn't found anything wrong
so they said all right you're back in
do you like that
i like that
i like that i like this outcome
i like that the employee could complain
and that that wasn't the reason she got
fired she was
called to task for doing something that
looked like it was against the rules
but they didn't fire her they just said
suspend you we're gonna look into this
they looked into it there was nothing to
it they said oh sorry you're back
i'm okay with that she got a little
attention her
her point of view got spread a little
bit better netflix looks like a
responsible employer i think everybody
won i think the trans community won i
think chappelle won i think netflix won
this is one of those weird stories where
everybody won
am i wrong
is it didn't everybody win
how often do you get that
everybody won
was it planned that way no i don't think
it was planned that way
i i think it's just one of these rare
situations where everybody did the right
thing
maybe we should note that
maybe maybe we should know rare
situation
where everybody did the right thing i'm
not saying you agree with your opinions
and you don't have to
shatten her down
oh is a captain kirk up did he make it
oh so he's already been up and back so
shatner's back
well
um i'll tell you if i had been on the
flight
there's a pretty good
chance i would have
shall we say
shatner my flight suit
that's right
you put me in that experimental
flight situation and i would
shatner my flight suit
and how is the dow doing
yes there is driving but uh uh i get to
go a little bit later today
all right
um
but i do need to go
yeah space travel for 10 minutes so four
minutes of
light
stuff
um
columbus was great because he was a good
navigator right and you know who else
was great
o.j simpson
o.j simpson was
great at football
let's not forget that
let's not forget that oj was really good
at football
same thing
yeah columbus
oj
kinda similar
gotta take the good with the bad or
or sort them out all right um
yeah i see you mentioning the aircraft
correctly
uh read delaney to find out why you're
wrong wrong about columbus
um
all right carol delaney yes so there's
apparently somebody somebody must be
defending columbus
you know does it matter
does it matter if the real story is that
columbus was an awesome guy and he never
did anything bad to anybody
it kind of doesn't matter
because that's not who we think he is
and as a national
symbol it only matters who you think he
is
it doesn't matter who he actually was
unfortunately it's not relevant
should be
if you're telling me you should be or
the truth matters does it
now the truth
should matter
it doesn't
the truth should matter in a perfect
world
alright
that's all for now and i will go
do something else now
and i hope you agree
this was the best thing that ever
happened to you today
were you
