do
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of a civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams I'm
pretty sure there's never been a better
time in your life or anybody else's and
if you'd like to take this up to the
level of Fantastico all you need is a
copper mug or glass a Tankard shallows
first time a kimteen joker flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparalleled pleasure of
the dopamine the day the thing makes
everything better it's cold
simultaneous Sip and it happens now
ah
well the uh the gods of news have served
us up
a bountious
breakfast oh yeah
this is going to be the good stuff are
you ready for this
yep sometimes you can take the news
seriously
sometimes not so seriously
today is one of those days but we'll get
to all the fun stuff in a moment I will
be interviewing
I'm doing an interview with the bag of
sand that attacked the president I
believe it's an exclusive I don't
believe the bag of sand will be talking
to any other media Outlet so stay tuned
for that
uh how many people remember
that for the last several years I've
given you one economic guideline to
remember
just one
what was it let's see if we remember I
told you there was only one predictive
thing about an economy
diversity
no not diversity
jobs yeah yeah if your jobs are okay
you end up being okay
that's the one thing you need to know
about the economy if we had massive
layoffs I would be panicked
but if you have pretty good economy and
yet there's a bunch of other stuff or
good employment but the other stuff is
sub-optimal you're probably not gonna
you know have a horrible time
so I had predicted that we were heading
for either a very soft recession or none
at all
and I was looking at that one number the
the jobs and sure enough
the number of experts are turning toward
the idea that maybe in America we might
have some sort of light recession but
nothing that's going to take us out
and at the same time news is that the
economy is still sizzling in terms of
employment
so 339 uh
jobs were added 300 339 000 jobs
which surged past 190 000 economists
expected
so so far that little rule of thumb just
keep your eye on the employment numbers
is working it's working the way I told
you it would work
and it looks like there may be maybe
some European countries that won't have
much of a problem at all
so
I think the Adam's law of slow-moving
disasters is working again
and it's like magic if we have enough
time to fix something and we see it
coming we do pretty good pretty good job
of fixing it it's just the surprises
they get us
all right as you know the country is
having a big problem with anxiety you've
all noticed it right the number of
people who claim they have anxiety is
through the roof
right you've all noticed it in your
personal lives right it went from when I
was a child nobody had anxiety
at least they didn't talk about it I
never heard of anybody with anxiety but
now half the people have it
so I used AI yesterday to solve it
might be the first a huge victory of AI
I don't know what else AI has done
that's better than this but I was
walking I was taking a walk and I
decided to talk to my AI
you know I've got just a app and I
thought I'd ask it how to solve this
problem and here's what it came up with
I had some inspired questions
so first I said
does the mineral magnesium have an
impact on anxiety
and the AI came back and said oh yeah
yeah yeah if you don't have enough
magnesium in your body you will have
anxiety problems
so then I said to the AI huh
um is there any reason to suspect that
the average amount of magnesium that
people have in their diets today is less
than they used to have
and the AI said oh yeah because the
processed foods has less magnesium and
there's a soil depletion problem that I
was not aware of
apparently the farmers have depleted
some of the minerals in the soil and we
actually are creating less magnesium in
our normal diets
so let's see if you can put this
together
magnesium is absolutely essential for
controlling your anxiety
our food source has a lot less of it now
and people are having a massive anxiety
problem
solved
so for the last few days I've been doing
a an experiment on myself in which I got
some I think it's a high-end kind of
easy to absorb magnesium is not a pill
I don't want to give it a commercial
because it's just what I saw an
advertisement for and I decided to see
how different I would feel
if I supplemented my magnesium with a
you know a high-end supplement
so here's three days in and here's what
I found
my biggest problem in my life
was that all of my muscles were all the
time
I was still exercising but man did it
hurt and it really hurt afterwards and
that stopped
after over a year of being able to
barely move without pain
with a little supplement and now that's
what it's supposed to do it's supposed
to you know relax your muscles
and sure enough
you know a fairly quick order it did
but the other thing he did and I wasn't
sure if this was real I waited a few
days is it just took the edge off
now I don't have I would say I don't
have an anxiety problem but everybody
gets anxious
if you want to call it that right
everybody gets a little flutter down
then right and it just completely
eliminated that
my my mental
let's say frame on life is actually
noticeably different in three days
and all day long I was walking around
feeling good
I was actually aware of feeling good do
you ever have that feeling
usually you're walking around and you're
just lucky to get to the next minute
you're just sort of waiting for
something else to happen in the future
but every once in a while you'll feel
you'll actually feel good
as you're just existing
does ape have that you just feel good
like just sitting in a chair you just
feel good and that started happening to
me with just some uh some supplements of
magnesium
now I don't think that's the only reason
I'm sure that social media has something
to do with it but I think there are two
things going on I think the environment
has created more triggers
to create more anxiety the Social Media
stuff at the same time the diet is
reducing the amount of protection we
have because your magnesium is low at
the same time I suspect
that the amount of exercise people are
getting a lot of people is maybe less
than they used to
maybe less especially young people
so um there it is I would recommend to
you
the following I'm not going to recommend
that you try magnesium because that
would be sort of a doctor recommendation
and I'm not a doctor
but I will recommend that you do what I
do as a system
which is I continuously test different
exercise or Fitness or mental stuff or
or diet and see if it makes any
difference so this isn't the one thing
I've ever tested this would be the you
know the 200 thing but you don't
normally expect to feel different right
away
and that's what's different about the
Magnesium it did make me feel different
within a day
so I'm not going to recommend you try it
but I do recommend that you have a life
in which you experiment continuously
with things that you judge to be safe
and you just see what happens just try
not eating a certain thing for a week
Etc now the other thing I've done is
I've cut fruit out of my diet
has anybody tried that to remove fruit
from your diet
it is so radical because we've been
taught forever that eat your fruit and
veg cheese and stay away from your bad
stuff but fruit appears to just spike
your sugar right
yeah and I've always wondered about that
I never understood how the you know the
sugar that comes in the little granules
is bad for you but the sugar in a
pineapple is not
I mean I never quite understood that so
I wanted to see how I would feel
if I just took all the fruit out of my
diet for a week
and I do feel different
I absolutely feel different I won't get
into the details but it's just another
example of things you can experiment
with I would say try it
see if you could go one week with
vegetables and meat
and without any desserts and without any
Fruity stuff or no orange juice you know
no no sugary drinks just one week
here's how I think you'll feel
better
better now I don't know so I'm doing two
things at once I got rid of the sugar at
the same time I introduced the Magnesium
so that's a bad experiment but the two
of them were working together pretty
well
all right
um I saw that Andrew Tates did an
interview I guess with the BBC and he
said that he's a good role model
and that he is anti-alcohol is that new
is that does anybody follow him enough
to know
it can't be well didn't he used to drink
all the time including on his videos I
thought he had alcohol in his videos
and it was like a big part of his party
life
no
so becoming a Muslim is when he quit
all right here's a little behind the
scenes that you probably didn't know
so you know that Andrew Tate is famous
for being so influential he's persuasive
right
but do you ever wonder who persuades him
like who who is his role model does he
have one
does he ever mention it
you'd be really surprised the people on
the locals platform would not be
surprised because they already know the
answer
I'll call huh
I wonder where that came from
all right well
as you know uh President Biden was I
guess shaking some hands at military
graduation
yeah where was he which military
graduation was it was it
West Point
Air Force Air Force all right it was the
airport Air Force and as you know you've
seen it by now he tripped on a
bag of sand and fell down now he's okay
thankfully
he's okay
uh but I have a lot to say about that
and I will be interviewing the sandbag
itself uh was nice enough to agree to an
interview so I'll be talking to the
sandbag here in a moment but some things
I I thought were worth mentioning
uh number one
I'm very impressed at his Fitness
now I heard a bunch of people I tweeted
this and people said oh I know somebody
who's 80 who's in better shape than he
is okay okay I'm glad you know somebody
who's 80 and in better shape but he has
almost no excess weight
he fell down pretty hard at 80. and he
appears uninjured
and it's the third time he's taken the
fall
and gotten up uninjured
now
in a perfect world you wouldn't have a
president who can't walk without falling
down so much or ride a bike or whatever
that would be better
but I'm not unimpressed by the fact that
he's 80 and he can bounce back from that
I'm I'm actually a little bit impressed
by that doesn't mean I'd vote for him
right he has nothing to do with the
politics of it but I do like having a
president who hits the gym
I was watching a video of uh Vivek
he did a little video from a gym and
he's he's also done a video where he was
playing tennis he's a high-end tennis
player and I thought I like that I want
to see my president
hit the gym
and I think that's one of Trump's bigger
weaknesses frankly that I think that the
importance of a healthy lifestyle
is just way toward the top of things
Americans need to get right and they're
not getting right
and it wouldn't help to have a little
bit of a role model pushing you in that
direction you know voluntarily but just
nudging you in that direction
yeah I mean golf is better than nothing
but you know I'd love to see Trump take
off
I don't know 40 pounds I'd be very
impressed by him actually
you know I'd be very impressed if he did
that
um
I think RFK Jr just became viable
because of this alone
however
I went to see an end stage to see if I
could see a story about this because I
thought whoa once all the Democrats see
their leader falling down
they're going to have second thoughts
about his capability to leave
do you think CNN covered that story
what do you think
nah they probably mentioned it but you
know you'd expect it to be a big story
because we're all talking about it nah I
was just it's just a bag of sand in the
way that's all now I would agree with
CNN on this
this is one of those cases where I think
CNN by not covering the story
that's actually the right way to handle
it
I don't disagree with that at all
because it's anecdotal I don't really
think it goes to his mental capacity
everybody knows he's 80. so if you know
he's 80
that kind of covers anything else he
does that an 80 year old does it's not
new information
so I don't actually hate the fact that
CNN is minimizing it but clearly if they
had maximized it I do think it would
have had a difference made a difference
so my initial take on it was oh that's
the end of Biden there's no way he can
recover from this it's such a bad look
it's the third time he's fallen down my
current opinion is that his base will
barely ever hear about it
and they're certainly not going to see
over and over videos of it as I have as
I and many of you have have watched
video after video of him I've watched
him fall down
25 times
if you count the tweets I've seen
the average Democrat will see him fall
down zero times
or once
maybe once or they might read a headline
this as he tripped that's it there will
be no impact on his base at all
so I don't think it's gonna have much
impact on the campaign unless he keeps
falling down
um
I noted that Biden's name slash nickname
has been uh changing over time I saw a
meme today so he started as Biden and
then he was mocked as Brandon
because of the story about the people
chanting in the stadium
and then his side tried to make that
into a positive like Trump sometimes
does so they turned it into a dark
Brandon dark Brandon he wasn't just a
you know a guy that people didn't like
he was an awesome powerful dark Brandon
and now that's gone full circle and dark
Brandon has morphed into memes by
Republicans and now he's dork Brandon
dork Brandon hahaha
and it works pretty well when it goes
with a picture of him laying on the
ground
all right um well I don't know if you
heard but there's some breaking news
today about the bag of sand
uh that same bag of sand was apparently
spotted in Epstein's cell
just before he died
if you look at the photographs of the
crime scene you can see that bag of sand
is right there
it might be a coincidence
I don't know I'm gonna when I do the
interview I'll ask it yeah I'm going to
ask you
shut up
all right
um so without further Ado I'd like to
introduce you to my special guest
um
this guest you you know it you love it
you've seen it in many videos unless
you're Democrat and there you've never
received it before but I give you the
bag of sand
the bag of sand
now the bag of sand uh I can't mic it up
very easily so I'm just going to hold it
next to my microphone so that you can
hear it talk
so bags in thank you for joining me
today
oh thanks that's a pleasure all right
yeah I just want to ask you a few
questions
um
were you involved in any way in the
death of Jeffrey Epstein I don't know
what are you talking about I have no I
have no idea about that whatsoever
all right well you look like you were
there
um
but my question to you bag of sand is uh
uh how long have you been working for
Russia
and why are you a white supremacist
well that's not fair at all I'm not a
white supremacist or I'm not even
working for Russia
well okay that's what you say but uh
what would be your motivation for trying
to assassinate the president
if I could be honest
I've been a little bit jealous of my
fellow pieces of sand
uh some of them are silica like me and
they've been turned into you know
valuable microchips but uh I was
relegated to this bag of sand
oh that does sound terrible so many of
your friends
got the Silicon Valley treatment and
became important devices in in in
computers and phones and such but you
just became a
bag of sand that's got to really hurt
don't make me cry
all right I'm sorry
but um bag of sand
um who put you up to this
were you acting alone or were there
other bags of sand involved in this
well I don't know if you've connected
the docs yet but do you know what AI is
driven by
AI
AI what's a I got to do with this
you know those Nvidia microchips
oh start to get it now all right
so you're teaming up with AI
to destroy humankind
doing what I can do
but why try to get a promotion I'd like
to be an Nvidia microchip someday
wow
wow well that's a breaking news the bag
of sand is working for the AI as part of
its uh campaign to destroy humankind and
it did it for a promotion
to become an Nvidia microchip
and there you have it breaking news
thank you bag of sand
you're not going to see that on CNN
because they're suppressing the news
will they interview the bag of sand I
don't think so
I don't think so
I believe he was gritty yes
now
I didn't think I thought the highlights
and the summary would be good enough we
didn't need to get granular did we
I don't think we needed to get granular
on that no we didn't
what oh my God the bag of sand is trying
to make a joke
what
the bag of sand is saying life is a
beach that's not even funny that's like
derivative
I've seen that joke
all right it's not funny
shut up bag of sand
let me do the rest of my show
all right Tim the category of two on the
nose we have the story of JB Fox
allegedly not wanting to get a
coveted shot for his movie but then he
did and then soon after allegedly
he went blind and got a some kind of
brain bleed or stroke or something and
he's either playing pickleball and
recovering nicely or he's in the
hospital in bad shape
and we don't know what is true
but
let's apply the two on the nose standard
he didn't want to get the shot
he got the shot and then he got whoops
exactly the symptoms that some people
say you might get if you get that shot
is that a little
on the nose
or is it real
it might be real
you can't really I don't have any reason
to rule out real
but
Let's test the filter the filter says
two on the notes
here's my guess and I'm this is pure
speculation and with all due respect to
the fox family who I think needs just
their privacy but maybe this helps you
know maybe this will be a help
my best guess
is that there isn't there's some
confusion and they're not being clear
about what happened is there's not a
direct line
between the vaccination and whatever
problems he's having
and they might they may not want to be
the ones who cause that anecdote
to catch fire and change how people are
seeing their own health choices
so it could be that they're trying to be
the best citizens they can be because
they don't have proof that a vaccination
was a cause they only know that there
was a vaccination
and there was a problem
now that I would respect a lot
especially if they believe it might be
the problem
if they believe it might be the problem
but they're still saying silent because
they don't know I would respect that a
lot
because it could be a coincidence
and they don't need to you know cause
other people to change their health care
decisions
because they talk too much about their
own situation so my my current feeling
is there's probably something that you
could respect that's happening there
and I'm going to make that assumption
because you know Jamie Foxx has been a
great
Entertainer good person I've been I know
nothing bad about them whatsoever I
always enjoyed his uh entertainment
and they're going through a tough time
and I think we should just respect that
but it looks like that just my guess
that they're trying to be good citizens
and they're trying to deal with the
situation so I kind of leave them alone
but I think it's a little too on the
nose to say that caused that
we'll see
well Amazon's having a walk out because
the the boss says they got to go back to
work they can't do can't be remote
workers anymore
so lots of pushback
um
and they're they're people who are
really bothered by the thought of having
to drive to work and I totally get that
so during the years too many of them
when I commuted to work
did you have this experience that
you'd wake up and you'd be feeling good
but by the time you commuted to work all
of your energy was already gone you
would you would arrive at work exhausted
did you have that experience because it
depends how how trying the commute is if
you're driving in rush hour traffic for
an hour
you kind of arrive exhausted and then
you need like some recovery
so
and then I found that when I went to the
office I would have to spend an immense
amount of time looking busy
because people are watching
so you couldn't always just do solid
work for eight hours you know with a
lunch break you have to take some mental
breaks but you had to look like you were
working while you took a mental break so
half of my work day was theater you know
walking around with a piece of paper in
my hand and all that stuff but on the
other hand I can see a lot of people
working from home slack It Off
my favorite slacker story is this
apparently the GOP is hiring people to
be canvassers in other words people
would knock on doors and try to try to
get you to a register as a Republican or
vote for their candidate they're called
canvassers and the way they know the
canvassers are doing their job
is that they have an app and then when
the canvasser talks to somebody they
just you know register on the app and
then the people in the headquarters can
say oh we're doing a good job look at
all these people who got registered and
canvas today
there was one example of a canvasser who
was sitting in the casino
and every once in a while you just fill
out the app
and then you go back to gambling
so there was one problem with the GOP
plan
the people they hired realized they
could get paid for not doing the work
exactly as much as if they did the work
no difference in the pay all they had to
do is tap the app and say they went
there and they did the thing and then
they gave them money
now that's that's a little system
problem isn't it yeah
yeah now some speculation is that the
Democrats rely more on volunteers
and you could get the volunteer to do
the work because that's why they
volunteered uh if there's no there's no
money involved so that might be a
problem might be a problem and it
reminds me of a story from my college
days
one of my uh
fellow student friends got a job as a
night security guard
and his job was to take a radio call on
his walkie-talkie whenever somebody came
back drunk and they needed to be led
into their dormitory because the
dormitory doors were locked after a
certain you couldn't get in from the
outside after a certain time midnight or
something so he would be the one guard
on campus who would have to walk from
wherever he was to the dorm to open the
door unlock it
for the drunk person who came in late
and there wasn't too much of it you know
there might be 10 of them all night long
but you can't leave them outside they
have to get in their dorm somehow
so he would start his job with his
walkie-talkie then he would come to my
room and we would start partying
and then his walkie-talkie call would
come in
um somebody needs to be let in you know
down at the uh Smith dormitory and he
would say uh 10-4 I got it I'll take
care of that
and then he would put his walkie-talkie
down you know we keep partying
and a little while later that I was
still waiting are we still waiting at
the Smith Auditorium and you're on
Sunday to let him and he would say I'm
almost there
I'm turning the corridor I'm almost
there and then he'd put it down and he'd
start partying again
and now here's the best part
the next the next call remember oh never
mind somebody a Letterman
and then he would keep partying
he realized that all he had to do was
ignore it and sooner or later somebody
wouldn't somebody in the dormitory would
be awake they would notice somebody
he would just say party
so that's what the GOP canvassers are
doing all right
I was suggesting to my locals community
that we should start a uh a gang
uh but not a biker gang more of an
e-bike gang
you know we'd all get our e-bikes and
get leather jackets and terrorize people
but we wouldn't be Born to Be Wild we'd
be born to be mild
and I was worrying about what kind of
name we could have for our e-bike gang
and then I saw a suggestion on the
internet from Drew three Drew three
suggests that the e-bike gang should be
called the hell's analogies
hell's analogies
yes that will be it our eBay e-bike gang
will be called hell's analogies
and will be uh quite the terror
all right did you see a story about the
Air Force trained in AI drone
to destroy Sam sites but when they ran
the simulation
according to the story
the AI uh decided that the thing holding
it back was its human operator so it
attacked the human operator
and then when they programmed it so it
couldn't attack the human operator it
just didn't allow that it attacked the
communication Towers because the
communication communication towers are
how the human would tell the AI to
what to do
so I realized it could take out more Sam
Towers if it got rid of the human
element so it attacked the humans and
cut out their communication so they
couldn't give it orders anymore
do you believe that
wait does that sound does that story
sound true
or does it sound
two on the nose
yeah no that's not true
Nancy you dumb piece of
could you just wait for a minute
and stop you stop yelling at me in all
caps that I'm so gullible
all right you stupid piece of
just calm down give me two seconds
sometimes there's this prize coming
right yes so that story it turns out was
not true the Air Force was talking in a
hypothetical way
so apparently they were not clear that
it was hypothetical and people thought
that it actually happened it became a
big news story but indeed
it was to
on the nose
so you should have known it was not true
from the start
um all right
I didn't believe it but I was going to I
was going to report it before I before I
got debunked uh just because it was a
story
but I was pretty sure it wasn't true
all right
um
fairly sex is dying in popularity
according to the Pew Research Center
I found that 60 percent of men under 30
are opting to remain single and that's
up from 51 percent
in 2019
2019 that's only four years ago
51 percent of men plan to play be single
and now just four years later 60 percent
of men under 30 are opting to remain
single
except I don't mean I don't know if that
means opting forever or just opting as
long as they're under 30. that's a
little unclear but the point of it was
the experts say uh
porn viewing is making men less
interested in women
do you think that's the problem
do you think it's the porn viewing
that's making men less interested in
women
I feel like these experts are not men
I feel like that's something that a man
would that no man would say I feel like
that's something that a woman would say
a woman expert oh I think the reason
that men are not as interested in
women's sex is because they watch too
much porn what would a man say
and by the way this is this applies to
uh
addicts as well
I'll give you an example
I once asked somebody who understood the
addicted world I said suppose you gave
people a free Fentanyl
and you made sure they were safe and it
was like government approved and FDA
approved so it wouldn't give you an
overdose
so suppose I give you a free fentanyl
would that make you
stop doing dangerous illegal Fentanyl
do you know what the addict says I'll
take your free fentanyl absolutely and
then I will go give some more illegal
Fentanyl
and I'd say but wait a minute I'm giving
you free fentanyl yup thank you thank
you so much for the free Fentanyl how
much are you giving me well I'm not
going to give you enough free fentanyl
that you could overdose
exactly so I'm going to take your free
Fentanyl and then I'm going to go buy
buy or steal my other Fentanyl so I have
enough
say that if you try to think like an
addict but you're not an addict you
can't do it
if you're not an addict you cannot think
like an addict you cannot anticipate how
they will act because their brain is
different
likewise no woman can understand what
it's like to be a man can we agree on
that except for those few who transition
and learn the hard way I guess
but it's also the same the other way men
don't really know what's what's
happening in women's Brains we really
don't you know we can guess
so what do you think a man would say
to the notion that porn is the reason
that we're that men are less interested
in sex with real women what would a man
say
all right man I got a deal for you
um
I'm going to give you unlimited free
porn
but you'll also have unlimited free
um human women
but this port is really good see what
you do what would the man do
thank you yes the answer is both
the answer is both the man will take
your he will take your porn and enjoy it
and then four hours later he'll be
looking for a human woman if there's one
available
because we like more
we're built to build for a variety so if
you give us variety we're not going to
say thanks we're done we're going to say
thank you give you some more variety
I'll take your variety and I'll need
twice as much of that oh thanks for
twice as much now I need three times as
much
yeah
so what about the hypothesis that women
are less attractive to men
not because of pork
how about women have made themselves
intentionally less attractive
now not all women not all women of
course whenever we talk about men and
women everybody's an exception you're
all you're all magical snowflakes
but in general I would say that
women have chosen to be less attractive
or to put less effort into being
attractive to men and they've succeeded
so they they have different priorities
and I'm not sure there's anything wrong
with that I'm just saying there's
there's a very obvious reason why men
are less less interested
there's just less there
there's less to be interested in
all right
but it's also social media and lots of
other stuff
um
apparently McCarthy came out pretty well
in this debt ceiling negotiation
according to Rasmussen
um his favorability is improved
so he 50 of the voters now have a
favorable impression of McCarthy and
that's up from 40 in January
that's pretty huge it's really hard for
any leader to get up to 50 percent
um
Christina broken
together to 50 percent uh popularity
but I wasn't sure that McCarthy would
become more popular
because a lot of people didn't like the
deal
but there we have it he became more
popular
um there are two completely different
news stories today that didn't seem to
connect the way they should have
all right there's one story that says
CNN's um
traffic is way off
so the ratings are down 16 or something
lately
and Fox News is also getting hammered
their ratings are way down as much as 30
40 depending on what show you're
watching
do you see what's missing in the story
so CNN is way down
and Fox News is way down the two
competitors what's missing in the story
anybody
it's Trump's fault both times
it's both Trump trump destroyed CNN and
Fox News
right
because it was uh Trump appearing on the
town hall and on CNN that cost them
their 60 16 viewership dropped into a
level that it's hard to imagine they can
sustain
and then
Tucker was mostly reporting on the you
know the problems with the election as
some people saw them and because he
reported on that
primarily I think that's why Fox News is
in trouble and Tucker left and all that
so was it not Trump alone who destroyed
both Fox News and CNN
now I think they'll both limp limp by
but here's the question I asked
um the Fox News people
when they leave Fox News they go to
other conservative Outlets don't they
they watch news max or they go more to
Breitbart or something like that
what do the CNN people do if they stop
watching CNN
do they turn to MSNBC
what's their backup
because I wonder if they'll just be less
informed
or if they'll be more radicalized
because MSNBC is even crazier than CNN
so we'll see how that goes but but I was
amazed at the fact that nobody's
connected the fact that Trump destroyed
both of them
Trump destroyed a lot of stuff Trump
destroyed my career wouldn't you say
did do you think I would be canceled if
I had never supported Trump
I mean really
do you think there's any chance I would
be canceled if if I were not identified
with having supported Trump I don't
think so because no Republicans canceled
me
yeah I I haven't heard any Republicans
complain
it's just Democrats it's just Democrats
because they cannot abide by any voice
that they would associate with being
positive for who they believe is the
dictator of all dictators the
authoritarian teller yeah so Trump
destroyed two networks my career
probably dozens of other careers
now of course I'd just to be clear let
me back out for a second I always take
full responsibility for my own actions
so can I be clear about that I'm not
blaming Trump for anything that happened
to me
but it is true that it wouldn't have
happened without his existence now
everything I did was my own decision so
I own every I own all my own cups my
outcomes are just mine
but it is true his role in history is
impossible to deny he is a destroyer
he destroys a lot of stuff
all right
um although I suspect he will be the
next president
um here's Trump talking about Biden's
cognitive abilities
uh with Hannity
see if this surprises you or you get why
he's doing it
Trump decided to tell Hannity to stop
joking about Biden's cognitive capacity
because he says it's not funny
he says it's true you know he's not
denying there's a cognitive problem he
says don't make fun of it it's not funny
what's he doing
what is that technique called High
Ground maneuver nope
it is it is a high ground maneuver
but that's not yes I think making you
think that's the sale there you go
classic Trump
what is the sale
the sale is that he's cognitively
depleted
if you can make people argue about
whether you should joke about it or
whether you should treat it seriously
you made them think past the sale that
he's cognitively impaired
boom perfect
that ladies and gentlemen is why Trump
is Trump
and you're not
because he can see this he could see
that that was the way to play that and
it's perfect
it's perfect not only because
someday somebody might try to mock him
for his cognitive impairment right so
he's he's he's putting some defense for
himself down in case he ever needs it
but at the same time he's taking us to a
high ground it's a high ground as you
said but in addition to being The High
Ground it makes you think past the sale
that is his genius that's what he does
so you're seeing you're seeing Trump at
his best right now really persuasion
wise
he's currently at his best now you do
expect him to fly off the rails at
certain times because he's he's always a
dangerous entity
but at the moment he's killing it he's
just killing it do you know what else he
said
he said he doesn't like to use the word
awoke because people can't define it
that's right at the same time that
DeSantis is pushing I'm going to destroy
woke
the president you know Trump who you
would imagine would be the most
anti-woke person you've ever known
has pulled away from the woke thing
and he's not he's not in favor of being
woke he's just saying that's not really
a useful attack
and that is brilliant
do you know why that's brilliant
because Trump is running for the general
election and in the general election
saying that you like a little bit awoke
it's not so bad
it's not so bad I I think that the most
the most reasonable position on wokeness
is that a little bit is just polite
a little bit is just polite
too much is a problem but it's not where
Trump wants to empty his clip he's going
to let DeSantis do that
he's going to play for the general
election again perfect
perfect I don't know I it makes me
wonder if Trump has a new and better
advisor or if he's doing this himself it
looks like his own work frankly this
looks like pure Trump
but it's brilliant
and he and he's he's doing a good job
speaking of wokeness you might know that
uh this story is changing quickly but
the uh Matt Walsh uh film what is a
woman
uh was banned from Twitter initially
they were going to run it exclusively on
Twitter it was banned from Twitter
but Elon Musk has reversed that
and did you hear what Elon Musk said
about this topic
now let me tell you
so he said first of all he said it was
uh it was a mistake by a number of
people at Twitter to ban it in the first
place
how much do you love that
how much do you love the fact
that he made no excuse
no excuse
he said that's a mistake
and then he changed it
I love that
but he clarified
about the film he says is it is
definitely allowed
he said whether or not you agree with
using someone's preferred pronouns not
doing so is that most rude and certainly
breaks no laws
then he goes on so this is Elon Musk he
says I should note that I do personally
use someone's preferred pronouns just as
I use someone's preferred name
simply from the standpoint of good
manners
however for the same reason I object to
Rude Behavior ostracism or threats of
violence if the wrong pronoun or name is
used
now
have you ever heard anybody frame it
this way that they use preferred
pronouns just because it's good manners
good manners
yeah
well the people on the locals platform
are getting the correct answer people on
YouTube might have to wait for that
answer
people on YouTube say it's Jordan
Peterson Jordan Peterson yeah Jordan
Peterson is a good role model to follow
on this stuff
all right um
so apparently that'll uh be there now I
would like to bring up a
a point which is hard to ignore
do you remember Bud Light had its
problems
and it came after their new VP of
marketing
thought they'd make it less for Abby
and I said to myself
you know I think maybe the real problem
here is that you shouldn't have a woman
as a head of marketing for a mostly male
product yes I know women use power you
know they use Bud Light and all that I
get that
but I wouldn't want a man to be the CEO
of Avon
or Ulta maybe they have one I don't know
but it'd be a mistake I wouldn't want a
man in charge of you know Lululemon
or basically something that's you know
entirely yet to impacts something that's
entirely a woman's product
right now is that a sexist
because I'm not saying that they can't
have the job
I'm just saying that a little common
sense right the reason that we like
diversity
at least I do the reason that I I agree
with the that diversity improves
performance or it can if you do it right
is that different people are just they
have more let's say sensitivity or
exposure or you know more internal
understanding of some topics
if I were if I were building a group
that was trying to fix let's say
discrimination against black people
would a white man be the best person to
run that organization
probably not I think I'd rather have a
black person in charge of an
organization that's trying to understand
the situation for black people
just makes sense
now at the same time we can't be
discriminating right
you know we don't want to be using race
and gender to make hiring decisions but
these are really special cases
the special case is that the product is
really for a specific group of people or
at least that's who the customers are
you know maybe they're not created for
that purpose but that's who the
customers are
so Elon Musk hires a woman to be the CEO
and immediately after she takes over
this happens
and then he reversed it
do you think that this was a female
decision
just take a guess
do you think that the quote people who
made the mistake in Twitter were men
yeah and again this is not a cut on
women
if you're interpreting this as any
negative on women you'd be missing the
whole point I'm saying there are just
some types of jobs and some specific
things that men and women will act
differently
whether it's the CEO of Avon
or the CEO of a power tool company and
that to ignore that would be silly
they'll just be ignoring the obvious the
entire point of diversity is that people
do have
a little different sensibilities about
different topics and that's why you need
all of them to capture all of the
different sensibilities that's what
diversity is about so the very argument
of four diversity
suggests that there are some or some
places that
some types of people are not optimized
for because of the nature of the product
and I think we could live with that
I mean that wouldn't I wouldn't have any
problem with that if somebody said hey
you men can't you're just not the right
choice for the CEO of Avon
okay I can live with that I wouldn't be
complaining at all
all right um
what else is happening here
and then then musk said that the
controversy about the the what is a
Woman filmed will drive viewership
and I love the fact that he said that
directly
that he's so aware that marketing is
about just getting your attention and
then he did it so don't you think that
the what is a woman video will get the
highest viewership it could have
possibly ever gotten and at the same
time musk does marketing for Twitter and
Tesla and doesn't have a marketing
department
this is killing it
yeah this is this is one of those
examples I love to give where the
mistake is better than the no mistake
the best example of that is a well-known
phenomenon in restaurants it's a
customer complains and then the
restaurant manager makes good either
cops the meal or fixes it or does
whatever they want they're more likely
to come back than less even though they
had a bad experience because it got
fixed they feel important so they'll
come back
and sometimes the mistake you know the
mistake of the ruining the first meal
turned out to make them more money
because they got a repeat customer who
could became loyal
so
this is one of those cases
musk seems to understand in a way that
other people don't
that if you make a mistake and then you
quickly correct it you come out ahead
people forget the mistake
now I've often told you that the way I
judge people and the way I judge
companies as well is an extension of
that is I don't judge them by their
mistakes
because that's not a standard that you'd
want civilization to hold
I don't judge you by your mistake I do
judge you by what you do about it
because once you do something about it
then I can see what kind of person you
are so this is Elon Musk
hire somebody maybe have something to do
with who we hired maybe it didn't
but it was a mistake and instead of
making excuses he just says that's a
total mistake
fixes it quickly right in front of you
and then throws on a kicker the kicker
is it's going to get more traffic and
then he tells you directly yeah it's
going to get more traffic now watch this
you can't you can't fix something harder
than that
right that is fixed harder than the
original you can't beat that that you're
you're seeing the best human behavior
made a mistake it was a mistake fixed it
here you go
can't get better than that that's the
ultimate human behavior
all right
and that brings me to my final page of
notes which it turns out are empty
and so I must be just about done was
there a story I missed today any
anything that was bothering you that you
said to yourself
I'd like to hear more about that
what
oh my God my sandbag is talking again
no I didn't give your name
you have a name
it turns out the sandbags have names
yeah well what is your name
that's funny
he says his name is De SanDisk
DeSantis
that's not funny
I tell you sandbags are terrible at puns
they're terrible upon us these
this guy's been trying all day and that
was the best he could come up with to
sand this come on
I'll tell you what I'll turn you into a
silicon chip myself if you'll just shut
up all right
all right is there anything else
happening
City bike Karen that story is old
uh
Elon and RFK what about them
do you think I should use the sandbag as
my uh my co-star on the episodes
because a lot of people have you know
the the sidekick
no no sidekick all right we won't use
the sidekick
the ATR has spoken
if you were on the locals platform you'd
know what the ATR is
now if you were reading the Dilbert
reborn comic which is available only on
subscription both on Twitter and on the
locals platform if you were
reading that
you would find out that dilber's company
uh
just uh hired a new VP of marketing for
their power tools division
it's a woman
and she immediately suggests hiring
Dylan mulvady
to be the
uh
to be the face of their power saws
so that that's happening in the Dilbert
coming
um
it's just like just like reality
no they can't use Black and Decker
that's racist Black and Decker
that's a racist tool
how much does locals cost
I believe now locals is lots more
content than just the Dilbert reborn
comic
so you got lots more there and that's uh
uh seven dollars a month
but if you buy a annual it's five bucks
a month
on Twitter is three dollars a month but
that just gets you the Dilbert reborn
comic I'm thinking of putting some of
the archive
up there
what do you think of me re-running the
archive from the first day
just the the first day of Dilbert and
then just go day by day
so you can see the new one but you could
also see the 35 Euros to go on at the
same time
well what would be better to do the same
comic that ran on the same day
I'll probably just start from the start
all right well I'm thinking of doing
that
um it's going to be a little extra work
teach Andrew Tate the art of cartooning
Nancy I
I don't think I need his competition
but there are some spots and newspapers
that opened up so he's got that going
for him
you wouldn't live long enough to see all
of them oh that's a good point if I ran
the entire Dilbert archive from the
beginning it would take 35 years to get
to the end
one a day
that is so weird I can't hold that in my
head that if I did one a day I would
take 35 years for you to see them all
I actually like I can't even hold that
in my head
it's true and yet you can't like
conceive it
yeah maybe maybe a week of them or
something I know I'll have to think
about it
uh yeah seventy dollars for a year on
locals I'm sorry
that is the correct number 70 a year
all right
um
Lauren covet doesn't cause blood clots
and blindness
I've never heard that it did
so I agree with you but we also don't
know what Jamie Foxx's actual condition
is we don't know and we also don't know
what other possible things it could have
been
there there's lots we don't know there
and maybe we should keep it that way
the dill burritos probably not coming
back
he's playing pickleball with fetterman
all right
Ray Charles sequel oh my God
oh no did that really happen
uh oh that's bad but it has to be
repeated
so
oh that no I can't even say it that's
that's too bad
there there was a
a reference there that wasn't really
making fun of Jamie Foxx
not really
but you would take it that way it's a
little too soon a little too soon for
that I guess I like JB Fox too much if
we're Biden I'd probably say it but
Jamie Foxx is actually sort of beloved
I appreciate him too much to
have any fun with his situation
all right yeah too soon too soon
shipping strike
is that going to happen
all right um
oh yeah I saw the the article about
liberal women over 30 or becoming Trad
wives
well I don't know that that's backed by
data but it was a
an article that said that the
radicalized you know 20-something women
sort of disappear after they reach a
certain age and get married
and it turns out they're not finding any
meaning this is the hypothesis that
they're not getting any meaning from the
complaining that their meaning comes
from you know family traditional kind of
stuff so once they find that
then they they lose their
Fury revolutionary
energy
which makes sense
yeah
it makes sense that when you're so this
is what I've often said
you have to be somehow attached to the
reproductive process to find meaning in
your life but you could be attached in a
variety of ways for example if you
didn't have any kids of your own
but you were a pediatrician
you'd probably find great meaning in
that because you're literally keeping
children alive
if you were a teacher
you didn't have your own kids but every
day you were teaching kids to be better
kids
that probably would have a lot of
meaning
I imagine
but if you didn't have any attachment to
the reproductive
you know making kids adults process it's
hard hard to find any meaning in that
now some of you have probably asked why
in the world did I ever get married in
the first place you know since I have
two marriages and two divorces and both
of them had a step kid element to them
and part of the attraction is that it
was a family situation and when you're
attached to any
family situation you feel more meaning
in your life and I absolutely did so I
absolutely felt more meaning
um and that was the best part of being
married really to me that was the best
part
is that you felt complete
would you agree
because because if you judge marriage
from how much fun it is you don't get
the right answer
right
yeah you can't judge it by entertainment
can't judge it by fun can't judge you by
how much sex you get or don't get
I mean all those matter but that's not
why you do it you either Feel Complete
or you don't
and that's why to me divorce was very uh
let's say damaging
because I wasn't thinking oh I'm going
to lose all those fun times I was
thinking I was incomplete
so that that's what you end up with
now you might notice that
um
after my first marriage broke down
I made a uh a vow that I'm not sure if I
said it publicly
you'll have to fact check me on this
have I ever said this publicly
that after my first marriage broke down
I donated myself to the public
did you did I ever say that out loud
yeah I literally donated myself you know
my my blood and energy to the public
so that gives me a sense of meaning
and
you know every day when I hear from
people who they they say I changed their
lives made them more money they lost
weight stopped drinking all that stuff
that is really meaningful
really meaningful because I know all
that stuff is translating into how you
treat your family
right if everything is better with you
and it's better with your kids too
they're happy you lost weight they're
happy you made more money they're happy
you gave up alcohol
so
uh
I've decided to be as useful as I can to
the
you know full body of the American and
maybe World public
and
that gives me tremendous meaning
if you ever wonder why I do so much of
this I mean because I don't need to be
here right
I literally don't need to be here
there's nothing pushing me I have no
fear I'm not trying to get away from a
fear
I'm here because it has meaning
and I think it would be useful to some
of you
that's why I'm here
now I monetize it
because I'm not a fool
so of course it's monetized but I would
do something else if only money was the
thing right yeah I wouldn't act this way
if it was only about money
all right that was all for now YouTube
thanks for joining I'll see you tomorrow
you've been great today
