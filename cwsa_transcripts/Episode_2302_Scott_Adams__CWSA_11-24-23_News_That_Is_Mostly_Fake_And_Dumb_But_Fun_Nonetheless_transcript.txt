good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization
coffee with Scott Adams and if you'd
like to take this experience which might
be in a simulation or it might be real
there's no way to know you might be a
brain in a jar but if you'd like to take
that experience whatever it is up to
levels that nobody can even imagine with
their little brains all you need is a
cup or muger glass a tankered cheler
Stein a canteen juger flask a vessel of
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee join me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dopamine of the
day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous up
happens now
go
ah
Divine
Sublime exceptional savor it all right
let's talk about the stuff the theme for
today is uh everything is fake and none
of the news is true and the stuff that's
true is
ridiculous so kind of a perfect day
after
Thanksgiving um by the way if you didn't
catch it I did a live stream of uh
cooking my meal yesterday had about
2,000 people attend so and then I asked
people how many of you are alone today a
lot you know I I think this whole
loneliness thing is way bigger than you
think cuz if you're not personally
lonely it's completely invisible problem
cuz people aren't dying of loneliness
exactly it just happens to be their
biggest problem but they they suffer
silently because that's what loneliness
is if they had you to complain to they
wouldn't be
lonely but uh we we'll figure that out
maybe AI will solve it so anyway
remember that story about what might
have been a
terrorist bomb on the rainbow bridge
between US and Canada and the latest is
it was a $300,000 Bentley that exploded
in a fireball there was no bomb
inside uh and it killed a wealthy New
York couple they may have suffered
mechanical
failure now that really that makes
mechanical failure to a lot of lot of
lifting doesn't it as they like to say
I'm getting tired of that saying does a
lot of
lifting but uh what what kind of
mechanical failure uh makes your car
drive to Canada and crash into things
and turn into a
fireball so that's not the best
advertisement for
Bentley but do you believe it was a
mechanical
failure I'm going to say no on the
mechanical
failure it just doesn't doesn't really
track with any real life experience I've
ever heard of or seen or been in
autopilot but not a high
speed yeah no I don't know there's
something still missing maybe one of
them was suicidal maybe there's
something we don't know I'm going to say
that one's a big question mark but
that's my first example of news you
should not believe in the first day or
two and uh that that's a warning to
myself by the way cuz I I fell for the
first story
too well the Wall Street Journal is
reporting uh and this should be no
surprise do you know why we were all
fooled by the uh Rainbow Bridge story do
you remember where the bad reporting
came
from it wasn't a it wasn't a national
Outlet it was the local
news am I right it it was a local news
unit I think that said it was a terror
attack
well um what about that local news well
the Wall Street Journal is reporting
that a lot of the local newspapers now
the the bridge thing I think it was a
local TV thing but they they have what
they call ghost
newsrooms so they're now a lot of local
papers they have literally no
reporters all they do is you know take
content from some Central source and if
they have a local story they get some
what are called stringers you know
somebody that you get just to do a
project um yeah a number of them are
owned by the same entities that just
feed them stuff now you might you might
say to yourself Scott why do these
newspapers even stay in business who
exactly is even buying a local
newspaper uh and part of the answer is
that they're owned by really really rich
people who uh don't need to make money
you know they're owned by hedge funds
and you know people just want some clout
I guess but uh they're not really
for-profit so much as they used to be
it's more like for influence I guess
maybe somebody just likes to own a
newspaper um but just think of that so
these uh newspapers have become like
these pemin
Village I just said that so I could
sound smart how many of you know what a
p pkin
Villages that's just one of those things
that douchebags like me say in public so
that that 3/4 of the people will say
pkin Village
huh so uh do you think we should cross
the
Rubicon yeah that's just another one of
those douchebag things that people like
me like to say uh should we we read the
uh eponymous book or the uh should we
consider the
Zeitgeist those are all the douchebag
things that people like to say AIC
Victory yes it was a pic victory in the
pemin village after they crossed the
Rubicon none of that mean means
anything but um the poor these ghost
newsrooms now I'm old enough to remember
or any of you old enough to remember
when the local newspapers had reporters
and also good Comics does anybody
remember when the local newspapers
they're like physical things you hold
your hands and when I say there're
physical things you hold in your hands I
mean I mean they they come off on your
hands and when you're done you look like
you just you raped a pile of coal and
you're like H I can't touch my food or
my face until I wash my hands so that's
called a newspaper if nobody if you're
not old enough to remember that and they
used to have these things called good
Comics like a Dilbert have you heard of
it it was it it used to be in local
newspapers and also National ones and
yeah they got rid of that and all the
reporters so now those newspapers are
just pkin
Villages because they crossed the
Rubicon was kind of in the
Zeitgeist yeah that's how smart I am I
got words I know
words all right so uh reports from small
business users users small business
owners
in San Francisco is that uh now that
President she has returned back to
China that uh San Francisco is returning
back to
turville so the uh turds Ville is back
open and uh if you'd like to visit bring
your big boots and when I say your big
boots I mean the boots you're going to
throw away after every walk they should
make disposable boots for San Francisco
that they'd have to be like thigh high
because you know what you want to think
add you really at the moment you only
need boots that are like ankle sized but
think
ahead you're going to need knee high
boots pretty soon you might as well go
for a thigh high get
ahead cuz you know they've crossed the
Rubicon in their pin Village that's the
zist uh here's a horrible story um there
was oh this is terrible a New Jersey
teacher a a 38-year-old woman Lydia
Pinto uh she was accused of having years
of sex with a teenage boy and uh wow she
was arrested now I I know a lot of you
are going to say because I know my
audience you going to say oh Scott that
oh you're saying it already all right
you're disgusting you're disgusting
people are saying the poor boy it's all
sarcastically oh the poor teenage boy he
had sex with an attractive adult woman
for
years no I want you to know that I I
personally have a friend who was in this
situation now wasn't a teacher but it
was a say I'll just say an authority
figure an authority figure and when he
was a teenager the same age as this
young poor victim in this story um he
had a similar situation where an older
female victimized him and if you think
he didn't have lasting damage from that
well you're wrong he did you know I knew
him later and he had nerve damage
starting like up toward the top of his
fingers and extending almost down past
the wrist area pretty bad nerve damage
from that situation not directly from
the situation but every time he told the
story he would get high-fived so hard
that over time he just lost all feeling
above the elbow
so what you need to know is that these
are dangerous situations and not to be
made light of because I know somebody
who's in that situation and tragic is
the only word that can describe
it well there's a uh Dei that's a
diversity Equity inclusion consultant in
Ohio who wrote a book called decentering
whiteness and then wrote about it in
Forbes and that got uh Senator JD Vance
and V ramaswami candidate for president
um both were criticizing it but
uh what the consultant
said uh is that decentering whiteness
and I'm not even going to say anything
about her her hairstyle which which
maybe acts against the decentering
whiteness concept because her hairstyle
look
like you know maybe it didn't come
directly from her African Roots but she
wants to decenter whiteness in other
areas uh not related to hairstyle and I
don't know the details of this but um I
do know that if you said decentering
anything else it would be judged as
super racist but not decentric whiteness
uh however JD Vance and F ramaswami both
think this should be worthy of
condemnation and the uh consultant who
wrote This Book
said in her defense she said whoa whoa
whoa what you don't understand is I'm
not talking about any individual white
person she said I'm talking about a
situation you know a
system do you know anybody who got
cancelled for saying the same thing is
there anybody who said I'm not talking
about any individuals it's more like the
system any have you ever heard of
anybody who got got cancelled because of
that I feel like it rings a bell
something about even if you're not
talking about individuals you're talking
about a system not even a group you're
not even talking about a group of people
you're talking about a system so as she
explained she's not talking about white
people but rather there's a system that
involves a lot of centering whiteness
yeah but has anybody ever been cancelled
for having that point of view H I don't
know I just can't think of anybody can't
think of
anybody well here's the next fake
story uh do you remember I explained to
you in detail how this new new
technology for AI called
qar might be the secret that created
some kind of conscious you know AGI
super intelligence within chat GPT that
that may be the real secret behind the
the story I got pretty excited about
that all of it was
 every bit of it was wrong 100%
of what I told you not even
close right so as of
today what I think is true and I'm
reading Brian relli and some other
people who know what they're talking
about um that whole qar
thing might make AI a little bit better
in some specific ways but no big
deal so so it went from God intelligence
that will own Earth any day now it's the
most dangerous thing in the world too
you know it might help you with math a
little bit and that's
it none of it was anything and
probably probably there's nothing like
AGI you know the the real super
intelligence there's probably nothing
like that at open AI or anywhere else
probably doesn't exist
anywhere I think maybe there's just
optimism that somebody will figure it
out uh so but it looks like as
uh as some smart people are saying that
the real game here with AI is which data
they have available to trade on so if
you think about it these social these
social media
networks May soon find that their entire
value is that it trains AI in a way that
competitors can't do it because you know
you know for example X will use the
traffic on X to train its AI but that
won't be available to other companies
you know uh Facebook will train on you
know train on their data Amazon will
train on their data and they all have
different
data
so
yeah if there's one thing I want AI to
do for my
purchases is this I'm very bad at
ordering things online that are the
right scale does anybody have that
problem you you'll buy a couch
online and it'll come it's like it's
it's like a toy or something um I
thought I was buying a real couch I
thought this price was unusually good
but it's actually a Barbie couch it's
not even a real
couch and and it'll be normal things
like you buy plates oh I bought a set of
plates oh I should have read that
they're only 5 in in diameter like who
who even sells a plate that's 5 in in
diameter like so there are ordinary
things that I don't check the size on
like if you buy a
chair doesn't your brain say well it's
probably like the size of a adult human
being cuz it's a chair and then you get
it it's like a little pkin
chair no that's the wrong use of pkin
but you didn't know it did you
sort of a Zeitgeist penin Crossing the
Rubicon kind of a
chair anyway so that'll help uh
meanwhile grock is coming that would be
Elon musk's AI so I already signed up
for that premium plus I don't know $20 a
month whatever it is $16 a month I can't
remember but I signed up for it so when
grock is available which could happen
any time next week um we're going to
have some fun I don't know what to
expect from that so I guess it will be
two versions of grock in the sense that
you could turn off its personality so
you know it has that kind of humorous
personality where it jokes with you
would you turn it off let me ask you do
you think you'd be sick of the little
jokes it makes and turn it off or would
you be happy that it jokes with
you I think I would turn it off off
after a few weeks of just seeing what it
does because the jokes it makes are off
they off task like if if it makes you
think about the joke when you just
wanted an answer and you're you know
it's one of many things you're doing
today I'm I think I'll turn the jokes
off but initially they're good initially
they're good because it you makes a
little more friendly and maybe I'd keep
them on we'll see how you know you don't
really know how you use it until use it
but I feel like I'd probably turn it off
after a
while yeah cuz one of the things it does
is it tries too
hard like it tries too hard to be that
person you know sometimes just give me
the answer you know if you had if you
had a friend who had a big
personality they wouldn't put their big
personality in every single
statement it would just sort of be there
as a background but AI would probably
try to throw it in every answer it's
it's going to be a little too much I
think all right speaking of
that what's going to happen when you can
create your own
porn just by talking to your
computer and what happens when you can
give it a picture of your ex or anybody
you work with or anybody in the world
and it takes one photograph and it can
turn it into their voice well I guess
you need a voice clip you need one voice
clip and one photograph and then you can
talk it into
any pornographic scene you want so we're
we're basically right on the edge of
doing that and we'll definitely be able
to do that within a year imagine the
entire porn
industry disappearing in a
year could that
happen that could actually happen now
the thing I don't know because I've
predicted that we won't like AI
art this is this is one of my
predictions that um I don't think
anybody agrees with so I'm going to keep
saying it so you remember I said it if I
see a painting or let's say a musical
composition by a human being I'm very
aware that the thing I'm responding to
is that that the human made it here's
something that I know as an artist that
you would never know the art is always
about the
artist you didn't know that did you the
art is not about the
creation the art is always about the
artist if you don't get that you'll
think that AI can do art that people
will want to enjoy they will not because
the artist is a
machine I'm not going to be impressed
and the reason that we're the reason
that art is about the artist is that
what is being triggered is our
evolutionary mating Instinct
art appeals to us this is my my
hypothesis this is not based on any
research this is based on my lived
experience if you will art is about
responding to the amazingness of the
artist there's a uh drummer who's all
over social media I don't know if you
see him I can't remember his name a
bearded guy who drums so quickly that
it's almost like a different instrument
like his hands
go and he can do things that you just
don't think are possible he he can uh
smack the uh stick down on the drum and
while he's looking at the camera he
grabs the stick out of the air and then
keeps going like crazy
stuff now when I listen to him drum do I
say to myself wow
that is some musically excellent
drumming nope
nope I mean maybe it is but it doesn't
like do anything to me it doesn't move
me it's just a different way to do
drumming not really special in terms of
how it sounds but the fact that he can
do something that you don't think a
human being could even do makes it
art if you if you said I have a computer
that can make the same sound as as this
guy nobody would listen to it
oh but we'll we'll make it visual I'll
make an AI guy who's D drumming exactly
like that real guy zero interest because
it's not the real guy I'm only
interested because a guy did
it when when you look at a van go do you
think you would buy any van go art if it
had only been made by a machine and
there had never been a van
go
no no
no not even
close you wouldn't have the slightest
interest all right now if I haven't sold
you yet if I haven't sold you yet wait
for it here comes the kill
shot imagine if Ai and only AI had
created the Mona
Lisa big famous
painting put in the
Lou do you do you think it would be the
most famous art in the
world nope
you wouldn't even show it to your best
friend if you produce that on your own
and like the AI created literally the
Mona Lisa and had never existed
before who would care zero people zero
the only thing that makes the Mona Lisa
the Mona Lisa is who made it and the
fact that you're like wow like a an
early human being you know without
technology made that
wow yeah so watch for that I and um so
the initial conversation was pornography
while it might be true that you can
create exactly the pornography that
looks like real humans doing real things
in a year it might never replace actual
porn because you'll know it's not
people so there's already uh anime porn
you know sort of cartooned versions and
it's actually pretty popular but
it never really you know crossed a
certain threshold in the general public
you know is popular with I know 10 or
15% of men or something but never really
probably won't grow beyond
that so anyway keep an eye on that but
imagine a world in which you can speak
into
reality uh any of your co-workers or
friends or into a porn do you think
that's going to be much
viral that is going to be so viral so I
think that um AI porn will mostly be
used for humor and even political memes
right so right now it's really easy to
make a a photograph you know take a
photograph and add some words to it and
and how popular are memes like I saw one
a meme today that just made me laugh
like crazy memes are really really
powerful now imagine that could be a 10
or 15 second AI reel with video as
completely pornographic and you can put
in you know world leaders you can throw
in Michelle Obama doing who knows what
anything you want I don't mean to you
know just pick one person but
anybody that's going to be the the most
popular memes are just going to be
pornographic memes with real
people how how do you stop it I mean
there's no way around
it all right um Trump is doing his good
mocking today speaking memes he Trump s
around on Truth a meme of Joe Biden
talking on the phone uh next to his
convertible you know his what kind of
convertible is it it's
a is it a Corvette I forget it's AET
yeah um so anyway the meme is Biden on
the phone next to his convertible and
he's saying on the phone according to
the meme Hello Jill I locked my keys in
the car again
now it's it's funnier because Trump
posted it right it was already
funny but the fact that Trump posted it
just takes it to another level because
you know somebody running for president
isn't supposed to be posting memes like
that so the the naughtiness of it or the
inappropriateness of it is what Trump
understands here's a little humor
tip you you do a different type of humor
for each kind of
distribution if I'm writing humor for a
comic that will just sit there on a page
and people will you know read it by
themselves you have to write it
completely differently than if you're a
public speaker or you're saying
something on a meme that you know is
broadcast you you you will get a much
bigger laugh if you're a public figure
saying something that people know public
figures are not supposed to say and
that's what does over and over again
it's
like somebody send me a porographic uh
Meme Over on the locals the on locals
you can uh include photos in your uh in
your comments so now
people I can't I'm not going to tell you
what I'm seeing but it's pretty
funny all right uh so Trump's doing a
good job mocking I think mockery is the
way mockery is the way I'm going to say
a lot more about that as we go because
we're going to spend we people who are
mostly on this live stream probably many
of you are leaning right and you're
going to have to spend another year
being accused of being a Nazi because
that's all the Democrats have against
Trump and uh and against whoever you
know if it's not Trump if it's somebody
else who gets nominated they're going to
do the same thing yeah I mean just think
about this
if V
ramaswami becomes the
nominee they will accuse him of being
Hitler just just hold that in your mind
for a
minute because it's all they have
they're they're actually going to accuse
the brown guy being
Hitler that's really going to happen and
you know it right now if if it's not
orange Hitler it's going to be brown
Hitler right now that shows you how
bankrupt their approach is it it's just
sort of if all you have is a hammer you
know everybody looks like a nail but
good
luck good luck selling that so I think
we need to mock it out of
existence and we need to meme it out of
existence or even embrace it now ever
since I started calling my audience
colonizers have you noticed that how you
feel about the word like you're starting
to make it into a joke
word so maybe more more you should call
yourself a colonizer but importantly you
should not let anybody else use the
CW colonizer is what you can call
yourself but you don't let other people
call you a colonizer that's the c-word
that's reserved sorry that's
reserved uh Elon Musk is going to Israel
next week
which raises some questions he's going
to meet with Netanyahu and two of the
boots that was uh most impacted by the
homas attack and why do you think he's
doing
that what's your best
guess do you think it has something to
do with um needing his support for
military
reasons could it be about
starlink could it be about rebuilding
Gaza could be about
rebuilding let me ask you this if you
were Israel and you were trying to
figure out what to do with Gaza and you
knew that you couldn't just turn it back
into what it used to be but you can't
you also can't just make it Israel you
know like just Israel that's going to be
a problem so what do you do let me tell
you what I would do I would invite Elon
Musk and I would say to Elon Musk what
do you think we should do
here what how do you think we should
handle this and because here's the way
the only way I think you could handle
it you say why don't we build it so it's
the the greenest electric place ever
because I'm guessing that um solar power
works really well in Gaza is that fair
to say solar power probably works really
really well in Gaza
so if you were if you were uh looking to
rebuild and you knew that the source of
energy was always going to be a problem
in Gaza like where does the energy come
from and you also wanted somebody who
knew a lot about
desalinization and somebody who is
building self-driving
cars how would you build a a city from
scratch I would ask Elon Musk does he
want to build a city from scratch and
I'd let him build it you know or at
least you know maybe be on the be on an
advisory committee of people building it
or something like
that because I I can't honestly can't
imagine a better person to ask the
question what do you do with Gaza can
you I mean seriously can you think of
one person on the planet you'd rather
ask that question what do you think we
should do with it once we're done well
yeah actually you're saying Trump
Trump's Trump is a good suggestion but
if you want to do something that's
really
groundbreaking like here if I'm
Netanyahu this is how I'm thinking now
remember Netanyahu is not your normal
world leader if you don't know this he's
unusually smart do you all know that
Netanyahu is not like you know the
ordinary leader he's he's like a level
above just in raw intelligence do you
think that Netanyahu is thinking let's
build Gaza back so it's sort of like it
used to
be I I don't think that's even slightly
possible do you think that he's saying
let's build it back so it's different
but it's basically just as good do you
think he would do that I don't think so
because the smart play is to build it
back so it's like the Jewel of the
Middle
East right build it back so it's the
model of people getting along it's the
very model of uh Islam and everybody
else getting along in the same place now
you would have to do serious serious
vetting of who you let in and who you
don't so that you can make sure they can
live
together but wouldn't you need to
replace the schools you couldn't have a
school system in hos where they're
teaching them to kill Jews so you would
need a high-end AI based school probably
some AI you know fundamentally AI driven
school and you would need here's how I
would do it I would have no private cars
in
Gaza I would have all electric and I
would ask musk if he wants to be the the
one who owns basically all the cars in
Gaza and if they're all electric and
they're all self-driving self-driving
like
taxis then they would have the best
trans transportation system in the
entire
world in 5 years they could have
actually the best Urban Transportation
imagine just going outside and the only
vehicles are
self-driving and you just take your wrap
and you walk to the corner and one pulls
up you never have to do maintenance you
never have to buy gas you just use it
when you need
it so you would you wouldn't have much
traffic either just think about about
this if all the cars were autonomous and
they were
networked you wouldn't need stop signs
or stop lights think about that you
wouldn't need stop signs or stop lights
because the cars would know where the
other ones were and they would just go
go past each other without touching you
know not close I mean you'd make sure
that they slowed down enough so
everybody had a nice you know big hole
to go through but wouldn't you want to
live there I mean except for other
problems wouldn't you love to live in a
city where you could walk outside a car
drives up takes you anywhere and never
has to slow
down that would change everything about
your
experience if you could order food and
the car just pulls up and you just take
it out of the
car so here's what I think I've told you
a billion times that the future is
building cities from
scratch this should be the city from
scratch it should be the one place where
they try to do everything right from the
first moment you know be before you even
put one brick back you make sure you've
planned you know how people could live
together how they could be educated how
they can get around how they could grow
food do you know what uh Elon musk's
brother is
into I think he's still into it but
Kimble Kimble Musk he does indoor
gardens in indoor
Farms now if you had indoor
Farm to everything that Elon has in his
basket of services remember he's got
your internet service in the sky he's
got your self-driving cars he's got your
uh energy CU you could put the Tesla
batteries in your homes he has the big
batteries so that you can do just solar
the whole thing solar rooftop if you
want between the musks the musk Brothers
they could rebuild
Gaza and even has the money to do
it what about the people who want to opt
down well that's the thing is that Gaza
is going to be largely empty so it's not
people want to opt out it would be
you're going to have to opt in right so
there's no opting out everybody's out
you're starting out out is the defa
nobody's in so you got to you got to get
in that's that's the only
challenge so it would be in expensive
and inefficient I doubt it I think you
could get the uh cost of rebuilding
really low if you did it right and I
think you can make the cost of living
there the the best cost of living and
the highest I bet you can make the
highest quality of living in the world
in 5 years and this is why I think
Israel needs to do this
if you build it back the way it was you
just recreate the problem if you build
it back and it's sort of the same
quality but it's just Israelis living
there it's just another settlement so
that's just another problem but if you
make it better than anything ever
was and also you make sure that you
bring back a good a good percentage of
the Palestinians but you vet the hell
out of them and you educate their
children in schools that don't uh
militarize
them I I would be impressed at that
outcome space Jason says Scott you're
okay with half the Palestinians being
sent to the
US ask better questions that is a really
dumb question do you really think I'm
going to say
yes of course not no the Palestinians
have a problem but I don't think America
should solve
it if if you can't get Egypt to take
them and you can't get Jordan to take
them taking them in North America is the
dumbest thing we would ever do
it would literally be the dumbest thing
we ever did and do you know why that's
not
racist well I know it's not because the
decentering whiteness um consultant says
that you can say that's more about the
system and that's really not about any
individual cuz if it were if it were
about any individuals it'd be racist but
it's not it's about a
system so if a Dei consultant says it's
okay I'm okay with it too all
right uh the other possibility well not
possibility the the other definite fact
we can say about musk going to Israel is
that there's one person in the world who
can give you a popel likee you here here
I'm using an analogy a popel likee
uh what do you call it uh absolvement is
that a word from being considered
anti-semitic here's what musk needs he
needs Netanyahu to stand next to him and
put his arm around him and say whatever
you're saying about this guy stop it
this this guy loves Israel stop it you
just need Netanyahu to say it directly
to everybody hey everybody do you know
what's good for you right imagine nyaho
saying this and he should he should he
should say look let's pull together
Israel doesn't need any enemies this is
our
friend he's our friend and he can
absolutely say what he wants to say
about you know ceasefires he's here just
to help this is the least anti-semitic
guy you'll ever have he's doing real
things to make things better stop it
just stop the division he's on our side
well he's not on our side that would be
the wrong thing to say it'd be better to
say he's on the side of
humanity that would be a better way to
say it right right I think it would be a
mistake to say he's on the side of the
Jews it would be better to say he's
clearly on the side of humanity are we
going to agree on everything no but stop
it just just stop going after him for
being anti-semitic you're not helping
Israel cuz the last thing you want is
for mus the back
out the last thing you want is for mus
to say all right I'm out you know I I
hear your criticisms I'm out you don't
want that you do not want that and
Netanyahu can fix that so we'll see if
he does I'm going to I'm going to
predict that netan will fix that or
he'll he'll take a big step toward
fixing it because it's good for him it's
good for America it's good for Jews in
America it's good good for the
Palestinians because musk is not
anti-palestinian that's
important so yes and N is smart so he'll
do that I
think all right um so there's a big
arrest the cartel's New York Post is
reporting that uh this uh the Mexican
president and the Mexican government has
apparently picked up this alleged cartel
security boss who's accused of feeding
his Rivals to Tigers so I guess they
have trained tigers that they throw
people in the cage and let them eat them
so he's sort of the enforcer guy and uh
so he got picked up do you believe this
story do you believe that on the surface
it's exactly what it looks like that Mex
and apparently he's in the cartel that
does a lot of fentanyl so so fentanyl is
the underlying you know big problem here
that that he's part of the fenal
production uh cartel so here's what I
think because this kind of story is it's
always sort of a oneoff like you never
see and they took down the whole whole
cartel it's always
oneof do you know what it makes me
think that this is just how the cartel
demotes somebody that they needed to
demote to me it looks like somebody else
just got his job
and that it was like corporate Intrigue
and like maybe this guy did something to
the wrong person you know maybe he
talked to somebody he shouldn't have and
the cartel decided to to nark him out
and just hand him over to the government
so I feel like the cartel itself said
you know what we want to get rid of this
guy so why don't you pretend you're
arresting him we'll just give him to you
and then the United States will say oh
it looks like you're working looks like
you're working with Mexico so we don't
need to send the military in cuz you you
know what's going to happen if a
republican becomes
president yeah the president of Mexico
isn't going to be handing us over one
 guy every
year that's not going to happen but it's
a good story for why you don't need to
send your American Military down because
you know look it's obvious that the
Mexican government's making progress
they picked up this guy and then a year
ago they picked up that other guy so
that's two guys in two years so that's
pretty good progress right two people in
two years right right so to me this
looks like a fake
story meaning that he probably did get
picked up he probably did get arrested
he probably did feed people to tigers
that part probably true but the part
about we we're making progress against
the cartels because we got this guy I'm
not buying that uh that to me this looks
like a human sacrifice and maybe they
just he was expendable
because a guy like that the guy who
feeds people to the Tigers he's not
exactly careful you know what I mean
eventually he's going to he's going to
feed the wrong guy to a tiger and
somebody's going to say um that was uh
that was actually my cousin you fed to
that tiger
uh so you know you got to
go all right so we'll keep an eye on
that but I don't believe anything about
the uh I don't believe anything our
government says about progress against
fenel I don't believe anything that
Biden agreed to with she will make a
difference I also wouldn't would believe
that if Trump had made the same
agreement doesn't matter who does it I
don't believe China's going to change I
don't believe the cartels are going to
change I would believe a military strike
in the
cartels like that would look real short
of that it's all
pretend well mayor Eric Adams um of
course a prominent in the Democrat Party
mayor of New York and he's being accused
of some kind of rape from many years ago
uh you should listen to his
denial if you want to hear how an actual
honest denial sounds listen to Eric
Adams so his
denial sounds absolutely
legitimate Absolut absolutely because
here's what you don't say oh I I uh
certainly you know that didn't happen uh
why do I keep getting accused of things
and you know sort of weaseling around
the question he looks at the camera and
says that did not
happen I've never met her I have no I
have no memory of her none of that
happened that's a good answer now keep
in mind though keep in mind when people
are prepared for the question and that
used to be a police officer so you've
seen every kind of lie they would be
good at
lying right he would be good at lying
because he's seen it from both sides he
would know how to do it however I'm
going to defend him
completely uh I saw the reporter ask him
this question apparently the accuser is
literally famous for being a Serial
accuser and wrote a book on how to
accuse
people so the the accuser is so
amazingly sketchy that once you hear
even a little bit about the accuser it's
obviously not
true let me say it again it's obviously
not true now here's the here's the
detail that I like to tell people who
don't know do you know how often public
figures get accused credibly accused
credibly like an actual person gives
details of sexual uh abuse and
rape it happens all the
time yeah do you know how many times
I've been accused by a woman in Canada
who I've never met she's just been my
stalker for years but she used to call
people I did business with in the United
States my Publishers and give them
detailed accounts of me raping her never
matter I can't I don't even remember her
name she's up in Canada somewhere and
she would go off her meds every you know
every once a year or so I think it I
think that's what it was literally offer
meds and she would have very detailed um
accusations about me going to her house
in Canada and rifling through a computer
and while I was there I did something to
her children right really detailed never
met her just crazy person in Canada now
and that's not the only one it's like if
you're a public figure it's just it just
is a routine serial kind of thing that
happens all the time now if you didn't
know that if you didn't know that that
it's routine for public figures to have
these crazy accusations then you would
look at mayor Adams and you'd say to
yourself you
know when people are accused of things
like that they're usually
guilty nope reverse it for public
figures for public figures they're
usually not guilty because there's a far
more prevalence of fake accusation
probably 5 to one now that doesn't count
for a you know Harvey Weinstein type for
them the real ones would be you know 10
to one for any fake one but they're
unusual yeah a real person like a real
ordinary public figure will have many
more fake ones than any real one that
might be
real you have to know that to understand
this kind of story all right uh hostage
exchange apparently is going forward
forward um and um it's we're getting up
you know minute by- minute changes first
it was delayed but now looks like it's
going to happen maybe 13 or so or 25
have been exchanged
already
um yeah
so so I don't know the details but it
looks like something's happening that's
productive and then we hear that no
Americans will be among the initial 13
hostages well if it's only
13 you know I wouldn't expect
necessarily too many Americans out just
13
but you you wonder if Hamas is
intentionally going to hold back the
Americans do you think they
will I feel like they
will or or it's or you have to ask if
there are any Americans still
alive you I think they probably hate the
Israelis more than the Americans but to
them they would just all be Jews that
they' captured probably they probably
don't even make a
difference all
right um so I guess there's not much to
say about it except we'll keep an eye on
it and uh I'll say again that we don't
know the real game here we don't know to
what extent Israel is going to learn
something by watching how the exchange
happens or talking to the people that
they get back to figure out where other
people are Etc but I'm strongly on the
side of saying that Israel is making the
right
decision to negotiate for these
hostages and I like the fact that Israel
played bad cop as long as they could you
know well they weren't really bad cop
but but they resisted the ceasefire for
all the right reasons so they you know
grudgingly they're doing it
now oh no uh Andrew Cuomo is being
now
wow anyway
um so we'll keep an eye on that so the
Pentagon apparently wants to keep his
option open for making AI able to
use uh or AI to make uh killing
decisions in war so apparently one of
our big future offensive capabilities
would be drones and it would be swarms
of drones and the only way you could
control a swarm of drones is with AI and
it wouldn't make much sense to control
it unless it could also make some
killing
decisions so do you think there was ever
any chance that AI wouldn't be making
killing
decisions that was never even possible
do you know why cuz if our drones were
not making killing decisions with AI the
enemy would because it'd be faster
so you can't really have the second fast
killing decisions can
you there's no point even building the
drones if you have to make you know
decisions the same as if you know you
were there in person it would be so INE
efficient they only kill bad guys yeah
they're so smart they only kill bad guys
now I'm certainly not saying that that's
risk-free and I'm not even saying it's a
good idea I'm just saying it's
inevitable
nothing could stop it because if we
don't do it the enemy would do it and if
the enemy does it we're going to match
it it's sort of like nuclear weapons
there there's no second path here there
is one path they will have
ai they will have the ab they will have
shooting Authority under some situations
will it go wrong will it create
skynets almost
certainly almost certainly in the long
run
so I don't know how long it'll take but
yeah almost
certainly I don't know how it could not
honestly all right um Ireland we'll talk
about so the story in Ireland is that uh
five people got stabbed including three
children by what they're calling an
alleged
immigrant outside of a school the crime
happened so the big riots and people
going crazy there uh the Irish Prime
Minister says the government is quote
very white and that it very much needs
to change to be more
diverse so that uh and somebody reported
that Ireland is 94% white but the Prime
Minister needs more
diversity do they really not even have
5% diversity in their
government they don't have 5% diversity
at
all how much more do you
need well uh yeah Conor McGregor has
weighed into this controversy a famous
uh MMA fighter and uh he's pretty darn
mad as are a lot of the locals about the
uh what they think is a dangerous
situation from lots of uh Islamic and
other
immigrants
so
so there you have it so there's not much
to
say um except people are alarmed and the
citizens are trying to fight back but
who knows how much that's going to make
a
difference uh Jack babic was posting
there's a video of people in gallway
some City in Ireland and a reporter was
asking them or somebody with a
microphone was asking if they knew what
the most common baby name was in their
town in Ireland and they were all
guessing is it Jack is it Timothy and
then after they've all guessed uh the
the second phase they're told the answer
and the answer is Muhammad yeah Muhammad
is the most popular baby's name in
Ireland do you think the Irish are a
little
worried yeah they're a little
worried a little bit
worried uh um so Elon Musk saw that post
by Jack babic and uh he weighed in he
said it's true in most countries in
Europe so in other words Elon was saying
that it's true that most countries in
Europe uh the most popular name is
Muhammad but it turns out that's not
true uh as his own uh his own Community
notes or context notes uh corrected
him how how much do you love the fact
that the guy who owns the a has now
routinely is it second or third time the
community knows as fact check the
boss I can't love that
more that like if you want one thing
that will give you some credibility in
the system is
this and and does he tell them they have
to take it down or does he delete his
tweet no he lets you see it total transp
Arcy I like everything about that but
you should know it's not true uh but it
is a trending name in in some countries
especially so it's on the rise but it's
not the number one baby
name all right uh Peta did a
post and it showed a meme where uh
turkeys were around a dinner table and
there was like a a human being that they
were going to eat and Peta said uh we're
lucky that turkeys would never do this
to us you don't have to do it to them
either and then uh on X there was a
reader context
note so that got fact checked so Peter
is saying the turkeys would never eat
humans and here's the fact check turkeys
are not vegetarians turkeys eat mice
lizard frogs and just about anything
they can fit in their mouths if turkeys
were larger or had the technological
means to farm and eat humans their
current diet reveals that they likely
would and and that's that that's like a
fact check on
X I like that so this this community
notes you know context fact check thing
whatever they want to call it this has
been
golden right it's not perfect it's not
perfect but oh my god when it when it
operates it's just
golden well there's more you know news
that Biden will do poorly in the
Battleground states which highly
suggests that Trump would get elected if
he's ultimately the nominee and here's
my take on
that are we going to find
out if our worst assumptions about
Democrats are true because the worst
assumption is that the entire system is
rigged which I am not aware of any proof
of that you know the courts have not
seen that but the worst assumptions on
on the uh Republican side is that there
will never be another true election that
the Democrats have so much control that
they'll just make sure no Republican is
ever president
again now I'm not going to say I believe
that to be true I'm not there yet but
that would represent the worst case
scenario right that that that things are
so badly rigged that they'll do it right
in front of you now if the polls hold
and Trump goes into election day with a
solid lead in you know all the major
polls for the Battleground
States and then he
loses and it's because a bunch of
ballots came in at
night it's going to be exactly what you
thought it
was everybody's going to say well that
is exactly what we thought it was but
can the
Democrats even if they wanted to even if
such things happened in our world and I
have no proof that they do if such
things happened in our real world would
they do it so
obviously and here's the interesting
part it's the so obviously part not
whether they would do it or not do
it because if it's not obvious well how
would you ever know who how would you
ever know if it's not
obvious but what if we get to election
day and it would be completely obvious
to every
Observer that it was a sketchy election
if it you know didn't go the way the
poll said it would go what would happen
then I don't know that could be a big
problem couldn't it but I have a feeling
that the Democrats have painted
themselves in a corner and the corner
looks like this
they're going to say for the next year
as they've been saying for past years
that Trump is uh a dictator a
Hiller how many times do you have to
tell your own people that he's Hitler
before everybody thinks it's morally and
ethically appropriate to
cheat I think there's a nonzero chance
that they will massively cheat right in
front of you because they think they
have to because they don't want Hitler
to come to power
but if they're not worried that Hitler
will come to power they're definitely
World worried that they'll get fired
right they're definitely worried that
their own power their own income and
everything will be challenged so I think
they've pained themselves in a corner I
don't know that the Democrat leadership
anymore has the capability to concede an
election in any in any
context I think that's might be gone we
might never see anybody concede an
election if they have
power right now that's the thing they
accuse Trump of right but the funniest
thing about the accusation against Trump
is somehow they imagine that other
people would have gone along with Trump
if he done something like you know
amazingly
unconstitutional it's one thing to try
to get your alternate electors in there
you know that's sketchy but it's sort of
things that courts unravel if they need
to so as long as it's something that's
you know the courts can handle in a
routine fashion it's not exactly an
Insurrection but yeah what what's going
to happen if something more radical
happens and everybody can see it I don't
know that could be dangerous we'll
see um we do have a story an Iowa County
supervisor's wife just got convicted 52
counts of voter fraud for ballot
stuffing and and her husband won so she
stuffed ballots and her husband won I
don't know if it was enough to make him
win but here's my question the fact that
you we caught somebody Bell stuffing and
by the way Democrats thought that they
had a they had a good Zinger they said
ah
Republicans Republicans so your whole
argument is crap because the cheaters
were
Republicans um
no no
that that's not a point Republicans say
that you can cheat it doesn't matter
that a republican
did the point is that it can
happen the Democrats say it can't happen
like it's
impossible well maybe it can happen
maybe maybe a republican did
it but I have a problem uh knowing how
to decipher this does the fact that she
was caught
prove that you can't get away with it or
does it prove that people are doing it
and maybe they are getting away with it
because I don't know how she got caught
and I don't know if the the system
caught her or there was like some
specific evidence that you wouldn't
normally have like a witness or a video
or something uh was there something that
how did how did she get
caught here's what I'd like to see oh
well first of all
Fulton County also just add to the story
um there's a story that and I don't know
what's true and what isn't but the story
is that 3600 duplicated ballots were
counted now in fton county in 2020 now
that wouldn't be enough that wouldn't be
enough to change the result 3600 and I
don't think anybody is saying it's
anything but a mistake CU it looks like
a pile of ballots not counted and and
it's not like they were all for uh Biden
there were more for Biden but they
weren't all for Biden so probably just a
mistake but here these two stories make
me ask the following question here's
another dog that's not
barking have any of you ever seen
anybody draw a diagram of our election
process where where you've got
everything from here's a Ballot Box and
here's a voting machine and then the
voting machines you know sum them up and
send them through this device and then
this device sends it to this clearing
Center and then you know the other
things meet so have you ever seen
anything like that where an expert who
really understands elections tells you
where the vulnerabilities
are or ultimately points to every part
of it and says you could not cheat here
we'd catch you here's why you canot
cheat here you can't cheat here in fact
the entire thing is secure
because um it can all be checked has
anybody ever done
that has any anybody ever drawn a
picture and put arrows to all the parts
and said can't she here here's why can't
she here here's why no do you know why
you've never seen
that wouldn't that be the most obvious
thing that you should see in a meme
every single day that should be a meme
every day now you and I can't make that
Meme because we don't know the details I
don't know where they could and could
not cheat I have no
idea but if somebody made
that oh somebody just let me I'm going
to click on that uh voting in
Davidson all right well it's a diagram
but it's not a could you cheat diagram
so this is sort of the dog not barking
right so one of these cases is a
republican who cheated
and uh that candidate got elected I
don't know if the cheating mattered
though so here's the question why don't
at least Republicans do that don't you
think Republicans should say hey here
are all the places you can cheat so you
better you better either get rid of
voting machines if if it looks like
that's the problem I don't know if it is
because nobody's ever shown me the the
chart I can only think of one reason
that no Republican has created that
chart because Republicans must be
cheating in the areas that they control
right because there are places where
Republicans manage the elections in
States places where the Democrats do it
based on who's in charge in the
state I have to assume Republicans are
cheating
wildly is that a fair
assumption because you're not seeing the
Republicans doing the most obvious thing
that you would do in this situation if
you belied there was only the other side
you would do everything you could to
make the public understand look there
are six parts to an election three of
them could be audited but three of them
can't there's just no way to
check
right Dan says dumb ASF logic that's the
best you could
do that's the best you could
do I got the worst trolls you have no
game at
all all
right um Republicans cheat against magga
oh maybe yeah maybe even Republicans are
cheating against Trump candidates You
Never Know Anything could happen but uh
I don't have any confidence in our
election system how many of you have
confidence that our election systems are
clean and will stay that way who's
confident confident that they're pretty
good and they'll stay that
way
nobody yeah now just you know it's just
a wall of no now just imagine
this this is what ordinary people think
of the election and I've seen the is it
rasmon who has polls that show something
like over half of the public thinks the
elections might be a little sketchy and
that's both sides you know there there's
there's a serious amount of Democrats
who think the elections could be sketchy
as
well and and we and in that context in
that context your government has never
shown you a a diagram that says here are
all the parts and here's how we audit it
and how here's how we double check so
you can know that there's no problem in
the system be the obvious thing right
remember when there were doubters for a
pandemic what did the government do when
there were when there were pandemic um
vaccination doubters what did the
government do massive education
campaign to tell you know their argument
for why the vaccination was safe
ultimately they may not have been
correct but you can see that when the
government says hey our public doesn't
trust what we're doing they always every
time they do a massive information
campaign
but not this time no no election
Integrity is like the single most
important thing for this next election
because January 6 and the so-called
Insurrection will be the biggest topic
for why a trump should or should not be
president again it's the biggest topic
it's the probably the first or second
biggest L uh
distrust of our government system and
there is no massive education campaign
to fix it there's only one reason for
that because would you agree dog not
barking would you agree that in every
other context where the public doesn't
trust their government and the
government knows they need to fix that
they do massive campaign to fix it am I
right can you think of any any other
example where the government knew they
had to re-educate the public and then
just didn't just didn't even try didn't
even
bother yeah it's got to be corruption
the only thing I can think of is that
both sides cheat and there and one side
cheated better last time and that's the
whole story that might be the whole
story you may not be right but you are
correct oh I like that I might not be
right but I am
correct all
right um BAGI shavasan who's a great
follow one of the smartest people in the
world
um by the way seriously one of the
smartest people in the world BAGI Sweden
ofon and what makes him uh impressive is
he's insanely Smart in so many different
domains that when he gives you an
opinion like you're seeing multiple
domains come into it it's a whole
different level than whatever you know
you're doing whatever you're doing is
different right he's he's he's operating
at another level but uh here's something
he said uh talking about the the the
drive to get uh corporate boards up to
um a level that would represent uh women
as well as men so that 50% of boards
might be might be female if you had you
know good Equity going
on so
bellagi um posts this he says if the
logic is that women must be 50% of
boards why shouldn't Republicans also be
50% of boards they sure are
underrepresented minority in Tech and
they showed a graph that showed
basically there's just no Republicans in
management in
Tech is that a good point because that's
diversity of
thought isn't the point of a
Bard to get diversity of
thought as well as diversity of people
isn't the reason that you get diversity
of people so that you can end up with
diversity of
thought but if they're all
Democrats are you buying much by having
male and female
Democrats I don't mean to be unkind but
there's not a big difference between a
male and a female
Democrat right because the Democrats the
women are driving the policies and the
men just agree with them it's going to
look the same a Democrat man and a
Democrat woman will have nearly
identical opinions do you think the
Democrat man is going to say no we
should have less less
diversity no because the Democrat woman
said they need more diversity so they're
going to say that so you get actually no
diversity at all if you have only
Democrats the men and the women are the
same right but there
between a Democrat of any gender and a
republican of any gender and sexual
preference as well big difference so
shouldn't your real diversity if what
you really want is diversity of thought
shouldn't it be where there is the
biggest diversity of thought and that's
a provocative
question spell his name um I will spell
his first name and you'll be able to
find him
uh it's just easier to spell his first
name uh B is in boy a l a j
i b a l a j i s I'm sorry j i no s uh
he's got an s on his uh on his well
actually if you look for his Twitter
name it's just bellagi with an s on the
end so belag
s
ofon
anyway there aren't there aren't that
many BAGI so you can you'll find them on
uh the xplatform just by searching for
his first name all right
um I saw a story that I don't
believe probably fake news allegedly the
source is Rudy J Giuliani but I don't
know if I would trust Rudy Giuliani for
this but I also don't trust the source
that says Rudy juliani is yeah so this
is just a throwaway but uh there's some
belief that zalinsky has a video of
Hunter Biden that's so damning that to
's blackmailing
Biden that sounds a little too on the
nose doesn't
it I'm not saying it's not true I just
don't know that any news source would
have that story so I'm going to say even
if it's true I think the reporting is
made
up that's my guess but no way to know no
way to
know all right ladies and gentlemen
today is Black Friday and if you're
looking for gifts for that uh $20 friend
or that $20 cousin you know the one you
don't want to spend a lot but you got to
have something to wrap and put under the
tree well my new
book reframe your brain if you're going
to order it I would do it really soon
because uh you can get this on Amazon
but it's on their independent publishing
program which means they they make them
based on the orders so they're not going
to make a ton of them in advance right
so I wouldn't wait till the last minute
to do that and the second addition the
more tightly edited but otherwise
similar uh to my big bestselling most
influential book in the entire success
domain most influen IAL book for
probably 13 years 15
years it's called how to fail in almost
everything and still went big kind of
the story in my life teaches you things
like systems are better than goals and
how to build a talent stack and all
those things that are now common
knowledge they started with that book
all right they're great Stu stuffing
stuckers not the
stuffing stocking stuffers um but here's
what's extra good about them as a gift
the reframe your Brain book will
literally work for everybody it works
for male it works for female it works
for senior citizens it works for an
older
teenager it works if you got a job it
works if you want a job it works if
you're successful it works if you're
happy it works if you're
unhappy it just works and by the way you
can just read the reviews and it'll tell
you everything you need to know the
reviews will just sell it to you if you
read the reviews you're you're going to
buy it cuz the reviews are
crazy you're getting your mother-in-law
chimpanzee okay well that's a good idea
too
yeah
um got caught
with
what I'm not going to read that comment
but it was funny all right um so ladies
