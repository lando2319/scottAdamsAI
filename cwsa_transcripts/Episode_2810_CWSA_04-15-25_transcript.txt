to think chaos is good for stock markets
cuz stocks are up again
today. Not bad. Let's check out our
comments and then we
can do a show that you deserve.
[Music]
Good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization.
It's called Coffee with Scott Adams and
you've never had a better time. But if
you'd like to try to take your
experience up to levels that nobody can
even understand with their tiny shiny
human brains, all you need for that
would be a cup of mug or a glass, a tank
or chest, a canteen jug or flask, a
vessel of any kind. Fill it with your
favorite liquid. I like coffee. And join
me now for the unparalleled pleasure of
the dopamine of the day. The thing that
makes everything better. It's called the
simultaneous sip. And it happens right
now. Go.
Excellent.
Sublime. Well, according to the
uh according to the uh University of
Amsterdam, conservative Americans
consistently distrust science, a survey
finds.
Now, do you think there's something
wrong with this analysis? The the
assumption is that you should trust
science. Should you should you trust
science when half of peer-reviewed
papers don't pan out and uh healthc care
science looks like it's completely made
up and vaccinations are
just barely tested in any way that you
would recognize? What what did I hear
the other day?
Uh I think I heard that in some kind of
drug testing they do a a
pre-trial and then the people who were
uh had bad side effects in the pre-trial
they remove them and then they go on
with the
trial. So they basically remove the
people who had problems and then they do
the trial. So it's completely fake. And
apparently that's a a standard procedure
to remove the people had problems then
then start the start the trial after
that. No, I think conservatives are
right. Science is sketchy. I think uh
climate models are weird. I think that
uh yeah, plenty of reasons to deal with
science. But here's some science.
Um, according to neuroscience news, they
figured out how to change LSD to take
out the good parts, you know, the part
where you have
hallucinations and uh, and then they
give it to schizophren schizophrenics
and apparently helps. That's the early
word. So, if you'd like to help a
schizophrenic, all you need is some
special LSD with a couple of molecules
taken out. I don't know where you get
it, but that's according to neuroscience
news. Do you believe that
one? Do you do you conservatives uh
trust that they've modified LSD to fix
schizophrenics? What What are the odds
you'll ever see that, you know, as like
a a standard treatment? I feel like
every time I read any kind of science
news during the
show, my first thought is we're never
going to see that. The every single day
I see new study where, not a study, but
an announcement where somebody's made a
battery breakthrough, a great battery
breakthrough. We can charge it in 10
seconds and it lasts a thousand
miles. We're never going to say that.
All all of these announcements are made
up, I think. I mean, they're based on
something, but I I don't think any of
that's going to turn into anything you
care
about. Well, let's see how smart you
are. According to Rasmusen,
um, what percentage of
voters disagree with having ID to vote?
What percent of voters
disagree with being able to prove you're
a citizen with ID before you
vote? You are correct. Yeah, it's 26%.
But if you guess 25, well, you're
brilliant. I have the smartest audience
in the entire world. Yep. 64% believe
Congress should enact the law requiring
proof of citizenship in order to
register to vote. But 26 disagree,
26%. Uh, if you're new to the show, um,
it's sort of a running gag that no
matter what the survey is, no matter
what the topic is, 25% of the people who
answer the survey will be just whack.
They'll just have the wrong
answer. Not having idea to vote, that's
just the wrong
answer. That's not an opinion. That's
just wrong. You're just
wrong. All
right. Um, so it turns out that dolphins
can
talk. So somebody's using AI to decipher
dolphin talk. And I guess the idea is
that you we'd eventually be able to have
a conversation with dolphins.
And uh I for one can't get enough of
that because what if dolphins are really
good
conversationalists? That'd be weird,
wouldn't it? It's like not only did they
talk, but they'd be like, "Hello, Mr.
Adams. How was your day today?" You'd be
like, "Man, you're a good
conversationalist. That'd be so cool."
So, I want to get a talking dolphin. Uh,
and I just I think I just put some AI on
it and next thing you know, boom,
talking. So, that would be the first
conversation they say between humans and
another intelligent
species. I don't know. I've been talking
to my dog for a long time, but she
doesn't talk back.
So, this happened the other day, but uh
remember when uh Trump was with Blly at
the White House
and and Trump was mocking Caitlyn
Collins of CNN and he made the claim
that CNN hates
America. CNN hates
America. And then uh Dana Bash was on.
As soon as they cut away from that, they
went to Dana Bash and uh she wanted to
to let us know that uh the CNN does not
hate
[Laughter]
America. Now, let me give you a little
uh persuasion tip.
If you're defending yourself against the
charge of hating America, you're already
losing. Because as soon as you hear
that, even if the only thing you heard
was the defense and you didn't hear any
of the accusations, you'd say to
yourself,
"H, nobody ever asked me if I hate
America. Why Why does CNN have to answer
whether they hate America?" Sounds a
little sketchy, doesn't it?
you're guilty if you just get in the
conversation. So, I think I think CNN
should have maybe just ignored
it, but instead they defended that they
don't hate America, which makes at least
half of the people in the country go,
"You
don't." Well, I've seen your coverage
and it it appears that you do. I'm not
so sure you love
America. Anyway, I'm sure they love
America.
Totally. Uh, I would say, however, that
the claim that they do love America is
what they call a baseless claim because
it was presented with no evidence
whatsoever. Right? That's a baseless
claim. When uh Trump said the 2020
election was
rigged, the CNN people and most of the
news said it's a baseless claim because
there was no
evidence. So, do they love America as
CNN? They say so, but it's a baseless
claim. No evidence
presented. Well, here's some fake news
that might be real news a little bit.
Um, so the Trump administration is going
to ask Congress to cut funding for NPR
and
PBS. Now, you you just said to yourself,
"Yes, finally, we get rid of NPR and and
PBS." No, that's not going to happen.
The amount of funding that NPR and PBS
get from the government, the federal
government, was kind of trivial. So, it
won't make any difference at all. But
you might feel better if you're not
funding them.
Um, so, so that's how you could be the
smartest person in the room. Next time
somebody gets in conversation about
funding NPR and PBS, you can be the
smartest one by
saying their total
funding doesn't have much to do with the
federal government. It's like 1% or
something like that.
Meanwhile, a New Mexico
man has been uh charged in arson attack
on a Tesla showroom.
Now, postmillennials writing about
this, I'm starting to wonder if if the
uh Department of Justice is going to
catch 100% of the domestic terrorists
who were doing the the Tesla
stuff, at least the ones who, you know,
burned down showrooms cuz there must be
cameras everywhere, you know, between
the cars and, you know, just security
cameras. So, I got another one. I don't
know how many are still on the
loose, but I feel like they're going to
get them all and then they should ship
them to El
Salvador and put him in those jails. I I
still have a question about those El
Salvador
jails because how can you possibly keep
El Salvador safe unless you never let
them out? Is that actually the plan that
they're never let out because they're
gang
members? And how in the world would that
even be slightly, you know, humane? But
nobody cares, I guess, because they're
monsters. They're
monsters. All right.
Um, so Biden's going to give his uh Joe
Biden's going to give his first speech
since he left office. How much would you
love to hear that? He's going to be in
Chicago uh speaking to the
[Music]
um advocates and counselors for the
disabled.
So, he's going to give his
speech and aren't you super curious
whether he can pull it
off because, you know, he's been in that
mode for a while where his decline is
happening kind of quickly. Why would he
even agree to it? Doesn't it seem weird
they even agree to it in the first
place? Because it's all just nothing but
downside for him. So, maybe maybe they
just can't say no to him. It's like, I
can do it.
Ah, I can make a speech. Let me make a
speech. All right, Joe, we'll let you do
one at a small event.
Speaking of Joe Biden, you know, the
Gayway Pundit and Just the News have
been reporting on, I think John Solomon
reporting on this that now that there's
some more uh unredacted emails. There's
a complete link. Um, you can you can see
the entire criminal enterprise where Joe
Biden was vice president and he was
negotiating deals for uh his son uh who
was on the board of Berisma. It was
exactly what you thought. So the the
Biden crime family was exactly what you
thought it was. Now, I don't think that
Joe Biden will ever be prosecuted
because he is a certain age and you
know, not like the special who was it
her who said he that no jury would
convict him because he's just like a
amiable crazy old man. So, I think that
Biden actually succeeded
uh something like a life of crime and he
got away with it all the way to
retirement. See, I think the trick is if
you're going to get away with a life of
crime, you have to act crazy at the end.
So, you know, wear your bathrobe
everywhere, that sort of thing. It works
for the
mafia. So, I think Joe Biden will be in
a bathroom pretty soon. That's my guess.
But it it kind of blows my mind that we
don't have to
guess. Was he abusing his office?
because we've got like his emails that
were used as a pseudonym and it's very
clear he was negotiating, you know,
energy deals on behalf of his
son. It's just amazing that we have all
the evidence now, but we just look at it
and go, "Oh, let's just talk about it
among ourselves like it like somehow it
doesn't matter."
So, you know, all those migrants who
were flown in by Joe Biden, which to me
was the weirdest thing. Remember when
you first heard that the US government
was not just processing people at the
border, but they were actively flying
people in from other
countries? That wasn't your first
impression. No, that can't be true.
Well, it can't be many people, right?
It's not like there's a lot of people
that going to fly in by airplanes. And
then you find out it's like over half a
million half a million people were flown
in from other
countries because the Democrats
apparently were trying to, you know,
stack the deck and get more Democrat
voters or get more, you know, get more
uh representation, whatever, whatever
they were after.
Um, but now a federal judge in
Boston. So once again, the Democrats
shop for a judge anywhere in the
country. This one was in Boston. And
they get this judge to make a ruling
that
affects things that are not in
Boston. So I feel like the Supreme Court
needs to slap this one down. But Bill
Malian was reporting on this Fox
News. Um but uh Trump was trying to
remove
uh their protection so he can ship them
all back and the federal judge said no
you cannot you cannot do that. So what
Trump order to do is revoke their legal
status. Um and then to basically revoke
them all and I think the judge said that
every person has to be judged
individually. There are half a million
of them.
So, that's going to take a while. Um, so
we'll see. I don't know if this is going
to go to the Supreme Court, but it seems
like exactly the sort of thing that
would Have any of you seen Tucker
Carlson show where he's talking to Kurt
Weldon, who was in Congress for years
and has a lot to say about
9/11. I don't know what to believe about
any of that.
So, I I'll just say that uh I haven't
seen the whole thing yet, but apparently
this uh Kurt Weldon uh who had been
chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, so you know, a serious
politician, and he uh he publicly
questioned the accuracy of the 911
report that he thought was basically,
you know, an inside job. And uh in
retaliation, the Bush administration
sent federal agents to his daughter's
house and ended his political career. So
now now apparently he's he's telling the
truth because he's 77 and he just feels
like he it's time to do. Now let me tell
you my evolution in this whole 911
story.
When 911 happened, I was really only
thinking about the, you know, the big
picture stuff. And I'd hear all the
conspiracy theorists and they're blaming
Israel and they're blaming Saudi Arabia
and they're they're they don't think Bin
Laden's even real or, you know, just all
kinds of crazy stuff. But I didn't pay
much attention to it because I thought,
I saw the airplane hit the building and
I saw the other airplane hit the
building. If I see it with my own eyes
and then the building goes down, well,
I'm going to think I'm going to think
that's what the problem
was. But the other day, you know, now
now time has gone by and we've learned
how many things that we thought were
true were just absolute You
know, the the Kennedy assassination,
pretty much everything that we've been
taught by our government is fake.
So now I'm open to it. So I'm open to
some good conspiracy theories, but I'll
tell you the one thing that I can't get
past. I was watching some clips of the
towers coming down, you know, at the
moment when they they
collapsed, and it looked like it was
just
dust. Like
somehow somehow the buildings had turned
all that metal into dust and there was
like nothing but a big pile of dust at
the the bottom and I thought that
doesn't look natural. I mean that
doesn't even look like a plane in it.
And then of course there's building
seven that never made any sense. So uh I
think I'm squarely on the conspiracy
theory side but I don't know which
conspiracy theory. So I don't know the
there's probably about five different
versions of conspiracy
theories. So uh what one of them is that
the planes were operated
remotely and you know they were not even
piloted by the hijackers. I don't know
maybe I doubt it though. I don't think
you could be that accurate, you know,
doing it remotely. But
maybe I'm open to any theories about
that because none none of it looked
organic or real and we don't live in a
country where the committee that studies
it can be trusted, you know, ever. So
there's something going on.
Well, you may have heard that uh China
in uh retaliation for the uh the
tariffs, Trump's tariffs,
um is using what I call the Dilbert
method to deny us rare earth materials.
Now, it's only seven of them. So if you
want to get some samarium or gatalinium
or if you're a little low on turb
turbium or you just can't get enough
dprosium or uh lute
luteium uh if you'd like some scandium
or itrium, it's going to be harder to
do. But instead of saying we're not
going to give you these, China does a a
total dilbert.
And instead of saying, you know, you
can't have them, they say, well,
there'll be some new restrictions and
you have to just apply. So, you can't
just buy them. You have to apply. And it
doesn't apply just to the United States.
It's to everybody. But it's kind of
genius because they can say, "We didn't
ban them. You just have to fill out the
paperwork and you can have them. But how
long is it going to take for them to
process the paperwork?"
I think if it's America, it's going to
take a while. So, that's a uh classic
Dilbert trick where you you're acting
like you're completely helping. Oh, no.
It's just some paperwork. Yeah, we can
even tell you how to fill it out. Here
you go. Just fill out this paperwork and
you can get your rare earth minerals.
Well, good luck with that because it
looks like they're going to dilbert
that.
Um, according to the Macau news, China
is significantly outpacing the US and
the European Union in the use of AI and
research. Is that good? How are how are
they using AI in research? Is it writing
the research papers?
I don't think there's anything that it
does that would help research because
you can't really trust it like you would
like to trust science. So, uh, how does
that work? Anyway, I I feel like this is
just another one of those things where
um on any given day, I'll see a story
that uh everything that China builds is
crap and they don't know how to do
anything and their buildings fall down
and the bridges fall down and the
bridges are made but with corn.
Actually, corn. I read that today. There
was some bridge that the inner structure
was part
corn on the cob even. It wasn't even
just the the just the corn. So, I don't
know if that's true. But then but then
you hear another story. It's like
they're way ahead of us on science and
they're way ahead of us in in
AI. I don't think we know anything about
China. Uh, China's just like a black box
to me because it's either falling apart
and they're on the verge of going out of
business or they're the dominant country
in the world and nothing can stop them.
But but China is always opposites there.
There's always there's always a story
about how great they are. At the same
time, there's a story about how horrible
they are and how much trouble they're in
and how it's all going to fall apart. I
don't know what to
believe. Well, Scott Presler is telling
us that California blocked a voter ID
legislation. So, even though the vast
majority of people want voter ID for
voting, uh they want, you know, ID for
voting. Uh California blocked it. That's
the politicians. But apparently one of
the state representatives is going to do
a a citizens initiation project to put
it on the ballot. If it gets on the
ballot, it's got about 64%
approval. So, looks like uh the the
legislature isn't going to be able to
block this. It's going to be on the
ballot because all they need is a
million signatures. I think you could
get a million signatures. I mean, that's
a big number, but I'll bet you can do
it. Um, Trump says he's going to put a
temporary exemption on auto parts from
foreign countries because the auto
industry likes
it. Um, and that's a temporary exemption
to give companies time to switch from
parts made in Canada, Mexico, and
beyond.
now
temporary. How how long does Trump think
it would take for people to move
manufacturing of car parts back to the
United States? That doesn't happen
quickly, does it? Or are there just
certain machines that are in Mexico or
Canada and if they just move them to
America, everything would be
fine. So maybe it's just that they've
got machines that make these parts and
uh and uh if you move the machines in
the United States, you can make them
here. Can't be that
hard. All right.
Did you know that uh Senator Schumer
apparently still hasn't condemned the
attacks on
Tesla and
uh EPA Chief
Zeldon? He was kind of slamming him
saying uh he said that Senator Schumer
was asked about the Tesla dealership
attacks and ignored it then turned
around and went after Elon.
It's unbelievable to me that Schumer
can't just say, "No, I'm against
domestic violence or domestic
terrorism." That would be a real easy
thing to be against, but he won't do it.
So, we have to assume he's in favor of
it because it wouldn't be hard to say
you're not
favor. Um, so here's what I've concluded
about this chaos stuff. you know,
Trump's always being accused of
chaos. I think the Democrats have made a
good
case that uh Trump has brought chaos
into the
markets. But what they haven't done is
made a good case that chaos is worse
than the situation we're
in. Because the situation we're in,
we're heading toward a a debt explosion
that was going to kill us for sure. And
then we've got a trade situation that
would kill us for sure, you know, over
time.
So even if they're if they're right that
uh Trump's bringing a lot of chaos, and
I would say there's a lot of moving
parts. So if you want to call that
chaos, sure. But they haven't made the
case that chaos is worse than the status
quo. You know, doing things the way we
did it. So that's my challenge to to
them. And if they think that uh if they
think that the way that we should go
forward is that no, we want to make the
cuts and we want to we want to fix
trade, but we're going to do it with a
scalpel. That's just
dumb because that's the way everything's
been done forever and it got us into
this situation. Do you do you think if
we had just individually called 130
countries and said we'd like to
negotiate our trade deals that they
would be eager to help
us? I don't think so. I think it's the
chaos and the fact that Trump just
scared the crap out of everybody who
does business with the United
States. It's the chaos. That's why 130
have contacted the US and are trying to
do a deal, which probably will be better
for us. I don't know if it'd be better
for
them. So, yeah, chaos is is great. Just
don't try to pretend that you could have
done it with a scalpel, you know, and
smart people could have sat down and
figured out a new trade deal. That's not
a real
thing. We would have done that decades
ago if that were real. Nobody could do
that. You You have to be a big gorilla
and scare everybody and then you can get
some stuff done. That's what Trump is
doing. It's a Let's say it's
directionally correct
chaos. There just introduced a new term
directionally correct
chaos. Well, Tulsi Gabbard and her
husband have been threatened with uh by
some guy Ali Akbar
Muhammad and uh he was accused of
sending threats including statements
like you and your family are going to
die soon. I will personally do the job
if necessary. You know, I don't think we
appreciate enough how brave you have to
be to be a conservative in the
government.
I'm not sure if she would call herself a
conservative, but she's, you know, sort
of on the Trump
team. You have to be pretty brave
because the crazies are all activated.
And the thing I'm wondering is why are
there not conservative crazies who are
doing similarly similarly terrible
things to Democrats? Is there some
reason that's not happening? I'm not
saying you should, but I can't figure
out why it's all coming from one side
when crazy people are more universal.
You know, they're all over the
place.
So
anyway, anyway, I'm glad that Tulsi will
be okay because that guy got picked up.
Um, according to uh Breitbart, Christina
Wong is writing about how the CIA
director Michael Ellis is saying that um
they're going to craft a uh CIA
um let's
say organization or system to fight the
cartels. And that had never been their
top priority, I guess. So, they're going
to use the skills that they've learned
taking down terrorists and other
countries and they're going to uh open
their aperture, as they say, on
terrorism and go after the
cartels. Now, didn't you always assume
the CIA was on the side of the
cartels? Cuz I did. I don't think it's
simply a case that they weren't working
on the cartels before.
I feel like the big change had to be,
you know, the big the big change had to
be they'd be willing to go after the
cartels. So may maybe under Trump they
will. We'll
see. So here here's a sign of the
times. If if you were trying to
understand how well California is being
run and and you could only hear one
story, this might be this might be the
one that sums up all of California. So
there's a Democrat in California who
proposed a bill for students to be able
to live in their cars among the amid the
housing crisis. The Daily Caller News
Foundation is writing about this. Uh so
Corey Jackson introduced the bill that
students can live in their cars on
campus parking lots. Now they would hope
it would be
temporary. At least that's what they'd
hope.
Um but just think about the
fact that a student at let's see which
of the colleges
uh California State University locations
20 California community colleges
um and that people are going to live in
their
cars because there's not access to
affordable housing. There's housing.
It's just not affordable.
All right.
Um, do you remember uh do you know the
mayor of Boston, Mayor Michelle
Woo? According to the National Pulse,
she
uh her campaign in 2021 accepted
$300,000 from a fundraiser reportedly
tied to a Communist Chinese Communist
Party influence agency.
Do you ever
wonder like how much money China spends
influencing
Americans? It's got to be a lot. By the
way, you don't hear the heavy equipment
right outside my window, do you? That's
not supposed to start until 8, but they
like to get a jump on it. I I've heard
that you can't hear it because my
microphone is nicely
directional, but boy could I hear it.
Um, yeah, 300,000 from a Chinese
Communist Party influence agency. Now,
again, I have to
complain. As far as I know, nobody's
ever offered to bribe
me. And I'm thinking, what's up with
that? Like, I I'm pretty sure I wouldn't
take a bribe to, you know, influence,
but nobody
offered. Come on.
at least offer so I can turn it
down. Well, meanwhile over in France,
uh, a number of their prisons have been
attacked. So, there's gunfire and cars
on fire and all kinds of
chaos. Uh, but at least eight prisons
around France were hit overnight.
And some are saying it's the uh the
narco underworld that it's basically the
the drug criminals and that they're mad
because uh it's a push back against
France's new anti-drug crackdown.
So apparently the drug the underworld
drug people in France have enough
firepower that they can attack eight
prisons at the same
time. Um I swear to God I saw this story
completely different earlier in the day.
I I thought it looked like a an Islamic
attack, but then it morphed into a narco
uh underworld attack. So, that's
probably probably the true
one.
Anyway, well, negotiator uh Witkoff, who
was trying to negotiate peace for Trump
in these various wars,
um he he talked to Vladimir Vladimir
Putin and he said that the talks were
quote
compelling. Does that sound like he's
going to have some peace right away? The
the talks were
compelling. That doesn't sound good. I
mean, it doesn't sound like progress.
Um, he said the Russian leader was open
to a permanent peace deal with Ukraine.
Yeah, that's what everybody
says. Um, and then Wikov says, I think
we might be on the verge of something
that would be very, very important for
the world at
large. Uh, it took a while for us to get
to this
place. Do you think they're really
close?
I don't I I don't think they're close.
Um I don't know what they've agreed to
or what they haven't, but I'm going to
say not close.
Um and uh Wov said that after 5 years of
talks he saw a deal quote
emerging and a a possibility to reshape
the Russian United States relationship
through compelling there it is
compelling again commercial
opportunities that would give real
stability to the region. What do you
think that would be rare earth minerals
and gas? I don't know.
So, I'm going to
say sounds good, but I I don't think
it's
real. I don't think it's real, but may
maybe I'm wrong. Meanwhile, Ukraine has
developed what they call the Alligator 9
uh drones for the sea. So, I guess it's
a a drone on the ocean that can release
other other uh drones.
So, it's an unmanned um
ship that can let other drones fly out
of it and attack
uh attack things that will attack the
Russian Navy
basically. Now, what it doesn't say is
apparently this is a Ukraine invention,
so nobody's saying that they bought her
from somebody. Has Ukraine reached a
point where they can develop
um really high-tech drones and that they
can make them in
Ukraine or are they coming from
somewhere else and Ukraine is just
taking credit for it? But it does seem
to me that if the peace deal doesn't get
done pretty soon, the the war is going
to turn into just a total drone war
because Ukraine doesn't have enough
people. So, they're just going to use
drones for everything. So, it looks like
they're going to drone it up for the
Navy. Um, they also have a
laser. So, they can put a laser on this
Alligator 9. Uh, and it can shoot down
drones
um or fry enemy. Well, it can launch its
own drones, but can fry enemy
drones and helicopters and
missiles. So really, did Ukraine really
invent something that has uh laser
defense and is super high-tech and it
can launch all these other drones
against
ships? No, I feel like somebody must be
behind it more than Ukraine. But on the
other hand, Ukraine was working pretty
hard to become the best uh military
drone country and they needed it. So
maybe they did do
it. Wall Street Journal is reporting
that uh Wickoff said the U talking about
their Iran deal. So um so Wickoff said
that the US is prepared to allow Iran to
enrich uranium at a low level if it is
subject to stringent
verification which would be a
significant shift in the White House's
position. Do you think that Iran is
going to literally say, "All right, we
won't make a
nuke because it's all they have to say
and then there's a peace
deal." They don't I'm not even sure they
need to mean it. They They just need to
say it. So, I think the game from Iran
will be to, you know, stall maybe as
long as possible while they're building
their nuke. But I think maybe at some
point they're just going to say, "Yeah,
totally. We agree not to have a nuke
while they're building it in their
secret under, you know, secret mountain
fortress." Because, you know, they're
doing all the good stuff deep
underground. You know, you you you can't
imagine that there's a factory sitting
above ground that could get
bombed. So, how would we ever really
know if Iran stopped making nuclear
weapons?
How how would we ever know that? Because
don't you think they could hide that
completely? I don't know. Seems like we
never really know. So, I don't think
there's going to be an Iran deal anytime
soon. I saw in the Hill the headline
that says there's a buzz building around
AOC's future. A buzz. I don't think
there is.
I think there's the media trying to
create a buzz around AOC because they
see her as potentially good
campaigner. I don't know if it's her
time to be president. She's a little
young, but that's also part of her
advantage. She would sell she would sell
herself as being the next generation.
But apparently AOC is helping Bernie
draw massive crowds. But I think when
you see here something like there's a
buzz, it's the media trying to create
one. So I don't think the buzz is out
there. I think the media is trying to
create the buzz cuz they really need to
find a Democrat who can make a dent. Do
do you think AOC could beat a
traditional Republican if she ran for
president? You know, let's say JD Vance,
somebody like that.
Do I mean how would she do in a debate
against JD
Vance? I feel like she wouldn't do that
well because he's good at it.
And we'll see. Well, there's a new
cement according
to Sugits Cena. There's a new cement
that can turn heat into
electricity and the then the building
can help power itself. I saw a bunch of
comments when I reposted this on X.
Everybody thought that the building was
going to collapse and it's terrible
cement and that uh
it's it's a bio inpired material with a
seabbuck coefficient of negative -4.5
uh
millolts. I don't know what any of that
means, but uh apparently they they're
going to have super cement.
I don't know if I'd want to build my
building with a cement that was made to
develop a power because I want it's made
out of
corn. The building is mostly made out of
corn. Anyway, that's all we got for
today.
Um I'm I'm noticing that a lot of the
news just looks the same. So instead of
just covering every story, if it looks
like the same news you've seen somewhere
else, um then it's not fun to talk
about. So Trump's going to get uh get
busy this week and you've got your taxes
to pay today. Remember, it's tax day.
Don't
forget. I won't take your calls. I can
see
why. All right. Uh ladies and gentlemen,
thanks for joining. I'm going to talk to
the locals people privately and the rest
of you I'll see
um same time, same place tomorrow.
Thanks for joining.
