hey everybody
come on in come on in it's the weekend
it's
sort of a holiday weekend and you don't
have any work to do today
i hope i hope you don't i hope that the
only thing you have to do today
is enjoy the simultaneous sip
and all you need is a copper mug or a
glass of tanker towels or sign a canteen
jogger flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine the end of the
day the thing that makes
everything better including the holidays
it's called the simultaneous ship it
happens now go
hello belgium nice of you to join us
this morning well we get a fun one today
i saw a
survey on the internet
a scientific one not a not a twitter
survey
that asked people who would you
generally trust
to tell you the truth and then they
listed a number of professions
and you would get to choose which of
those professions you found
trustworthy well what was at the top of
the list
of trustworthy professions
was it journalists
do you think journalists were at the top
of the trusted professions
no they were not luckily
nurses doctors and engineers
were right at the top of the list
wouldn't you want that to be true
right i mean that's sort of good news
right it's the people that
the public believes are medical
professionals
and engineers and then just stop
i'm exaggerating a little bit but how
would
how good would society be if we believed
our
health care professionals completely you
know you got to be a little skeptical
but you believe them the most
and then engineers and then you just
stop
and everybody else you just say ah maybe
i don't know
not so sure about you i'm willing to go
with the healthcare professional
and the engineers but i don't know about
you so
journalists had uh only 23 percent
thought that they were generally
trustworthy
now you might say to yourself
that seems like a problem because
journalists
are in some ways the gateway to
all truth everything that we understand
about the world
seems to come through journalists first
you know then it gets turned into
history and whatever
whatever else law you name it but
having journalists at the very bottom of
the trust
uh funnel seems like a little bit of a
problem but engineers have a 93
trust rate i'm kind of a hybrid because
as a cartoonist i'm
closer to a journalist and doing this
i'm closer to a journalist than i am to
an engineer
but all of my early exposure
was working with engineers for years and
years
so i feel like i picked up some of their
good habits i like to think i did
um correct me if i'm wrong i need a fact
check on this
i think this is true when i talk to you
about
i said i was confused about the
religious
folks who wanted to continue having uh
church services in the pandemic and i
asked you
what would jesus say about that would
jesus say yeah give me my
individual freedom or would jesus say
yeah you're gonna have your individual
freedom but just hold on a little bit
take a little sacrifice for your
neighbor we'll get there
you know you're not gonna lose your
freedom but temporarily going to ask you
to make a sacrifice
i thought jesus would come down on that
side but as you know
i'm neither a believer nor a religious
scholar
so i wouldn't i wouldn't follow my own
advice on religion
that's for sure if i could give you any
advice
don't take my advice on religion i'm the
last person you should listen to on that
domain
but didn't the pope agree with me
i feel like i saw the story and then i
want to research it
and it's maybe a little bit ambiguous
what he's talking about
let me read what the pope said and see
if he agreed
with the supreme court who said freedom
rules and
go ahead or does he agree that maybe you
should keep the
restrictions so the pope says some
groups protested
refusing to keep their distance marching
against travel restrictions
as if measures that governments must
impose
for the good of their people constitute
some kind of political assault
or autonom or autonomy on autonomy or
personal freedom
so it it feels like the pope is
pro-lockdown and it feels like he would
be equally pro-lockdown when it came to
churches
is that the way you read it i read it as
the pope is okay with closing churches
temporarily
because it's just a health thing so
uh let's just leave that there
i've told you before that on cnn there
are
two personalities that are far more
let's say objective and valuable
than the rest of them all right so
i don't like to be the person who says
that some group or or some entity is 100
bad right because usually there's
something good and something bad about
just about everything
and on cnn there are two shows that i
think are very worth watching
one is uh smirkanish who is always
more objective than just about anybody
on television he does a really good job
at that
and the other is fareed zakaria now
fareed
definitely has tds he's got a bad case
of tds
but my observation is that it seems to
be limited to
what he believes the president is
thinking
which is at least you know limited so he
thinks the president's got some racial
ideas he
he thinks the president is doing it
because of racial ideas
that part's just tds as far as i can
tell
but the rest of the things that ferrari
says
on any other topic are pretty darn good
not only uh educational but entertaining
and by the way i decided yesterday
i'm going to make it a habit especially
between now and the end of the year
through the holidays
i'm going to intentionally add
compliments
to people who deserve them and i'm going
to include compliments
to people on the left and the right and
it's in the spirit of the holidays
i'm just going to point out that if
somebody even if i disagree with them
if they're doing something notably good
i'm going to call it out
just in the spirit of the season so
fareed is
does a great show
but here's what's interesting on his
show to uh
his most recent show he uh i think he
broke it to the cnn viewers
and i don't know if anybody has ever
said this clearly
so it's the clarity of the story that
that makes it important it's not that it
hasn't ever been discussed
but when he puts it in clear words which
is what he's really really good at
i think he woke up the left in a way
that they hadn't quite been woken up
and it goes like this i'm paraphrasing
but effectively far read explained to
the left and i don't know that they knew
this most of them
that president trump doesn't have to do
anything
to take a second term doesn't need to do
anything
all he needs to do is enjoy the fact
that there is great question about the
validity of the
election he can let his lawyers now
that's something he's actively doing
but he can let the lawyers take the the
battle
through the courts and even even his
critics are saying
okay okay as long as you're using the
courts
and you're using um legal challenges
we don't think you're going to prevail
but we're not going to complain too much
about the fact that you're doing it
because you're you're within the rules
all right
so here's the part that the left didn't
quite understand
all you need is doubt
and you get the second term of president
trump
there's nothing else you need there's
one thing you need
period doubt
you don't need a court win because it
can be decided
by the legislatures if the legislatures
decide they don't have a
you know a good idea let's put it this
way
if the legislatures all just say ah yeah
we're just going to go with the popular
vote
well then biden becomes president but
if there's enough reasonable doubt the
legislatures might say
we don't trust the election it would be
the republicans who say that of course
and there are enough states and the
swing states controlled by enough
republican legislatures that if they
inject enough doubt
into the electoral process fortunately
the founders and the the framers of the
constitution they allowed for that
so that's a that was a known risk and so
the process has very clear steps
oh if you can't make a decision with the
electoral college process
it moves to the con the house the house
gets one vote for each state
and there are more republican states
that's it
that's it i can just i'm gonna pause
this comment
so on youtube somebody says stay in your
lane scott
i would like to recommend to you a book
called loserthink
a prominent part of this book is mocking
people who tell me to stay in my lane
do you know i wasn't always a cartoonist
no
if i'd stayed in my lane i wouldn't be a
cartoonist
if i'd stayed in my lane i would not
have one of the most
popular live stream shows in america
stay in your lane is literally
i think the dumbest thing anybody's ever
said
you wouldn't have airplanes computers
technology you wouldn't have
civilization if people like me
stayed in their lane it's leaving the
lane they gave you
everything that you enjoy today all of
it
a hundred percent of what makes your
life good today
my lovely critic is that people like me
don't take your advice if we took your
advice we'd be wallowing in mud and
eating our own feces so
let me continue so fareed has made the
case
clearly in a way i'd never seen before
that the president doesn't have to do
much of anything would you say that the
president has successfully injected
doubt into the election process i
actually don't think it was mostly him
in this case in this case i think the
president is following
i don't think he's leading on the
question of election
election allegations i think he's
following his base
imagine if you will that the republican
base
had gone through the election and said
all right well we don't like the outcome
but it was fair would president trump be
fighting this in court
no no he's not leading this he's
actually
going with his base almost as a show of
respect
the base wants him to fight
he's he's got this relationship
commitment with his base that's unlike
anything i've ever seen
and i think he just feels the obligation
i mean he'd like to win
of course he probably thinks he was
robbed of course
but i think the driving motivation in
the real world
is that the base wants him to do it and
they have a relationship so i think he
feels an obligation to
to follow it through but as ellie
alexander is reminding people in his
tweets and public work lately that
there might be some primary challenges
to republicans who
don't doubt the outcome of the election
so there might be a little risk being
injected into the system for republicans
who thought they had
safe seats or maybe it's the ones who
are closer to not safe
but ali alexander is putting that
notion into the universe now
in terms of persuasion you can't
persuade somebody of something that they
have they're not familiar with
in other words if they haven't heard
your argument you're not going to
persuade them
so the first thing you have to do is get
people a little bit pregnant
with an idea that they had not been
wrestling with up to that point
and the idea that ali alexander is
putting into the
into the universe and very productively
i would say if you're a
trump supporter and you'd like to see
the president prevail
this is very productive persuasion
and it's very simple and it has to do
with the fact that people can get used
to things
if they wait long enough so all he needs
to do
to accomplish this bit of persuasion is
to make you think about it
make you talk about it possibly get you
to
debate it if you see a debate on cnn
about this concept whether republicans
will be primaried
he won because that's it if you see on
cnn or fox news
any conversation by any of the talking
heads they even bring up the topic
all you would need is somebody to do
what i'm doing right now
just talk about it that's it because the
first time you hear this idea
that republicans might get primaried by
their own party if they don't
if they don't you know firm up and be on
the same side on this
election allegations the first time you
hear you think well maybe that's a
little harsh
but the longer you talk about it the
longer you think about it
the thing which struck you as being a
little harsh maybe over the line
suddenly it starts to feel like just
reality
you might get primaried so i don't know
that people will get
primaried if they don't you know back
the president on this
but he has injected that risk
where it didn't exist before so ali is
succeeding
what you're watching is persuasion that
unambiguously is succeeding
whether it succeeds all the way is
another question but it's certainly
succeeding in its
you know limited goal so fareed is
telling the
left that the cat might be on the roof
meaning breaking it to them easy
getting so freed is doing the same thing
he's introducing an idea that this might
not go the way the democrats are
positive it's going to go and
the difference between the way the
democrats are positive it's going to go
in other words biden taking office
there is nothing obstructing the other
path
now that's the part that they're going
to have to come to grips with
it would be one thing if fareed and said
well there's this
weird long shot other way that things
could go
but you probably don't have to worry
about it because it's a long shot
there's obstacles and there are things
that could stop it
but he didn't say that he basically drew
a picture that's a straight line
to trump taking a second term let me ask
you this
has trump succeeded or you don't even
have to say trump
can you just say it is true that
nearly all republicans believe the
election was stolen
right the polls showed that the polls
show the republicans believe it
how about democrats according to
rasmussen 30 percent of democrats think
the election was stolen
now imagine days go by and rudy
and you know jed ellis and the the team
and and uh the kraken stuff and sydney
powell
and you just hear more and more stories
about allegations
and you're a democrat and you're one of
the democrats who does not already
think the election was stolen so you're
in the 70 percent of democrats
what happens if you are subjected to a
non-stop
trickle avalanche rainstorm of
allegations
now you might say to yourself every time
i hear one
the lawsuit gets thrown in a court so i
guess they're all bad
maybe but that's not really the way
brains work
your logic might try to protect you and
say
no no those other lawsuits got thrown
out and even though those other lawsuits
used different evidence and made
different
claims the fact that completely
different lawsuits with different
evidence and different
claims the fact that those were rejected
certainly makes me feel safe that the
next one
that they've had time to prepare good
evidence and make
completely different kinds of claims
well i'm pretty safe that those
different lawsuits are going to be
failures too
so that would be your you know your cut
your
confirmation bias and your pattern
recognition kicking in and trying to
protect yourself
but the fact is republicans have a whole
bunch of doubt
about this election there is plenty
of evidence that they will consider
useful
meaning that the data anomalies they
will believe even if they're not true
the sworn testimonies of hundreds of
people who said they saw frauds
republicans are likely to believe even
if they're not true
so fact aside
and court decide and science aside
our democratic process ish
the republic if you will
is built on how we feel it's not built
on the court
it's not built on the truth it's not
built on science
our system is expressly
specifically built on how we
feel by design that's not an accident
when you vote are you voting the facts
well sometimes you think you are but
you're not
when you vote are you voting because of
all your logic
you might think you are but you're not
and i think the
founders knew that this is an emotional
process
and the fact that everybody gets to vote
and you're all encouraged to vote and
you have the right to vote
that's about your psychology that's
about making you feel the system
was credible it's your feeling
it's designed to make you feel the
system is credible
feel that you participated and feel that
you're part of it
the constitution is about what you feel
that's it and specifically designed that
way it's not an accident
so if the way this ends up going
is that the republicans by a majority
feel that the election was stolen
they have every constitutional right
to act on the feeling
and they don't have to explain it they
do not need to go into court and then
make their case and prove it to a jury
that their feelings also match the facts
it isn't part of the process and i don't
think
that the framers of the constitution
left it
out by mistake
i think they framed it exactly the way
they thought they were framing it which
is if the legislature
and the and the house decide that
the process they feel
doesn't have the confidence of the
people
they feel they've lost the confidence of
the people
they can try to regain it by using the
system as designed
and the house to simply vote now
that story that i just told you to many
of you sort of hearing it for the first
time sounds ridiculous
anybody who is already aware of this
path which many
republicans have been for weeks
you're a little bit used to it already
aren't you
think about how you felt the first time
you heard
that trump could win the election
without winning the popular vote
and without winning the electoral
college
and that it would be perfectly legal
and constitutional
and it wouldn't even be an aberration
it would be the way the constitution was
designed
to work to solve this
exact problem the exact problem
is that there's some doubt about the
election
and it's a big doubt that's the problem
it's designed to solve and it will
so watch yourself getting used to
something that
shocked you like crazy when you first
heard it
two weeks later you're thinking yeah
that could happen
why wouldn't that happen keely machining
uh used the word basilis and threw it
back at the uh
her at the press uh which was very
clever
because of course the uh the word
be the word basos is being used against
about the allegations
of the election being fraudulent now
baseless is a clever persuasion word
and i have spoken about this when you
hear baseless
do you say to yourself oh it could be
true
but we haven't seen evidence yet is that
how you interpret baseless
because that would be you know an
accurate interpretation
but that's not how you you register the
word
the way your brain hears baseless is
that we've already looked into
it and there's nothing there right it's
not what it means
but that's how your brain interprets it
and that's why democrats used like to
use that word baseless
because it it it influences you to think
that there won't be anything there no
matter how much you look
suppose they had said something that
meant the same thing
suppose they had said there nobody has
produced evidence
that will hold up in court about the
fraud
yet would that be a fair statement
nobody has produced conclusive evidence
of fraud that's big enough to change the
election yet
that would be true right but notice i
threw in the word yet
what did the word yet make you think
the word yet makes you think it's going
to happen it just hasn't happened
yet so yet is a manipulative word
like basils but yet manipulates you in
the way of thinking well we probably
will find it if we keep looking
baseless says well we probably already
looked and it wasn't there
see now this is uh but there's not much
you can do to battle that
claim because it's a really good attack
using baseless
is just really smart effective
persuasion
so what do you do when your enemy uses
smart effective persuasion against your
argument
and it just works it just works
well one of the things you can do if
you're kelly mac and any
is you can take their freaking word
baseless throw it back in their stupid
mugs
and apply it to the russia collusion
and say that you you threw the country
into you know almost a paralysis
for three and a half years you the
democrats
on a quote as she repeated at least
twice
baseless accusations about russia
collusion
baseless i say now what do the democrats
say
when kaylee mcinanni calls russia
collusion
baseless yeah they got the same problem
don't they
they got a problem because they're going
to argue well it wasn't
baseless we had a reason
and then what would kaylee mac and any
say i'm i'm just
just doing a mental thing here what
could she say
hypothetically uh
well basically the let me short
short circuit this everything that
they're saying about
and all the words being used about the
fraud allegations in the election
apply almost perfectly to the russia
coral
the the russia collusion hoax
and so she's pointing out their
hypocrisy and doing a great job at it
and it's also funny
it's just sort of funny so i've decided
that
one of uh kaylee mcinnini's signatures
which makes her a perfect uh a perfect
hire for trump is that the things she
does are effective
but they're always a little bit funny
there's always that little extra
x factor and this is one of those
examples because using their word basils
and throwing it in their face on a
different topic
to make them realize that the word
itself is illegitimate
they either have to call her on using
the word or they have to admit
that when they use it it's illegitimate
and they can't so it's a good trap
which is funny it doesn't change
anything it's just kind of funny
so she's sort of perfect for trump um
so i discovered a way to monetize the
stupidity of my critics
uh and of course i did that with dilbert
because dilbert
was largely mocking you know bad
managers and
things like that now they're not
necessarily critics but
i did figure out how to monetize uh bad
managers by the dilbert comic strip
but i've somewhat accidentally slid
and this was no plan or anything i just
sort of ended up here
through uh trial and error so
i'm going to turn one of my critics into
content
right now in front of you i'll change
stupidity
and criticism into content which will
amuse and entertain you
and uh i believe i'll get ad revenue on
youtube when you watch it
so i'm literally going to monetize
this freaking idiot critic that i'm
going to talk about right now
all right now i laid a trap yesterday
which was not planned in advance
but when i did it accidentally i decided
to keep it because it was so
delightful completely accidental but it
still formed
a trap and here's what it is i'll read
the tweet
and we'll talk about it i said
extraordinary claims demand
extraordinary proof
now that's a carl sagan truism right
so we have bumper sticker brains
so when we recognize little sayings
that seem to be true they're very
persuasive it's like oh there's a saying
well if there's a saying then it must be
true
there's no logic to it but our brains
work that way so
this this saying that extraordinary
claims demand extraordinary
proof has been out in the world for
decades and so most people just think
well
yeah that makes sense and it does
and then i go on and i say democrats
make the extraordinary claim
right now see if you think this is an
extraordinary claim
that democrats are making that despite
sky-high motivation
and plenty of opportunity to cheat in
the election
that they didn't do it how
how extraordinary would it be if you
let's say
took a pile of money cash and left it on
the street
of a crime-ridden inner city
how extraordinary would it be if you
came back in a week
and it was all there that nobody took
any
that'd be pretty extraordinary wouldn't
it right
so where you have the opportunity
and sky-high motivation for a crime
how often does it not happen zero
zero times there are zero times
that you have a gigantic motivation
orange hitler we must stop him
and you have lots of opportunity because
at the very least
giuliani has shown that there's lots of
places they could have cheated
so long as you can control the witnesses
right if you couldn't control the
witnesses it'd be harder to
you know to steal an election because
they'd be watching everything
but we do know and nobody doubts this
the democrats
did control the witnessing process
and limited it i feel like everybody
agrees that happened
there's a disagreement about how
important it was but nobody questions
that it happened
i haven't seen any pushback at it at all
and
so in a situation where you've got
effectively a pile of money sitting in
the street in a high crime neighborhood
how much proof do i need
that it got stolen a year later
do you think i would need to prove it
i don't think so i would say that the
logic of the situation
dictates that that money is gone now
is anything in this life a hundred
percent no
not really i mean nothing is a hundred
percent even if you think it is
now even even newton was a little bit
wrong on gravity right
so einstein cleared it up a little bit
so you can be a little bit wrong on
things that you're really right about
nothing's 100
but there are things that we can treat
as true because they're so likely to be
true let's go on
now the trap was and if he didn't spot
it the trap was that i knew that these
smart dumb people
would say hahahaha scott
you can't prove a negative in other
words
you can't prove uh
you can't prove that something happened
because you have no evidence right if
there's no evidence of a thing
happening or not happening you can't
prove anything so i knew people would
come in and say
you can't prove a negative so alex leo
an ex-vp of daily beast she comes in to
school me and she says this
if that's how this works now i'm gonna
need you to
prove you don't molest animals scott
i've heard you do and the extraordinary
claim that you're a sane rational
non-molester needs serious evidence all
right so here are the smart dumb people
now what i mean by a smart dumb person
is they're smart enough to know
that there's a bumper sticker saying
that you can't prove a negative
so they're smart enough to know that but
they're not smart enough
to apply that to the situation and also
understand if there's an exception
involved so they're smart
but they're dumb they're too dumb to use
what they're smart enough to know
here's my argument can you prove a
negative people
you're all very brilliant i know you're
above average if you're watching this
live stream can you prove a negative
well the first thing you should ask me
is prove it to whom
can you prove it in court or can you
prove it in a scientific way
because those are not really the same
right the burden of proof in a court
case
versus what a scientist would do those
are different
so the first thing you have to ask is
well can you prove a negative
in science can you prove a negative
in court but can you prove a negative
to the satisfaction of the public which
would be the third domain right
if i could prove it in a way that i
convince you
that can have real world utility that's
a real thing
i can make a case and convince you in
public
that it's true effectively proving it
even if it's not true so
let me give you an example if you
thought a minute ago
that you can't prove a negative let me
give you
an example suppose you had a rock in
your hand
and you're standing next to a cliff and
you take that rock and you hold it
behind you where you can't see it
and you let it go and you also know that
there's nobody else around
because you went up to the top of the
mountain by yourself and you can see
lots of visibility you're you're all
alone and you took your rock in your
hand and you held it behind you where
you can't see it
and you let go of it
can you prove that the rock
fell you don't have any witnesses
you don't have any documentation you
don't have a video of it
you don't have any proof all you know
is that the situation you created
guarantees
the result is that proof
because maybe that's an anti-gravity
pocket in the universe it just happened
to be where your hand was
maybe an alien comes out of the air with
a tractor beam and
focuses on the rock and pulls it into
space
i mean maybe it didn't fall but in the
real world
the rock fell and it fell every time but
you can't prove it
the only thing you know is that you
created a situation
in which it's only going to go one way
so back to my situation can you prove a
negative
yes you can you can prove it in a
million different ways in the real world
can you always prove can you always
prove a negative in a scientific realm
i don't know i don't care i'm not
talking about a scientific realm
can you always prove a negative in a
courtroom situation
i don't know i don't care i'm not
talking about that
the only thing that matters as fareed
zacario has explained now to the left
is whether the public believes it
can you prove to the public
that something you didn't see and didn't
witness although there are plenty of
witnesses i'm just talking
hypothetically
could you prove that something that had
to happen
happened so let me tell you
we know that the election was not secure
and there were lots of opportunities to
cheat
so long as you controlled the witnesses
which we know happened
and you had sky-high motivation
and sky-high things to gain
lots of people involved what are the
odds
that it wasn't stolen close to zero
close to zero because that setup should
guarantee
that you could have stolen an election
every time and so i would say to you
while you can't prove an election was
stolen maybe
that's possible maybe it can't be proven
but
can you convince republicans
that with that setup it had to be stolen
or at the very least you can have no
confidence that it wasn't stolen
and i believe that having no confidence
in the result even if it wasn't stolen
if you've got no confidence in it
because of the nature of the way it was
set up
you have a constitutional remedy
that's crystal clear it ends up in the
house
and you get a second term of president
trump
so to my critic ex-vp of daily beast and
alex leo
you're smart enough to know that there's
a bumper sticker that says you can't
prove a negative
but you're not smart enough to know how
any of it works in the real world
and that there's nothing that's a
hundred percent
but you can certainly make a case all
right
so here's here's the other thing that uh
my critics do that i find absolutely
hilarious
they if they make a comment and i
respond to it
just respond to it so somebody insults
me or makes a charge and i tweet back
a response just one response
what do the the bad trolls pile in and
say after that
oh i triggered you i triggered you now
and i'll be like i get
insulted on twitter once every five
minutes
and during my entire career i have been
deeply
insulted by a stranger every five
minutes
for approximately 32 years i think
i mean my entire experience is strangers
insulting me all day long
but in their minds this one is the one
that triggered me
i literally treat critics as
entertainment and now
you know part of my business model i
could not be
less concerned with somebody you know
some
rando critic on uh on twitter
but then then you get oh she's living in
your head
rent free and i'm thinking
no nothing like that's happening
all right
so newt gingrich
adds a little bit of context for us with
this tweet he says the more data that
comes out on vote anomalies
that clearly are not legitimate says
newt
the more it looks like 2020 may be the
biggest presidential theft
since adams and clay robbed andrew
jackson in 1824.
so i i'm not a big
history buff did you even know
that according to historians it's just a
fact i guess
because newt's a historian it's the fact
that
adams and clay robbed andrew jackson in
1824.
did you even know that
um all right
so that's my relative
maybe allegedly all right
oh you're seeing the news there's some
fake news
that's uh cnn's playing up big i think
fox news is playing it too
that there's somebody out in the world
suggesting
republicans boycott the senatorial
general uh the special election in
georgia
and remember what the first time i heard
that and and people on social media were
saying oh yeah ellie alexander saying
that
what did i tell you when a whole bunch
of you
said that ali alexander was saying we
should boycott the election
i said to you with no evidence no proof
no court case no science
i said that didn't happen and dozens of
you were like oh yeah he said it i saw
it myself
i witnessed it he absolutely said it it
took about a minute and a half
after the live stream was over to
validate that he did not say that and
does not want you to boycott the
election
very much does not want you to boycott
the election in fact
opposite of that now wherever the hell
you got that i don't know
i don't know if you were talking about
the primary
getting primaried or he got confused or
what but
here's what the fake news is doing to
you it's the same play
that uh rudy giuliani is doing
which is getting you used to something
before it happens
there they're sort of breaking you in
getting you a little do a little
stretching better get used to this
and that is the idea that uh there's
some republican calling for a boycott so
now cnn is reporting this again and it
reports
uh trump rejects boycott calls in
georgia runoff
so wouldn't you think that if you saw
the headline
trump rejects boycott calls
wouldn't that headline point to a link
to show you
who it was who is asking for a boycott
but it doesn't right it's a story
about republicans calling for a boycott
without any evidence or link to
republicans calling for a boycott do you
know why there's no link to
republicans calling for a boycott
because there are no republicans calling
for a boycott
no no there's no there are no
republicans calling for a boycott
right they just want you to put get that
in your head
so maybe it'll become a thing so cnn is
trying to create a boycott
by telling you that trump has rejected a
boycott
which puts boycott in your head now
you're all smart enough to know
you're being played right nobody wants a
boycott
okay so here's something i've done
before but i think it's
it's funny so i'm going to do it again i
want to take you through the
the evolution of the democrat uh
statements and arguments about the
election allegations of fraud all right
day one you're you're allo we think your
election was fraudulent say the
republicans
so the democrats sort of as
one said some version of this there was
no fraud
it isn't even possible to cheat not only
was there no fraud but it's not even
possible
wasn't that the first thing that every
democrat said
then some evidence started to or at
least allegations of evidence started to
surface and then the story
softened a little bit and it turned from
there was no
no fraud and it's not possible to okay
there was some fraud
but no one is alleging that there was
enough fraud
to change the election so just let it go
and then it turned into okay there might
be
you know okay we understand now that the
allegations
uh are not that it is oh
so i'm sorry i skipped one okay there
might be some fraud
but the but the but it's not widespread
so it went from there's none to okay
there's a little fraud but it's not
widespread
and then of course republicans explained
that the accusation was not that it was
widespread
but rather that it was focused in the
swing states and very targeted
eventually that message got through and
the democrats
response evolved a little bit more and
now it turned
and then it turned into all right okay
we understand that the allegations
are not that it was widespread but
rather targeted in swing states
but you keep moving the goal posts i
mean before you said it's widespread
now you're saying it's targeted moving
the goal posts
you're moving the goal posts except
nobody moved the goal posts it was
always
that it was targeted at the places where
it mattered
but it's still baseless still baseless
you move the goal posts and it's
baseless
you know people who move the goalposts
uh you know there's
they don't have an argument all right so
then it evolved to
um it evolved to
okay okay all right trump's lawyers are
now alleging that there's enough fraud
that would change the election
okay okay we'll give you that there
there are enough allegations that
if they were true it would change the
elections
um but it's not been proven in court
not been proven not been proven in court
and then that evolved into okay okay
you have hundreds of witnesses and
you've got tons of data analysis
showing anomalous results in swing state
cities
you've got sky-high motivation to cheat
and lots of opportunity
but it hasn't been proven so while these
things are true
lots of witnesses hundreds of them a
fraud
tons of data analysis that looks pretty
solid
and lots of opportunity and motivation
but it hasn't been proven
and then related to that is well trump
lost
whatever the number is today 38 lawsuits
in a row i'm just making that up
i think that's in the neighborhood
though he lost 38 lawsuits in a row
you know and if you lost 38
lawsuits in a row i mean that's all you
need to know
right and
then uh here's a little factoid for you
that
robert barnes attorney robert barnes
said
he said prior to the supreme court
decision on bush
verse goer every federal court
and every state supreme court had ruled
for gore
over bush every time
until the supreme court and then it
reversed
so as uh robert barnes points out he
says the election contests only start
next week because all the early stuff
just sort of doesn't count it's all
about getting to the supreme court
and it looks like they will so if you
thought that any of those
uh minor court lawsuits getting tossed
out
mattered they don't
not only that but they were different
claims with different evidence or
as the judge would say lack of evidence
so
does history repeat if the situation is
different
the whole point of history repeating is
it's got to be the same situation
but democrats have decided the history
repeats
when the thing that's repeating doesn't
have any correlation
except in words they're both called
lawsuits i guess
to the two things and they still think
history is going to repeat
that's not logical these are just
different things
one does not predict the other no matter
how many lawsuits are ever lost
in a court that doesn't mean the next
one's going to lose
they're not connected they're different
lawsuits all right
now of course i think democrats may be
starting to realize
and i think janet ellis said this to
some version of this i'm going to use my
own words for it so don't blame her if
this is wrong
but the lawsuits were really about
keeping the argument alive
and stalling and trying to get some
delay
on the certification of the vote so when
the democrats say hey you were just
flailing with these weak
cases i don't think the republicans
disagree with that
they wouldn't use the word flailing but
i don't think they'd
disagree that they were these were weak
quickly prepared cases that were just
thrown into the system
it's just that the strategy was not to
win those
the strategy was to inject doubt maybe
get a delay
keep the argument alive in the mind to
the public
make it make it look like there's lots
of smoke so there must be fire
did it accomplish those things well it
certainly accomplished the latter which
is make you think there's a lot going on
all right
so here's where i think they are today
so i think they've evolved all the way
from there was no fluoride and it's not
even
possible they've evolved all the way
okay okay history doesn't repeat
in terms of these lawsuits that's true
um
if it's if they're different kinds of
suits and sure trump lawyers have
hundreds of witnesses tons of data
analysis showing anomalous results in
swing states
they've got sky-high motivation and lots
of opportunity
but i don't see you citing any proof
so this is the one that happened today
somebody on social media
alleged the election was fraudulent and
a democrat
said you're not citing any proof
so it went from there is no proof
now it went from it didn't happen to
there's no proof
to you're not citing the proof that's a
big difference
from it's impossible to you haven't
shown me the
there is no proof to you're not citing
it in your tweet
because you know they're tweets
you don't really cite a lot of evidence
although you could
and you should all right
uh here are some of the uh
the mistakes of logic that they're
making which i talk about in my book
loserthink which you should buy as a
gift for somebody you love
for christmas it's available everywhere
the books are sold
and on page 143 i talk about a thing
called word thinking
where you try to use words to convince
people that there's an
argument but it's really just a
combination of words
so for example the word baseless which
i've talked about
is trying to make an argument by word
choice
there's no argument they're trying to
make you think there is
just by the choice of words baseless and
widespread
um and then on page 67
of loserthink is the idea that history
doesn't repeat
especially if the situation is different
and it's always different
so these lawsuits uh are obviously
don't predict the bad ones don't predict
what happens with the later ones
and then of course there's plenty of
straw man
straw manning going on here that is so
common and dumb
i didn't even include it in my book
about bad thinking
the the straw man idea where somebody
makes a claim a
and instead of defending against claim a
you just act as if they said claim b and
you defend that because it's easier to
defend
that's straw manning you're just
pretending somebody said something else
so you can defend the other thing
because you can't defend the actual
thing
so that's what the widespread thing is
so the claim is that there's specific
fraud in just the right places
and what they say when they defend is
like well there's no widespread
there's no widespread claim so that's
just
straw manning by changing the argument
all right um
let us look um oh here's another thing
that
robert barnes said by the way you should
follow him on twitter
if if you're looking to follow an
attorney who
actually is just not crazy
he would be the one all right
he tweeted how did democrats kick kanye
west off the ballot
in his home state so kanye west
was kicked off the ballot in his home
state uh minnesota right
by demanding and the answer is that by
demanding a strict
signature match so i guess there wasn't
good signature matching
on kanye's you know uh
what was it uh the uh petitions to get
on the ballot
so he got not allowed but then after
he's disallowed
by strict signature matching they decide
that the actual election
they will turn off the strict signature
matching
so so kanye is taken off the ballot
using a rule and then they change the
rule
to run the actual election there's no
justification for changing that rule
if the election process requires strict
signature matching it's a good idea when
you're
you know when you've got a petition it's
a good idea in the primaries and it's a
good idea in the
election so
all right um here let me put this in
context
do you think that the will of the people
is important in our
system well you'd say of course we vote
even if we argue about the votes
sometimes generally speaking
yeah we we get the thing we want it's
the will of the people it's basically a
democracy
even though it has lots of warts but
let's let's look at this
presidential election and i'm going to
put some some numbers on stuff
just to uh explain the concept
but the numbers i'm putting on things
are just
being pulled out of the air okay so
let me ask you this do you think that
social media
uh collectively and its choice of who to
promote and who to boost and who to
suppress how much of a percentage change
in the election result
do you think that the the all of the
social media
mechanisms caused well we don't know
but i'm going to put a number on it just
to complete an argument
so don't don't argue too much about
whether this number is right
just just wait for the fuller argument
okay i'll say
i'll say five percent all right i've
seen bigger estimates i see them in the
comments you're saying
17 10 to 15 20 but just for argument
i'll take a modest number i feel like
you would all agree
that it's at least five percent i mean
is there any smart person in the world
today
who would argue that the social media
decisions
didn't move the election five percent i
don't think anybody would make that
argument today
they might argue at 17 but i don't think
even democrats would argue five percent
would they
so let's let's put a pin on that so
let's say the social media moved at five
percent
and of course it would have moved it
five percent toward biden
how about the fake news
does the fact that we just saw a survey
that showed that democrats actually
haven't seen
a lot of the news haven't seen the stuff
about hunter biden
haven't seen allegations about tara reid
and all that
if you put together all of the the
hoaxes
the the drinking bleach hoax the fine
people hoax
and then all the news that they don't
even show
how much as a percentage and again these
are just more conceptual percentages
there's no real science here um how much
do you think
that cumulatively moved
the needle now of course you've got fox
news very powerful entity
you know persuading in the other
direction but i would say that this
that the fake news probably i'm going to
say five percent
now i see bigger estimates in the
comments 20
35 75 i don't doubt your numbers
so i'm not going to say that your
estimate that it moved in 75 percent
i'm not going to say that's wrong i'm
just going to stay
a modest number to make a larger point
right say 5
how about rule changes
how many rule or law changes did we see
just before the election well the one i
talked about
robert barnes talked about a rule change
that kicked
kanye off the ballot had he been on the
ballot
would it have changed the election i
think so
what about changes to having uh
unsolicited mail-in ballots sent to
everybody that was a rule change right
how much did that affect things well we
knew that democrats would be more likely
male and below people and we knew that
republicans were more vote in person
people
so i think every expert would agree
that if you look at the cumulative
number of rule changes
about signature matching and where
witnesses can be
and where they can stand and
you know there were decisions made by uh
judges that should have been
legislators if you just just take all of
those
rule changes together how much did they
move the election
well i'll be modest again i'll say five
percent again because i don't know
i mean could be more i'll just say five
percent
all right so how much did covent
change the outcome now in one way it
changed it is that caused
some of the rule changes such as
unsolicited mail-in ballots
but how much did it change it beyond
that how many people
didn't vote because they didn't want to
take a risk
you know people who didn't want to mail
invalid but they were afraid of going in
person
we don't know but i would say that
it probably changed things i mean it
probably had some effect right
so how much did fraud change the
election
well some of you are going to say 100
you know it flipped the result
some of you can say well it's there's
some
but maybe not enough to change the
election in my opinion
it's at least five percent just
subjective just an opinion don't ask me
to prove it
i'm just saying that i live in the real
world and when you see a situation that
looks like this one where you have all
the opportunity in the world to cheat
plenty of opportunity as long as you can
control the witnesses which is true
and sky high motivation to do it like
just through the roof motivation
you're gonna get at least five percent
fraud i mean i would
estimate massive fraud
but it's at least five percent all right
so let's take these together so again
i'm taking the low end of what i think
most of you think could be much
bigger impacts but let's look at them
together social media maybe move things
five percent
fake news five percent rule changes five
percent
covered i don't know maybe another five
percent fraud
maybe five percent now if you add all
these together
uh how many did you get here uh 5 10 15
20 25 and most of that movement
would be toward biden how much did the
will of the people
factor into this election
zero zero
now you could argue that the will of the
people had to at least get within
striking distance
like it had to be a close-ish election
for the will of the people to be
completely irrelevant right
so i guess in some sense you we at least
got it to a tie
so in some hypothetical theoretical
sense then the people's will
made some difference but the total
amount that the
vote changes we're talking about this
you know two
three percent thing but we've got
probably at least
25 impact of things that had nothing to
do with the will of the people
the completely unrelated so
do we even have a democracy
no no no we don't
it's not even close we're not even in
the same universe as a democracy or a
republic
you know whenever i say democracy about
the united states you're all smart
enough to translate that into your mind
right
we're a republic with democratic
elements to our
our system um
yeah we're not even close but here's the
weird thing
are you okay with it now you're not okay
with the
result so a lot of you are not okay with
the outcome
but are you okay with the fact
that we live in a country that is not
even close
to a democracy in terms of presidential
elections not even close
we're not anywhere near it
well weirdly we all complain about it
and none of us are
okay with it in terms of the outcome but
we kind of do accept it
remember this rule that it sounds so
trivial
but it explains so much of life
you can get used to anything you can get
used to anything
and we live in a system that's not even
close to a democracy
or republic while we all want that
yeah we just sort of got used to it now
part of how you can get used to it is
sort of understanding that as newt
gingrich says
there probably has been mischief forever
probably there's never been an election
that was
as fair as it needed to be probably
we've never had the system that we
thought we did that we were taught in
school
it probably never existed but what
changed
is now you know it and what changed is
that the fake news and social media
um became more powerful
so it's even more obvious that it was
never what you thought it was
it's just more obvious but it's probably
not that
different in terms so let me ask you
this
if our system is as i say not a
democracy but rather
is a competition between oligarchs
is that worse if you had a choice
of a benevolent dictator or
a very flawed democracy where the wrong
person could get elected
which one's a better system if you could
if you knew and of course this is the
hard part because you can't guarantee
that a dictator is benevolent
and absolute power corrupts so it's a
tough
tough deal but if you could get it
you know if there were any way that
that's possible and i think it's
basically not
but if it were possible that would be a
better system
than a democracy as long as the people
you know liked their system and weren't
complaining about it but what about the
system we actually do have
it's not a democracy it's not any kind
of a dictatorship
clearly but it's definitely
uh a war between oligarchs and
persuaders
there's this hidden underground war of
their you know now you've got the data
analysts who are coming in like an
infantry you know the republicans sent
in the data analysts
it's just like a war you know they said
all right you know
we got the tanks over here we better
call in the air support over here
got the data analyst move the data
analysts in
we got the money people all right bring
in the billionaires
then the billionaires you know compete
with fighting and sorry bring in the
networks
networks come online and the networks
come in and fox news fights cnn
and stuff like that but the
our process is now
maybe 20
rich people fighting it out for control
it's 20 rich people fighting it down for
control that is our system
is it worse than
like an actual democracy
probably not
probably not if you think i'm
complaining
i'm not i'm just noting
that you don't live in the reality that
you hoped to live in
i don't know if it's worse because isn't
the united states doing pretty well
i mean compared to other countries and
hasn't our system really
realistically it's always been this
battle of 20
20 powerful people and then they decide
based on their little battle
who it is that the public thinks is
president that's kind of what's going on
i don't know if it's any different than
it's ever been and so
i'm not going to complain about it
because all of our systems have flaws
but it is useful to know something more
about your reality
all right
um i don't remember if i said this or i
thought i said it
but i had asked the other day whether it
was possible
to create a voting app or a voting
system that
is you know credible and free from fraud
and a lot of smart people said no that
we don't have the technology to do that
i vehemently disagree i believe that
if you assemble the various technologies
that do exist
we already have everything we need
blockchain being you know one component
as smart people have said you need to
not just check that the vote happened
the way the person voted you need to
also be able to check that the person
voting is the person you want to vote
and that they have the the right to vote
you can do all that
i believe that's completely doable all
right
best periscope ever thank you i i don't
know that it was but
i always like to hear that
somebody says a representative democracy
is an oligarchy
it kind of is isn't it yeah yeah a
representative democracy
but at least in theory the oligarchs
would be ones you voted for
but in reality voters don't have that
much
effect on the presidency today
somebody says you don't need blockchain
i believe that too i think you don't
need blockchain
i'm not as well informed to know
but why would you need blockchain if you
could
just audit your own vote if after you
voted
and you know the election's done and
certified you can just
check your app and it shows you the vote
on the database and you know it got
there
would you need blockchain i don't know
i feel as if you could get there without
it but i'm not the expert
all right um
[Music]
somebody says the freed zacario video is
from september
interesting but it's on social media
recently
so if it gets so if that's true and it
probably is
see that i wouldn't doubt that at all
um but the so
if you want to modify in your head what
i said about farid the only thing you
would change
is that it's new information to his
crowd i've got a feeling that they are
not
hearing that because when they argue
about it they don't
act like they know that path is there
and i think what's also new
is that if it's true that it's from
september and it probably is
um when fareed was first saying it
it probably sounded really uh
theoretical
but if you fast forward from september
to today
does it sound theoretical because now
you can observe
that the president's attorneys have
succeeded
in convincing at least the republican
public
that it was fraudulent do you think that
didn't affect the republican politicians
no if the republican public thinks the
election was stolen
the politicians kind of need to think
that too
even if they don't think it they're
going to have to agree with their base
on that
it's too important
somebody says mcconnell and graham got
thousands of illegal votes
well the thing that you will never catch
me doing
is acting like fraud could only happen
on one side
but i am wondering why we're not hearing
accusations from democrats
that republicans also did some fraud
so there's another dog that's not
barking do you hear it
where are the democrats who normally
just throw back whatever accusation you
throw at them right
i mean it works both ways if anybody
accuses anybody of anything
the other side in five seconds will say
well you're doing it
you did it last year we're just doing
what you did
so are you a little bit curious that the
most
obvious thing that should be happening
now is the democrats saying
you say we stole the election yeah what
about your republican-controlled towns
what about them they're stealing
elections i've got witnesses
where are those because there's a trap
there right
if the if the democrats decided that
they would say hey
you guys are cheating too then then
trump becomes president
because if the democrats think there was
cheating and the republicans think there
was cheating
and we don't know the net of the
cheating the election
doesn't get certified the house votes
and trump gets the second term so the
democrats
even if they think republicans massively
cheated in
other places you know the the
republicans are making claims
about the swing states but maybe
maybe where there were where there was a
little more
republican control of a local election
you don't think there was any fraud
in any old in any local election
you know at least within the city there
was republican control
none i would submit to you
that the democrats probably have a whole
bunch of examples
that they're just sitting on because
they don't want to raise the idea
that fraud is possible because the
biggest part of the point is it's not
possible
so so they have cut themselves off from
their most
normal i just realized i'm not wearing
my
my ring on camera i take it off to type
because sometimes it limits my finger
movement
but i'm still married in case you wonder
um
anyway i think i finished my point
that's all for now and i'll talk to you
tomorrow
all right periscope is off and youtube
you have my full attention yeah the
slaughter meter became
um the wrong measurement for the
situation
because what happened was i do still
think
that in terms of the original purpose of
the slaughter meter
was predicting that trump would get the
right number of votes to be reelected
i still think that's true it's just i
don't know if we'll ever be able to know
will the system ever suss that out so
the slaughter meter
uh was designed about how many votes
trump would get i'm i'm reluctant to
repurpose it and say
it's now the the odds that the legal and
constitutional system
will will put him back in back in power
so i'm gonna just skip that for now i
think
uh what is my prediction of who will
take office uh biden
so my prediction that biden will will
take office
is not based on the legal challenge it's
not based on how many votes there were
whether or not there was fraud or
whether or not it can be proven
or even if the fraud was enough to
reverse the election it's based on the
fact that i don't think the
courts could
could inject this much let's say
damage into the system that i believe
the courts
would ignore the law to protect the
system
and i'd be okay with that actually if
no i'm not sure it's the right decision
but in terms of the
the balance if the supreme court is ever
confronted with a decision
where they could be technically legally
constitutionally accurate
but if they are it will destroy the
country
i depend on them to protect the country
first
right and i think i can protect i can
depend on that
they're going to protect the country and
they're going to avoid a civil war
even if it means a ridiculous decision
so i don't think the supreme court can
be the help that the president wants
and i think that the social media and
fake news
are now powerful enough that they can
just bully
biden into office and just tell you it
was all fine
so i don't think trump has the power to
overcome
those forces but it's not impossible
like fareed zakaria said apparently in
september
there's a there's a path with no
obstacle
he's got a clear clean path to the
office
just don't know if he'll take it all
right that's all for now
i'll talk to you tomorrow
