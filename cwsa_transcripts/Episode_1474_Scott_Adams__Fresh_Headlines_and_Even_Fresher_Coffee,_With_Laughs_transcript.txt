well good morning
it is good morning
it's a terrific morning
because the news
is
funny tragic
it's always tragic
but funny
but tragic
and i don't want to make light of the
fact that it's tragic
but also sometimes funny so we'll do a
little bit of that but
before we get into that
how would you like to take it up a notch
yeah you would get a little extra
make it uh one of those days that you
remember for i don't know until tomorrow
anyway well all you need is a copper mug
or glass a tanker chelsea steiner
canteen drug or flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid i
like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day the
thing that makes everything
better
it's called the simultaneous sip if
you've heard of it
and it's going to happen now
wait watch the hear the echo in my cup
no
go
yeah
that was so real
it was like you were there
and
let's talk about the news
well by far the most important news of
the day
by far
is that my album is dropping
i always wanted to say that my album is
dropping today now i don't actually have
an album but i'm featured on one
my voice is
basket case theory the single is
dropping i think in an
hour or so so in about an hour you'll be
able to see it just to search for
basket case theory and look for akira
the dawn and meaning wave is the is the
genre or i don't know the label i guess
i'm not sure what to call that
but the rest of the album will be uh
available later but the signal is out
today
get it
get it
all right now
if there was one thing i needed to make
me happy in this world
one thing
that would tell me that the golden age
is here
um it would be this announcement
that tesla is making a robot
yes
tesla
is making a robot
now
how many words is that tesla is making a
robot five words
they're the five words
they're
possibly
the most important five words
in humankind's history
maybe not i mean it could be just
another product and
other people would make robots and stuff
and you know life will go on or
or
those five words
tesla is making a robot
will be the five words that change
everything
just
everything
do you want to do you want to know how
much it's going to change
i don't know anything about this robot
right so so this is me speaking with
zero knowledge except there's a some
indication that tesla makes wants to
make a bot called the tesla bot
we'll probably find out more about it
but number one
do you think that tesla
uniquely could make a market
for human-like or maybe not but robots
that live in your home and help you out
yes
yes
could microsoft do it
microsoft a gigantic successful company
right could they make a robot
that you would buy
it'll be really expensive the first ones
i don't know how much but just imagine
you have to be pretty rich to buy the
first one you know just like you did for
the original teslas right they're pretty
expensive
but do you think microsoft could pull
that off
even if they bought the
the best
marketers and engineers in the world
nope
nope i don't think they could they just
don't have the right
company vibe image
they can't control the uh
the reality distortion field how about
apple
could apple computer
make an apple robot
that makes you say all right any price
i'm just going to buy that damn robot i
got to have an apple robot
that's a trick question
why is it no you're ahead of me
damn it citizen x
here i am trying to make clever surprise
points
and you're spoiling it for me but keep
on doing it because it was funny
as citizen x points out
could apple make a robot
without steve jobs
right
i think the answer is no
i hate to say it i mean apple is maybe
the premier company of all companies you
know i doubt anybody's better at
anything
than apple is at everything basically so
there's nothing you can say bad about
apple computer i mean it's just an
amazing company you know one of the
wonders of the world at this point
but
they don't have steve jobs
and if somebody's going to make you
buy a robot
you need a steve jobs
so can tesla
get you to buy a robot
for an outlandish price
to have your first robot in your house
and the answer is yes
let me let me say that again yes
i i would put it in order for that robot
without even seeing the specs or the
price
honestly if i could place an order
i would place an order without knowing
the price
you know i have no enough money i could
probably afford it
i wouldn't need to know the price i
wouldn't know what it could do
i wouldn't need to know how long the
battery lasts
or even whether it might kill me
because it got mad at me
i want that robot
is there anybody else here with me is
there anybody here anybody else who have
the same feeling which is
are you serious
elon musk is making a robot
uh
uh when can i get one
now imagine imagine the same story
except it's microsoft
microsoft is making a robot
i think i'm gonna wait for version 2.0
right
right it's completely different
if musk is making a robot i want one
i want one
but if microsoft makes one i'm going to
wait for version 2.0 well see if has any
functions i want i'll check out the
specifications
see what the competition is offering
but uh musk has that thing so maybe you
can make that work but here's the bigger
part it's not about the robot
it's about
uh
you know you don't see this coming yet
if tesla makes a robot put put the parts
together here now if tesla makes a robot
number one
they can colonize mars
and build a base
and have it ready for us
right
elon musk
can i swear permission to swear
permission to swear i need some
permission
anybody in the comments i need somebody
to tell me i can swear
all right i'll keep it modest put the
child children away get them they're
getting ready for school it goes like
this
elon musk
can put a robot on mars
who else could do that well maybe bezos
can do it right but elon musk let me say
it again he's going to put a
robot on mars
i don't know if that's like specifically
in his plans nobody said that
but how do you build a base on mars
it's going to be super dangerous
robots right
so he's probably going to commercialize
them on earth you know get the process
working ship a ton of robots to
mars and mars will become like elon
musk's robot planet and when the chinese
try to land and take over mars it'll
already be populated
with fighting robots that'll keep the
chinese from populating mars
i mean you have to see how far ahead
he's looking here it's crazy
secondly and here's the fun part elon
musk is also famous for talking about
the fact that we're a simulated reality
and that you and i are really just
created by some intelligence as a
program
we think we're real
like players in the game but maybe we're
not
here's the fun part
what happens
if elon musk makes a robot
that thinks it's real
thinks it's alive
do you think he'll do that
because if he did and he could it's
certainly well within his technical you
know his company's abilities to just
program the thing to act and talk like
he thinks is real
what then
yeah it's gonna you up you know you
don't know it yet
but if elon musk makes a robot that
thinks it's real
everything changes
you just don't know it yet but it'll
change everything
all right
uh apparently the remaining mexico
policy that trump got through in his
administration
um is so sticky that biden tried to
reverse it and the courts said no
so
according to
some you know not the supreme court but
lower federal appeals court
uh they've got to reinstitute that
remain in mexico thing
so again
trump looks right
right
i mean on immigration
trump looks right i think we could say
that you don't have to be a partisan to
say he looks right now compared to the
alternative
um
and trump was right i think that's the
hashtag that was going around on twitter
because obviously afghanistan makes
trump look right even if he wasn't he
looks right right you don't know what he
would have done because he wasn't there
but he looks right
he looks right on inflation he looks
right on
looks right on a lot of stuff
so it's a bad time to be biden
here's something i wondered about but
didn't know
where was the taliban getting all their
funding and weapons and stuff
do you know that
where was the taliban getting all of its
support because you need a lot of money
weapons and guns and training and all
that stuff
well i'm seeing iran and i think iran is
part of the answer
and i'm seeing pakistan i don't know
that's the answer according to gordon
chang
who's uh writing um on uh
i think it was in fox news
by the way that's that's by same bird
every morning there's this one bird who
walks in front of my security camera
you know if you see him
that's the bird and he go it's always
during the live stream that's to say
it's the same freaking bird
every time
anyway
apparently china
has been funding and supporting the
taliban from the beginning since after 9
11.
what
that's right so china didn't even close
their embassy they're so close to the
taliban
they didn't close their embassy in kabul
all right think about that
they didn't even close their embassy
that's how close they are yeah china
is responsible for everything bad in the
world
but now they own the taliban and gordon
chang is
telling us that uh
you know we should we should be worried
about that and i am
now uh rasmussen did a poll this is very
relevant to all this and asked people if
they think that biden is really making
the decisions or if there's somebody
behind the curtain
who is making the decisions and i think
rasmussen has not released this
yet but it's coming out soon
i got a little sneak peek and how many
people of the voting public so this
would be both parties you know
representative sample of likely voters
what percentage of them do you think
believe remember this is democrats and
republicans
so what percentage of them in total do
you think believe biden is actually in
charge
give me your number
all right i'm seeing people guessing you
know 20 29 49
85 40 49 the answer is
39 of the public thinks the president
is in charge
and actually making his own decisions
39
let me say that again
that includes his base
right now obviously his base is kinder
to him than the
republicans
but even his base
a lot of them don't think he's making
decisions
now i take you back
to my strangest prediction ever
which is that
trump would be running against kamala
harris not joe biden even after kamala
harris
left the primaries
i doubled down my prediction and said
he's still running against kamala harris
well i was close
because if
if you know a solid majority
51 of the people and this rasmussen poll
thinks that other people are making
decisions for him and that includes a
good chunk of democrats don't think
biden is in charge
and 10 percent said they're not sure
i don't know that 10 is always funny
um
but here's my take on this
i think joe biden is in charge of some
decisions
the doomed ones
right if a decision is doomed meaning
there's just nothing you can do right
it's biden's decision or he assigns
kamla harris to it
right if there's something where you
can't win like immigration
uh let's but let biden make this
decision
and then he'll give it to kabul harris
i think they hate kamala harris
i'm almost convinced they're going to
give her the american evacuation from
afghanistan project for her portfolio
uh after you've solved the immigration
problem kamala
can you be in charge of getting all
those americans out of afghanistan
but i think that project is doomed
whoever works in that is going to look
like a horrible horrible person
that's right
because we kind of hate you
so it seems as if the democrats are
trying to destroy kamala harris
faster than republicans
i mean republicans are just sort of
watching the show they don't even have
to go hard at her because there's not
much there
but the democrats it looks like the
democrats are going to take the horse
out and shoot it
so they can get a better horse
so the democrats have to first shoot the
horse they came on camel harris broken
leg
they don't get another horse
so watching the democrats execute their
own leader
will be kind of fun because they'll do
that in the press
well it looks like everybody's turning
on biden for this afghanistan stuff even
uh jennifer rubin famously the you know
most anti-trumper
ever
well there's a lot of competition for
that i suppose but she's right up there
and what works for the washington post
and
here's what she tweeted
uh
and she tweeted at the department of
defense so she's not messing around on
this one
she says in a briefing that british
paratroopers going into kabul to get
their people
why aren't we
department of defense isn't authorized
white house needs to give that
authorization and give enough troops to
do that
wtf are we waiting for
maybe we're waiting to put harris in
charge of it
maybe
wow and after harris is in charge of
evacuating all those americans
who are surrounded by the taliban and
have no military assistance
she'll do fine on that
i think her next assignment is to quell
inflation
and she'll be looking into the causes of
inflation and making that go away
right after she solved uh
you know immigration and this evacuation
stuff
so kamala harris good luck with your
portfolio of
tasks
you're gonna need it
now
here is the weirdest thing that might
come out of this have i ever told you
that unintended consequences tend to be
the only ones that matter in things
it seems like no matter how well you
plan
no matter how smart you are
the stuff that you couldn't see coming
is what matters and i'm just going to
put this out here
let's accept
that joe biden and his administration
and the military
botched
the withdrawal
can we all stipulate that so i've argued
before
that you know we don't know all the
details and maybe they botched it and
maybe they didn't have any options that
were good
but let's for this for let's just
stipulate it looks botched
certainly it looks that way
by the way if anybody says to me scott
you're crazy
why are you defending it when it so
obviously looks like a botched thing
i agree with you it looks botched
which was really my point things can
look botched but maybe you should wait
for all the information to come out it
might not be it might be there was just
no damn choice that was any good
but here's the weird thing that could
happen
it could be the most
botched best thing that ever happened
accidentally
because if the taliban had not been
completely amazingly successful
what would have been the alternative
civil war
right now everybody agrees with that
right it wasn't like the taliban was
going to quit
nobody thinks that so there's either
going to be a protracted civil war with
all that that implies very very very bad
or it's going to go the way it went
which is instant collapse
with
little violence
now what happens when the taliban
wins convincingly and the only thing
they have to do
is just not screw anything up for a few
weeks
all the taliban has to do
is just don't make a gigantic mistake
because they won
they won
what would be a gigantic mistake for the
taliban
look
let me take care of this on uh
on youtube
in all capital scott is actually a
barden apologist wow never will view him
the same
i think biden is brain dead
i don't know how i can say that any
better i'm just saying that you should
wait for all the information before you
make a decision do you think that's too
tough
is that more than you can handle can you
not handle me agreeing with you that it
certainly looks botched
if you're looking at the surface
totally looks like complete incompetence
top to bottom
but we also don't know all the
information
anyway
so
um
i think i was talking about something
before that guy
triggered me
what was i talking about oh there could
be the the best
mistake ever
so let's say the mistake was we
underestimated the taliban's um success
complete mistake so the taliban takes
over what was the result of the mistake
no civil war
right the result of a massive
intelligence failure
was avoiding a civil war
okay
what is the second part of that
the taliban won
they don't want to give it away not yet
i mean they could make mistakes in the
future but not today
they just won
all they have to do
is give safe passage to the americans
that's it
that's all they have to do
and they get everything
everything
all they have to do
is just don't touch
one hair
on one american
just do that
now i don't know if they can pull that
off because they don't have such command
and control that they can control every
bad fighter everywhere who's got a bad
attitude right so i doubt
they can pull that off completely
but we'll know if they tried right we'll
at least know if if the taliban
leadership made a serious effort
to you know let the let the americans
out without being
killed
it's going to be messy
but we'll know if they tried
think about a motivation remember the
democrats get motivation wrong all the
time
what is the taliban motivated to do
right now
right now
they are motivated to let us out with no
no injuries if they can pull it off at
least that's what the leadership would
be motivated for the individual fighters
is going to be tough to get them to
comply
so here's what the biggest
botched mistake and i would agree with
you on what it looks like okay we'll
find out more but what it looks like is
a giant botched
incompetent thing that avoided a civil
war
and might
might
get all the americans out without
trouble
might
now if that happens let's take this as a
an if okay giant if
if if it turns into bloodshed and
hostages well that would be the worst
case and and certainly nobody wants that
but
suppose that happens
suppose
that the taliban does let the americans
mostly get out
and it doesn't become a big hostage you
know death
march
and we avoided a civil war
it would be the biggest botch
ever
that kind of worked out
and the other interesting thing is that
apparently the taliban is making nice
with both russia and china
because russia and china want to have
influence over the taliban
in afghanistan
how's that going to work out
[Laughter]
is there anything better than leaving
afghanistan to our biggest
rivals
russia and china yeah i know they have
the
they have the rare earth minerals and
stuff but good luck getting them
good luck getting them out of the ground
i don't know maybe you can do it but
good luck
i feel as though
yeah if i ever told you before that you
can't you can't tell the difference
between good news and bad news i think
mark twain said that we can't tell the
difference between good news and bad
news
this botched withdrawal looks like the
worst news ever
doesn't it
it looks like it's going to ripple
through our
foreign policy decisions forever it's
going to humiliate us in the public
stage americans maybe blah blah blah
blah we lost the war
it's all bad
except
it is this close
to being the best thing that ever
happened
do you see that
now it might not that that little
distance between the best thing that
ever happened
which is we get out of afghanistan fast
and all the americans get out too
could be
now what is up with the taliban acting
not like the taliban they've said
that they're going to be basically more
flexible with women's rights
you know subject to islamic limitations
so you don't know if that means anything
really
but they've said they won't get
retaliation on the interpreters
again
i don't know if they can make that
happen but they're saying it they're
saying it they say they're going to let
the americans out
i think they're even saying they want to
just like build relations keep the
existing government operating
it's like the taliban is saying all the
right things
what's up with that
do we really even know what the taliban
is all about
have we
have we conflated the taliban with isis
and al qaeda
have we just sort of said they're all
the same thing like i'm not going to be
the guy who defends the taliban i'm just
going to raise the question
why are they why are they even talking
like that
right
yeah i mean if it's sharia law
you know it's not going to be too
flexible
you know why why are they pulling that
off the taliban is actually pulling off
an impression of a reasonable entity
is it just just a trick
or
or do they just want to govern the
country without foreign interference and
they want to do it their way i don't
know i mean it's not good no matter what
how you look at it but it could it could
be not what we think it is
well trump is the best criticizer of all
criticizers i think we can all agree on
that and he's going after this afghan
situation
in his usual inimitable
best in the world criticizer in my
opinion
best in the world criticizer nobody
criticizes better than trump because he
keeps it simple he repeats it it's
catchy
it's got a nickname sometimes
nobody criticizes like he does and
here's what he said
let's say he
said uh damn it did i not put down his
quote
um
well
it doesn't matter what he said he he
said that you should do it in the order
of you know do it in a smart order where
you you get rid of the people that you
get rid of the military assets then you
bomb the
bomb are your bases they can't be reused
and then you leave the military so trump
quite reasonably showed an order of
doing things that's not the way we did
it and would make common sense
so trump's criticism is perfect
because he he draws the parallel says we
should have done this and everybody
agrees commonsensically it looks like we
should have done it this way
the way we did it was this way and it's
botched
it's just a perfect
i mean even even his critics are going
to agree with him on this this will be
the one thing that even the critics say
well okay trump's right about that
but i still i still have the belief
that no matter what order you did things
it was going to end up the same
maybe worse
because as soon as you got serious about
getting americans out
the government would have fell
because the afghan government would say
wait wait hold on they're getting all
the americans out
what
seriously they're evacuating all the
americans
i'm getting out of here
i think the afghan government would have
fallen the moment they heard that
americans were doing a massive
evacuation campaign
now to jennifer rubin's point
so today's the day we can agree with our
critics and people on the other side
at least when it comes to american lives
and military stuff that's this is one
place we tend to be able to agree i
agree with jennifer rubin
why aren't we sending
troops like the like the british are why
aren't we sending out trucks and
vehicles to pick up these americans
why are we letting them do it themselves
i mean i don't understand that
so
jennifer rubin's got a good question
there
um
so uh
let's talk about my uh
uh well i call him my mascot so i
started out as a critic and i if you've
ever seen this before
um when my critics come after me they'll
often have what they think is a pretty
good point so good that they'll say it
in public
and they'll come after me on twitter
social media whatever
and then i will weigh in
and because i'm a trained hypnotist
and smarter than my critics in every
single case
what no no i think it's true yes i'm
smarter than my critics in every single
case
let's say that's a universal truth
um we all think that right we're all
smarter than our critics every single
time
i think we can we can bond on that
belief
that our critics are always wrong
can we agree on that are critics always
wrong
well
um because i'm a hypnotist i can throw
my critics into cognitive dissonance
pretty easily and then i transform them
into what i call mascots
now a critic is somebody who's making
some points that are pretty good or at
least well something you can argue with
but a mascot just says nonsense
because they're just a mascot
so now my critic named anomaly on
twitter who's now my mascot
he's just babbling about stuff
but today his criticism in public
was that i the creator of the dilbert
comic
don't know this is what anomaly says my
mascot he says that i don't understand
that sometimes the people who get
promoted to
power positions are not the most capable
let me say this again
i'm the creator of the dilbert comic
whose main theme is that your management
and all your experts are incompetent
for 32 years every single day i wake up
and i make a joke about how your
managers and the people in charge are
really incompetent
my mascot has decided to criticize me in
public for not understanding that
sometimes the experts and the people in
charge are not the best of the best
he said that in public
that
that's not a critic
that's a mascot
that's a mascot
all right
so i was wondering what other criticisms
he had if he's criticizing the creator
of dilbert for not knowing that
management sometimes is imperfect
um is he also criticizing jeff bezos for
not making enough money
uh jeff bezos he's doing some good work
but
i don't feel he's making enough money
that's the sort of thing a mascot would
say
criticizing cheech and chong for not
smoking enough weed and
criticizing trump for never saying
enough bad things about his adversaries
so those are some things that i think my
mascot will be
waiting into next
but my favorite
is that my mascot believes and he's
mocking me today on twitter that i don't
understand
that vaccinations did not work in israel
did not work
what
somebody needs to tell the country of
israel
and their leadership and all of their
experts that the vaccinations didn't
work because israel is under the
impression that they work really well
wouldn't you think that that's exactly
the sort of thing we'd all agree on
don't you think that the question of
did vaccinations
decrease death and hospitalizations
and were were measuring and
gathering the data don't you think
don't you think
that we could have
you know maybe
figured out if it's working or not
but according to my mascot you can't
tell it looks like it's not working
why because people who are fully
vaccinated are
the people who are mostly in the
hospitals
oh
if the fully vaccinated people are
mostly the people in hospitals let me do
some thinking with my noggin
that means well it can only mean one
thing
it means that vaccinations give you
coven
i don't know what else you could mean if
people who have the vaccinations
are getting sick and dying of covet
logically
the vaccinations are giving you colon
now my even my critic doesn't say that
that's too stupid
but
let me let me think of another reason
what could be another explanation for
why israel
is almost fully vaccinated and yet
the people who are getting sick are
fully vaccinated how is it possible that
with a virus that can still infect you
if you have the vaccination in a nation
that almost everybody is vaccinated how
could it be possible that most of the
people in the hospital are vaccinated
could it be because
that's the only kind of people in israel
who can get infected
is vaccinated people
because everybody's vaccinated
not everybody but enough of them that
the numbers require that all right now
somehow my mascot has decided that this
means i'm wrong about something
but i don't know what that is he needs
to specify
am i wrong
the vaccinations don't work
well let's let's rewind the tape
what did scott say
last year when project
warp speed was introduced
so those of you have been watching me
what did i say
when the vaccinations were first
announced that they were going to rush
them and they were going to do them what
did i say about the likelihood that they
would work meaning that there would be
an actual vaccination that just stops
you from getting it what did i say
i said they wouldn't work
i said that we would probably have great
advances in therapeutics
i said therapeutics would surprise you
on the upside it'd be better than you
think
and i told you
that based on what i saw from the
experts this wasn't my own opinion i
said that well we've been trying to make
a coronavirus vaccination forever
and never succeeded why are we going to
do it now because that's what the
experts said
they said i don't think you can do that
i'm not even sure you can make a
vaccination for
uh covet
like it might not even be possible with
anything we know how to do
and that's what i said so i told you
that the vaccination wouldn't work
i told you therapeutics would be awesome
we created something we call a
vaccination but it's really more like a
therapeutic because it doesn't stop the
infection it just makes it
you make well probably does in some
cases but it doesn't stop it cold
and
so there you go
so as far as i know i'm the rightest
person on vaccinations
right do you know anybody else who said
we would surprise with therapeutics but
the vaccination probably wouldn't work
i think there were some experts who said
it and i guess they're right but
i said it
so am i am i not exactly correct when
now that we need boosters
it's
it's a little bit more clear that it's
closer to a therapeutic than it is to a
vaccination i don't know that i was
wrong about anything as far as i know
but
why do i talk so much about whether i
was right or wrong and i know it's
obnoxious to all of you
and many of you have quit watching my
live streams because i keep
telling you that my critics are wrong
well i think that that's actually useful
because the
the biggest part of my content
is working through the thinking and the
illusions of it so if i don't tell you
why my critics are wrong
then i would be missing maybe the most
important part of this content which is
telling you what works and what doesn't
when it comes to thinking and
understanding your reality
now that doesn't mean
i'm harping
yeah there's a little harping
asking questions is not the same as
criticism yeah it is
if you ask the right kind of question
it's the same
why don't they just call it a
therapeutic well it's really a hybrid
typically you don't think of
therapeutics being a vaccination or like
an injectable
needle that protects you a little bit
but it's sort of a therapeutic trouble
is it's a hybrid
it's not a vaccination it's marketed as
one yeah that that is correct it's not a
vaccination in the classic way
um
oh by the way uh in separate news i saw
that uh the greg guffeld show his his
evening show
just topped a cool bear in the ratings
so uh
give give a little congratulations to
greg guffeld for
topping the entire field
he just lapped the entire field no
number one rated show
in that time slot against
stephen colbert
so there you go
um
and
there there's your classic talent stack
story right how often do i tell you
how often do i tell you that
if you assemble a bunch of skills
and you could be let's say in the top 20
or so of those skills
you have a world-class product
greg's just the perfect example that
you know
writes does tv looks good on tv he's
funny he you know he understands
politics he knows persuasion if you
could go right down the line
and you say to yourself holy hell he's
he's he's assembled these list of
compatible skills
that just really add up to something now
i i make this case about other people as
well so i don't just say it about people
i like or you know people or my friends
or whatever
but look at hannity for example
wouldn't you say that hannity
you like him or not doesn't matter if
you like him or not his his talent stack
is really impressive
like he has the entire
list of every skill you would need to be
as successful as he is it's not an
accident
now i i had one topic i wanted to talk
about that i missed on my notes how did
i do that
um there's a larry elder
story
that's funny i was sure i wrote that
down i mean maybe missing a page or
something but larry elder running in the
recall election against
um
against uh
newsom
and
cnn is trying to do some hit pieces
against him now here's the funny part
i've been waiting and waiting
for the left to to go hard at larry
elder and i wondered what they had
you know i wonder what kind of horrible
things in his past and i'm not going to
list
the stuff that they're mentioning
because i don't know that it's true it's
how at least one of them sounds untrue
but
here's the funny thing
every criticism about him
is making me like him more
you should look into it yourself i'm not
even going to mention
i won't even mention what the criticisms
are just look them up yourself just look
on cnn and when you read the criticisms
you're going to say to yourself
i think i like him more
it's kind of funny that they can't find
anything
like like one of the criticisms involved
in you know smoking a lot of weed no i
don't know if he's ever smoked weed
right but if he did
i probably like him more not less some
of the other criticisms are about uh
humorous insulting things he said about
various you know woke groups and i read
the insults and i think that was pretty
good
that was pretty funny
i think there was one about there was
some
there was some women's march
they made
let's just say
he made a very
he made a joke about the women's march
that was totally politically incorrect
but pretty damn funny in a trump-like
way you know like you'd laugh of it
because you know he's going to get in
trouble
i've often said
that the thing that makes good writing
and especially humor work is that you
have to think the person who wrote it or
said it could get in trouble
like that's what makes it interesting so
the things that you probably like most
about what i say
if you like anything about what i say is
when you think oh he's going to get in
trouble for that
they're going to come after him for that
and that's what larry elder apparently
does well i mean
it's been his job on the radio to be
provocative so he knows how to do that
so he's got he's got that that little uh
a little extra speed
you know what i mean you know trump has
an extra he has an extra speed
you know you could be driving along it's
like first speed you know everybody's
got that second everybody's got that
third every fourth everybody's got four
speeds on their transmission you're
going along
and all of a sudden trump will be like
and you're in a whole different realm
of like
witty insults and
psychology and hyperbole and uh your
world is
you can't understand it and stuff and
like
six speed
well larry elder has apparently a six
speed as well
uh meaning that he's got that sense of
humor that edge that provocative thing
that makes you pay attention
so um
it looks like larry elder has a real
shot
he's got a real shot um
and if history is
suggestive
he his polls might be even better than
they look
because he might have the he might have
a little the the trump issue
where people are not admitting they
would vote for him maybe maybe a little
that i don't know
but i feel that there could be some fed
up democrats who aren't
forthright about what they're thinking
so let's see um
we'll be watching that
uh
dr johnson not what he said oh dr
johnson is back well so i have a
i have a mascot over on
youtube called dr johnson i don't know
what kind of doctor he is
but he
his entire act is misinterpreting things
i've said and then getting really mad
about it
i can't block him i don't have that
option i can i can mute him from a
channel but i can't block him for some
reason
um
call him doc
all right
is like his first name is likely richard
because it looked fake is the reason
it's real okay that's a some kind of
elon musk quote somebody's saying i
don't know what that context is all
right that's all for now
youtube thanks for coming and i will
talk to you later
