dude
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization as
long as it lasts it might be a timer on
it now if you've seen the news about the
UFOs anyway we'll talk about that but if
you'd like your experience to go up to a
level that only UFOs have ever received
then all you need is a cup of mug or a
glass a tanker Charles is dying a
canteen yoga flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee
because I'm a human
enjoy me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine the other day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous Sip and
happens now go
ah
so let's talk about the news
um
uh aliens are invading the planet we'll
get we'll get to that we'll get to that
you don't need that right away we'll
we'll work our way up to that aliens
but we're going to start with RFK Jr who
did some notable interviews yesterday
so he did a spaces interview with Elon
Musk and David sacks and he did a Jordan
Peterson interview that at least aired
yesterday
and I think there was at least one other
major interview he did
and
let me give you
the uh
the correct opinion
on RFK Jr
are you ready for this
now one of the things he said uh talking
to Jordan Peterson is that he has a path
to Victory how many of you think he has
a path
that there is a way he could win
how many of you think that
a little bit mixed but a lot of yeses
yeah a lot of the s's a lot of no's
all right I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you
that he has a path that might be the
easiest path of all of them
you ready
all right look at Trump's path
Trump has to get past Biden
we know he's failed to do that once
and we know that Biden's
yeah how much he can function doesn't
seem to matter
there there seems to be an anti-trump
vote
that can be activated
so so Trump I think has a good chance of
winning would you agree I think he has a
a good solid chance of winning
but if Biden is in the way there's
definitely a big if on that
yeah I I feel like that's more of a coin
toss
Trump versus Biden feels like a coin
toss what do you think
coin toss
let's say Biden is still somewhat
functioning by election day
all right all right so how about
DeSantis does DeSantis have a path
uh well you only has a path if Trump
drops out what are the odds of trump
dropping out or some legal problem
taking him out
not very high not very high right so on
the Republican side
you've got Trump with maybe a a jump
ball 50 50. and then there's nobody else
who seems to be
sort of having a good chance would you
would you agree with that so far
the of the Republicans Trump's the one
with a chance and this may be a jump
ball
right now let's look at the Democrats
what do you think of the odds
given what we see of Biden today that he
will still be functioning by the time
the Democrat primary rolls around
I think it's low
I think it's actually low
and who is his backup who's the backup
Kamala Harris
Gavin Newsom
I think it's RFK
now let me tell you the argument that
RFK Jr makes which I accept as a good
argument all right
number one
um he pulls well with Independence and
Republicans
for a Democrat for a Democrat he kills
it on Independence and Republicans
now do you believe that
I believe it because I'm seeing lots of
interest from people who would describe
themselves as that more than I've ever
seen I I've never seen
this much crossover interests have I
maybe Reagan I don't I don't know when
it was when was the last time somebody
really
legitimately attracted a crossover group
from the other that's very rare Clinton
yeah Bill Clinton is a good example but
it's rare
all right so he could get those votes
but what about getting his own votes
the hard part is getting Democrat votes
right because apparently he's he's not
exactly catching the Democrat uh system
on fire
but as he points out and I agree
if he were to become the the candidate
if you became the Democrat candidate
what percentage of Democrats would vote
for him
almost all of them
almost all of them
because he'd be a Democrat
and that's it
now apparently he pulls extra well
against Trump because he pulls some
Republicans and independents
so he would be the best chance to beat
Trump on paper right RFK Jr versus Trump
RFK wins Biden versus Trump it's a jump
ball
all right you're a Democrat
you want you wanted four more years of
Biden and only a jump ball chance that
he's going to beat Trump
but if you take RFK Jr you have a 80
chance that you win
versus a jump ball
it's not really close
it's not it's not close and there's no
way that the people
who you know have control of the
democratic party there's no way they
haven't noticed that you know I'm not
I'm not breaking any news here
so the only thing that can keep RFK Jr
and at the job statistically speaking
is Biden's Health in the next year or
what what is the primary
when does the primary happen
can somebody give me a date on the
Democratic primary it's about one year
is it
I thought it was in the summer
the summer of 2024
is it the summer of 2024 is that right
I think that's right all right so let's
say it's a year from now
do you think that so Biden we already
heard that Biden's schedule has been
constrained
to four hours a day although I think
that's fake I think he's doing other
presidential stuff in the other hours
um and then on the weekends you're sort
of leaving him alone and this is stuff
that even CNN is reporting
so even his own friendlies are reporting
that uh
that Biden's failing basically he's just
not holding it together
so
I don't know RFK Jr has only one
obstacle to the presidency which is the
health of a person who's dying right in
front of you
do you still think he doesn't have a
chance let me say it again
according to the polls the only thing
that could keep him from the presidency
is Joe Biden's Health in the next year
would you bet against that
would you bet against him knowing the
only thing keeping men of office is Joe
Biden's health and he's literally dying
right in front of us
I mean we're all dying right we're all
dying he's he might be on a uh let's say
he might be on a fast path compared to
some of us
I don't know if you're writing him out
off your uh you're making a mistake
but you know it's entirely possible that
Biden stays in the race and that's the
end of the story
um a question people ask me
uh oh and
so one of the big questions is is voice
quality and there are a number of people
who say I can't listen to him you know
it bothers me to listen to his voice
so I want to weigh in
because I have some bad voice expertise
I had a similar problem for years
and here's my take on it
so
I listened to RFK Jr for over an hour
yesterday
between the multiple interviews and I
was riveted the entire time
because when he talks about the history
of big Pharma
and how how the laws changed and how big
Pharma came to be able to advertise and
how we're taking two and a half times
more stuff and everything now I'm not
sure that everything he says has all the
context and is really telling me
everything I need to know I don't know
but I do not detect lying when he talks
have you had that experience yet
imagine listening to a presidential
candidate for an hour
and in that hour I did not detect a lie
how often does that ever happen because
even when you listen to your own team
you know maybe the candidate you like
you couldn't detect the lies you know
you could call it hyperbole but you can
spot them I mean they're they're really
obvious
but when RFK Junior talks he talked for
an hour
and I didn't hear anything
that was a lie I heard things that I
disagreed with
so let me be clear I'm not with him on
policy
I want to make that clear he's not my
guy for policy I still like Vivek
ramaswami because I'm a I'm a one policy
guy
on Fentanyl
so
um so he's not my guy in policy when I
talk about RFK Jr I'm only going to talk
about his odds of winning and the
capabilities he's bringing to the
campaign so it's about persuasion
and his popularity it's not about my
preferences about his policies okay
but even when he talks about policies
that are not my preference
he's putting a Nuance on them that makes
me go oh
take climate change
when he was asking about climate change
I think it was Jordan Peterson I
expected him to go full climate change
didn't you
I expected him to go full Greta
he did not go full Greta nope he said he
started by saying exactly what I say
which turns out to be exactly what
Jordan Peterson agrees
which is there's something to the
science which is if you add human made
CO2 it should make things warmer all
things being equal
but he doesn't seem to think that we
should stop everything and that's our
biggest our biggest thing to work on
that's very similar to my opinion
my opinion is real but we'll figure it
out you know we'll figure out how to
protect ourselves
you see very much in the common sensical
cone of that argument the common sense
is it's a big problem but we'll probably
figure it out
yeah
um that's exactly where I am
now he he differs for me on nuclear
uh I've talked about this he thinks it's
too expensive he can't get insurance
what do you do with the waste 30 000
years of waste Etc now separately I've
described how if France can figure that
out
I don't feel like those are real
problems
why would that not apply in France they
have a free market
so if they can figure it out it's figure
outable both economically safety wise
and every otherwise but that's a
separate argument right he gave the best
counter argument to nuclear I've heard
that's worth something
I mean I just respect the fact that even
in disagreeing with me it's the best
disagreement I've seen
it's the best I don't agree with them
but it's the best disagreement I've seen
and you know his disagreement was the
economics and the insurance and I think
that's all true
in the American system the part I don't
like is that that's the part he needs to
change
it's like that's your job
the the nuclear company can't get
insurance
well do something about that
France figured it out
uh it's not economical
well how do you make it economical
France figured it out right Etc so I'd
like him to be you know more pro-nuclear
but here's the best argument against it
that there is an alternative
that's better
now you're going to say to yourself oh
that green stuff is no good right you
can't get enough windmills and you're
not going to have enough solar power and
what happens when it's cloudy and the
wind isn't blowing right so those are
all the things that usually are the end
of that argument
would you agree that the the green only
without nuclear argument
always dies because the green only is
not dependable
am I right
once you say it's not dependable
you're done with the argument because
nuclear is Dependable it might be
expensive but at least it's there it's
better than not being there
but here's his argument and I hate how
good this is
are you ready to have your mind changed
you all believe that uh the green stuff
let's say just solar and let's just say
solar and wind
solar and wind are not Dependable enough
to be your primary thing and they're
also not economical would you agree not
economical and not dependable
right here's his argument
that you can build a solar plant
for something like a
tidy fraction of what a nuclear plant
would cost for the same you know
gigawatts do you think that's true
if the only thing you're looking at is
the cost of building the plant
is it cheaper to build your one one
billion dollar solar plant
than your 20 or 40 billion dollar
nuclear plant for the same wattage
probably right
probably right if you're just looking at
initial costs and also if you're looking
at initial approvals I would imagine it
would be faster you could probably build
a nuclear but that doesn't get you where
you need to go right
just building a bunch of solar doesn't
get you too dependable
but would you would you buy just the
first part of the argument
that if it were Dependable I'm not
saying it is
but if it were Dependable would it be
cheaper
because solar you could just put it
there and it just sort of runs and you
know there's there's a recycling
issue there as well
but I think he's I think he's researched
that and I'm gonna
um yeah and let's assume the batteries
are part of it but right batteries are
part of the answer of course
so would you accept that he's done the
math and he will tell you that building
a solar plant is cheaper for the same
amount of electricity
as nuclear when you consider all of the
risks and costs of nuclear and how long
it takes and and all that would you
would you allow that the initial build
cost would be far less for solar
no
I see disagreement
okay now his argument is it's like a a
huge difference
it's just a huge difference now who
would agree with him on that
I think I think Elon Musk would agree
with him
so you would be on the other side of
Elon Musk on an area of Elon musk's
expertise
is that where you are
would you all would you all disagree
with Elon Musk on Elon Musk area of
expertise
because he knows solar he knows what
he's talking about
all right so
let's do this
since we can't solve it here let's see
if you can find me some sources that
just compare the gigawatt price just the
gigawatt price you know price per
electricity of nuclear versus solar but
we're not talking about reliability yet
that's coming
right so I I accept that that's true
but I could have my mind changed you
could change my mind but I'll bet it is
true you could build a solar cheaper
seems I mean
my Common Sense tells me that's true but
you can talk me out of it all right
let's say that is true here's the the
rest of his argument
the real thing we need is to fix our
energy Grid in this country so that
anybody who has electricity can share it
with anybody who needs it
which is completely deflated everything
I've ever thought because first of all I
don't know if that's practical I don't
know if it's it might be too big of a
job
but he's talking about it as a massive
National effort to build out the energy
infrastructure and here's what that
would do it would allow every person to
be a a creator of electricity
and to sell it into the grid and if the
grid were
done well enough
presumably you could get the electricity
from wherever you have it you've got
extra
do wherever you need it so for example
not everybody would have to be in the
Sun
as long as some people were in the sun
they could ship their energy to the
people who didn't have any
Etc until you add enough of extra of
everything
because every house would be
manufacturing energy and putting it back
into the network that you would have
enough
and it would be the cheapest way to get
there it would also
fix a problem that you would need to fix
even if you had nuclear even with
nuclear you still want to fix your your
grid
so when he talks about fixing the grid
as the solution that makes green energy
work
that's a hell of a good argument
I don't know if it's true
let me be clear
you know I haven't run the numbers
but it's a hell of an argument and
nobody's come close to making that
argument that I've heard have you heard
anybody make that argument before
that you can make the green stuff work
reliably and far more economically than
nuclear and without the risk if you fix
the grid
I just don't know if it's true but I
don't detect it as a lie
it might be wrong
because it's really an economics
question it might be wrong but I don't
detect it as a lie meaning I think he
believes it's true
and it looks like it's it looks like it
could be
it's a hell of an argument I'm still on
all energy everything you can do so I
would be and I would be in favor of
nuclear
plus fixing the grid
but it's a am I ignoring life cycle cost
no
no I never ignored life cycle costs for
me that's assumed
because economics is my background so I
would always look at life cycle costs
right I did I did separate the startup
cost
because that gets you going for your
life your your life cycle costs I'm sure
that the total life cycle cost of
nuclear is bigger
there's a waste Etc and even though the
the solar panels eventually wear out and
become waste
I don't see that as big
but I could be wrong about that my
common sense is is guiding me not any
specific numbers
anyway the fact that uh he could
he could present an argument that is so
different from what I think is the right
thing to do and yet he could sell it
because I there's stuff I can't check
like I can't check his numbers too
easily it's very rare that somebody can
do that that's a really really good
sign of somebody who's got a Mastery of
the concept
all right now the complaints about his
voice some people said oh I'll never be
able to listen to them and so Jack
Dorsey say that RFK Junior's voice is a
superpower
and I agree
it's a superpower not only did I listen
to him riveted but because his voice was
difficult to listen to it made me think
that what he was saying made more sense
do you understand that
so there's a there's a concept with the
way humans are wired
that if you pay for something you'll
think it's worth more than if he didn't
pay for it did you know that one
hypnotists know this one of the reason
that a hypnotist charges you
um money is so the hypnosis works if the
hypnotist did it for free
the subject would say well if it's free
like how how powerful could it be and
how real could it be if you're giving it
to me for free
so you automatically distrust anything
that's free
when you listen to somebody who's easy
to listen to
is free
you don't pay anything you're just
getting a benefit you're hearing stuff
you want to hear if you have to work at
it
you've got to put us some investment
into getting past the voice if it
bothers you and then you listen to it
and here's the good news what he says is
so interesting just the way he frames
things that he'll hold your attention
past his voice
if he can hold your attention past his
voice problem
he owns you
do you see that
if if he can make you work to listen to
him he owns you
it's really powerful and now the the
question is whether there be some number
of people won't listen to him but I
would go back to his argument Democrats
are going to vote for him if he gets the
nomination would you agree with that
would you agree that all he has to do is
get nominated and Democrats follow line
they always do and he's a Kennedy for
God's sakes of course he'll vote for him
they're not going to vote for Trump
and they're not going to stay home
because that lets Trump win so of course
they of course they vote for him
yeah so his voice isn't going to stop
any Democrat
and he's already proven that his voice
didn't stop him from getting
Independence and Republicans it's not
going to stop him
it's a it's a positive if anything it
makes it more interesting and I would
say more relatable
do you know what you don't want
well I'll just talk for myself do you
know what I don't want
I don't want a president who is both a
Kennedy and Problem free
I don't want that I do not want a
problem-free Kennedy to be my president
let me say that
you know why because he would look like
a member of the elite
his voice problem normalizes him
humanizes him and takes the Kennedy off
him
right yeah if you think of the Kennedy
as you think of sort of these you know
beautiful perfect people who just seem
to have an extra gear you know that you
don't have
but RFK Jr also has a gear that you
don't have I mean he is operating at a
high level that's that's just shockingly
interesting
but when you add the voice problem on
top of it it it makes him one of you
you've got a problem
he's got a problem too
yeah now of course I'm you know I have
more empathy because I had my own voice
problems
so that may be biasing me toward him but
I don't think the voice will be a
problem in the end
and it's getting better as well
all right his biggest problem is trying
to beat the Democrats super delegates
but that's only if he's actually in it
with Biden still in the race
the super delegates would not be an
issue if Biden is no longer in the race
and I think that's I I don't know if um
RFK Jr wants to say that directly
but the real bet here is that Biden is
just not in the primary by the time it
comes around that's that's the bat
you know but I don't think he has he has
a beating him straight up
who would agree with me RFK Jude here
can't be biting straight up because the
super delegates and the system will just
want to keep Biden in place
so it's all about
him not being in the race in a year
and I think the odds of that are pretty
pretty good not 100 percent
but
let's put some odds on it now let's see
the wisdom of the crowd
wisdom of the crowd time give me your
percentage odds that Biden will be still
in the race and healthy enough
uh by the primary
five percent
all right
I'm seeing numbers from 90 to 2 percent
but if I had to average them in my head
it would be around 40 percent
I'm saying most people are around 25.
but they're higher ones so it looks like
your average would be around 40 percent
now who has the best chance of winning
the presidency
if if you believe that by the chance of
being the candidate the candidate
are only 40 percent
that makes RFK Junior
most likely to be the president
I don't know if the betting markets have
figured this out yet
but if but as the betting markets are
also saying there's only a 40 chance
that Biden will be the actual healthy
enough and together enough to be the
nominee
if you take him out of the picture it is
RFK Jr all day long
I don't know I feel like that's what the
conversation is going to turn into
because
if you take RFK JR out of the end of the
conversation
stop it Adam
nobody listened to Adam
everything Adam says is untrue
could not be true
all right
um
let's see what else is going on
um oh here's another one for you
so
do you know why democrats should have
liked Trump
this will this will be a call back and
then I'm going to tie this into RFK why
why should Democrats have liked Trump
not for success
all right this is I know this is unusual
but Trump was a normal Republican
meaning that Trump didn't believe the
craziest stuff that the extreme
Republicans believed and I believe that
he could actually I think he actually
brought people toward the middle
does that does anybody believe that I
think that Trump
brought Republicans toward the middle
you did not make them more extreme
right now if you were a Democrat isn't
that the thing you would want most in
the world you'd want you'd want the
extreme Republicans to move a little bit
in your direction
Trump did that now of course he was
demonized to the point where you
couldn't notice but he did it
I think RFK Jr would do that for the
progressives
we know that Biden is not
um not let's say reigning in the
progressives as much as he could
although I would give him credit that
he's ignoring them to to a large degree
so he is doing a good job of ignoring
The Crazies
but I think RFK Junior would you do even
more because he's bringing this common
sense you know Middle Ground thing so if
you if you think the biggest problem in
the world is wokeness
see this this will be very non-obvious
if you think the biggest problem in the
country is wokeness who is more likely
to get rid of it does Santos who's the
anti-woke guy or RFK Jr who just says
let's concentrate on Common Sense
it's RFK Junior because he's the one who
could lead his own side
nobody's going to listen to the DeSantis
the more he says you should be anti-woke
the more they're going to say oh yeah
I'm going to be twice as woke I will
triple my wokeness just because you
don't like it
so the weird thing about RFK Jr and
Trump is that they're the the ones you
would want the other side to have as
their leader in case you lose
he's like an insurance policy
so if you're a Republican
you might prefer running having him as
the other side because at least if you
lose
The Crazies won't be in control in the
Democrat side
at least you get that right that's not
nothing
that's not nothing but you still got a
lot of you know a lot of questions
around the Second Amendment and nuclear
power and climate change and a lot of a
lot of things he's going to have to
answer for by the way I saw this there
there's some I don't know if it's a
rumor or true that at some point in the
past RFK Jr said that climate deniers
should be jailed is that something
you've seen
climate deniers should be jailed
now I assume that's fake news
it's in a video but that doesn't make it
not fake news you know that right the
fact that you saw it in a video has no
no uh impact on whether it really
happened
because you've seen a million videos
where you saw it with your own eyes but
it didn't happen because it was edited
to change the reality here's what I
think based on what I've heard of his
current opinion on climate change there
isn't any chance he said that
now you might have a video
but there's no chances real
was he talking maybe about only some big
climate polluters like the Koch brothers
or something but was that the context
that was was it removed
yeah so I think I think the context was
limited so to some specific players who
were so bad in polluting the world
they thought maybe they should go to
jail so I don't believe this had to do
with you and I doubting climate change
let me get let me do this in a different
way
consider that Democrats really believed
that President Trump
praised neo-nazis
in public and did it with forethought
and intention
and Democrats actually believe that
do you know how they believed it
they saw it on a video with their own
eyes
heard it with their own ears that's why
they believed it
it just didn't happen
because they cut out the context that
reversed its meaning
same with the drinking bleach
right how did anybody believe that in
the first place
how in the world did any Democrat
believe that really happened that he
suggested maybe putting some
disinfectant in your body some household
disinfectant
of course it didn't happen
of course it didn't and the fact that
you saw it with your own eyes and heard
it with your own ears is meaningless in
today's world because it was an edited
video
now put yours
put yourself in the Democratic shoes and
now you just heard that a guy who's
running for president a serious Common
Sense guy who's running for president
you believe that only in 2012 thought
that you should go to jail if you don't
believe in climate change
you believe that
do you do you believe that he meant the
ordinary people who should go to jail
you really believe it okay
um I don't know what to say about that
that is so far from the believable Zone
that I just don't know what to do about
the fact that you believe that
that's very
why don't you send it to me and prove it
to me okay
send me the send me his writing don't
send me the video
so somebody said it's in writing send me
where he wrote that
and and prove and prove to me that he
thinks that people like you and I should
go to jail
for doubting climate science
because everything he says is the
opposite of that he's very much the Free
Speech guy
the Free Speech guy is an absolute he he
was saying he was praising the ACLU
for defending Nazis
back back when the Nazis were wanting to
protest and the ACLU defended the right
to speech he actually said that again
all right so you think the guy
who thinks that even Nazi should have a
right to free speech thinks that you
should go to jail for doubting climate
change
you think that happened in the real
world
say it
do you really think that happened in the
real world
of course it didn't of course it didn't
there's no chance that happened in the
real world
I don't know what that video is or what
you think you saw him written down but
it's not really possible in the real
world he's Ultra Super Free Speech
that that just doesn't get you to go to
jail for climate change there's no way
that those two things can both exist
all right let's talk about uh UFOs so
there's a whistleblower claims to have
been part of the UAP task force who says
not only are there real UFOs they're
alien ships they're definitely alien
and we've captured a number of them not
just one
but a number of them including dead
Pilots that's right we actually have
dead aliens and a number of captured
UFOs
now because he's a whistleblower you
would expect he's seen him right I mean
he was on the UAP task force so he's
seen them of course
no no he hasn't seen him
[Laughter]
but he's talked to people who have
who are curiously not whistleblowers
um and the other thing we know about
these UFOs is that they only seem to
crash on American territory
unless every nation in the world
uh is in on it
for example do you believe that there's
never been a UFO crash on the continent
of Africa
but there are Fallen like flies on the
United States and we're just picking
them up before anybody notices
really there's not a single one that
ever fell in a country that doesn't have
a a good let's say a government that can
swoop in with their high technology and
Corden it off and and keep it from you
we've never had one fall in the desert
where anybody in a camel can just walk
up to it and say hey what's going on
here
never happened and here's the
interesting part
when the UFOs fall and they're falling
quite frequently on the United States
Territory according to the Whistleblower
that they never fall where civilians can
see them
Isn't that cool they only follow where
the military can get to them before you
can see them
because otherwise there would be all
kinds of pictures from civilians hey
this fell in my backyard here's a
picture
or they're so good they've somehow
gotten all the pictures anybody ever
took
I'm sorry
I'm not believing any part of this story
at the very least you want to talk to
the person who said he saw the dead
bodies
if you don't talk to that person
you're you're one away from you know the
possibility now I do love the conspiracy
theory of it the conspiracy theory is
that the the UAP task force
would be like a decoy
so the government would create a task
force but then the government would
prevent the task force for seeing any
good evidence so that the task force
would do their work and conclude that
there's no evidence of aliens
because the government itself wouldn't
let its own task force see any of the
good stuff that's his claim
does that sound uh reasonable to you
that the government created a secret
task force
with a specific intention of keeping
them from finding out the truth so that
they would lie to the public
without having to lie it would be all
they knew
I don't know
that's a little too conspiracy-ish
to me a little too on the nose
all right so I hate to ruin your fund
but I'm going to say there are no alien
ships in our custody
how many of you believe there are alien
ships in our American custody
I see some yeses lots of no's
kind of a mix
I think I may have you know brow beat
you into saying No but
I want to believe this I I don't think
I've ever seen a story I wanted to
believe more than this
but I don't I don't believe any of it
you think it ships well he was very
clear that there are dead pilots in the
in the ships
all right
dead alien bodies and we have them
I I want to be wrong about this oh man I
want to be wrong it'd be so much fun but
no
all right
um
the crypto exchanges are being targeted
by the SEC I guess that's how they take
crypto out is they won't necessarily
have to go after every individual crypto
they'll just go after the exchanges and
then your crypto is worthless anyway
uh is coinbase going to be taken down
and what happens to my money in coinbase
if it does do I need to like pull my
money out of coinbase as soon as I'm off
this
I mean I don't have a I don't have a ton
in there but I'd hate to lose it
for no reason
uh
all right so allegedly here's the
article
he wants a law
all right I can't click on it when I'm
on the call but I'll look at it later
all right I don't have to read that to
know it's though
do you want to test my filter
I say that the link you sent me is
 before I before I look at it
now if it's not
then I of course will publicly confess
my arrogance and stupidity
as I I do so often
but I'm going to bet against that pretty
heavily
all right uh we know that the uh
Mar-A-Lago boxes of the current hoax so
now the the summer hoax on Trump is all
about the Mar-A-Lago boxes now the
newest thing is that uh allegedly when
the Mar-A-Lago swimming pool was drained
presumably for maintenance they drain
some of the water into uh
one of the rooms inside the building
what
the story doesn't even make sense the
story is that when they drain the pool
somehow it drained into a building full
of files and computers
do you believe that there's any do you
believe that you can drain a pool
and it ends up inside your building
I don't believe that
but it's all it's all part of you
finding anything they can do to keep
this story in the news
yeah it just he finally drained the
swamp but it turned out it was his own
swamp
I don't know everything about that
sounds like so it just looks
like they want to keep it in the news a
little bit longer
all right um
here's a little uh test of your
intelligence go
give me the answer before the question
answer before the question go
Now look up and there it is
you have the correct answer before the
question is even as 25 is the right
answer the question was uh according to
erasmussen poll what percentage of the
voting public
say that the Target store focusing on
pride month made them more likely to
shop at the store
25 percent
25 were more likely to buy things at
Target because they had Pride
merchandise and pride signs
now
would you like to see me step on a third
rail
Just For Your Entertainment
is pride really the right Vibe for 2023.
is it
because it was definitely the right vibe
in 19 whatever you know whenever the
idea of you know gay pride
first came up I think that was sort of
right on point
because they didn't want to be shamed
and that was sort of the big problem
but it's 2023.
what was the last time you met somebody
who didn't think that you know a gay
person had you know full
full respect or whatever words you want
to put on I don't run into anybody like
that like nobody no conservative no
nobody this is not a thing
so at this point the The Pride the pride
thing no longer feels like underdogs
trying to rise up to where everybody
else is
now it sounds like you're trying to get
ahead
am I wrong
sounds like you're trying to get ahead
because the context changed when when
when it was let's say you know you would
be the subject of mockery or whatever if
you were a gay
then pride is exactly what you want
to try to bring up
you know bring everybody up to something
like equal
and but once you get there
and even your your staunches critics
agree that okay everybody's equal you
know the Constitution gives you rights
let's just let everybody be human
once you get to that point and I would
argue
for the most part we're at that point I
mean there'll always be lingering
bigotry in every area
but at some point pride is just the
wrong word
like once you've succeeded I would say
that the the gay community LGBT
maybe the tea is still coming along but
the the cue part
I would say it's the most successful
um population group in the country
in terms of turning around their
reputation or their I don't know their
situation in the country I would say
that by far they're just the most uh in
my opinion my respect for the LGBT
community is Extreme
because I think they took the the
hardest
the hardest turn I mean race is hard too
but
they took the hardest topic and they
turned it around completely
yeah is there anybody here who would be
afraid to go into a gay neighborhood
because that high gay crime
zero is there anybody here who wouldn't
hire
a lawyer or a politician because they
were gay
no it's not a thing it's just not even a
thing in 2023.
so I think the gays should take uh take
the win
take the win you're not done when I say
win I don't mean all bigotry is removed
blah blah lots of work to do always says
but I don't know if pride is I think you
accomplished Pride
and now maybe there's something else you
should accomplish I don't know what that
would be because it's not for me to say
but I I think you got Pride
prized up just take the whim see what
else he can do
all right
what else
so Tim Scott
Senator Tim Scott went on The View
and they wanted to talk to him about his
view that systemic racism shouldn't hold
you back you know you blacks in America
and everybody else can do well if they
do the right things as he did now that
there was a little bit of pushback
because they were saying he's a special
case
and then they pointed out was it uh
sunny sunny what's her last name
what's Sonny's last name Houston so
Sunny Hosten was saying okay but you're
a special case Tim Scott you're a black
man who became a senator and then she
said that she was a special case because
she was a host on The View and then she
said probably Whoopi Goldberg is a
special case
because she's also on The View
now let's put it all together
three of the six people on The View were
black
yep
do I need to go on
three of the six people on The View
like one of the most famous storied
shows of all time as you know hits above
its weight and
political impact and everything else
three of the six people were black yeah
counting Tim Scott that day
three out of six
[Music]
take the wind take the win now uh Tim
Scott got a lot of credit for holding
his own
and he did a really good job
of getting time to speak
sorry YouTube I keep losing the
connection there
um
so here's the question I asked myself
why is it that Tim Scott was treated so
respectfully
and it seemed different from the way
other people have been treated on the
show what do you think it was
do you think it's because he was black
that was my first thought as they were
giving him a little extra
consideration because he was black but I
don't think it's just that I think
that's part of it
but I don't think that's the big part
you know what I think it is
I think he has that leadership thing
that's what I saw I think he has the
leadership thing and what I mean by that
is that when he talked they actually
wanted to listen
you hear what I'm saying that when he
talked
they wanted to listen they disagreed
with him and yet they wanted to hear it
completely
and that's because he does the following
things he doesn't say crazy
right doesn't say crazy so they
don't have to talk over him and yell at
him when he's saying crazy because
he just doesn't do it he just says
obvious Common Sense things which you
might disagree with but none of it's
crazy
he is polite
he doesn't talk over them
and when he comes at them with his
leadership polite common sense it
completely disarmed them
they just put down their weapons
now that's what I saw and I thought that
was really impressive and I'll bet he
can do that in other contexts right so
if you're looking at Tim Scott as the
black guy
maybe you should take another look
because he he he showed me that he's got
another gear because the
the deference that they were paying him
was real
and it looked like he earned it
that's what it felt like he had earned
credibility that even the view who
didn't like his views they understood
The credibility behind it and and his
his politeness to them which was real
caused them to be polite back because
otherwise they would look like turds
right now if you throw somebody like
Trump in there you know he's going to be
a fighter so he's going to say some
provocative things and that's going to
cause them to say provocative things and
then you get a fight
but Tim Scott LED them he led them
like he sat down and he owned the group
and he owned them by Common Sense and by
politeness that completely disarmed him
good job Tim Scott you'd make an
excellent vice president and potentially
president
I like I like a lot about him
um
here's how I would prefer
talking about the subject all right so
this is sort of a Tim Scott advice
I believe that we make a mistake we
humans typically make this mistake
we connect the problem with the solution
now that doesn't sound like a a problem
does it don't you think the solution
should be related to the problem
Common Sense here's the problem I think
the solution should be related to the
problem
that just makes sense except that it
doesn't make sense
every time
here's a case where it doesn't make
sense
let's say you believe systemic racism is
a real problem I do it's a real problem
is your is your way to get past it to
directly
find a solution that is directly related
to systemic racism is that your best
play
well
if you could do it easily it would be
right if there were some easy way to
stop systemic racism that permeates
everything
yes if you could do it but nobody knows
how
if you don't know how to do it
you're gonna have to get creative
the best thing you could do to get rid
of systemic racism is
focus on individual success strategies
specifically the strategy part
if you if you took um
let me say this if you gave me a 100
young poor
black kids
and you just said all right Scott your
job is to just teach them strategy just
life strategy
how do you think they'd do let's say I
got them from kindergarten and I just
had full control of you know their
education
so all they all they'd see is basically
their parents and then you know me
because I'd be teaching them
you don't think I could teach all
hundred of them to do
pretty good job
and and to be way above the average of
white performance
I could yeah I I could take any hundred
black kids
on average
and make them on average higher earners
and have you know better more successful
lives than an average white person who
didn't have any strategy who was just
trying to figure it out on their own
so in my opinion the way to address
systemic racism and this feels like a a
message that somebody like a Tim Scott
could take because he did this
Tim Scott overcame systemic racism by
personal strategy
strategy
he just did the things that you do to
win and then he won
so
I think that the message should be that
systemic racism is real
and you should not ignore it and if you
can do anything to make it less go ahead
and do it
but that's not your solution Your
solution is to take people who are in a
hole give them strategy make them
successful and then systemic racism goes
away on its own
imagine if you will
a future in which a black candidate
comes into your office for a job and the
first thing you think is oh good I hope
I got one of those strategy guys
uh this old man I might be lucky here I
might have one of those good strategy
guys
right
how hard would that be
that's a one generation fix in one
generation you could teach black
Americans strategy
and every time they came into a job
meeting your bias would be oh a strategy
person
that's exactly what I want I want
somebody who understands strategy
so you do that in systemic racism
largely melts away on its own
so don't go after the systemic racism
directly go after the individuals fix
them so they can slice through the
systemic racism and then there won't be
any
because when that when those people come
into your office you're going to say yay
got one of those
all right over in Ukraine the
counter-offensive is totally on or maybe
not and a big dam was blown up either by
the ukrainians or possibly the Russians
so we got lots of good information
coming from there
uh
uh and also the ukrainians are totally
winning but also the Russians are
totally winning
totally winning both sides are winning
and losing both sides are losing at the
same time
um now the day I'm happy to be in the
russian-controlled territory so I'm
going to go with Ukraine blew it up what
do you think do you think that Russia
blew up a dam in the territory that it
controls
oh
oh Russia did not blow up their own Dam
but the news is acting like it's a
question mark
huh
did did the Russians blow up their own
Dam
like they blew up their own pipeline
or could it be
that an unfriendly entity is more likely
to blow up your hmm
I wonder
quite a mystery
they did it to slow the counter
offensive
you think the Russians blew up the their
own Dam to slow down the
counter-offensive
really
because I'm no military expert but let
me weigh in on that strategy
the parts that are flooded
the ukrainians can ignore
because that's already conquered by the
water
they're not going to fight the water
the water will conquer a certain amount
of places where it floods and then that
Parts out of the that's not in the war
anymore I mean the war just won't count
because it's flooded what the hell are
you going to do put a flag there
so I don't know
I I don't see them flooding it in this
scenario I understand you know there
could be there could certainly be a
scenario in which your own side blows up
a dam I get that
but I don't see it here because there's
this gigantic swath of territory that
the ukrainians could attack they don't
have to attack that little flooded part
do they nobody said it was so critically
important to the war that if it's
flooded it's going to change the course
of the war or anything like that
to me it looks like it was just the
ukrainians taking out the electricity in
the area that they're attacking which it
did
all right
they have to cross it to reach the other
areas but was that the one place they
had to cross
I mean I've got a feeling that they're
just lots of ways that Ukraine can get
at you know that gigantic line
On the Border
I don't know I can be wrong
I'm just going to say I'm going to say
Ukraine
uh the Water pushes them to a Kill Zone
Maybe
that actually that's a pretty good
theory so the theory was that the
flooding could push existing forces that
maybe have already started to
counter-offensive it could push them in
a direction of you know disadvantage
I can say that but I feel like you
wouldn't blow up your own Dam unless uh
It Was Your Last Resort
of course it's not their damn
so maybe they don't care but I don't
think you blow up your own Dam
unless you think that's going to win the
war really make a big difference and I
don't the experts are not saying that
it's making a big military difference
could be wrong
that's crimea's water supply
distracts from their failed offensive
Maybe
it's about making people suffer
all right
kremia's water supply is okay
all right that's all I got for today uh
YouTube I'm gonna say bye
um
uh you're bad you're bad but I love you
anyway
