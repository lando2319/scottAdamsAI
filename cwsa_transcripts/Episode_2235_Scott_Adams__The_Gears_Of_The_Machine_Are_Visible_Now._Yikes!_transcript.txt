do do
[Applause]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the Highlight if you've been this
civilization and it's just getting
better every day
you're getting smarter sexier I mean I
can't even stand it anymore but if you'd
like to take it to another level that's
blinding blinding is what it is all you
need is a cup of mugger a glass of
tanker Chalice of style the canteen
Jugger flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
here the day thing makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous sep
and it happens now go
ah delightful
well I like to start with some fake news
fake news is the good appetizer isn't it
you start with the fake news and it's
like fun and light and then you get to
the good stuff
well one of the fake news update uh fake
on the side of let's say the
right-leaning news a sphere
do you remember a lot of you saw on EX
platform that uh there was a gentleman
who was killed by two people in a car
who hit him on him when he was on his
bicycle intentionally and killed him
and tragically he died and he was a
retired police guy
police chief anyway the uh the
controversy is that the page of the Las
Vegas local newspaper
said it was a bike crash
so how many saw that and said my God
my God the media is calling this a bike
crash it was obviously a murder you know
where's the racial element to this and
all that Well turns out that was fake
news
fake news fake news in the sense that
when the paper first got the report
they didn't know much about it so they
called it a bike crash and they knew he
was dead
as soon as they found out it was
something else they reported it was
something else
so they weren't trying to hide the news
they just didn't yet know the news the
the first the first report seemed to be
more of a fog of War situation
so so there you go
you may have seen the weird story of an
F-35
in the United States is flying around
and the pilot ejected for reasons we
don't yet now and the plane continued
flying on autopilot
and as of a moment ago they don't know
where it is
sad to say this sound real
it doesn't doesn't really sound real
does it and there's a picture there's an
accompanying picture of a uh probably an
F-35 that's doing barrel rolls on his
own
really on autopilot it does barrel rolls
do you believe that they got a really
clear picture
of an F-35 doing a barrel roll
and that that's the missing airplane
how about no
how about no I think it might be
entirely made up
but I'm not sure just stock footage yeah
anyway so the video is clearly not real
whether or not the F-35 is really
missing
it's in Lake Marion Maybe
Maybe
but we'll keep an eye on that the
missing F-35 and 80 million dollar plane
um
in other news
um
it turns out we know where the Epstein
Client List is
you may not have caught that part of the
news because you got distracted but the
Epstein Client List has been located
it's um
oh it's on the F-35
oh okay
all right yeah it's on the F-35
but they'll find it any minute now I'm
pretty sure they're they're almost going
to find it
they're looking hard everybody's looking
for it
but as soon as they get it we're going
to see what's on that list that's for
sure
there's a study that is totally credible
totally credible
says that women prefer funny and
good-looking men
well yeah
you know
if there's one thing I can tell you from
my experience
that long before I was successful as the
Dilbert guy
oh did the women want me for my sense of
humor and my good looks
yeah it was I swear I was beating them
off
which was what I was doing when I wasn't
beating myself off and
oh my God it was just a nightmare it was
like Night of the Living Dead I would
walk down the street and people would
see me and they'd say I bet he's funny
and they just started following me
and they'd be like look at that funny
guy or wow
can I get a piece of that tell me a joke
funny guy oh oh I'm so wet that's the
best dad joke that ever made me close to
orgasm let me tell you let me tell you
yeah the women they love the funny guys
they love it
so you believe that science right
well
it's interesting that they complicated
it with they also like a good looking
men
so they like funny men but especially if
they're good looking
do you know what Norm Macdonald said
about this scientific observation even
though he's deceased
he said that
turns out women just laugh at whatever
handsome guys say
uh-huh
now we have the truth
if you've ever been in the company of a
really good looking guy and any female
anything that good looking guy says is
pretty hilarious am I right pretty
hilarious Oh by God did you say that
pass the salt are you kidding me passes
all back
you're so funny you're so funny oh God
you're so funny can I touch you
yeah so there's your science
so can I give you this advice
trust the science people trust the
science
because it's so accurate and believable
and totally credible
and you know uh when you should trust
the science there's one time you should
trust the science
and then there's another time you should
not
trust the ugly scientists
the
ugly ones cannot be trusted but if you
see like a really handsome scientist or
a hot woman scientist yeah that's
science that's the real stuff I tell you
if a beautiful woman who's a scientist
tells me something is scientific I'm
going to say oh yep oh
something like that that's how I talk oh
anyway
so science
have I taught you that when we learned
that AI could be created artificial
intelligence could be created out of
nothing but the prior word patterns of
human beings
a lot of people said hey that's not real
intelligence that's like some fake kind
and I said no that's how humans work
humans use words
in sentences that they believe are
reasons
and they're not it's the same reason we
use analogies instead of arguments we
think the analogy is is some kind of
logic or Reason
it's not it's just a different situation
so if you're using an analogy to make
your point
that's sort of word thinking it's just
something to remind you of something
else that's it doesn't there's no logic
to it and
I'm going to give you the best example
well the best example would be
um
abortion
yeah I did a little experiment last
night on the uh the man cave video that
I do at night for subscribers on locals
and
you know somebody was one of the members
was uh giving an opinion on abortion
and using words like this
uh is it a life
you know are we talking about a life and
you know blah blah blah and of course
that's word thinking that's trying to
win the argument by having your
preferred definition of a word
be the preferred definition
and if another person has a different
definition of the word you're not really
having a debate
you're trying to be a dictionary that's
completely different than logic or
anything you're just trying to win with
the word
I'll give you the best example of this
I saw today
somebody somebody named Jonathan Perkins
tweeted on September 15th obviously in
support of trans people
um wrote trans women are women but
didn't write it once you know wrote
wrote a whole bunch of times to really
drive it in trans women are women trans
women are women trans women are women
like 20 times
now that
is What's called the word thinking
trying to win an argument
by making you accept the definition that
they've accepted as the word
that's not an argument
that's just trying to be a dictionary
right if you're trying to be a
dictionary you're not even part of the
reasoned conversation
so uh Riley Gaines who you might know as
the award-winning I guess award-winning
would that be the right thing a champion
a champion swimmer who is uh railing
against people who were born male
swimming as women and
she Tweets in response to trans women or
Women written 15 times she tweets uh hot
dogs or dogs 15 times hot dogs are dogs
hot dogs are dogs
now
yeah it was perfect
so Riley Gaines in addition to being a
champion swimmer I'm starting to learn
is actually very smart
have you noticed that
she she's not just a champion swimmer
and she's not just outspoken and she's
not just good at tweeting she seems to
be unusually smart
I'll just keep an eye on that
yeah but she called out you know she
used her own way but yeah she called
down somebody for word thinking word
thinking has no role in anything
all right interestingly you're following
the Russell Brand Story I'm sure he's
been accused by four Anonymous people
coincidentally at exactly the same time
that he's making a big dent in the
National Consciousness in in a way
that's not really friendly to the Biden
Administration although he's by no means
a right-wing person or even close to it
but uh Elon is vacuum so Elon Musk
tweeted I support Russell Brand that man
is not evil
um that's pretty full that's a
full-throated endorsement or support
um do you know what Elon Musk said when
I got canceled
said we shouldn't cancel uh humor we
shouldn't cancel it he said we shouldn't
cancel humor
no he weighed in right away so we
shouldn't be canceling humor
but when he supported Russell Brand he
said the man is not evil
well I'm not going to make anything of
that
[Laughter]
when he supported Russell Brand he said
the man is good and when he said
something about my case he said humor is
good
huh
if I were married to Elon Musk I would
be divorcing him right now
which apparently is a very financially
advantageous thing to do
so yeah
no I don't think it means anything
that's just sort of a a funny funny
observation
um somebody else pointed out that
there was a woman who had a theory that
Russell Brand has known since the
beginning of me too that his day would
come and so he's been carefully
cultivating a right-wing audience that
would accept whatever he said about it
uncritically
and here we are and he planned the whole
thing he knew that he would be attacked
as me too and he couldn't survive on the
left but if he found a home on the right
he would be insulated against his metoo
accusations
I don't know
I don't think people are that smart I
mean he's really really smart but I
don't think he made up years of opinions
to cover up the potential for that
I mean if he did he's smarter than we
think and that would be pretty
impressive
but I don't know that's a little too
clever
that it doesn't doesn't quite
you know fit my sense of how people work
day who knows it seems far more likely
that it's not a coincidence that he's
being taken down because it seems like
all of the
uh all of the powerful voices
on one side of things are all being
attacked in pretty much the same way
it's all sex or racism racism or sex
it's all the same stuff
all right well the Senate has decided to
relax
it's a dress code
everybody's pretty sure it's about John
fetterman dressing like a hobo and they
want that to be okay I guess
so I suspect that most of them will
still wear suits
but at least the law has changed so that
federmen can run
now
do you think this is all because of
fetterman
I'm going to check your conspiracy
theories is it all because of fetterman
you think
maybe I'm going to say maybe on
fetterman but here's what I think
I think that they're holding out hope
their representative bobert could run
for the Senate
I'll just let that sit there for a
moment
so you you can complete your own joke in
your head
yeah they're just hoping that bobert
would someday run for Senate there so
this is like sort of like the Russell
Brand thing they're planning maybe a
dozen years in advance because it might
be a long time before she runs for the
Senate if she ever does but you know you
gotta you gotta play the law game and
the Senate is good at that
so I mean she might be 75 by the time
she's there but yeah still they're
holding our hope it's a it's a very
lonely body of uh people and they don't
have a lot of hotties in the Senate and
maybe they'd like to get one so I'm just
putting that out there
now the good news is
that finally I can run for Senate
people have been saying Scott
why don't you run for seven well two
reasons one dress code
and two I don't like to commute
so if I could do it by zoom in my
pajamas
boom
I feel like I'm running the country
right now and I don't have a dress code
so what difference would it be it'd be
very similar very similar
all right let's talk about your tells
for fake news I've got opinion pieces
here from Stefan Collinson
Dean Obadiah
and Glenn Kessler
Kessler's at the Washington Post the
other two are writing for CNN do you
recognize those names
anybody recognize those names so
remember if you know the players
everything makes sense
if you don't know the players it looks
like news
all right these are not the players who
tell you news these are opinion pieces
first of all but they're uh they're
they're sort of special purpose
abundance so let's see what Stephen
Collison says
the front runner for the Republican
nomination talking about Trump is a
twice impeached ex-president
who is facing four criminal trials and
has here's the important part has never
shelved his attempt to overturn the
American democratic system of fair
elections
now that's stated in an opinion piece
but that stated as fact
is that a fact would you say this is how
you would uh word it they tried to
overturn the American democratic system
of fair elections
or would another way to say that be he
didn't think the elections were fair and
he was trying to make them Fair
so the reality is the opposite of this
that as far as we can tell Trump thought
the election was unfair and wanted it to
be rechecked so that he could get a fair
result which he believed would show him
the winner
do you think that the facts have shown
that he has not given up his attempt to
overturn the American democratic system
of fair elections does anybody think he
was trying to do that
this is word thinking because Stefan
Collinson can put words in this sentence
those words will be picked up by the
readers
do you think the readers will think
through the entire situation and then on
their own
they would come up with the opinion that
he was trying to overthrow
overturn the American democratic system
the fair elections
is that something that that the the
Democrats on their own
would have come up with that
interpretation if the news had always
just shown them the facts but not the
interpretation would they have come up
with that
or would they say oh he's a sore loser
so he did what he could to you know see
it see make sure that the election was
really what it was and maybe he
shouldn't have but it didn't work out so
there we are
now I don't think that the the Watchers
would come to that opinion on their own
they'd probably just say oh there's
always a protest after an election if
you don't win right there's sort of
always a protest after an election if
you don't win and somebody thinks
there's something up
um it happened when
it happened when Trump won it happened
probably happened before
all right
um how about Dean Obadiah
he's gonna he's gonna deal with the
question of uh Biden's age
so do you think Dean Obadiah is going to
write a balanced opinion
well
um his his take is that maybe Biden is
old but she got to look at how old and
how many gaffes Trump is making
so you know the argument against Biden
is largely based on a series of gaffes
right and acting strange in public
but Dino padaya is here to remind you
that Trump has done many of those same
things and just recently
so here are some of the things that are
being compared
to Biden's gaffes you ready
um Trump did a 40-second pause during
one of his uh his speeches which is
supporters generously interpreted as he
was emotional and needed a pause
but do you know badaya points out that
if Biden had glitched for 40 seconds
that you'd say that's a mentally that's
a cognitive problem
did it look to you like Trump glitched
yes did he glitch like McConnell or was
he clearly just waiting and there was
something going on in his head but he
knew he knew exactly what he was doing
no it didn't look like a glitch to me at
all but if you hadn't seen either one
and you're reading this opinion piece
you'd say to yourself oh yeah old people
do stuff that's probably about the same
it wasn't even close to the same
no he didn't glitch he paused for a
dramatic effect and it worked really
really well
here's another one
twice um
Trump referred to Obama what he meant I
think once he meant Clinton and once he
meant Biden
so he said Obama instead of
one of those two people
who basically some people say you are
being run by Obama
now
I don't know what is the most common
gaffe in politics but if I had to
nominate the most common gaffe in
politics it would be saying Obama when
you meant somebody else
it's the most common mistake in politics
how many times have you heard people who
are clearly not too old say Obama and
then can correct themselves and say
Clinton
all the time
all the time
yeah and even the spokesperson for Biden
had said Obama when she was talking
about her own boss does anybody think
that that Biden spokesperson has
cognitive decline
no I think she started that way
that's not cognitive decline it's just
the most common thing that people get
backwards
then the other thing that Trump got
wrong is that you were worried that
we're heading toward World War II
when obviously he meant three but Dean
Obadiah reports this as he doesn't know
what year it is or that he doesn't know
that World War II happened
does that sound like what happened
has anybody ever confused World War II
with the hyperbole that World War III is
going to happen it's probably the second
most common thing that people get wrong
I I've seen it you've seen it too right
when they're talking about whoa this
might launch world war three
but they were just thinking of two
before they upped it by one and then
they say two accidentally
so yeah this is this is a pretty hard
stretch this is the type of opinion
piece that the more respectable people
would never write so you have to you
have to invite somebody whose specialty
is writing just
really stretches stretches of the
imagination
all right how about uh Glenn Kessler who
wants to make the case that uh Biden
fired that Ashokan guy in Ukraine or got
him fired for good reasons that other
people thought were good reasons and
everybody agreed and so there's nothing
sketchy here he just got rid of a bad
prosecutor
and one of the things that Glenn Kessler
mentions is that the the French and the
Germans agreed with Biden
so we know the French and the Germans
agreed
really what were their names
which which French person
did they did they agree
and there were other people in the Biden
Administration who agreed with Biden
you mean the people who are all fully
aware that this was his grift
yeah the people who were fully aware of
of what Biden's gift were
were in favor of him getting rid of the
person who might be stopping the grift
some people say I don't know what's true
yeah that's
when you look at how weak the other
people are there's no reference to the
other people except the people who knew
that Biden was in on some kind of
Ukraine grift
Scott spins the crimes of criminals
which criminal are you talking about
you don't even know what you're talking
about I'm not even sure if you know what
what topic you're on
so I would say that if they send Glenn
Kessler out to support the fact that
everybody agreed with Biden on firing
shoken the minimum that that would
require would be at least one name of
one person
who is not you know under the Biden you
know sphere of influence
who actually agreed
just one
you don't think an article like that
should have at least one person with a
quote or even a quote how about a quote
from a
well-established
French or German politician
to say exactly what they said so we
could read it ourselves yeah
so now that you know the names Stephen
Collins and dinobadaya Glenn Kessler
Phil bump
those are the names you should know that
they're telling you the opposite of
what's true so you can actually read
them as the real news
the fact that what is not mentioned is
more prominent than what than what is
mentioned
tells you exactly what's going on
that it would it's not real news it's
not even real opinion
all right
RFK Jr has a pandemic related conspiracy
theory
that many people believe
but I'm having a problem with it because
it's a little bit too James Bond villain
for me
and it would go like this that roughly
speaking
um
roughly speaking that the people who
created the coven virus are the same
people who created the vaccine and it's
all
it's all one big plan
so that the the trial runs were some
part of a uh you know and the in the
predictions of a pandemic
we're all part of a major plan to use
the pandemic to take away freedoms and
the freedoms they wanted to take away
were freedom of
speech mostly but basically a massive a
way to roll out a massive censorship
program basically put a put a lock on
the country
so here's what's wrong
with that
uh with that theory
I think they could have done it without
the pandemic
I don't think they needed the pandemic
did they
because it turns out that all of the
entities that sort of played along
with their own entities
um
so related to this
is a far better analysis from Mike Benz
I keep mentioning that you should follow
him oh my God am I having my
my brain unlocked by his analysis so he
knows how the CIA operates and he goes
through uh I tweeted it and you
absolutely have to watch it if you don't
watch the Mike Ben's 40-minute
explanation of how the CIA has set up
these cutouts to make you think real
things are happening but it's all
operated by the CIA if you haven't seen
it you have no idea what's happening in
the world you would have no idea
who's actually running things
but
um
here are some things that Mike Benz
teaches you and there's a lot more if
you see the government refer to some
academics that they're working with
they're not academics they're cutouts
meaning that they're people that are
funded by the government
to give the government what it wants
because the government can't do
something legally itself do you know
what the government can't do legally
censor people
they can't do it directly
so they hired groups of fake academics
who did have jobs at universities but
you know the academic part was really
just convenience so they could launder
the government's censorship through
these seemingly independent academics
and then the other trick is that when
they say that the academics are there to
study misinformation
that is a smoke screen they're not there
to study it they're there to stop it
and they're going to tell you what the
misinformation is you don't get to
decide so somebody else that the
government pays to do this and has to
keep the government happy because that's
where the money comes from
they create an organization that says
that this and this and this are
misinformation
and then they work those entities work
with the platforms and they say they do
to get them to to stop the
misinformation now the platforms don't
want to get in trouble
so it's easier for them to go along
because they don't want to cause trouble
so the government creates these cutouts
and funds them to say what the
government wants them to say to you know
block and censor people and then they go
to the platforms and they say hey were
these independent academics we're just
trying to make the world a better place
and we're going to make a lot of trouble
for you if you don't do what we say
and apparently all of the platforms
conformed all of them base basically
everything except acts I guess so
um and that was before musk owned it so
even then probably
so apparently the censorship included
the 2022 election
you see it yet
the government actually created a
cia-led entity a mass structure
to keep you from knowing that the
election
had some critics shall we say
amazingly
amazingly
what are we looking at here
so anyway you should look at uh
um
yeah so here are the uh here are the key
words to look for to know that it's a
government cutout look for academics
when you see academics I should be a
flag
they're not so much academics as they
are people paid by the government to do
what the government wants look for
studied Mis look for they studied
something
means they're stopping that thing
and look for conversations with the
major platforms did they have
conversations
I know when I have a conversation
the people that I've talked to don't
immediately change all of their
activities
that feels like a little bit more than a
conversation doesn't it there must have
been some kind of
pressure on them
anyway
um
I saw what did I see a real tweet to the
other day of musk saying that the Soros
organization appears to have the
intention of destroying civilization
did you see that
and and I believe he was called
anti-semitic for that
but what about the fact that that's
exactly what it looks like to all of us
if there's an organization trying to
fund people who elect criminals out of
jail and mass immigration in
how else could you describe that except
an intention of destroying the world
it looks like intentionally destroying
the world now if there's a argument in
favor of it why don't I know it
why don't I know the argument on the
other side
I mean I've looked for it
I I can't find it
why is it so well hidden if it's such a
dominant narrative that's affecting the
entire country I've never even seen the
argument for why it's a good idea to let
everybody in and open the jails
basically
now I've heard I've heard it said that
the you don't want to put a lot of black
people in jail over minor crimes
because then you know they forever will
have the a criminal record and what are
they going to do but become criminals
because their options are limited but
there's nobody in the world who thinks
that's working
do they
to me it looks like uh
that almost all the crime is repeat
criminals
right if you're treating the consistent
repeat criminals exactly the same as the
one black guy who stole a candy bar once
uh what are we talking about that's not
even sensible I'm completely on board
with not ruining somebody's life because
they shoplifted when they're 19.
I'm totally on board with that
but if you shoplift every day and it's
power tools
I'm not going to let you out on that
that's a whole different thing so
clearly at this point the Soros
organization knows what's actually
happening which would be very different
from whatever idealized plan they have
so why don't they adjust their plan
why have they not said oh that was a
mistake we will we will correct and we
should only be going after the
non-repeat offenders you know they're
not going after they're the only ones
that we should be leading with is the
non-rebates but definitely not the
serial criminals
but they don't seem to be doing that
and
so it it does look like unless they have
a better explanation for their
activities it does look like their
intention is to destroy the country
am I wrong like what else could it be if
you could give us any other explanation
I'm sure I would listen to it and I
would fully I would fully value the
argument
I might disagree but I would give it
full respect because it's so important
and there must be smart people who are
in favor of it but the fact that there's
no argument in favor of it
that is in the news you know don't you
think that if the Soros had a good
argument CNN would be telling you what
it is
right
if there were a good argument for the
open borders and for the you know the
run-up in crime in the cities that's
completely intentional CNN would tell
you that it's working out
and MSNBC would be saying yeah you know
uh maybe the right wing Mega extremists
don't like it but it's it's totally
doing what they hoped it would do
where's that Soros doesn't even have the
support
of the left leaning media but they
definitely take his money
right he's one of the major funders of
democratic stuff they take his money but
they don't support anything he wants to
do which means that can you can you
imagine that how much more money can
they get if they supported him but
there's nobody there's nobody in the
news business who will even say it's a
good idea that thesaurus money is having
the effect it's having nobody have you
have you ever heard anybody support him
anybody
anybody in the left or the right
if there's nobody on the left or the
right who can see any positive in his
actions
then he is destroying the world
what else could it be
what else could it be now by the way I
say that with hyperbole because I would
rather hear the argument and that I know
what I'm really dealing with but there
doesn't seem to be an argument that
anybody on the right can articulate but
of course you know they would see
themselves as you know a nemesis but the
people on the left who are taking his
money
can't explain why he's good for the
world
not even a not even you can't get
um Glenn Kessler
Stephen Collinson or Dean Obadiah to
write an opinion piece that supports
Soros
or at least those specific things he's
doing
just think of that you can't even get
the professional misinformation people
to misinform you that even they won't do
it because they even can't they can't
see an argument for it there's no
argument
all right you want to hear some more
about the uh absolute of the
thing that you think is news
is it my imagination or was Health Care
a big issue before
did somebody solve it does somebody
 solve Health Care while I wasn't
watching or did we just stop talking
about it because Biden hasn't done a
 thing
now I think he added some people to
Obamacare but did that checks it oh all
good now are are the costs not spiraling
out of control and suddenly the entire
news industry doesn't care anything
about health care suddenly it doesn't
matter at all
he reduced the price of insulin which I
think Trump tried to do and got reversed
and then Biden reversed the reversal or
something
yeah
but with the healthcare story tells you
as clearly as you could possibly see
that the news is not real
because Health Care didn't get better
they just stopped talking about it
that's all that happened they just
stopped talking about it
all right
I have a prediction for you
that we're getting to the point where
there's enough
reasoned scientific pushback to climate
change
that it might disappear from the news
without anything changing
what do you think
and I feel like it's I feel I'm feeling
the the first whiff of it
you know the same way that the health
care thing was the biggest thing in the
world until they decided it wasn't
I feel like the uh you know the Sheldon
burgers and the uh you know the
Epstein's
um not not the island Epstein you know
Alex Epstein
um
that they're doing such a good job of
laying down the counter argument
that I think it might just disappear I
think they might just stop talking about
it because it doesn't work
and then then we're going to pretend
that everything they said about it we're
just going to act like
the biggest problem in the world just
disappeared because they stopped talking
about it
or maybe it was never the biggest
problem
yeah Vivek is also a big part of you
know punching through the narrative
there all right so that's my prediction
that that there will be a time in the
future and I'm going to give a date
one year
so before the election
one year from now
uh no that would be still in the
election cycle so they might still be
trying to scare people it'll probably
take longer
I think it'll be four or five years
before it goes away but it's just going
to disappear
all right
um over in Ukraine nothing to worry
about here but seven Deputy defense
ministers were dismissed that's seven of
eight
I wonder why
seven Deputy defense ministers and
there's some rumors about corruption
huh
is it possible that seven Deputy defense
ministers did not get fired just because
they were incompetent
but maybe they were making some money on
the side
oh what are the odds of that
yeah
so there's that
all right let's talk about uh Trump on
his uh interview with uh
uh be at the press and was it a woman
named Welker who is the host if I have
that right
anyway so the one of the big pieces of
news that came out of that was that
Trump was asked about
um a National Abortion ban a federal ban
and he he said that he wanted to help
the country negotiate
some kind of compromise where everybody
would be happy and they'd love him for
it or something like that
now
Matt Walsh didn't like that because it
looks like a compromise on something you
should never compromise on in his view
why are you compliment compromising on
killing babies I'm summarizing but
that's the basic idea why would you ever
compromise on killing babies
um so this is not my point of view just
to be clear I'm characterizing somebody
else's point of view which is why would
you ever compromise on baby killing that
would be the the last thing you would
compromise on
um and Seth Dillon made a similar Point
by saying now we know who among us would
have compromised on slavery instead of
fighting for its abolition whoa
hit us with the slavery analogy
so uh here's the thing
in both cases
I think there's a similar thing going on
I think we did find out who among us
would have compromised on slavery uh
what the union was formed
and the answer is all the people who are
good at long-term planning
would have compromised on slavery
because it was the only way to get there
the other possibility wasn't there
we wouldn't have been one country
so the other country would have just had
their slavery
and nobody would have been there as a
Counterpoint to it
likewise
Trump knows that whatever happens will
be something like a compromise and so
being the practical person he is
he would rather say let's focus on the
process of how we would negotiate a
compromise
that's kind of perfect
if he can make you think about the
process
about negotiating you know where where
is the end is it this many months is
there a ban of some kind is there any
limits whatever if he can make you think
about the negotiations he's already made
you think past the sale
the sale is should have been negotiated
but he's making you think about the
details of the negotiation and whether
there should be a negotiation
and so your your brain is already
negotiating
he does it all the time and it's perfect
he also says that he's going to reach a
you know agreement that everyone will
love
now you know that's impossible right
there is no possibility you could
compromise on abortion and have
everybody love it
but do you think he doesn't know that of
course he knows that do you think he
wants you to focus on the fact that you
won't all love it
of course he does he wants you to be
thinking about that if you're thinking
about whether you love it again you're
thinking about whether or not there
should be a negotiation
it's his classic trick he does it all
the time it's perfect persuasion
and so I would answer the question this
way now we know who among us would have
compromised on slavery instead of
fighting against Evolution abolition
everybody who is good at cost benefit
analysis would have
right the answer is not your moral
your moral strength your moral strength
would get you the opposite of what you
wanted
your moral flexibility
would get you eventually what you wanted
but also all of the other things in the
meantime like coherence a country that
works less division
Etc
so this this is not a question of
morality
because Trump's morality probably would
get you to the same place as the people
who are his critics are you would just
take longer
but you would have a way to get there
if you want to do it the immediate way
you probably just don't have that option
so why would you spend a lot of time on
something that wouldn't make any
difference so Trump's being practical
and of course is getting a lot of
pushback but I would say that focusing
on the process is exactly the way a
president should should
go and I would add this suggestion
the best answer for Trump is that
imagine a president saying this
you don't want your president making
your personal health care decisions for
you
right who's going to disagree with that
you don't want your president to make
your personal health care decisions but
I'm going to add something
you also don't want your president to
make your personal life and death
decisions because that's what it is it's
a life and death decision it might be in
some cases the life of the mother
because she might need to protect her
own life in rare cases but it's
certainly about the life of something
that some would call a human and some
would call you know a pre-human in some
way
so you could argue about the words to
put on it but we're all looking at the
same thing so the question the the
question that's hard to disagree with is
do you want your president to make your
personal health care decisions no
do you want the president who doesn't
even know you
to make your own personal life and death
decisions life and death do you want the
president to decide the president
doesn't even know you the president
doesn't know anything about your
situation
now that's not to say that the laws
should not be strict the laws will end
up where they end up but it's very smart
for the president whoever the president
is to say I'm going to help you guys you
guys meeting the public I'm going to
help you reach a situation which is
stable for the country
and I do have preferences
I do have I do have preferences
but my preferences should not lead your
life
the only thing I'm going to help you do
is make sure that your life and death
and your personal decisions are decided
by the public as best as possible and
not by a President
now I think that's wrong
I think that's strong persuasion but if
you're very much in favor of you know no
compromise
you're going to end up with nothing
you'll end up with a Democrat president
so if uh if the moral win is more
important than the actual win
uh then that would be the way to go
now I'll say this I've said it a million
times and I'll say it again
Trump is a business person
who's been making business decisions for
his whole life
if your job as a writer or a humorist
and you've been mostly writing for your
life and talking
you're not really you don't have the
same decision-making qualifications
and I say this often
decision making
is a skill
it's not something that you're purely
born with if you studied economics or
business you've been taught how to make
decisions you've actually been taught
I I've sat through classes where they
teach me to focus on the long run by
doing something called a you know a
discounted cash flow analysis and that
forces you to always think about the
long run or the complete picture I would
say the complete picture and don't focus
on the initial investment the initial
investment is do I buy this computer for
half a million dollars
if that were your only decision the
answer is no
right because you spell you lose a half
a billion dollars but there's a point to
the computer and if you look at 10 years
no not 10 years but if you look at three
years maybe it made sense yeah so if
you're looking at business people
having a different approach to something
than writers
who are you going to believe will not
believe who would you trust as a better
grasp on decision making
a lifetime business person who operated
at a high level or a lifetime writer
now of course writers also have to make
plenty of decisions about their own life
and their families and you know even
they run a business as well but it's
very bit different scale
the the complexity and the long-term
planning of Real Estate
I mean when Trump when Trump does a
project he's probably thinking 20 years
right
you wouldn't do a building unless you
had a sort of a 20-year mindset
so
I I think I would trust the people who
learned how to make decisions over the
people who were doing something else
during that time
all right
uh
and of course comparing it to slavery is
an analogy which is not what good
decision makers do
have you ever heard Trump do that
I'm trying to think if I've ever heard
him argue with an analogy
and my first impression is no
can you do a fact check on that does
anybody remember Trump ever making an
argument with an analogy
I don't think I've ever heard it
now that's a shocker isn't it
because that is a real uh
that's a real endorsement of his
analytical abilities if he could stay
away from analogies and I think he does
actually I don't think he uses analogies
so and the reason is that you don't use
an analogy is although in the legal
system you know precedent does matter
but in arguing what is rational
an analogy is just somebody else's
situation
it doesn't have a bearing on the one
you're looking at but people who don't
know how to do analysis imagine it does
so this point about who among us would
have compromised on slavery
the answer is all the smart people
unfortunately that's the answer all of
the smart people because they would have
known it was the only way to end it in
the long run and also have a strong
country in the meantime
uh Jesus used parables
a parable is a story
trying to give you a way to act in the
future yeah that's not trying to win an
argument with an analogy it's pretty
different
the snake story
it was the snake story an analogy
I I think if you
yes here's the thing the snake story is
made up right
an analogy is a real thing
that you're comparing to another real
thing if somebody makes up a story
that's a story
story is persuasion
and you know story gives you a mental
model to to hang your facts on but it's
not it's not an analogy
all right
um
what's happening my AI is malfunctioning
yeah you can always tell the people of
in cognitive dissonance because they go
immediately personal
so if you so if I say something smart
and you see somebody saying what
happened to your brain that means that
the cognitive dissonance if I say
something
that has a let's say a logic error
then people say that well you're
forgetting this variable
or have you considered also this other
Factor
that's what they say when they disagree
when they're experiencing cognitive
dissonance they say what's wrong with
your brain what happened to you
it's pretty consistent
all right
what if you say something dumb like we
should compromise on abortion well luo I
didn't say that did I
did you hear me say that
did you hear me say what you should do
nope
no
no you haven't heard my opinion on on
abortion I think women should work it
out that's my opinion
so if you're anything but that that is
actually your imagination
and you're having an argument with your
imagination
now no I never said you should negotiate
it I said that if you want the country
to stay together that would be the path
if you want us to be forever divided
then you would fight it to the death
so you get to pick your two approaches
but I didn't tell you which one to pick
if you want to die for your moral
um
you know if you want if you want the
country to fall apart
for your moral Victory you do have that
option I didn't tell you you shouldn't
do it
if it's that important to you that you
would destroy everything for it
I don't know I can't tell you what's
important you have to decide that on
your own
uh no our ancestors didn't need
analogies to get a message across they
needed stories maybe but not analogies
all right well that's got a lot of
action on on here
all right
um
against women getting the right to vote
in America unless we need to do a
compelling oh uh so I'm asked did I ever
read any of the opinions of people who
were against women getting the right to
vote in America when it was first being
debated some of the reasons were
compelling
uh
you know
um I've of course I'm opposed to
take away anybody's right to vote
um but
the arguments are funny
like if you're gonna if if you're gonna
follow along and
I don't know that we would have much of
a different outcome if women didn't vote
I'm not sure exactly what would be
different
yeah
no I don't even ask
all right
yeah
Pearl thinks women should not vote it's
pretty funny
all right how about only taxpayers well
I've said that before
that your vote should be in in
proportion to how much taxes you pay
so I mean
it should be
yeah the other model uh was what the
Constitution originally had which was
property owners
you know the the argument for property
owners is way stronger than the argument
for women not voting
am I wrong
because the property owners as long as
everybody has a chance to own property
like you wouldn't want a law that
limited new people from owning property
but as long as everybody has a way to
own property
then it should be only people who own
property should vote
do you think that property owners would
vote for uh letting criminals out to Rob
again
no property a property owner is not
going to vote for that there's people
who don't own property and hate people
who do
if you hate people at property you do
the things that are being done now you
let in Mass immigration and you let all
the criminals out of jail
that is anti-property
now here let me spin this into a related
topic
does anybody have the problem that
there's a young person in your life and
you're trying to be a mentor or advise
them but you don't know how to advise
them what to do in the land of robots
you know when Ai and robots are running
everything I I try to think of a job to
recommend that wouldn't be taken over
obviously by a robot or AI and here's
the best that I've come up with so far
you ready
there's one thing the AI and robots will
never be able to do I hope
it's actually possible that they could
do it but is your best bet and it goes
like this
they won't be able to own property
they won't be able to own property if
you own property you can rent it sell it
make money from it if you don't own
property you only have Labor
and it's going to take all of your labor
away
so I would say that your only defense
against Ai and robots is to own property
any way you can
because your property is the only thing
they can't compete with and one of the
properties that you could own as a robot
so I'm looking forward to having a robot
or a little Fleet of robots and that I
rent them out like temporary workers
right
so I'm going to use robots I'm going to
own them because it's ownership that's
the only thing that will be worth
anything in the future so I think
ownership will be the prime way anybody
makes money in the future you gotta own
real estate or assets or something gotta
own something the business you could own
a business
so look for ownership
boom
yeah I don't think
I don't want to talk about that a
millionth time
uh
every adult owns some form of property
at some point
all right so if we found that F-35 yet
uh yeah I did contact Pearl
you know it was interesting the reason I
had trouble contacting Pearl is that I
followed her and I got automatically
unfollowed before she could DM me
so
all right
um all right that's all I got for now um
have you heard of the uh Pegasus bug
Russia has I think Russia or is
developed by Israel or something it's a
bug that it's a program that can get on
your phone and they can monitor
everything in your phone
did you know that that's a real thing
and apparently I know some thousands of
people have it on their phone and don't
know it
now the people who have it on the phone
tend to be influencers
so what are the odds that I have Pegasus
on my phone right now
it's pretty high isn't it
pretty high
yeah if you said that Russia made sure
that the top thousand
political opinion people had it on their
phone I'm definitely in the top thousand
am I not
if you were a Russian you wouldn't put
me in the top thousand of people whose
phones you wanted to listen to I think
you would
I mean I think I'd be in the top 50.
but top thousand for sure if they could
get me they would so
there's no way to prove it apparently
you can't Spot It
yeah
so it might be I I suspect that
somebody's deeply into my communications
let's just say there's an indicator
well I'll just tell you there's somebody
reading one of my messages
with one person
and uh I'll I'll just tell you this area
I can watch the new message indicator
disappear while I'm looking at it
while I'm looking at it I did that this
morning
new and new message indicator comes on
in my DMs
and then I I actually filmed it
and I said watch this is going to
disappear without me touching the
computer and I just filmed it
Boop
twice
twice in a row
I watched the new message indicator
disappear now only on one account
it's only on one account
so you tell me that nobody's reading
that message before I read it
what do you think
what else would it be
do you think there's a bug that affects
that affects the the new message
indicator
after it's been up there for a minute
now if you told me it never it never
went on in the first place I'd say well
could be a bug but you tell me that a
new message indicator shows up
but only for one person
and then it disappears within a minute
yeah some I'm pretty sure somebody's in
my
Communications
yeah no it couldn't be anything about
the person
in terms of technically because you know
what would the person have to do with my
phone
you know it's my app on my phone that
sees it as a new message
it can't be something that's happening
on somebody else's device
yeah all right so that's not fun
what is deja vu if we're a simulation
I don't know could be anything
Macedonian teenagers
yeah so the message turns to a red
message from an unread message while I'm
looking at the list of messages but
without touching the computer I'm not
touching it
anyway
so I would remind you that there's no
such thing as
privacy
privacy is the same as being boring
that's it if you're completely
uninteresting
you accidentally have privacy if you're
doing anything interesting somebody's in
your
every time you just have to live your
life like
um there's you're fully transparent
now I'm pretty sure I've been living my
life like somebody's reading all of my
messages for
pretty much my whole career I think
the the only thing I would put in a
message
that I didn't want you know that would
be like embarrassing would be like
flirting or something like that
but a tractor what's a tractor that's
not a thing
you you have multiple stalkers
uh
Willie Brown said that Ian email stands
for evidence
all phones are already trackers what
devices affected
well I don't think that works on the
iPhone I think that's that Pegasus
checking thing is for
I think it might be only for uh Android
someone started a 4chan Paul thread on
me
so
what are they going to talk about me
why would you need a new thread on me
yeah Pegasus is an iOS but I think the
solution doesn't work for iOS
but I'm not positive about that
uh
one million child March what
no I don't use Q
um
Roomba could be hacked wow
can bobert recover she's already
recovered nobody cares about bobert
nobody cares that she Vaped nobody cares
all right that's all I got for you
YouTube so I will talk to you tomorrow
thanks for joining
bye for now
