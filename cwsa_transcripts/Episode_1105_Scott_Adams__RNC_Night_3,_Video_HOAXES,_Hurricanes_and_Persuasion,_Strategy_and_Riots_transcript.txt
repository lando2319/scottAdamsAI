hey
everybody come on in it's time
it's time for coffee with scott adams
the best time of the day yeah it is
and all you need to enjoy this
incredible experience is not much really
all it takes is a copper bug or glass of
tanker shells to stein the canteen
checker flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid
i'm partial to coffee and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure of the
dopamine
to the day the thing that makes
everything better
except riots apparently it's called this
it's called the simultaneous step it
happens now go
ah no i was wrong i did make the riots a
little bit better
you might not notice it with all the
fake news but
pretty sure there was a benefit there
well um i was uh
at first happy to hear the report that
there were no deaths from hurricane
laura but
the update is there is a 14 year old who
lost his life
so that is tragic um
and while not uh downplaying the loss of
life
it is remarkable that there was that
little bit uh that the loss of life was
small and part of the solution for that
might be we're getting smarter maybe
we're we just have better communication
part of it is that it was predicted to
be bigger than it was
so that's good news but i saw this bit
of persuasion coming out
of the local government trying to get
people to evacuate
and listen to how good this persuasion
is
this is as good as you can persuade
they announced before the waters game to
try to get everybody to leave
they said quote please evacuate and if
you choose to stay
and we can't get to you write your name
address and social security number
and next of kin and put it in a ziploc
bag in your pocket praying that it does
not come to this
oh my god that's good in fact
they should use this the same exact line
for every single situation where you're
trying to get people to evacuate
because i've taught you that the
strongest form of
persuasion is fear so if you can make
somebody afraid of something nothing
there's nothing that's as good as that
it might be used in a bad way but
there's nothing as
effective as that as scaring people
but if you're going to scare people you
want to make it
visual this is really visual you can
imagine the baggy you can imagine
yourself filling it out
you can imagine putting it in your
pocket because you think well would i
how would i attach it to myself put it
in my pocket
very visual it makes you deal with the
question
of how you would do it which makes you
think past the sale
the sale is doing it and you're thinking
about how to do it
do i have a baggie yeah would that be
good enough whose name would i put on it
thinking past the sale fear
visual and then they put it in a story
you could actually see the movie of this
part of your life
where you're getting the baggie you're
filling it out you're putting in your
pocket and then here's the
here's the really powerful part you can
see your
own lifeless body being discovered
and they find the baggy in your pocket
try to top that take take the
the best persuader in the history of
persuaders
try to top that you can't
that's as good as you can persuade
there's nothing left you know there's no
money left on the table with this one
this is putting it all out there
now i don't know if the person
who came up with this idea was
trying to persuade and actually
understood technique
or it could be that this was simply a
good idea
and it is a good idea but it also has a
persuasive element so i'd be very
curious
whoever came up with this framing if
they had any actual training and
persuasion
because if they hit this by accident you
know
if you stumbled across something this
powerful
just randomly i mean it's possible
but i'd be surprised i think there's
somebody who's got some skill
some serious skill who came up with that
all right um as you've noticed the
mainstream s
mess the mainstream press
which is sort of a mainstream mess
is realizing that the poll numbers are
plunging for biden
the more violence there is in the
midwest especially
that's the last place you'd want to have
any violence because those are the
battleground states for the election
and i think politico and cnn
and you're seeing some other people say
hey
wait a minute i don't think this rioting
slash protesting slash looting
i don't think this is working in our
favor and by the way a public
service announcement if i ever talk
in a generality such as
there were looters in the city or there
were
there were some bad eggs you should be
smart enough
to translate that into your head try to
follow along
because i know these you know my
followers are smarter than the average
you should translate that into your head
into he doesn't mean
every single person might not even mean
most of them i might be talking about
just
the bad eggs and the bunch you should be
able to
to handle the fact that when people use
generalities that way
they don't really mean every person it
doesn't mean every person when i
say it doesn't mean every person when
you say it
doesn't mean every single person when
anybody says it
so if you're going to be that idiot who
says oh he says every single person
oh every single person there was violent
oh that's right scott sure every single
person
that is a case of using sarcasm instead
of reasons
mixed with a little intentional bad
reading comprehension
um here's the way the fake news
is spinning tucker carlson's show last
night
so tucker said and i'll paraphrase but
tucker was
essentially saying that nobody should be
surprised
that a vigilante kind of a shooting or
really just violence in general
came out of these protest slash looting
slash riots again
not every person was writing not every
single person was looting
some of them were good just in case
there's anybody new to my periscopes who
needed that little extra
clarification every once in a while a
biden supporter floats in here not
knowing what they're going to get
so i like to make sure that they know
what they're getting
so all right so tucker makes the
completely
ordinary obvious
clearly justifiable non-provocative
totally non-provocative statement that
if you let this
situation go on it's very predictable
that it turns into two sides and at
least one of them is going to have guns
probably both as we saw in kenosha
there were guns on both sides only one
of them fired it turns out
so how controversial is it to say that
it's predictable where this
ends that's not predictable that's
that's not
controversial at all in fact
i think tucker said something that a
hundred percent of people would agree
with
how can you be provocative saying things
that everybody agrees with
and is obvious that if you allow
you know this chaos to continue the
obvious conclusion is people getting
killed
obviously that's not even a political
statement
that's just a statement of duh so how
did the
bad people in the fake news business
spin it
uh well here we we have somebody from
politico
blake uh houndshell he's the editorial
director
of the website politico and he says
quote
vigilante violence was always one of my
greatest worries about the present
moment
tweeted blake has now now keep in mind
he just
completely agreed with tucker carlson
because he said vigilante violence
was always my greatest worry meaning it
was
predictable predictable that's what
tucker said
so now he's completely agreed with
tucker so we're done right
there's nothing else to say you just
agreed with what tucker said
oh no he continues and he goes talking
about tucker he goes and here we have a
prominent tv host
a man who had the president's ear
excusing it
rationalizing it no
nothing like that happened it's not
rationalizing something to predict it
because you know who else predicted it
the guy who's criticizing
tucker carlson it's the most ridiculous
criticism in the world
he agrees with them and then he
criticizes them without any awareness
that they have the same opinion
incredible is he the only one who is
this blind to the obvious
no turns out that nicole
hannah jones who is a new york times
magazine reporter who won the pulitzer
prize for her work on the
1619 project which you've heard of what
was her opinion of
tucker's point of view quote he just
justified murder no
nothing like that happened nobody
justified murder not tucker
not his listeners not anybody
nothing even remotely like that happened
how about max boot a conservative
washington post columnist
you can trust a concert you can trust a
conservative washington post call him
this can't you
wait he's a conservative but he tweeted
that uh
carlson was quote inciting violence and
abetting terrorism
was he because the video shows that the
terrorists are the ones who were
chasing and trying to physically hurt
if not kill the person who ended up
shooting in self-defense
more on that in a minute but no it
wasn't anything like that
he was just predicting
as i have i have also predicted it
but i don't encourage it it's just
obvious it's going to happen
and there's nothing else that could
happen i'll go further
than any of them which is to say it's
guaranteed to happen
you can't you can't change that with
your preference
tucker carlson can't change the course
of events
by wishing it wouldn't happen he could
even encourage it not to happen
he could come out strongly against it
happening it wouldn't make any
difference
it wouldn't make any difference because
the people who are doing stuff
are not watching tucker carlson and
saying well there you go
i better not do this thing i was going
to do
that's not a thing you know
maybe you could change the minds of some
people who are on the fence in some
weird situations
but in general it's not going to move
the needle at all
all right so that part is insane let's
talk about the rnc
convention night three i would say it
was another
solid performance and i think everybody
agreed i think the democrats agreed
i think the republicans agreed and
um i would go even further than to say
it was solid um there were some
standouts
really star turns i thought jack brewer
because because it's 20 20 and you have
to specify these things
can we can we get to the point in
history where if you have the
first black female inspector general of
the post office i don't know maybe
that's already happened
that we don't make it a story that is
the first black female who has
you know got this particular job can
can't we get past that
can't we get to the point where we say
why wouldn't she get the job
can't we get to the point where we say
something you know we're glad it's
happening
but why is it news is there somebody on
the other side of this who doesn't think
that
in my hypothetical example is there
someone who doesn't think a black woman
can get a good job
when all evidence clearly shows that the
other succeeding at the highest levels
especially in congress they're killing
it in congress
so why do we make this news i feel like
we've reached the point where
talking about it makes it worse you know
when it's if you go back 20 years or
even 10 years i suppose
yeah it's worth mentioning you know it's
definitely worth mentioning if you get
the first
let's say whatever group for president
or vice president
even for uh you know for congress i
think that that's fair
to point out somebody you know getting a
powerful position but
yeah at some point we just have to stop
calling out people's
race for the news story it just
needs to be less important and we're all
going to be better off i think
both for the good news and the bad news
anyway
jack brewer african-american man was
very pro-trump
and the part that is stood out aside
from the fact that he's
really good on camera i mean you know
there's some people
you put them on camera and they just
disappear and then there are other
people who just
not only light up the screen but they
seem to enter your
they enter your space that's what trump
does
trump doesn't just light up the screen
when you're watching him
he's in your house i mean he gets off
the screen he gets into your bones he's
in your dna
and you know i'm not sure that you can
you can't really coach
somebody to do that i don't think you
can make somebody better at
communicating
but whatever that thing is that trump
has that makes him light up the screen
and then leave the screen and enter your
house
that just comes along once every who
knows
but jack brewer has a strong version of
that
thing that that charisma that natural
star power i guess you'd call it and it
was interesting to watch that
but the point that i i was most
interested in
is that he directly debunked the fine
people hoax
does it make a matter does it matter
that he is a black man
who debunked the fine people hoax yeah
it matters
matters a lot you know i had challenged
anybody who believes this hoax to find
me anybody in leadership
in israel who thinks it was true
under the theory that if israel doesn't
think
that the president was praising these
people who were anti-semitic
if israel didn't see it they've got
pretty
pretty good filters on this stuff i
don't think they'd let it go
at the very least they would have said
hey could you clarify this
you know were worried that you were
supporting them anything like that
anything like that no because israel
is not taken in by the fake news
that so many of us are so
uh watching a black man who had
tremendous just star power really
impressive
um to watch him light up the screen and
to some extent
not quite a president trump level but
come into your
your life you know he leaves the screen
as well
to see him debunk that was useful but
what happened the fake news immediately
fact-checked them
they fact fact-checked him incorrectly
and said no he got that wrong
there's just nothing you can do if the
fact that if the fake news has a
a news silo which they do and nobody
gets outside of that so they don't see
the other argument
they can just fact check it so cnn
you know ran much or most of the rnc
convention
on their network so here's
if you're wondering why the polls are
moving let me just put this idea in your
head
and you're going to laugh that you
haven't seen somebody say this yet
unless you have
maybe somebody said this i haven't seen
it think about this
cnn carrying the the republican
convention
was the first time uh
a lot of cnn viewers had seen actual
news
meaning the other side of the story
they've seen a version of the you know
filtered through the fake news
you know messaging but they've never
seen they've never
heard the other argument they've never
seen a picture of republicans looking
like they have empathy i don't think
people knew they were black republicans
i mean of course they knew on some level
but i don't think that they knew that
there were black republicans
who are um so powerful that
you know we're talking about them as the
next president you know if you were
if you were a democrat who had only
watched the fake news and you'd never
seen any republican messaging
counter messaging you know any any of
the strengths if you've never seen any
of that
what did you think when tim scott got up
there and gave his
you know incredible speech did you say
to yourself
who is he probably
you probably said who's he i didn't know
there were any black republicans
and when you know jack uh when jack
uh brewster brewer i'm sorry jack brewer
was
talking last night how many people
said wait a minute why is a black guy
saying that the fine people thing was a
hoax
do you think it at least caused some
curiosity in people saying
hmm i wonder why that would happen
because
it would be a strange thing for him to
claim in public if it could be so easily
disproven by just looking at the
transcript of course
if you do look at the transcript you'll
see he's completely right
most people only see the first part
that's misleading they don't read the
second part of the transcript
that clarifies anyway
cnn uh made the mistake of accidentally
allowing their people to see republican
messaging for the first time
what should be the predictable outcome
of that
the predictable outcome of that should
be
a little bit of movement on the pole it
should be
now i don't know that it works the other
way because fox news can cover
the uh the democratic convention and
almost everything
that conservatives hear
from the democrats is things that they
already know
now they may know it's false or they may
know it's true but they know the story
and they know the the counter to it if
there is one
so you should expect that if both
networks carry both
uh conventions that one would get a
significant bump in the polls
and one would not because one is giving
no new information
to to the public and one is giving a lot
of new information to the public
like a whole different world you didn't
think was there it's like ah
really seriously are you telling me that
president trump did all of these things
that are conspicuously designed
to be good for the black voters in this
country
did they know that well they know it now
if they watch the convention so it
should make a difference
i thought it was very interesting and
very smart
that trump tweeted a thank you to cnn
for carrying most of the rnc
and there was no joke in it i'm just
just sort of hold this in your head
trump
tweeted a thank you to cnn
with no joke it was you know obviously
he was doing it for persuasion purposes
because you know what i've taught you
that one of the most powerful persuasion
things you can do
is if somebody is your critic you go as
hard as you can again
against them while they're being a
critic but the moment they say something
that's not
critical you should go just as hard in
the other direction to praise them
and thank them and and call it out as
good behavior
that's good persuasion trump does that
better than anybody and there's nobody
in the public sphere
who has ever done that specific trick of
persuasion
as perfectly as he does he will he will
try to bury you if you're
a critic but the moment you're on his
side
it doesn't matter what you do right
doesn't matter if you're
cue doesn't matter what you are if
you're on his side
thank you i'm glad you support america
so that is good persuasion it's you know
obviously persuasion but it's
it's good persuasion um
so we learned a bit about
the the shooter in kenosha
so as you know the 17 year old with the
ar shot and killed
two white people and injured a third
again it's important that they're all
white the shooter
and the the people got shot it shouldn't
be important
but it's 20 20 so i have to throw that
in there that that makes
it's just disgusting that mentioning
people's ethnicity in a news story
should matter but it does it does in
this case
and so here's what we know about them
this is
andy now if you're not following him his
last name is spelled
n-g-o he's got
pretty much all of the all of the useful
information
about these protests and
what comes out of them and he reported
this morning that
one of them was a 36 year old he's the
first one who's shot
and the video shows him chasing after
the shooter and throwing something at
him
in other words attacking him with the
risk of
grievous bodily harm and if he got
shot for that and of course we're still
in fog of war but that's
that's what it looks like that was
uh turns out that the guy he shot was
also coincidentally a registered sex
offender
for a sex crime involving a minor
that's good context to know isn't it um
how about the next one
the other one was uh 26 and he was shot
uh and he was uh filmed chasing down the
the teen who did the shooting and
hitting that team when he was on the
ground
with a skateboard now that was
again risk of not risk of but grievous
bodily harm he
actually hit him and then the teen shot
him dead
the person who got shot dead has a
criminal history
that includes charges of battery and
repeat
domestic abuse so so far
the the kid with a gun shot a registered
sex offender
and somebody with repeat domestic abuse
allegations doesn't mean they were
guilty
they're allegations the third person was
shot
this one survived he was 26 and he's a
member of the people's revolution
movement
um he was photographed with a gun in his
hand i don't know if that
was real but it looked like it um he was
filmed chasing after the team
with a pistol right
and he was shot at close range in the
upper arm
turns out he also has a criminal record
that includes being intoxicated
and armed with a gun so
um i said quite clearly
that i don't have i don't care about
them
i don't care about any of the white men
because again it's 20 20. so in order to
make a statement about
anything you got to specify their their
ethnicity and their their race
so i will those are the rules i don't
care about those white guys
i somebody said the third guy is unarmed
i was gonna make that joke but it
sounded a little too cruel
but i don't mind mentioning it when you
did
um i don't care about them
and let me say it as directly as
possible their lives don't matter to me
their lives don't matter because they
made choices
that made them um worthy of being shot
and it wouldn't matter who who it was
doesn't matter that they're
white men or men or weapon or anything
if they made choices that
earned them getting shot and that's
looks like what happened
as far as we know i mean it could change
if we learn something else
but if they made those choices i don't
care about them i don't care about them
at all
to me their lives don't matter
now i will also extend this concept
to anyone no matter their race or
ethnicity or gender
or age or religion to anyone who resists
arrest and gets shot
even if the police acted inappropriately
i don't care about them their lives
literally don't matter to me
now it's hard to say that in public and
again i'm not talking about black lives
or white lives or blue lives or any
other
specific person anybody who makes the
choice to resist arrest
doesn't matter to me at that point i
totally care about their families
because there's a lot of pain that's
left behind that's bad i care about any
anybody who gets
you know mistakenly blamed for something
because they get caught up in the
political
moment of 2020. i feel bad for them
and certainly if anybody made a mistake
or could have done
something better that needs to be
addressed you know i'm not giving police
some kind of a pass to shoe people
they need to do it right and if there's
any way we could do it more right
i'm all for it i just think that as a
principal
if you allow people to resist the rest
without consequence and without serious
consequence
including death if you allow that to be
your new standard
that resisting arrest can be okay
you have created the situation that will
destroy
civilization itself because
unfortunately nobody's figured out how
to have
a civilization without some kind of law
enforcement
and you can't have law enforcement if
people are allowed
to walk away from the rest or if they're
allowed to go
pick up a weapon during the middle of an
arrest
can you let somebody go into their car
and pick up their weapon
while the rest is in progress i don't
think so
and let me say as clearly as possible i
don't care about that guy who got shot
reaching for his knife i don't care
about him i really don't
and has nothing to do with being black
or being white has nothing to do with
that
he made choices that if he got his way
and his supporters got their way
resisting arrest would be
as a de facto kind of real world
case resisting arrest would be legalized
effectively if you could do it without
consequence
and i'd say in that case
i just don't care about so i couldn't
say that
until there were some serious white
people who got killed
that i could say i don't care about too
because otherwise it gets misconstrued
but there it was all right now
i've been joking slash not joking about
biden's satanic influences
meaning that there are a lot of satanic
coincidences
about joe biden that he lives
underground
like satan that he that lucifer's name
is
bringer of light and that's literally
what biden
announced he would do he would bring
light uh
there's the fact that kamala harris
both are six letters kablon six harris
six
president of or vice president of the
united states is six
so he's got the 666 thing going for his
vice president
um but this one
this little bit sort of tells it to
y'all
so one of my uh one of my trolls or my
critics online
has been posting a picture of my
deceased stepson
who died of a fentanyl overdose
in 2018 as as a comment
no matter what i'm commenting on and
then he
says it's my fault that uh that my
stepson died
now i accept that that's true
i would never argue with that in the
sense that was there anything i could
have done in hindsight
that would have prevented it and the
answer is always yes if you have
somebody in your family who commit
suicide
yeah there was something you could do
you could have been
in the room all the time you could have
tried harder whatever
so it's not like i disagree with the
point
that anybody who has a loss in the
family they could have done something
different
but it's the real world people don't
know
until hindsight makes us all smart how
much they could have done or should have
done
under the circumstances but i don't
disagree with the point
that somebody could have done more and
that into somebody in this case was me
but when you see the the degree
of evil that it takes for this person to
do that and it's repeated it's not once
it's somebody who i block them they
create a neutral account they do it on
the next comment etc
but that that feels closer to satanic
i'm not a believer but just in terms of
categorizing it
feels closer to satanic than it does to
somebody who's just a troll but
i'll leave that to you the
the rnc last night made and for the last
three days
they've made a number of positive
comments about school
choice but i think that they have failed
in their messaging
so even though the republicans have
fairly consistently said hey
school choice will will help you
there's a there's a part they leave out
that makes their
preference for school choice inert
in other words it's the most powerful
thing
or could be it should be the most
powerful thing that they say
but the way they say it turns it from
potentially the most powerful thing they
could say
to absolutely nothing and here's here's
the problem
when you simply say this it's not enough
and this is what they do
they say we want more school choice
because you know competition is good and
then
you know uh parents can raise their
children
and the way they want it's it's freedom
uh it's right they say that sort of
thing
that has no persuasive power
except to republicans which is not good
enough if you're running for election
what they should say and they're leaving
out and it must be intentional is that
the cause
of not being able to have this freedom
of education if you will
is the teachers unions specifically the
teachers unions
if you unpair those two ideas
and then you unpair it from systemic
racism
you've lost all your persuasive juice
all right the way to make it persuasive
is to say
systemic racism the biggest cause of it
and it's real
if you're still arguing the systemic
racism doesn't exist
because you're a republican and you
don't want it to exist
it's a losing argument and the reason is
a losing argument is a
it totally exists it may not be in the
form and type that other people are
talking about it
but obviously exists any system
will be optimized for some types of
people
and sub-optimize for other types doesn't
mean
anybody did it intentionally doesn't
mean it's anybody's fault
per se but it is something that needs to
be addressed
and certainly there is a ripple from
slavery and other effects
that clearly have an effect but i would
say that the
biggest lever for fixing that and i
think everybody would like to fix it if
it's fixable
in in the sense of giving everybody a
fair shot because anything you fix for
the black community
as is often said and it's one of the
strongest points
is going to help everybody it's going to
help everybody
there is no way to give the black
community
a boost that doesn't help everybody
unless you're just transferring money
which is sort of the dumb way to do it
but if you were to uh state
quite accurately that the teachers
unions
are the primary cause of locking the
black community into
the lower socioeconomic
grouping that's just true that's
demonstrably
obviously observably true they're doing
literally that by being the strongest
force they're a huge political force
and the reason they're a big political
forces there's so many teachers
lots of teachers means lots of money
from dues
lots of money from dues means you can do
things beyond
what the school is doing at the moment
you know beyond the negotiating for the
teachers
you can use that money a lot of it to
influence politics and they do
and they have so much money because
there's so many teachers
that they can actually determine you
know local uh
local politicians who gets elected and
then they can just
cement their power uh and they can lock
in
structural or systemic racism
and and school choice is the primary way
that anybody's ever thought of if
somebody comes up with a better idea i'm
open to that
but in terms of ideas that people
actually have
like real suggestions that are actually
something you could do something about
getting rid of the power of the teachers
unions
and moving more towards school choice is
the thing
the number one thing that the black
community needs
to you know to get a fair shake because
they're not
there anybody who says that that you're
getting a fair shake
when you're black especially if you're
living in some you know urban
place that's not so good anybody who
thinks that they're getting a fair shake
not paying attention because not only
are they not getting a fair shake but
anybody who's in the same socioeconomic
group
also not getting a fair shake all right
and it's because the teachers unions so
when the republicans leave that out
they also guarantee that their message
is weak i don't know why they do it
honestly
all right so
here's what else i would say also
that nobody succeeds without a good
strategy
uh would you agree that the the asian
americans
have a good strategy as a group
again when you talk about a group you're
not talking about
every single person in the group if you
know i'm hoping you're adult enough to
know that
but isn't it true that the asian
american
community has a strategy which is stay
out of trouble
you know legal trouble especially stay
out of trouble and
emphasize education right
and it seems to work because they've
they've done unusually well
would you say that wealthy white people
also have a strategy that works well of
course they have an advantage if they're
coming from wealth
but they also hear good strategies just
by being around it
they can observe what works and what
doesn't because they're around
success if you've never been around
success you kind of don't know what it
looks like
you know it has to be personal you have
to know somebody who is successful
it's not really good to just watch them
on tv or read a book about a successful
person
if you've not met one it's a real
disadvantage
i mean a serious disadvantage and
i've often said that one of the biggest
strategic mistakes and it's just
one of them is if you're idolizing uh
if you're idolizing criminals
if they are your heroes literally
criminals and you are de-emphasizing
people who are doing it right
and succeeding then you can't really
succeed
i don't know that there's a culture who
has ever
idolized or or put most of their
let's say identity into a criminal
element
that has succeeded now you see this in
two ways and
i get this from from leaders in the
black community tell me this right
so the next thing i say is not my white
guy interpretation of anything
because again it's always a mistake to
think you can
put yourself in somebody else's head if
they're if they have a really different
situation
but black leaders will tell you that one
of the problems
is that if you're black and young
especially if you don't have a father
who is doing well that they're looking
for role models and the people who are
doing the best
in a bad situation might be drug dealers
so if the only people who seem to be
living some kind of a high quality life
are literally criminals that's a bad
strategy
you know you need to replace that
that role model mental situation
with some other kind of positive role
model or you just can't
there's nothing that can be fixed if you
don't get that first
that's sort of like starting place right
now you see this also with the
police shooting stuff and and i hope i
model this
correctly it is a good strategy
when you see three uh scumbags of your
own ethnicity
getting waxed by a guy with a gun which
is basically what happened in kenosha
that you should call the three who got
waxed as bad people
i don't make them my role models i don't
make them
my cause i say screw them
i don't care about them but if somebody
does something awesome
i'm gonna call that out right i'm gonna
call that out and i'm gonna make them my
hero
so you know when i see jack brewer who
not only was spectacular as a
personality
as charisma as a communicator i mean
really really good
but apparently he has a um his life
lives up to that same standard so what i
call him out as a role model
i feel like that's a good strategy
doesn't matter what
ethnicity is he's my role model because
he works hard
i would say the same thing about kanye
one of the the greatest parts about
kanye
is unstated this is the thing nobody
talks about
but it should be the most important
thing about kanye
he knows how to succeed he works hard
stays on a jail takes the right kinds of
risks
learns what he needs to builds his
talent stack
has a rock solid strategy
for life i mean really solid strategy
you can see it in everything he does
right he makes the right kind of risks
you know when he does things that are
provocative he makes that work for him
it makes him yeah makes his voice more
important
you've seen him succeed in three
different fields at this point because i
would say that his
his uh spiritual stuff he's doing now is
hugely successful
so he's hugely successful in music you
know
producing performing those are you know
pretty different
uh hugely successful in fashion
and now hugely successful as a spiritual
leader in this country so look at kanye
and
the fact that we don't and what do we
say when kanye's in the news what do we
talk about
he gets mocked he gets mocked for you
know that one thing he said that he
didn't like or
you know that that one time taylor swift
you know was winning an award or or
they mock him for i don't know liking
trump
it it as long as you're mocking your
good role models
and you're and you're making heroes and
if you're literally criminals
or people who weren't resisting rest and
again
don't take this generalization to apply
to every situation
i'm not saying that police made all the
right decisions
i'm not saying that you know all of the
shootings were
justified or good nothing like that
police clearly make mistakes
because they're human if your police
didn't make any mistakes
it would mean were already taken over by
ai and the robots
and even they would make mistakes so i
have a better strategy is what i'm
saying all right so i finally figured
out i've been
uh and this is because anderson cooper
said last night
to his group shot of gas
he said that the president suggested
drinking bleach
for the coronavirus if you're listening
to this
don't drink bleach for anything it'll
kill you
and anderson cooper said that and his he
had
at least one conservative uh i think two
conservative
voices on the screen at the same time
which is a lot actually
um and so i'll give them credit for that
they had
two trump-friendly people
on the screen with two others which
which i i give them credit for that
so uh taking president trump's
um let's take him as a role model in
this
when cnn does bad things i will
viciously attack them because i think
it's really bad for the country the fake
news
but when the when they do something
that's clearly a good thing
anderson cooper had two not just one
because you often see just one he had
two
pro conservative voices on with with two
on the other side
and i thought that was reasonable so i'm
going to call that out as a compliment
but so anderson cooper states this
this fake news that
uh the president suggested drinking
bleach and both of the
uh conservatives just went
you know they just they just made this
noise like i can't believe it
and then here's the amazing part i
always
wonder do the people who are pushing the
fake news
how aware of it are they don't you
wonder that
are they doing it completely
intentionally
or are they actually not sure what the
real news is
and anderson cooper in my opinion
again there's an interpretation that's
coming but in the way he dealt with
their objections
he was saying what you didn't see that
are you telling me that didn't happen
and they're like like it didn't happen
he's like seriously you're telling me
that didn't happen
and though and the genuine way he
responded
to that indicated to me it could be
wrong but it indicated
that he thought it really happened and i
thought my god
my god he thinks that actually happened
and so i had to go back and look at what
the president said
to figure out how somebody who does news
for a living
could believe that actually happened and
i figured out what the how they did the
trick
and it's the way they did uh there are
at least
four other hoaxes that fall into the
same
category all you have to do is edit the
video
so you're taking out a clarifier you
just remove
the clarifier if it comes before or
after the statement
so they did the same trick with the find
people hoax
they edit out the part where trump says
i'm not talking about the
white nationalists and neo-nazis they
should be condemned completely if you
take that out
it does look like he was praising the
the racist
which is why he clarified
they just take the clarification out and
even he was aware
that it could be misunderstood and so
he clarified and then they just added
out the clarification
uh but they did the same trick for the
uh the overfeeding the japanese koi fish
all they do is lop off the part where
his host
uh shinzo abe if i pronounce it right
did the same thing by dumping the rest
of the food in there
so trump was just doing what he did but
if you don't see that context it looks
like
trump's just being a jerk and throwing
all the food in there
and then the george floyd case is it is
slightly different but it's instructive
video can't tell you that george floyd
had a fentanyl overdose in him
and it was going to kill him no matter
what video doesn't show that
so if you show a video that can't show
the central variable that mattered
which was was he going to die anyway is
that why he couldn't breathe
turns out that's the case so that video
is fake
somewhat accidentally it's sort of
organically fake
because it can't show you the inside of
anybody's chemistry
video doesn't do that so you believe
with your own eyes what you saw but of
course you're fooled
because the video is misleading but
here's how they did the
drinking disinfectant and or that that
morphed into drinking bleach
and i looked at it again and i and i
played a few videos
and i was like holy cow they did it
again
so here's what they do to
to pull off that trick so
prior to trump mentioning
the injecting disinfectant the immediate
conversation before that was
light used as a disinfectant
now if you take out the context that was
light
as a disinfectant initially talking
about outside the body
it was trump who talked about moving
that idea inside the body
uh if you take out the first part of the
concept you're confused
then to make matters worse later trump
uses the word disinfectant
they also cut off the end where he
brought it back to light
to clarify that he was talking about
light
so they take out the first part where
the context is light
as a disinfectant using specifically the
word disinfectant
so that when you see disinfectant as a
word
in the in the part that they do show you
it's out of context
because now you think it's two different
things and i know that that's true
because people in the comments said hey
i heard it with my own ears i saw it
with my own eyes
he said disinfectant not light
disinfectant if you didn't know the
context you would think those were two
different things
if you see that he finishes talking
about light
and it's introduced talking about light
as a disinfectant
you see it differently also if you don't
know
that in the news there was a a specific
high-tech company that was testing
literally injecting in a ventilator
light into your trachea maybe into your
lungs if they can figure out how to do
it
as a disinfectant if you didn't know
that
and the fake news will never report that
you would not know it was a thing and
therefore that context would be missing
so now of course
this hoax would be debunked if
the fake if the fake news ever showed
you
that uh the same week the president
mentioned
this light as a disinfectant it was in
the news
and not only was it in the news but his
some of his biggest supporters online
were tweeting about it
you know big blue check pro-trump
accounts were tweeting about this exact
thing so
do you think that trump notices or his
staff notices and brings it to his
attention
when there's something important that
might be optimistic might be good news
about the coronavirus
do you think his staff doesn't mention
that to him if
if his supporters are chatting about it
and it's a real thing and it's in the
news
of course of course of course they're
going to tell him that there's some
potential good news brewing
that's exactly what he wants to hear he
needs to hear the bad news too
but of course he wants to hear that
there's potential good news
is there any chance he didn't hear that
before talking about it
well anything's possible but not much
chance
given that he spoke to it specifically i
mean he was
it's pretty obvious that's what he's
talking about
and so i remind you that video lies
nothing lies as well as video
so if you say to yourself anytime you
anytime you hear these statements are
you saying that's false
i saw it with my own eyes or are you
saying that's false
i heard it with my own ears or i watched
him say it
if you see any of those statements
that's somebody who saw a fake
edited video because they can't
understand
how they saw something with their own
eyes and
until people are sophisticated enough
to know what the fake news is doing
because it's you know it seems
intentional at this point
until you reach that level of
sophistication you're just locked in
your little silo
and you can't get out um
yes thank you for noticing i am back in
my house and my house
is safe so i got lucky because the um
i was within walking distance of the
fire evacuation zone
i wasn't walking distance to the fire
but the evacuation zone you know
is ahead of the fire so that that got as
close as i could get
that was pretty scary so
i'm glad that worked out
yes so speaking of spying
i have a guest tomorrow on periscope if
my technology works
uh george papadopoulos will be joining
me
live on periscope tomorrow morning usual
time
and he's got he's got a book out we'll
talk about that but
um i don't know why it feels to me
see if you have the same feeling it
feels to me as if
george papadopoulos isn't getting enough
attention
for how much he knows about this story
so i'm gonna fix that a little bit
um because it was reported as fake news
that uh there was spying on the trump
campaign the
the fake news still reports that like it
didn't happen
or they still reported like they had
perfectly good reasons
to you know be looking into stuff which
is amazing
it's amazing that there's still people
who believe that but
maybe george papadopoulos will give us a
little context
uh and we'll talk to him if the
technology works
you know i always have a little trouble
taking guests on periscope
but we'll we'll we'll we'll push through
it
all right that's all for now i'll talk
to you
later
