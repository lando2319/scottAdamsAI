good morning everybody and welcome to
coffee with Scott Adams the highlight of
human
civilization yeah I'm a little
discombobulated I started an hour early
because I read the clock wrong and then
I started late because I stopped looking
at the clock it's that kind of a day but
otherwise it's going to be
great if you'd like to take this
experience up to levels that nobody can
even understand with their tiny human
brains all you need is a cup or mug or
glass a tanker chalice or Stein a
canteen jug or a flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure of the dopamine head
of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous SI happens
now M savor it savor
it
well have you heard of uh project
Lazarus it's a project to use AI to take
over your social media accounts after
you die and just keep tweeting and it
will even age your profile
picture that's right so now if you die
you can still do social media
no problem but uh some Anonymous person
on the project uh is a little worried
that it's taking a dark turn because
apparently it's a little bit too
good so now the AI can make a perfect
reproduction of you and it can post
things just like you
would is that a dark
turn do you think that people have will
have ongoing
relationships with the
deceased I
do I think people are just going to keep
uh with their
partner I think that people's uh like
spouse will pass away and they're just
going to keep living with them they'll
just keep going on imagine you're
85 and your life is basically you walk
out to the living room your spouse is
sitting in a chair drinking some coffee
maybe you talk a little bit but
basically you're not going on big trips
and you're not you know you're not going
to the
gym what would be the difference between
that and walking into your living room
your TV comes on it's a perfect
reproduction of your spouse who died
last year and has a conversation with
you just like your spouse would
have and might might actually be more
interested in your problems than your
spouse
was what's going to keep people from
just continuing their existing
relationship now if you're you know 25
and your spouse dies you're you're going
to need you know some human touch and
stuff so you replace them but I think I
think a lot of people are just going to
continue living with the
dead and then eventually they'll Port
the dead into a robot body and just
reproduce their dead ones their loved
ones I don't know there might be
something important about our ability to
let go what if we lose our need to let
go I don't know could be an interesting
change might not be
good all right um I'm having a comment
problem on locals so I'm going to open
up my phone here just to look at their
comments on a separate
device which will totally
work sure sure it'll totally work no
problem and it's totally working all
right we're all good I can see all of
your comments
now uh all right the theme for today's
show is uh all of our systems are
designed in America all of our systems
are designed to promote the least
qualified
people do you think that's a general
thing or just sort of a little
problem well I'm going to develop the
idea that it's everything we're doing we
we went from a system that was designed
very specifically to promote the most
capable people to one which in every way
is designed to do the opposite now what
is the obvious outcome of that there's
only one way that ends up and let me let
me develop that a little bit let's take
schools so we have these things called
teachers
unions now the teachers have a little
bit different interests than the
children and the parents that's why you
have a teachers union because the
teachers have their own interests that
are not identical to their bosses or the
people who pay them so they have to have
their own protection now I'm in favor of
unions Al likee unions but if you have a
union in the context of teaching your
children that is a system designed to
maximize the teachers benefit and that
will be at the cost of the children's
capabilities
now why don't we have unions in the
military does anybody know why can't
soldiers join a
union all right it's such a stupid
question that you don't even need to
answer right like you don't even have to
think about it too much you're like a
union if if soldiers were in a union
they could just refuse orders and go on
strike yeah obviously right so you would
never have a union in a context where
your very life depends on it everybody
understands that right if your life
depends on it you don't want to have a
union getting in there with their Union
rules but what's the difference between
our education
system and our homeland
defense what's the difference well one
of them shoots bullets and blows things
up and the other trains children
but aren't they really the
same because if you don't train the
children the country will be you know
helpless and will be invaded and will be
destroyed if you do train the children
and they become very you know competent
and capable then they help your economy
improve and what's the number one thing
you need need to defend yourself um from
other countries number one thing is
money because if you have money you can
buy weapons
look at Ukraine right so the fact that
we separate our education system from
our military is a logical
mistake we do it because our brains
naturally put things in buckets so we
think oh training children that's a
different Bucket from the military but
it's not it it's a
Continuum training the children to build
a good economy to make them capable to
be in a military if they ever need to to
to make good decisions so you don't have
to send your military out it's all
connected so we have a system called
teachers unions which guarantee we do
not do the best job of teaching our
children then we've got uh Dei diversity
equity and inclusion which has infected
our uh our colleges our schools and our
corporations and now Dei of course is
well-intentioned
in my opinion well-intentioned meaning
that the whole point of it is to make
the world
better more inclusion better diversity
uh as long as things work the same you
get more diversity you win should be a
better world but intentions do not
necessarily translate to
design right if your design is the
opposite of your intention that's
mistake and in this case um I think we
would all agree that if you focus on on
uh diversity and inclusion and you even
have a staff members whose job it is to
make sure you do it you are going to
give up capability for diversity now you
won't plan to do it it would not be your
intention to do it but it would be a
necessity by because of math if
everybody's if everybody's going after
the same pool of diversity there just
won't be enough diverse people who are
also qualified for your specific job so
you're pretty much
guaranteed pretty much guarantee that
you're going to get lower quality
because of Dei so the teachers unions
guarantee it the Dei guarantees it how
about our current Mass illegal
immigration is mass illegal
immigration going to get you high
quality people compared to vetting
people and making sure they add things
and no obviously you know that's you
don't even need to answer the question
obviously the point of mass immigration
is not to increase the capability of the
citizens of the United States it does
add labor and I would say that the
second generation of these uh immigrants
could be quite high quality I love our
second generation the the second
generation are pretty awesome but you
know you you it's going to take a while
to get there so if you had enough first
generation can't speak English we're not
vetted can you pretty much guarantee
that at least for the next 10 or 20
years you're going to have lower
capability would you agree which which
has nothing to do with the the natural
nature of the immigrants is just the
system right if the system stops
checking people and lets everybody in
you don't get the same you know
qualified you know job Seekers that you
otherwise how about our presidential
system do we have a political system
which guarantees the best and the
brightest become your
leaders well let me say it this way no
matter how much you love
Trump you got to agree that if you could
get something like his policies without
the provocation you'd probably be in
better
shape but here we are it's going to be
Biden versus Trump trump which will make
50% of the country literally
insane and is your best choice I do
think he's your best choice of the two
now I'd still rather a v ramas Swami
because he he gives you all the goodness
without the
provocation so and he's younger which
matters to me
so do we have a system that guarantees
your best political candidate
or can you just look at it and say to
yourself uh it's kind of obvious that's
not what the system is doing whatever it
is that the system is doing is
definitely not choosing the best
candidates it's choosing candidates they
think they can win in the case of trump
candidates that you know touch them
emotionally also in the case of trump uh
candidates who just seem safe or maybe
they can control them through blackmail
maybe Biden I don't know maybe there's
some blackmail that's part of the part
of the process hard to say but you also
can't rule it
out so that's not good how about uh Tik
Tock and smartphones are they making us
more capable or less capable obviously
less they're they're making us stupid
and it's dividing the country so it's
making us less capable of being good
citizens who can work with each other to
good outcomes right and are we changing
it no no Tik tok's going to continue
continue smartphones will
continue and how about our health do we
have systems that are safeguarding our
health well not so much our I would say
that our food sources are compromised
meaning that too much sugar too much God
knows what kind of chemicals in our food
and I don't think that that's GE if your
food is compromised your physical health
is compromised and it's a straight line
to your your mental health and your
physical capabilities are compromised so
do we have a food system which is uh
going to promote capability or a food
system which is going to promote
sickness and poor mental health clearly
the food system is making us less
capable how about our
uh yeah all right so th those are just
some few examp examples to give you some
board as we go but I'm not
wrong I'm not wrong we sort of drifted
accidentally into every one of our major
systems that we rely on to be healthy
and to have leadership and economics
every one of them we've
polluted with bad ideas that were often
well-intentioned yeah so let me say it
again if you could get diversity for
free I'd be all over it of course of
course I do want I do want our
businesses and our organizations to
roughly look like the country I think
that's a good thing but you don't want
to give up too much to to buy that right
and that's the problem you might give up
too much to get it too
quickly all right how
about uh how do people feel about
leadership um I would like to see if my
um see if my audience is so smart that
you can get the answer to the question I
haven't even asked yet before I ask it
Go the answer to the question before I
ask the question you don't even know a
category this
is that is correct the answer is
25% do you want to hear the question or
doesn't it
matter because you have the
answer yeah well rasim did a poll and
they they asked uh us voters if they
believe in their lifetime the overall
quality of America's political leaders
have gotten worse 75% said yes in my
lifetime the political leadership has
gotten worse that means 25% of the
country has either not noticed it's
gotten worse or believes that it's
gotten better or declined to
answer now how many of you when you
first heard me
say that most of our polls have 25% of
the respondents have the dumbest
answer in the world just the dumbest
answer it doesn't matter what the poll
is
25% a good solid 25% are going to give
you the dumbest answer you've
ever heard in your life yeah I think our
leadership's fine it's doing great best
I've ever
seen who who sees that come
on all
right
um oh I see a question here in the
comments on locals what came first Trump
or or the controversy I would agree that
it's not so much Trump who caused his
own problems um you know the Democrats
painted Trump in a in a way that causes
the problems but he is
unique in that the way he he speaks
speaks and acts makes it a little bit
easier if you compare that to the way V
speaks and acts V can say things and
actually is we'll talk about that saying
things that are even more provocative
than Trump by far actually if you look
at what VI said just this week he's way
more provocative than Trump do you know
why it's not a number one news story
about all the crazy stuff that V said do
you know why it's not a news story
because the left is scared as
because he can explain his provocative
opinion so well
Trump trump speaks like his
Bas and that's great for you know
getting them to love you because he
speaks the way they do SI very simple
terms keep it easy the wind stops
blowing my TV goes off okay that's not
technically accurate but you get the
idea right so Trump's more of a you get
the idea you know what I'm saying and
you feel it so that's how he
communicates It's very effective very
effective but it leaves him open to
attack because if he's taking the sort
of simple emotional truth and I and I
believe he's close to the truth even
when he's using emotion to persuade um
it's very easy to attack from an
intellectual perspective because you say
well he's not defending that that well
but then you you introduce a
v similar or even more provocative
statements and you do not want to put
him on television on
MSNBC and let the Democrats hear him
speak I'm surprised he's gotten as much
play as he has on the on the left you
know CNN's had him on a few times to
their credit so let me give let me give
some let me give CNN some um complete
credit
they've had for Von and they' let him
talk so I'm going to give them credit
for
that uh anyway so I just wanted to say
that uh the uh pentagon's effort to
crack down on extremism you know the
extremism all that white supremacy that
was in the military well they looked for
it man they studied it they searched and
they search for the white supremacy
that's uh ruining the military and you
know what they found after all that
searching
it's really no different than the public
at
large in other words it was an illusion
there was never any
excess white supremacy in the military
no but uh did they decide that they
didn't find it so they're done no no
they're doubling down they're going to
look harder they're going to look twice
as hard now now what do you think uh
happens to the Readiness of the military
when you start dividing them by I don't
know I think you might be an extremist
or a white
supremacist well uh the dod Department
of Defense
um is starting to feel it might be
causing greater feelings of alienation
and hostility so in other words the
military system which they implemented
to get rid of white supremacy which
would be what well-intentioned
well-intentioned I don't want to see any
white supremacy in my
military none I want to see Zero way
Supremacy in my military none good
intention but bad system because it
turns out there wasn't much there to
look for so if you've got a system
that's causing alienation and Division
and it's not finding any problems that
it was trying to solve it makes things
worse so once again we have a system
that by its
design will reduce the quality of our
military by its design so as long as
they're chasing diversity in the
military and trying to root out with
things that don't
exist you don't get a good outcome so
now you got your schools are ruined by
the teachers unions you got your Dei
ruining corporations in the government
you've got Mass illegal immigration
ruining the capability of people coming
in or lower the average you've got your
presidential system that gives you a
vegetable as the major candidate I mean
let's face it Biden's basically a
vegetable at this point you've got uh
food supply that's making us unhealthy
smartphones and Tik Tock that are making
us stupid and biased and in military
this biased design is reducing the
equality of the um
forces how bad is wokeness well uh do
you know a publication called Atlantic
which is famous for being super Lefty
anti-
Republican apparently they allowed uh
writer John
mcarter who uh I'm pretty sure is black
um to write a negative article about
Robin D'Angelo's book uh uh what is it
uh uh anti antifragile right so
antifragile is one of these you know
woke books and the Atlantic actually had
a ran a piece in which um John
McCarter responding to some criticism of
his criticisms uh posted this today
apparently the uh author Robin D'Angelo
said that she was being criticized by
somebody who is as a as right-wing as or
as conservative as Clarence Thomas and
Ben
Carson and mcarter says about that uh
I'm quote very conservative like clar
Thomas and Ben Carson she has clearly
read barely a word of my work at least
when I slammed her book I had read every
word and I m i maintained that I'm sorry
it was white fragility I had the books
wrong anti what is anti fragile is is
that somebody else's book is that
candi's book I'm confusing it was some
other book um oh antifragile is talib's
book yeah Nasim Talib all right so go
back the book is white
fragility white
fragility okay and that's sort of a a
woke book obviously an anti-white
book so mcarter says at least when I
slammed your book he he'd read every
word of it and then he goes on he says
that white fragility is literally the
worst book ever written it's so bad it's
an
achievement just hold this in your
head that wokeness has jumped the shark
so much that even
Atlantic will run a major piece against
a book which is you know one of the
foundations of wokeness uh from a black
writer who isn't as conservative as
Clarence Thomas and Ben Carson
apparently but uh I feel like that's I
feel like the fact that this even
happened is telling us
something it is telling us that at least
you can say what you're thinking about
the topic of wokeness and Dei and all
that and that's that's an improvement
because I don't think it was even a year
ago you could even speak honestly you
should see the things that V is saying
this week there's not a thing he said
this week that you could have even said
out loud a couple years ago you would
have been canceled immediately but now
you now we say okay that's actually a
pretty good point and you could say that
out loud now big difference
well
uh I don't know what to call him uh what
do you call
zubie
musician um
philosopher he he's impossible to
characterize he has so many skills you
know zubie so you might know him from
social media well zubie uh says that
social media is reducing people's social
skills and attention spans
and he says that he's been talking to
people for basically his job is you know
if you could call it a job it's the best
career ever uh he goes around he travels
a lot and he talks to
people he he really has the best job he
goes around he talks to people and then
he creates content out of it probably it
influences his music influences his
political opinions and everything else
but he says the average person is uh um
less social and less competent post
scamdemic he calls
it have you noticed that people are less
socially capable since the pandemic how
many of you have noticed that
change because I definitely am yeah I
I've said this before but I completely
lost what I would call a social
Instinct do you know what I mean by that
a social instinct now that doesn't mean
I'm going to treat people poorly I hope
I mean I hope I've have not accidentally
done that but I don't have like a
drive and I can't I thought it was just
me so you know I've told you before I I
can spend two to three days a week
without seeing another person in person
at all not not a word of in-person
contact two or three days a week and for
a while it was bothering me because you
can feel it's unhealthy you you can just
feel it like on your body and your brain
like even at 24 hours without talking to
another person you feel a little
unhealthy and then the moment somebody
comes into your life you have like any
kind of good interaction you feel
healthy like it's just
noticeable but
uh I wonder if the loneliness is what's
killing people as much as any other
cause of which we could mention
many because I feel like the loneliness
is like
lethal like not at the level I
experience it but I feel like a little
bit more of it could kill
me that's what it feels like it feels
like it could just kill
me um but I also got used to it so I
agree with zuie on
that um but at least if you've got all
these problems at least you can go get
therapy am I
right thank goodness the system of
mental health care in this country is
vibrant and it works every
time right right no uh well yes we don't
really have any mental health um system
for the people who are in the worst
shape but you know we know we we can't
involuntarily put them in in
institutions but at least the average
people who can afford to go to a
therapist at least they're getting super
good service from the therapists who are
trained to what that's not
right well okay um well Jonathan hate
posted this today he said I wish I had
not resigned from the APA I guess that's
must be the associ
association American psychologist
Association so it's a group of
psychologists so he's he wishes he
hadn't resigned from it in 2021 do you
know why he wishes he hadn't resigned so
he could do it
now that's right in your face he wishes
he could design he could resign from
them
twice because they've been infected by
wokeness and uh apparently they're
introducing the concept of colonizers
into the therapy model so that you can
know if the real problem is you've got
some bipolar or maybe you maybe a little
some some or uh are you a victim of
colonizers is it really a victim
oppressor oppressor and uh victim kind
of model so apparently even therapy is
going to be ruined by uh wokeness so we
have a system that if you have mental
problems we can make them
worse is your employee Andor your
spouse if they go to therapy do they
come back better or they come back
worse your coworker or your spouse goes
to therapy they come back better or they
come back worse now I've only been in
one form of it it was uh marriage
counseling for my first my first
marriage definitely made it
worse I never could have guessed that
marriage counseling could make things
worse but it definitely did definitely
did now I don't know if that's common
but for the other therapies I'm sure the
therapy is number one well intentioned
everybody agree I don't think anybody
goes into the therapy job with bad
intentions good intentions but if the
system is to allow in the victim uh
oppressor model you're not going to get
a good result you're not and I have a
feeling that might have snuck into my
situation because I think I might have
been an oppressor in that
context that's what it felt like
anyway uh I told you that uh
Forbes Magazine it's kind of a magazine
still uh did a hit piece on me they used
to be a credible magazine but now
they're just ridiculous garbage um and I
had to look into the ownership of it for
a while it was owned by a Hong Kong
based company so I said to myself aha
it's China China doesn't like me so
they're making Forbes right bad things
about me but that's not the case so the
Hong Kong Bas thing sold its Holdings to
a 28-year-old rich guy CEO of luminar
Technologies so
Forbes like the Washington
Post like
Atlantic owned by a rich guy
or an a rich woman in the case of
Atlantic so why do rich people buy major
Publications that do not look like they
could ever make a
profit no nobody would buy any of these
assets to make money you just wouldn't
do it nobody's that
dumb why do you do it well you do it for
influence don't
you I don't know of any other reason let
me ask you this what was the
Forbes uh opinion on climate change uh
up until
recently traditionally let's say last 20
years what was the Forbes view on
climate
change what was Steve
Forbes view on climate
change
skeptical skeptical yeah uh I don't I
don't want to be the one who
characterizes Steve Forbes opinion on
climate
change
um but I would say that he he might have
been uh not
alarmist not alarmist how about the new
guy well the new guy apparently has
donated money to both parties so he's
donated to both Republicans and
Democrats but not much so he's not a big
donor but he's spread around to both
sides which makes sense he's just a good
business
person um but he is uh so he doesn't
advertise his political leanings except
that one of his main concerns we know
from a 2018 article was climate
change right so somebody who is not
political but says his biggest concern
is climate change now owns
Forbes what's my opinion on climate
change probably really close to Steve
Forbes
skeptical skeptical of model
skeptical that um you know it's not for
the benefit of
China skeptical that you know going
completely green too fast is a good idea
you know maybe you should phase into it
so I probably I this just a guess
because I don't know this to be true but
probably if Steve Forbes and I sat down
and talked about climate change there'd
probably be not much
difference how about if I sat down with
the new owner of Forbes
and we talked about climate change if
it's as bigest issue I doubt he's
skeptical about
it so now remember I told you if you
don't know the players nothing makes
sense do you think that Steve Forbes
would have allowed an article um that's
basically a hitpiece about
me you want to know something I
shouldn't tell
you
for several years Steve Forbes asked me
personally to sign my books as Christmas
gifts for members of his
family which I did which I don't do by
the way in case you're you thought oh
I'll send you a book and you'll sign it
I'm not going to do it I will throw the
book in the trash but it was Steve
Forbes and I always like Steve Forbes so
I thought oh Steve Forbes I don't know
him personally but I thought you know if
he wants my books for his family I want
his books to have my I want his family
to have my books so I signed them a few
times now do you see how important the
players
are it's the players yeah yeah if you
read the news and you believe you're
reading news that somebody objectively
thought oh I think this is the important
thing that the you know my audience
needs to see
sometimes but lots of times it depends
who who owns the the product
right so uh I think C fors is still
involved in some ways but uh obviously
the CEO would be the boss all right um
there's some uh controversy about
Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of
Fame is that what it is so in Hollywood
you know they put your star in the
sidewalk and some people want to have it
removed but I don't think you should
have it removed moved I would um I think
has a more use a bigger
use I think your therapist could take
you down to that
sidewalk and point you to the star and
say I have two
questions how do you feel about your
mother and what do you think about this
star and then you would know all of
their mental
illnesses so you can use the Trump Star
as a way of diagnosing mental illness
uh-huh so when you look at the star you
see Hitler musolini po pot
Stalin and
Thanos
okay okay yeah that's all you would need
to diagnose somebody these mentalness so
I think they should use it for that it's
kind of a important asset well speaking
of uh
Trump uh CNN is still talking about his
Christmas message that all the losers
should rot in hell which was one of the
funniest things he's ever said because
if you take it in a context it sounds
like Hitler molini but if you see it in
context it's just
funny and it's you know it's on it's on
message and you know it's something he's
been doing for I don't know 15 years or
something how long has he been doing
message well before he ran for president
the first time he was doing things like
uh you know Merry Christmas except to
the losers or something so he always
does
this but the CNN had Debbie Dingle on to
look offended now Debbie Dingle if you
don't know what she looks like uh just
imagine a poor man's an EEG
Carol uh or what egene Carol look like
if she'd been like sick for a couple
weeks so that's what just so you have
the visual but if I were in charge of uh
nicknames uh what would you call Debbie
Dingle it's got to be
dingleberry it's got to be
dingleberry
yeah that's all I'm going to say about
that like I I'm not in charge of
nicknames but if you could look at a
Debbie Dingle and you come up with any
Nick nickname that isn't dingleberry
well you've done it
incorrectly you need to go back and
adjust your work
and uh you people who are not Native
American speakers I'll give you a few
minutes to look that
up in in the urban uh in the urban slang
dictionary uh I found out today from a
post by DC
Dro that Russian uh
textbooks teach history to their
students and in Russia they learn that
uh the 2020 election was
rigged was rigged for Joe Biden and that
Biden's family has corrupt commercial
interest in
Ukraine that's right in
Russia they teach in
school that it's a fact that the 2020
election was rigged and it's a
fact that uh that Biden is uh corrupt
that's what they learned in
school
now I happen to think that's
true I happen to think that's true let
me be very clear I'm not aware of any
evidence whatsoever that the 2020
election was rigged I'm not aware of any
evidence of it whatsoever I've not seen
anything that I consider proof of
that and I also believe that Biden was
elected
by our American system so I
congratulated them on day one and have
never changed that because even if the
system is
corrupt it it it worked the way the
corrupt system works and got as a result
and so I accepted it because I don't
know maybe it was always corrupt I've
accepted all the other
presidents
but uh I'm going to say the
obvious if you believe that every
American System an institution was
corrupt except for our
elections I just want to hear you say
that out
loud see if you get here here's a
challenge for you for New Year's when
you get together with your relatives see
if you can get a Democrat to say out
loud that they do understand that all of
our other systems are corrupt because
most people can see that but that they
believe that the elections are the one
shining example of non-c corruption in
our country in which everything else is
corrupt I just want to see somebody say
it out loud in like a complete
sentence you know what they'll say
instead no court found any
problems that's
right
um so um did you know that uh before the
1990s
the rural voters in America and City
voters they voted about the same wasn't
that much difference between country
people and city Folk but around the mid
uh or early 90s actually but close to
the mid90s there was a big boot big
change and suddenly the lines
diverged and Country folk became more
Republican and city Folk became more
Democrat now what do you think caused
that
everything was going long stably and
then mid 90s boom big change what
happened you're blaming it on Bill
Clinton on racism cable news well I'll
give you two dates that I think are
relevant to this Fox News started in
1996 the exact year that the Gap uh
widened uh Rush limbo started new Radio
Show in
1988 was it a gigantic impact the the
year he
started not
exactly probably not I mean I don't
remember but I don't think it was
probably took him a few years to ramp up
to become the The Rush that you knew and
loved so mid 90s you had Rush limbo and
Fox
News uh entering the persuasion
game remember when I told you that our
opinions are assigned to us here it is
you don't have to
wonder it's really obvious as soon as
there was there were new entities that
were credible enough that a lot of
people watched them they their opinions
were assigned to them and they accepted
them so it's pretty much just that yeah
it's pretty much just
that
um
there is a uh
study to try to see if they can identify
fake news just by the the semantic
information so is there some some kind
of algorithm you could run against a
news story that would find out if it's
fake just by the way it's
constructed now you see any problem with
that do do you think there'd be any risk
if we developed an algorithm that could
spot fake
news could anything go wrong with
that
yeah the last thing we need is a secret
algorithm for finding fake news I can't
think of anything that's a worse idea oh
yeah yeah yeah we our technology spotted
some fake
news well how did that work like how did
it Spot It Well semantics and stuff well
could be more specific well yes it's the
order of the
semantics okay that's still not well
it's the specific order of the semantics
which we run against a filter that's
based on patterns which are taken from a
large language model which we run
through some other filters and then a
Transformer and then we get the
answer uh I don't understand any of
those words which you just said now
don't worry worry about it we just told
you it's fake news it's fake
news well how do I know that's true you
idiot look at what the fact Checkers say
just check the fact Checkers the fact
Checkers who are Democrats just like we
are and only want our side of the thing
to show they agree with me so there's
proof well I'm not sure I could believe
those fact Checkers and I'm not even
sure I could believe your
algorithm well if you're not going to
believe that would you at least believe
the New York Times because the New York
Times agrees with the fact Checker which
agrees with us and just because they're
all Democrats who want Trump to
die I think that's a coincidence you
just have to look at the you know all of
these things pointing in the same
direction I mean where there's smoke
there's
fire yeah the last thing we need is a
secret algorithm for finding fake news
because that's going to be corrupt in
about 10 seconds
uh Nikki hilly had a uh let's say
suboptimal uh weekend or yesterday I
guess um she was asked about the cause
of the Civil
War which made her laugh because it's
not exactly a normal campaign question
but you know what it
is it's kind of a
layup it was kind of a softball question
wasn't it what was the cause of the
Civil
War allow me to take a crack at
it well the cause of the Civil War of
course slavery was a a a base concern
but of course historians will tell you
there were there were other uh there
were
other um variables as well such as
Lincoln wanting to you know keep the
country together and such as you know
different economic interests Etc but yes
slavery was at the core of that but was
not the you know whole story how' I
do
okay everybody happy with that answer
yeah you know even if you
disagreed yeah it's reasonable for a
politician to say yeah slavery was a big
part of it but you know other interests
as
well what did Nikki Haley
say um she summarized it and said well
it's really about what government can
and cannot
do what
yeah it's sort of about you know big
government versus small government you
know she didn't say that but she tried
to give sort of generic
non-answer you know and then people took
that as she either doesn't understand
the legacy of slavery which of course
she does it was basically just one of
these gotcha things but speaking of
gotas uh before she you know as part of
her answer she said quote what do you
want me to say about
slavery uh in other words she was trying
to figure out what slavery had to do
with her current run for president so
that's a reasonable question right well
what do you want me to say about slavery
sort of like what's I got to do with our
conversation but V robas Swami quotes
her in a post where she says what do you
want me to say about slavery he quotes
her and then he says I think she mistook
uh the person in the audience for a
super pack
donor that's pretty good what do you
want me to say ask your donors what what
they want you to say pretty good VI all
right I don't think that's an important
story but it's happening Glenn Greenwald
pointed out that CNN went easy on her
because you know she's part of the
military industrial complex he's uh he's
suggesting all right uh AOC was uh doing
some crazy video live streaming about
the border and she said it's not an
immigration crisis it's an imperialism
crisis it's a climate crisis and it's a
trade crisis that's right if you fix the
climate
imperialism and
trade and of course you're also going to
have to get rid of white
supremacy she mentioned if you get rid
of those things immigration just takes
care of itself so
so we don't have an immigration problem
we got a white people
problem a lot of white people
problem uh I may be interpreting it that
way yeah she's crazy and worthless and
uh getting back to my theme about the
quality of our leaders does AOC she's
very persuasive I always say but does
she seem like a qualified
leader I don't think so being persuasive
isn't good enough she's uh I don't think
she's
even I'm not even sure she has good
intentions really I mean she might I
can't read her mind but it doesn't it's
not obvious that she has good
intentions um there are a lot of people
who would agree with her that are more
obvious that they're coming from a place
of good intentions but this is crazy
 this just looks like uh she's mad
at her father or she's mad at white
people or something like why would you
throw in imperialism climate crisis
trade and white supremacy into a uh
unguarded border question there's just
you're either
sick uh or so political you're useless
or you're
incompetent or you're just a racist or
all of the above I think she's
incompetent and a racist is my best
guess but that's our current system uh
elected her because of her great quality
right do you remember why she got
elected because she was female and she
also tried
hard she wore on her sneakers because
she tried hard CU people were really
excited to see a woman try
hard I hate to say it but that's what it
was she's female and she tried really
hard and that was good enough
wow she's young and female and she tried
really
hard all right um latest on Ukraine is
that the rumors are that the Biden
Administration wants to start some kind
of negotiating an end to it and of
course if they did that the end would
look
like uh some limits on NATO expansion
probably uh Russia keeping the stuff
that they already got probably and it's
going to look exactly like Elon Musk
said it would
look before they killed so many people
do you remember how much trouble uh Elon
muscot for suggesting maybe they should
work it out before they just mindlessly
kill each other but everybody said no no
much better to mindlessly kill each
other let let's just keep mindlessly
killing each other and so that's what
they did but they're going to end up
right back where the smart people like
David sax and El musk and other people
said they would uh it's going to
look exactly like it looks now no NATO
Russia keeps those places now I think
we'll find a a way to make the obvious
not happen yeah the obvious solution is
you just work it out and you do it
quickly so since that's obvious and it's
smart we'll find some way not to do it
um how's our immigration doing our
Immigration Court has a backlog of uh
more than three million
cases three million people according to
our system need to be interviewed to
find out if they're really coming across
because of uh they're like What's the
word uh political refugees what's the
word Asylum are they really legitimate
Asylum Seekers or they come in here for
work three billion of them so I ask you
again again are the systems in this
country designed to increase the
capability of our Workforce and our
people or to decrease it well if you've
got a court that can't even look at
Asylum cases it is clearly by Design not
intention but by Design to make us less
capable what else could happen I there's
no other way it could go so that's the
design design his
Destiny all right how's uh Biden bomic
coming uh let's see stocks are up uh
inflation is you know prices are still
higher than we want but at least the
rate seems to be down in the reasonable
level at the moment uh gas prices are
lower than the highest but they're much
higher than the
lowest uh job growth is not
bad uh unemployment not
bad but as uh Michael shellenberger
points out today uh real wages are down
so workers have less
money and interest rates are high which
has the effect of giving you less money
because if you want to buy a house it'll
cost you more so how would you net this
out is if you take the net is the
economy good or bad because you do have
people have jobs that's good prices are
not going up out of control that's
good but people have less buying power
well I think the less buying power was
was baked into the model right inflation
was guaranteed for a while interest
rates will probably come down so here's
how I would say you should look at
it it depends entirely upon which of
these things you think or
temporary if you think interest rates
are coming down and the FED seems to be
signaling that then we might you know be
uh let's say gliding back into a better
situation I tend to think that we're in
good shape except for the debt that I
have no idea how we'll ever handle it un
unless we can figure out with robots and
AI how to boost our productivity so
much that you know that inflation gets
eaten up by productivity maybe but
everything we're doing so far seems to
be to make all of our productivity worse
instead of
better all right
um let's uh look at the lawfare
situation remember Brandon straa he was
the leader of the Walk Away movement
meaning walk away from the Democrats and
consider Trump well he attended the uh
the January 6 events he did not go
inside did not go inside the capital and
he did not hurt anybody so he did no
violence uh and he did not go inside the
capital but he not only um was
threatened with jail but he was sued by
some of the police officers including uh
this one Byron Evans and he was sued
under the KKK act alleging that that uh
brand that Brandon had violated his
civil rights and conspired with white
supremacists to commit assault and
battery holy
 I had no idea that that happened
did you know that this poor guy got sued
under the
KKK act for
discrimination was there anything about
January 6 that had to do with race
in fact January 6 was the most pure
non-racial event in the history of the
United States we've never had an event
that that that was that completely
non-racial do you look at the uh The
Defenders at the
capital did we not see white and black
and Asian and Hispanic Defenders of the
capital working arm in-arm
together that's what I
saw what was anybody in the crowd saying
anything
racial
no
nothing there it just wasn't even part
of the
conversation this was the least racial
event of all time you you can make
almost everything else racial because we
do that with our news and everything
else you can make everything else racial
but there was nothing there was nothing
in January 6 that was racial at all that
was purely about you know the Integrity
of the vote that was it so just watching
this is
mindblowing that this poor guy who
became influential you know in politics
was taken down by you know first a
criminal charge and then a lawsuit
that's just plainly ridiculous
absolutely ridiculous
insane well who else is in trouble let's
say
uh um so James o'keef you know is
undercover of videos he's now running
his own operation OMG so axios is
reporting that a Manhattan judge has
denied project
Veritas First Amendment
claims other words uh when before he was
OMG O'Keefe was um the had of project
very us and apparently they're not going
to get protections as journalists with
First Amendment
rights
wow um but what this means is that
prosecutors are going to be able to look
at it a thousand documents uh related to
the alleged theft of Ashley Biden's
diary so that was the case that trigger
this um and I guess project Veritas is
claiming
it was somebody else who stole them so
they were just acting as
journalists um but uh at the moment it
looks like we might see a lot of
documents related to that so I don't
know if that's good or
bad all right uh the New York Times says
you know is suing uh open AI in
Microsoft because it says Chad
GPT is stealing their stuff I didn't
know how bad it was until uh the New
York Times gave examples so New York
Times gave a 100
examples uh you know obviously there
would be infinite more but they just
picked a 100 for their legal case here
and they found a 100 cases where if you
asked
um
uh
huh interesting
um you said
uh oh so the New York times tested and
they asked chat GPT some questions and
then they saw how many times chat GPT
gave a Verbatim answer from an article
in the New York Times without mentioning
that it's a Verbatim answer from The New
York Times and it's a lot so why does it
do
that why does Chad GPT take entire
sections and plagiarize them in effect
plagiarize them from the New York Times
when it has access to so many sources
why why would it pick one source sort of
preferentially
well I I'm going to Hazard a
guess why do you think they don't use
Fox News
preferentially it must be programmed to
favor uh to favor what somebody would
imagine our high credibility
left leaning Publications now the New
York Times would be among the left their
greatest standard of
credibility among people in the
political right that would be seen as a
joke am I right if you talk to somebody
who's very involved in politics and very
informed on the left they will tell you
that the New York Times is not perfect
it's not perfect it's got some things
wrong but it's it's the standard for
news
will they not they'll tell you it's a
standard for news if you talk to anybody
in the right they will laugh and say
it's just political is basically just
brainwashing and propaganda right now
I'm not saying which one is
right I'm saying that somebody had to
pick which one was right or some budes
so I'm assuming the obvious that
somebody who has programming control
over chat GPT decided on their own own
maybe with some of their co-workers that
the New York Times was very credible and
that they want their AI to be as
credible as possible so I should give it
a little extra consideration
but since AI is not
programmed completely in detail and it
gets to sort of do its own thing based
on patterns it's no surprise that it
favored patterns coming from one source
that was a favored source so I assume
that's what's going on so
um under the
circumstances I think I agree with the
New York Times on this would you agree
if it's
true that the AI routinely just quotes
verbatim the New York Times I think the
New York Times
has absolutely has a case and you know
you know what else is really
funny uh apparently Apple uh Apple has
has very quietly and cleverly started
paying for its uh training sources for
its AI is building and and it's paying a
lot so in in order in other words in
instead of just scraping somebody's
content the way it looks like chat GB
did Apple is saying may we uh may we
train our AI in your content and then
the owner says well for a certain price
and then they say what is that price and
then they pay
it so apple is making chat GPT look like
criminals because Apple without even
requiring to pay there's no law that
says I have to pay yet I I imagine there
will be but they're they're getting aead
of the law by doing the ethical thing so
let me stop for a moment uh I sometimes
uh compliment and sometimes criticize
Apple this is
smart is ethical
and it's
smart they just said if it's going to go
this direction we want to be on record
as being the ones who paid for it you
know we we want to pay our bills
absolutely respect that good choice
apple good
choice so yeah I expect the New York
Times is going to win that and probably
it means that uh Microsoft pays them a
lot of money unless they can unprogram
that um at the same time US senators
Chris Coons and Marshall Blackburn are
trying to figure out what to do about uh
fake music so they've got they're
drafting a some legislation the no fakes
act that would not allow you to use AI
to create music that comes too closely
from any specific artist and I guess
this became more important because there
was a gigantic viral video that went
around of some fakes of uh
Drake and the weekend yeah
Drake now suppose you would asked me
Scott uh it looks like we're entering an
age where AI will pretend to be real
people and real
performers who would be the first artist
you would want to copy well you don't
want it to be an artist who is so
unpredictable and good that you don't
know what they're going to do you don't
know what they're going to do right well
who would be the artist who makes every
song sound like the song
before I got it
Drake yeah would you like me to give my
impression of every Drake
song I'm falling asleep as I make my own
song I think I'm bored I don't know why
anybody this is this I am the worst hip
hopper in the world even
though Scott likes hip-hop I like the
genre but I can't even understand why
anybody ever listened to drag I don't
get him at all now let me be consistent
with
my artistic
opinion
art is
subjective so the fact that I think
Drake has no Talent whatsoever
is irrelevant because that's on me
because Drake sells a lot of
music that guy sells a lot of music so
what can you conclude about that he's
very good right I I I hate to admit it
but if you sell that much music for that
many years and people are really happy
they bought it he is a great great
artist that's just the truth the the way
you can measure great art is people want
to pay for it year after year after year
they're going to pay for it and they do
they pay for it so if you use the most
objective and most reasonable standard
and indeed it's the standard I like
applied to me I don't want you to tell
me that Delbert is good or bad I want
you to tell me did people subscribe to
it did they buy the book did they want
the
calendar because that tells me what I
need to know I don't I don't need the
you know internal thoughts so Drake is
uh one of the greatest artists of all
time uh but uh he's probably the easiest
to
copy is that is that too far would you
agree with me that he's got to be the
easiest one to
copy
yeah anyway so no offense to Drake he's
actually
great um let's see what else is going
on
uh Jack Smith is trying to block uh
Trump's defense from offering any uh
defense that doesn't sound real does
it it doesn't sound like it could
possibly be
real that in public in front of all of
us he's trying to make sure that Trump
can't uh give a a
defense um so one of the things that
he's trying to block the jury from
hearing is that Trump requested
increased Capital Security and was
denied now if you were on the jury and
you're trying to figure out if Trump
were trying to take over the country or
not you know is he an
insurrectionist wouldn't you want to
know if he had tried to stop the
Insurrection and somebody stopped him
from stopping it I can't imagine what
would be more important now since I'm
not a lawyer and I'm not following this
as closely as I should am I missing the
point that because Smith is not charging
him for
Insurrection which is weird in itself
right is that is that true he's not
being charged specifically with
Insurrection if he's not being charged
with Insurrection is that the
justification that Smith is using for
why he can't defend himself against a
charge for
insurrection is that what's happening
because there's got to be a legal
argument for it right so he's saying
it's just off
point but if I were if I were the Trump
defense I would consider it completely
on point because it suggests it suggests
a frame of mind now is
the what exactly is the charge against
Trump for January six if it's not
Insurrection it's inciting
violence what is the charge
see it's all so sketchy in lawfare that
I can't even hold it in my head with
obstruction so charging him with
obstructing a government
process don't you think it would be uh
relevant to obstruction that he
tried to make sure the obstruction
didn't
happen that's the most relevant thing in
the
world that is so
relevant
now here's what here's what I take from
this uh I think we all understand that
the legal system is a you know a contest
where you're fighting as hard as you can
we all understand and we agree that the
defense can try everything that's legal
they they can just throw they can maybe
stretch the truth they can throw every
defense they can because we want we want
the best
defense we also think think that the
prosecutor can do the the strongest
prosecution that they do because you
want them to do that as
well but isn't there a bit of an ethical
problem if your prosecutor is trying to
take away the defense of the
defense that's a little different than
trying hard to convict
him that doesn't even look legitimate
not even a little bit it you you you
know in the legal profession there's the
con except that if you lied about one
thing uh on if you lied under oath about
one thing the jury is often
instructed that they can assume that the
person is a liar in general and may have
lied about the other things so a lie
about one thing in a coure setting is
reasonable to extend that to well maybe
they're a
liar what would you assume about
somebody who's doing something that at
least to our non-legal Minds looks
obviously
corrupt if Jack Smith would do one
obviously corrupt thing preventing Trump
from you know this part of his defense
and by the way if this defense actually
affected Smith's ability to get the
prosecution than it should be in if it
doesn't affect it then what's the
difference
it just looks illegitimate to me
so if uh Jack Smith can do one thing
that looks clearly
illegitimate it would be reasonable to
assume that the other things he's doing
are illegitimate and indeed they do look
illegitimate to
me all right
um Mike Ben is uh again showing us who
the players are
so let's see so there was a uh group
non uh non-government group behind the
lawsuit that removed Trump from the
Colorado ballot we think he'll that'll
probably get reversed but at the moment
Colorado Court said Trump can't be on
the
ballot who do you think is the biggest
donor to the group that removed through
the courts Trump from the ballot George
Soros and the head of the group says
that on on camera so you know it's it's
recorded um but says that uh the Soros
has never tried to get them to do
anything
specific so she wants you to know that
George Soros and nobody in his
organization ever said do this or don't
do that they just gave him money so
that's fine
right no no because it's uh this is a
Democrat who used to work for high rank
in Democrats it's obviously one of these
Democrat cutout groups everybody knows
what they're going to do you don't have
to tell them what to do because they
form to do the thing you want them to do
to be you know dirty tricksters against
Republicans
so she said uh to an interviewer I used
to be
political so she's tried to tell people
that she used to work in politics but
now she's in this non-government role
as a Democrat who used to work for
high-ranking Democrats who's taking
money from Soros to take Trump off the
ballot but you know what she used to be
political yeah yep she used to be
political there there was that one time
when she was
political it's exactly what it looks
like it is exactly what it looks
like amazing
all right
um and uh in her own documents uh they
call President Trump the most corrupt
president in American history but she's
not political no no no uh there's a
surgeon who's complaining that Dei has
infected medicine and led to a erosion
of quality of their
care
so we have a system of medicine that
guarantees you get less good medical
treatment because they're going to Value
diversity over capability certainly in
the uh medical schools they do that but
in even after Medical School apparently
they're doing that that's consistent
with my
theme
um yeah so uh let's see here's something
that V said that I don't I feel like you
couldn't have said two years ago and you
couldn't even say it unless you're as
good at defending yourself as m is he he
posted uh everyone agrees that
affirmative action in the NBA would ruin
basketball and affirmative action in the
NFL would ruin Football turns out that
affirmative action in The Sciences has a
similar effect uh this should surprise
no one well when he says this should
surprise no one how do I say that the
way I say it is design is Destin
yeah design is Destiny so they have a
design that guarantees they'll get uh
less good medical outcomes but what
about the NFL and the
NBA what does their design
guarantee the best
players yeah yeah the NBA and the NFL
are designed to get the best
players all right um here's one our
argument for vake over
Trump I'm pretty sure that a lot of
magga people are sick and TI of
diversity equity and uh inclusion and
the negative it has done to the country
and you know Trump's opposes those
things too but he doesn't oppose them
nearly as
elegantly as vake does so I would say
that depending where you place your
priorities for getting rid of wokeness
uh nobody's ever made a better argument
than VI and Trump's not the one to make
that argument because he uh he he he's
not so much the uh explainer as he is
the Persuader it's a different
skill all right
um and then V talk about January 6 so
he's involved on this from you know his
first impression was it was all bad uh
but the more more he finds out the more
his opinion changes so listen to this so
if a said this about January 6 uh if
you'd have told me nearly three years
ago when I was just a CEO that January 6
was an inside job I would have said
that's crazy talk it's not there is now
clear evidence that there was at the
very at the very least entrapment of
peaceful protesters similar to the fake
Gretchen Whitmer kidnapping plot and
countless other cases I think the
Brendan straa situation
tells you it's
illegitimate the FBI uh won't admit how
many undercover officers were in the
field on January 6 Capital police on
oneand fired rubber bullets and
explosives into a peaceful Cloud crowd
who they then willingly later allowed
into the capital that doesn't add up and
the actual evidence turns the prior
narrative upside down if the Deep state
is willing to manufacture a quote
Insurrection to take down his political
opponents they can do do
anything once you see it you can't unsee
it that is correct for January 6 has
always been an op and not by Republicans
it was a Democrat op from the beginning
and uh now it's obvious but if you get
outside of our little political bubble
you know the bubble of people who watch
live streams like this and pay attention
nobody knows this
stuff nobody really knows who the
players are they don't know who owns
what magazine they don't know which ones
are typically organs of the CIA they
don't know any of that they're just
reading what their team says and then
adopting that opinion but uh V is looks
like he's just ready to rip the cover
off the ball so he's calling out climate
change is a
hoax uh he's saying the Dei is just you
know um unproductive garbage racism
basically and he say saying that January
6 looks more like a hoax than than a re
a real
thing those are some bold things to say
and you know
what MSNBC can't touch him now because
if they bring him in they have to ask
him these questions and the problem is
he has
answers you know the old lawyer thing
don't ask a question if you don't know
what the answer will be well they don't
know what the answer is going to be if
they ask him so you get you know msnp is
mostly failed lawyers who became online
hosts they're mostly lawyers right it's
like I think a half of their hosts are
lawyers yeah no lawyer is going to bring
V on and have him dismantle msnbc's
entire narrative you know that that
would be bad but you could you could
bring on other Republicans you know you
could bring on a lot of Congress
Critters and they wouldn't embarrass
MSNBC they would just do their little
talking points and then msbc would
embarrass them after they were off the
air wouldn't leave a mark But V will
leave a
mark so I think they fear him at this
point they
should
um let let me summarize this I think
Trump speaks like his base and that's
what makes him so persuasive when people
listen to him even though you know he's
a billionaire and you might have a
regular job you still say he's talking
like me like the words coming out of his
mouth I it sounds like I could have said
that so that that really is a bonding
thing for his
base but V doesn't speak like his Bas do
you know what V speaks
like before I tell you my opinion you
tell me what V speaks
like Trump speaks like the bass what
does v speak like
some say a professor some say a car
salesman Pastor
father president dad preacher uh Highly
Educated grad student Chad
executive all right I'm going to give
you a lawyer I'm going to give you the
right answer all of your answers are
pretty good all of your answers are
pretty good CEO is a good answer here's
the right answer he speaks like the
leader you
want I don't want somebody who's only as
smart as
me I don't want somebody who talks like
me I want somebody who talks better than
me I want somebody who can take my exact
opinion on climate change and then go on
television and explain my opinion my
opinion better than I can explain
it that's what I want I want somebody
who understands economics better than I
do I don't want I don't want somebody
who talks the same way I talk about
economics I want him to go on and and
promote essentially my point of
view but better than I do it and I do it
pretty well but he's better I hate to
say it but he's better at it that's not
easy for me to say I mean I don't know
if you're catching this but
I'm saying that somebody's a better
Communicator than I am I don't say that
a lot I'm pretty
cocky pretty cocky in that particular
domain I don't say that a lot but he's
better yeah he has more communication
skills than uh any politician I've ever
seen now Trump is still Trump right so I
don't like to get into that comparing
them directly and the reason I don't
compare them directly is I believe Trump
has earned eared uh icon
status you there are some things you
don't compare things to comparing
something to
Trump it's a waste of energy there's
only one of them he is what he is and
that's just the end of the story it's
the same reason I say don't you know
compare things to the Holocaust right
there there's some things that just
don't compare anything you can talk
about
it but to compare his communication
style to aake is wrong question wrong
question yeah all
right bill maluan at the border says
that uh I guess secretary uh mayorcas
came back and said uh you got some
challenges down there uh but they're
really happy that Mexico is stepping up
their commitment to help so good good
that's a good job so may orcus uh went
had met with the president uh Labrador
of Mexico and got this commitment for
lots of Mexican help so we're all set
right all good borders fixed well not
according to Fox News Bill maluan who
spends a great deal of time down in the
border and is you know the probably the
strongest reporter from that area and
Bill ban says about that continuous
efforts what efforts Mexico is enabling
the chaos at the border by Mass issuing
humanitarian visas to migrants that
allow them to travel through Mexico
straight to the US border then they
discard the Visas on the ground when
they cross illegally and then he says
and the trains and the trains Mexico is
running like train loads of migrants
with visas that they issued to the
border so he's like what progress what
commitments all
right have I uh completed completed my
theme my theme is that our current
systems in this country are by Design
not by intention not by intention but
certainly by the way they're designed
they guarantee lower capability of
future citizens they're making us uh
less capable less educated more
divided and it's everything it it's not
just education it's not just
corporations it's not just
government it's everything and I think
that's why you need a
vake
right you if you if you want well let me
give you an
example uh so we're all watching
Argentina they got their new president M
and he's a he's just a crazy guy in a
good way right he's changing things he's
getting rid of departments he's
streamlining things he's bringing free
markets back and all that now if you say
to yourself what is it that makes him so
strong as a politician and you probably
have lots of answers you say well he has
a real good broad background you know he
was a popular athlete but he's also an
economist he's a wild man he's got a
look with his hair you know he
communicates in a certain way so you'd
have you'd have all these reasons but
there's one thing he
has that not everybody can
duplicate well actually a lot of things
but one that stands
out he's
young how old is
he give me his age president of
Argentine is
40s is he pushing 50 or now early
40s he looks like he's mid 40s I'm
guessing right yeah under 50 I think you
can still shake things up over
70 good
luck yeah good luck I I don't see uh
anybody in their
70s ripping something out by the root by
the time you get to your 70s you're like
well we could trim that tree and keep it
you know you need you need to be a
certain
age he's 54 somebody says I'm seeing 53
that would have been my guess yeah I I
would have put him early 50s actually
but early 50s still young
enough still young
enough uh he's got the fire to change
things fundamentally I just don't think
older people change things fundamentally
and that that's
another vake Advantage now the other
vake Advantage is if you don't like
wokeness and I know that on the right
that's a big deal who who can rail
against wokeness more
effectively if Trump does it and you
support Trump what are you a white
supremacist right even if you're not
white you're still away supremacist if
you support Trump what if you support V
and he goes hard to dismantle Dei are
you a white
supremacist well now it's a little
harder argument to make isn't it because
you're saying well he's
brown
so how's that make me a white Sur Prem
assist if I'm supporting the brown
guy right so V has not only the
communication skills that are
unparalleled he's coming from a place
that's just the more comfortable place
to make the argument yeah you anybody
can make the argument but we're not not
all coming from comfortable places I
would be a good example of that right I
couldn't run for president and make a
Dei argument without half of the country
saying but you're just a white
supremacist so right but if a makes it
they're going to have to do
better they're going to have to defend
Dei because they can't just go after him
say Well you're obviously a white okay
why isn't this working
anymore so that's another Advantage he
has now V says he doesn't think that uh
those in charge will let either Trump or
Biden get to the Finish Line he doesn't
think either one will get there because
there are too many
powers trying to prevent
it so if you're looking for your backup
plan I think Nikki Haley is looking like
The
Insider deep State military industrial
complex
friend DeSantis just sort of
disappeared uh but if you're looking for
your your backup
plan you might need a backup
plan so at the very least least here's
what I'd ask you to do just become
familiar with V's
policies just just become familiar with
them that's all just in case it's come
just in case it becomes necessary
because I know most of you are just most
of you are just uh Trump supporters
probably but keep an open mind because a
lot could happen uh to
Trump that's not good you know if if
Trump is not taken out with lawfare or
some other dirty trick we can't imagine
he should
win but there's a lot of dirty tricks
and a lot of time left so don't be too
confident all right ladies and gentlemen
that's all I got for you today thanks
