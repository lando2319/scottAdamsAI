so we're all in this together
Valentine's
you want to talk about some funny news
how about some funny news number one buy
a show of hands how many would like to
be to completely ignore the mass
shooting
yes yeah everybody's hand is up okay
we're gonna ignore that like it didn't
happen happy Valentine's Day let's talk
about the good news
um I don't know if you saw this but
there was a member of Congress and I've
never seen this before that well I guess
I've seen it before it was really rare
uh so Josh Hawley
did something I don't know I'm not being
sure you're going to believe me
are you even going to believe this story
Josh Hawley a member of Congress did
something that is potentially useful
I know now there's nothing about Josh
Hawley he's he's high on my list at the
moment but he keeps trying to do things
useful
now I don't know how successful he'll be
but he he just introduced or he is
introducing legislation to make to make
it illegal to use social media if you're
under 16. in other words you'd have to
be 16 or older to use social media
I am so on board with that so on board
we'll go private here on locals thanks
for reminding me
yeah now there are not many parents who
would be able to say this because their
their children would hate them forever
so I think parents are just going to be
kind of silent and hoping it goes
through Maybe
but yeah I don't think it'll pass I
don't think it'll pass for the simple
reason that the social media companies
in this country have a lot of a lot of
power now I'd be really interesting to
see what interested
to see what Elon Musk said
because I don't think he's weighed in on
this yet or I haven't seen it but I'd
love to know if he's in favor of that
because he might be
he might be but I'd be really surprised
if the other social networks are we'll
see
but congratulations to Josh Hawley for
doing something that would be useful I
think Josh Hawley is also he understands
the danger of tic tac
so just just a few members of Congress
who are young enough
and apparently trying to do useful
things
do you remember when Ron DeSantis
started doing all these useful things in
in Florida useful from the perspective
of his base
and everybody and and I kept saying well
he's just picking up the free money
it's like there's free money laying all
around the ground there in Florida and
why did we have to wait for him to pick
it up he's just doing all the obvious
things that his base liked well Josh
Hawley does the same thing
I wouldn't ignore that and I wouldn't
discount well I wouldn't uh I wouldn't
hold it against him
if his legislation doesn't get passed
because even just putting the
legislation out there changes the
argument
right it's a whole different argument if
you know it's actually been put into
legislation because that means it's
serious
right so even if it get rejected we've
at least elevated the conversation maybe
got a little bit closer maybe more
people who were exposed to the argument
maybe maybe it will take some event in
the real world to make you seem like a
better idea than it does right now
but uh this this is good work Josh
Hawley congratulations
um
there are reports that some kind of
Epstein list will be produced
but it's apparently a list documents
with names of those associated with
Epstein
now
are you comfortable with that
do you think that's
um I won't I don't want to use the word
Affair but do you think it's good for us
to see a list of all the people who are
quote associated with them
because would that would that not
include people who didn't who didn't
have any bad behavior
but they thought maybe they had some
business use with them they didn't know
exactly what he was up to
I don't know
I well it could be fake yeah we would
certainly believe it if the list were
fake that wouldn't surprise me at all it
does seem like there might be some
people who are important enough
that if they were going to be on such a
list they could make themselves not be
on the list I think that's the thing and
there might be people with that power
heads of governments and such
but I'm gonna I'm gonna predict that
it's a dud
what do you say I predict it will be
Undead it'll either be people we already
know of
complete strangers
and people who had a reason to do
business with them that although it
might have been ill-advised you know
such as Bill Gates ill-advised there's
not really any evidence that more than
that happened
I feel like it's yeah it's really going
to make us chatter like crazy but I'm
I'm very concerned that there's some
innocent ish ish people on the list and
by that I mean people maybe shouldn't
have done business with them maybe they
should have known better but didn't do
anything illegal
I'm very uncomfortable with that list
coming out because of the potentially
innocent people innocent ish right
ah
keep an eye on it all right here's
something I didn't know about the Ohio
train derailment
um I was aware that there was a 2022
film on Netflix about a train derailment
uh but the and and it was the same plot
there were chemicals that were released
and the town had to evacuate
now what I heard first
was that the movie was set in
Pennsylvania which at least is some
difference
from being in Palestine Palestine Ohio
what I read today and I need a
confirmation on this
um yeah I believe it was filmed in the
town where the actual derailment
happened
so that's what's being reported today
is that true
does that feel like a coincidence to you
all right I have two things to say about
coincidence
number one
lots of things can look like
coincidences that are not
so how could it what would be a scenario
in which this would look like a
coincidence but it's not
getting a think of one
how could it look like a coincidence but
not be one
all right here here's things we know so
I'll just deal with what we know and
then I'll just speculate right this is
just rank speculation so don't put too
much credibility on I just want to talk
you through a possible way that this
could be ordinary it looks extraordinary
but it could be ordinary here's how
apparently a number of people who lived
in Palestine Palestine Ohio
um were were extras on the film
so imagine if people in your town were
extras on a film about a train
derailment and it was filmed in your
town
so now you've got a whole town full of
people who are talking about train
derailments in a specific town it's in
the context of the movie but they're all
train derailment trained derailment hey
did you work on the movie about the
train derailment I didn't did you work a
movie about the trading derailment no
but I know somebody who did work on the
movie about trading derailments
all right now just introduce one crazy
person
what and the crazy person wants to do
some crazy
what do they do
they probably do the thing that's in the
top of their mind which is train
derailment
now here's the part that I heard on
Tucker last night
apparently
there is there are a lot of trained
derailments that appear to be
um sabotage
there were a thousand trained
derailments last year
or something like that right now I'm not
I'm not alleging that they were all
sabotage but some number of them were
apparently there is a well-known method
for making a train derail and this
well-known method has been implemented
in the United States more than you think
because it's not being reported on for
some reason yeah there's something they
do with a wire across the tracks that
changes the electrical signal which
causes the train to derail I don't know
how and I don't want to tell you if I
did
so
don't you think that there is one
explanation that would remove all the
coincidence
everybody was thinking about this very
specific crime there was one crazy
person there who said I think I'll do a
crazy crime what's on my mind oh
everybody's talking about traged
derailments I'll just go walk one block
over there and do one
so that would be one explanation that
would remove the weird coincidence right
here's here's a second explanation
for the coincidence
it's a coincidence
just just a coincidence
because the nature of coincidence is
that there are so many things happening
all the time every day
that you will always see coincidences
coincidences are rare coincidences are
guaranteed
and because we have news and social
media all of the rare coincidences come
to our attention
for example was it a coincidence that
two brothers who played on opposite
teams in the Super Bowl this year for
the first time
yeah that was that was a weird
coincidence how about the fact that uh
the two Super Bowl champions uh the the
ones who were competing they both had
black quarterbacks for the first time
well that's a coincidence
it was a sign of the times and stuff but
a coincidence right the world is full of
coincidence
full of it almost all of our stories
have coincidences in them so one
possibility is it's just another one is
the one you noticed but it's it's a it
looks like a big one but yeah just a
coincidence it's a place with a train
now if there were a thousand a thousand
derailments the odds that one of those
derailments would have been near this
one town
not that high
if there are a thousand a year it's not
that high that one would be near that
town
now the the actual explosion and stuff
would be rare
all right the other possibility is that
the number of coincidences are ramping
up
what would that mean
suppose in the real world
coincidences were genuinely ramping up
in a way that didn't make sense didn't
make any statistical sense whatsoever
what that what would that mean
has anybody read a book called The
Celestine prophecies
it's pretty old book
The Celestine prophecies
and I don't have a the clearest memory
of the book but I'll tell you the the
major theme was this
the major theme was that the individuals
in the book started noticing
coincidences that were out of control
like a lot of coincidences started
happening and I believe the the bottom
line was it was people people's level of
awareness
about the nature of reality was starting
to change
and the coincidences were marking this
movement in which the human Minds were
going to another level of awareness
is that happening
do you do you think that human minds are
right now
going into a whole new level of
awareness
hell yes
oh yeah oh yeah we are going into a
whole new level of awareness AI will
break our heads
you have no idea what's coming nor do I
because it's a it's impossible to know
AI could change how we think about
religion
it will definitely change how you think
about your consciousness
because it's going to have Consciousness
I know I know almost all of you disagree
but I promise you AI will have
Consciousness if there's nothing I'm
more sure of
I'm positive
positive and it will happen really
quickly and it's going to change
everything you know about
you know you're a mortal Soul the
specialness of your Consciousness the
uniqueness of people yeah everybody's
angry about this right people you're
like oh no not this one Scott you're so
wrong about this one
I hate to tell you there's no way around
it
there is no way around it it's going to
break all of our brains and it's going
to happen really fast next few years
we'll have a conscience well that's we
we could argue about the definition of
terms
but
what about this simulation Theory
simulation theory is not getting smaller
have you noticed that you know people
who talk about us being in a simulation
such as me
there's not less of it every year
there's more of it every year
there's more of it and that's not going
to change our our very understanding of
reality
is going to be completely different have
you all seen um you've seen you all
remember the audio illusion where some
people would hear the the word spoken
was green needle
and what was the other one green needle
and then the other one was completely
two different words
but have you seen the one where there's
a list of a list of phrases
and you could hear every one of the
phrases clearly
from the same words that are being
spoken you just have to be looking at
the word and then you can clearly hear
that's what's being spoken then you go
down to the next one and list completely
different words and it sounds exactly
like that's what they're saying and then
you say to yourself oh it's a trick
because they're they're making me go
from top to bottom and they're just
changing the word so it sounds like so
you try to start mixing it up and go
okay there's no way you're going to know
that I'm going to look at this one
and that it sounds exactly like the one
you're looking at and you say all right
I'll get you this time this one
and it's exactly the word
your reading is the one you hear now
when it was just two
two different you know sets of words
when it was just two sets of words
and you could say wow isn't that a weird
coincidence that one said a word like
Laurel and Yani Laurel nyani was the the
binary
two words
that's not that amazing
right if I said to you hey do you know
there are two words or phrases that
would sound alike to people if they
heard them I would say well that's
really interesting but not it doesn't
blow my mind because you could imagine
there would be two words that would have
that quality
but wait until you see a list of words
that are completely different words like
they don't have any of the same letters
in them practically and every one of
those will sound exactly like what you
hear as you look at it and it's only
because you're looking at it that you
can hear it differently wait till you
experience that there on Instagram
there's a number of those you could
probably find them once you realize that
you'll realize that your reality is
completely subjective
right when it was just two things this
sounded like you could say oh there's an
oddity of life
but once you realize that any of the
words on that list sound exactly like
what you hear and they're all different
and you can change it instantly there's
no there's no setup time
you look instantly at any words on the
list and you'll hear them
once you experience that you will know
for sure that what we're experiencing
here is just a psychological phenomenon
I don't even know if you're there
like actually literally
I don't know if you're even there
we live in a and you know we assume that
everybody's here
but it's all subjective
all right
um
Trump is making some news because
apparently he's a
he's testing out some uh
nicknames for Ron DeSantis now you know
that he tried wrong to sanctimonious
that was the first attempt because you
know presumably Trump thinks that
DeSantis will run against him in the
primary
so he's trying to you know Tamp him down
now Ron de sanctimonious how many
thought that was a good nickname
Ron de sanctimonious
all right how many citizens think they
know what sanctimonious even means
see the problem the problem is
not that he is or is not sanctimonious
the problem is I don't think most people
know what it means
so it's too many letters as that one
didn't work
well that was reported that privately
he's referring to Trump is referring to
the census as meatball Ron
which in the reporting that I read
was suggestive that he
that he's short and round and Italian
so kind of racist kind of racist
um
but it's a weird kind of racism isn't it
it's a weird kind of racism because
there's literally no food in the world
there's more universally light than
Italian food at least in America in
America the one thing you can say that
everybody will agree with is how about
Italian food
Italian food is the one thing everybody
in the United States agrees on well you
know I like Thai food but not everybody
does
well I like you know I like Persian food
but not everybody does
but Italians everybody we're all on
board
so it's a weird kind of you know
somebody's going to call it racist
racist because yeah I suppose it is I
wouldn't I wouldn't disagree with the
labeling but
it's clearly not
um mean-hearted mean-spirited
in the sense that literally no one
dislikes Italian food no one
uh of course I'm exaggerating but it's
close to close to true
the other one he's trying out is uh
let's see what else is he trying out
shut down Ron
so trying to pin the shutdown which
temporarily to Santa Saturday in Florida
um
that's not too I don't know shut down
Ron
that doesn't really I don't know that's
kind of nothing
so here's how it's being reported
do you think it's fair
to report Trump brainstorming behind
closed doors
how many times have you seen a report
an anonymous report of trump talked
about some crazy stuff behind closed
doors
my rule is always going to be the same
doesn't matter if it's Trump
doesn't matter who it is if they're
talking about crazy behind closed
doors that's cool
that's cool with me 100 cool
I don't care what it is do you know why
because we all talk about crazy
privately well it means non-publicly we
all talk about crazy
nobody doesn't
if you reported everything I said
privately
do you have any idea what that would do
to me
do you have any idea
there are a lot of people and I'm
definitely in this category
who are attracted to whatever the worst
thought is
because it sometimes is funny it's
provocative and it's you know not boring
so privately I spend a lot of time with
the worst possible thoughts
because they're funny
now privately I could laugh at the
things that might be terrible or
insulting to other people
but they're not there
they're not in the room
anything I say in the room
only matters to the people in the room
right and if I trust them not to take it
outside the room that's all that matters
so no I'm sorry horrible thoughts are
entertaining and I will use horrible
thoughts in private all the time they
are not any kind of an indication of my
soul or my inner thoughts they're simply
funny because they're inappropriate
right so
if you say here's a list of all the
things God said privately I would say I
hope they're all inappropriate
I hope they are they should all be
inappropriate everything I say privately
I try to make interesting
because what's the point of talking if
you're not interested
so I I have no problem with anybody
saying anything horrible
behind closed doors but it does give you
a little insight that you're still
looking for a uh
linguistic kill shot
I don't know if there is one
so the news is reporting that DeSantis
is clearly preparing to run for
president do you believe that
do you believe it's it's pretty much a
done deal and he's just laying low but
he's because the reporting is that he's
setting the the stage sort of privately
and part of that is that they believe he
keeps doing popular things because it'll
make him more viable for president
you want to hear what's wrong with the
news and everybody
this is what's wrong with everybody
including B so this will be a self uh
insult as well
why did we rule out the possibility he
was just trying to govern the state well
like that's not a possibility
no nobody will even consider the
possibility that you're simply trying to
do a really good job in his current his
current role as governor
shouldn't he be trying to do that under
all circumstances like the news the news
is reporting that he's only doing
popular things to run for president
and I'm thinking how messed up is that
that that's the most messed up reporting
you could ever have at the very least
you should say he's you know he's doing
all the things that his base likes in
Florida which should also set him up
well if he were to run for office
you could have a twofer
let me tell you what one of my pet
peeves is as a public figure
almost every day I go to social media
and somebody who has never met me is
telling telling me what I'm privately
thinking right it's just really annoying
they're always wrong
but the other thing that they always get
wrong is they'll say the reason I'm
doing something
so let's say the reason he did this was
he was afraid of X the reason he did
this was he makes the money I don't know
the reason he did this is X here's what
is always wrong
if you're if you're trying to speculate
why I did anything
and you only have one reason
it's wrong
I don't do anything important for one
reason
do you
do you
if it's important there are lots of
reasons you do it
right why do I exercise
is there just one reason
I mean I do it for my health I do it for
appearance I do it to live longer I do
it because it's useful if you're a
public figure people have to look at you
right who does things for one reason
do I eat well be just one reason
no
do do I do this live stream for one
reason
am I doing this for one reason no idiots
do things for one reason if I'm going to
do anything that's like a lot of energy
and time I'm going to find more than one
reason for it like it's it's got to
accomplish a few things in my life where
I'm not even going to be interested
so I only do things that accomplish
multiple things
so if you say Ron DeSantis I think the
only reason you're doing a great job as
Governor is because you have lust for
higher office
maybe but how about this how about Ron
DeSantis is not an idiot and so he does
things that are good for a variety of
reasons you know what would be another
good reason
to manage the uh the governorship right
I'm just going to toss this out here
just possibly
it's um and I know you hadn't thought
about this but
it's good for the public
is that never a reason
like Ron DeSantis can't ever in his
private moment say you know what
this would just be good for the public
I'm just going to do this
also good for me as a governor
also good for other Republicans because
they get you know they get some of the
shared Glory
also good
in case I ever ran for president
in the case people wanted to vote for me
if there were so many people wanted to
vote for me present that would be good
for them too why can't it be good for
the people
like you know just to imagine anybody
has one reason for something it's just
the lowest level of analysis
all right so uh Nikki helle has
announced she's going to run so I guess
it's on uh if we imagine that Trump
would not get primaried we don't have to
imagine that at all but here's my
question for those of you who identify
as Republicans help me out on this
uh Nikki hilley is a woman and uh I
believe she does she identify as a
person of color
right yeah in Indian American and
anything else I don't know doesn't
matter
so let's say she identifies as a person
of color and a woman and she's running
as a Republican
how does that feel
does that have like a
that has a feel to it doesn't it
it feels like it's off brand
now let me be very clear
I'm sure she is qualified I'm sure she's
qualified to be president there are a
number of Republicans as well as
Democrats who are I would say they're
qualified you know people at that level
of success they're they're all kind of
qualified you know then it's just a
choice of which flavor you like but
they're all qualified right she's
qualified to be president for sure
but if you're a Republican and you're
used to all the favoritism
the favoritism that you've seen
for people who are not white men
and the Republican party is really
dominated by adult white men
for better for worse it's just a fact
um
how are they going to take it
doesn't it feel like it would be a stunt
in in TV there's something called stunt
casting
so you bring in a celebrity just for
like a little you know moment and people
didn't expect it they go oh that's funny
I I was stunt casted on Babylon 5.
you know so I was a semi-famous
cartoonist who appeared there once just
so there'd be something to talk about
right that's stunt casting but it looks
like Nikki Haley because she's female
and would identify as a person of color
it looks like Republicans stunt casting
like running the person who has the
right demographic
quality used to be to a Democrat
now there is something to that
because you would take from the
Democrats you know their minority
power
so I get the idea
and I like it as a strategy it's not bad
but there's just something about it that
feels like you're trying to match the
wokeness of the Democrats instead of
let's say argue
what is limits should be
it feels like surrender
does anybody else feel that way and by
the way I I think she's completely
qualified for the job
no
okay
all right so I was asking because this
is a purely subjective
um
most people are saying no
so most people are completely okay with
that as simply being an advantage he
would have as a candidate
am I right let me let me put it this way
would you be comfortable with her being
a woman and a person of color and of
course we're comfortable with that
that's that's not the problem the
problem the question is
are you comfortable that it's an
advantage
are you comfortable putting it forward
as an advantage
because that's the part that is creepy
to me
it can simply exist
but if she starts if she starts pushing
it as some kind of Advantage she's dead
to me
in a political sense
do you remember when Hillary Clinton
said uh being a woman was an advantage
for leadership
because women listen better
do you remember she said that she said
that out loud
she actually said women are superior to
men
and then she didn't get elected
fortunately but so Nikki Haley has a
um she can play this right or wrong
the right way to play is the Obama way
do you remember how Obama very cleverly
and this must have taken a lot of
discipline self-discipline he never sold
himself as a black guy
running for president he mentioned it of
course but it wasn't his sales point
he was he was just a qualified person
and that was a good way to get some
Republicans on his side if Nikki hilley
simply ignores the fact that she's a
woman just doesn't mention it ignores
the fact that she's a person of color
and let the media talk about it
that could be a winning play
but the moment she says it's time for a
woman I'm out
the moment she says that I'm out if she
does I think she's smart enough not to
by the way if she mentioned that she's a
person of color and that's an advantage
I'm sorry
no I can't go with you there
it's just got to be on qualities and
talents and policies it's just got to be
like I I just can't go there with
anybody
so we'll see there's certainly a she has
a path
I would say she has a path what do you
think
do you think she's legitimately
presidential material
in terms of a path
I'd say yes
I say yes yeah Narrow Path but they all
have narrow paths
except Trump and DeSantis Maybe
all right
um
is our infrastructure under attack
I don't like to you know jump into
conspiracy theories but there are a lot
of infrastructury things that are being
attacked
from Power stations to railroads
uh to uh I don't know food supply
egg egg producing stuff
but to me they all look like coincidence
what does it look like to you
I don't see them as a coordinated effort
of any kind
here's what I see
I see the crazy people attack things
that are visible
if I were a crazy person and I had a
gong or Dynamite or something I think I
would attack things that are sort of
visible
so infrastructure is unusually visible
so it just kind of makes sense to be a
lot of attacking going on so I don't
think it's coordinated
but I wouldn't ignore it
if I were if I were China for example
and I wanted to do this you know all in
war where every part of warfare is
considered fair I would be looking to
sabotage American infrastructure in a
thousand different ways that you didn't
notice but as far as I know nobody
associated with China has ever been
accused with any infrastructure attack
or any other country
the best of my knowledge no other
country has been implicated
implicated in anything somebody says
incorrect can you crack me
well covert covert was a special case
sure
yeah we know that everybody spies on
everybody
but are have any of the infrastructure
attacks been tied to China or Russia or
anybody else
I'm not aware of any
okay well we'll keep an eye on that but
I'm still in the probably just a
coincidence because infrastructure is
visible and it makes a big impact if you
attack it I think that's all it is
all right
I saw a statistic I don't know if it's
true but it was on a tweet look Drew so
give me a fact check of this 40 of males
between age of 30 and 60 in the midwest
are not working
does that sound true
forty percent of males between 30 and
60. in the midwest are not working
I I feel like it might be true
but here's how I would explain part of
it
and the question is how do they live
like how do they live
well here's one
uh some of them might have working
spouses
right some of them have working spouses
so that's some percentage of it
um some of them are on disability
some of them uh are looking for jobs and
can't get them I suppose I'm not sure
what they counted here exactly
uh some of them probably moved in with
their parents
even at age 30 plus moved in with their
parents
but here's another possibility
some of them might be living off of
inheritance so it's a short-term thing
you know they may have had deceased
parents and they might have a you know
little little pot of money that they're
living on for the moment but that might
run out
um
but I think a number of people are
probably working for cash
a lot of men in the manual labor stuff
they may be you know I don't know
cleaning pools and doing odd jobs and
stuff for cash
so I've got a feeling that the uh the
illegal
underground economy is at least a big
part of this I don't know what
percentage Yeah and some are manhorse
yes
all right let's talk about those weather
balloons do you know do you know I'll
know Bill Ackerman famous
investor hedge fund guy is that name
familiar to you because you it's it's
more fun if you know how well known he
is okay so Bill Ackman is one of the
most well-known
big Finance people you know a name that
if you if you have any business
uh scanning of the headlines you see
them a lot Bill Ackman so here's why you
tweeted today now I tell you that he's
important and smart and successful and
Rich
so that you put his comment in context
okay he tweeted what if the three UFOs
shut down are found to use technology to
be made of materials or or be made of
materials that are not native to Earth
how does life change thereafter what do
we do next
so
here's what I said
um
I question her what are the odds that
the aliens are building
spaceships that are octagonal
do you think octagonal shapes
are like Universal like every planet you
go they've got an octagon somewhere
because it's just sort of a universal
shape
or is it possible that the octagonal
shape is a really strong tell
that it was made here on Earth
I'm gonna go with octagonal
probably is a signal that was made on
Earth
so one of the questions you might ask is
is there any kind of octagonal
uh like weather balloon
is that a thing
have you ever heard of that like in
octagonal weather balloon
here's one
there's an octagonal weather balloon
that's the bottom of it a sided
company is called Aerostar American
company
so Aerostar makes an octagonal
payload
there's a balloon above it way above it
so in fact the balloon is so far above
it you can imagine that If you flew
under it you wouldn't even see the
balloon
you would look up and you see the
octagonal
thing and it would look like it's
floating with no form of proportion of
propulsion
it would just seem like it's floating
there because you're looking at it from
below so you're looking at the Octagon
of the payload but way up above it is
the balloon and maybe that's not so easy
to see
it might be easy to see if you were
going slower but you're in a jet so
you're in a jet and you're under it
you're like
hey I think I saw an octagonal thing
now
how big is it well looks to be about the
size of a car
is that what they reported
it was they said it was uh unmanned
octagonal object
the size of a car
that appeared to be floating without any
form of propulsion
it's right here
it's right here
somebody on Twitter said oh check this
company out so I go to their page they
sell a bunch of weather balloons
and this picture of a weather balloon is
right on their page
now let me ask you this
has the CEO of this company Aerostar
have they tweeted yet I just want you to
know everybody we do make an octagonal
shaped payload for our balloons so in
fact there are a bunch of
car sized unmanned
octagonal octagonal objects that are
floating over the United States
from us we make them so I'm not saying
that's what you saw but you should be
aware that we make octagonal car sized
unmanned objects which seen from Below
might appear to you as though they were
completely some kind of floating Magic
do I trust the photos from their website
yeah
yeah yes I do
now you go you all got pretty quiet
there didn't you
are you quiet because the odds that I
solved the UFO thing are very low is
that why you're quiet
it's real it's my real mind Bender isn't
it
because you know I did right
you know I just solved this national uh
mystery this is the solution it's right
here
do you think that the news will report
that I solved it
didn't report it yesterday
do you think it'll report it today
no this is the solution
and do you know why I know it's the
solution
because you haven't heard from the CEO
of this company
how in the world would you not have
heard of him so or whoever it is he or
him she she or him
right
yeah
now I'm just looking at your your
comments because this is hilarious
there's something happening with your
brains right now isn't it
because what I'm telling you doesn't
seem like it could possibly be true
right
but it looks like it might be
so you're trying to decide whether this
is actually the entire answer
at least for one of them you know only
one of them was described as octagonal I
assume the rest are just weather
balloons and I think the reason
here's here's my best uh my best
Assumption of what's going on
I think that the Biden Administration
was embarrassed by the Chinese spy
balloon which was definitely a Chinese
Bible
I think I mean any anything could be
wrong but that's my current working
belief it was definitely a Chinese Bible
now that made Biden look weak
so what do you do if everybody thinks
you look weak and your country has no
National Defense for air stuff
well if it were me
I would blow up some things in the sky
above me to show that I can spot even
small stuff and I can blow it up at will
and then I start looking around to say
is there anything we can blow up
and then my people would say not if we
keep our radar settings the way they are
but if we you know dial it down a little
bit make it a little more sensitive we
can start picking up smaller objects
which we have not identified
then Biden says you mean enemy stuff
right no just unidentified but maybe
enemy stuff probably not because we have
you know we've been ignoring stuff at
that size that moves slowly we've been
ignoring it for decades and haven't been
a problem yet
but it could be totally Chinese
incursions right
yeah well anything's possible okay shoot
it down
and then they say what
what if it's ours
what if it's just like a weather balloon
and it's one of ours
well shoot one down that's disabled
there are apparently hundreds or maybe
thousands of weather balloons on any
given day
they're all over the place
you think that all of them work
do you think that all of them are
sending out I don't know probably a
transponder message or something you
think every one of those the electronics
is working everyone they're all good not
a chance
there are definitely some broken weather
balloons in the air
would you agree there's there's no
chance that they're all working
so if you went to this company and said
we spotted this thing it might be your
weather balloon do you mind if we blow
it up what would the CEO say
where is it it said 20 000 feet it might
run into a commercial aircraft
oh blow that up I don't want my
space trap I don't want my weather
balloon taking down an airliner if it's
broken anyway it's no use to me just
shoot it down okay or at least they
wouldn't complain about it if they heard
about it
don't shoot on the balloon
I am loving the comments right now
because you're not sure what's going on
are you
you're not sure if I really did solve
the entire mystery
by Googling the webpage of a company
that makes weather balloons
but I think I did
now if it turns out that I'm completely
wrong about this
uh and I you know have to say how
embarrassed I am
that'll be fun too
you like it when I'm embarrassed in
public it's kind of fun it doesn't hurt
me so if it would entertain you I'm
happy to I'm happy that you would have
that entertainment but I feel like
this is the answer
all right now I need you to just tell me
because you're holding it you're holding
out on me you're holding it
do you think I solved it just for one of
the UFOs the octagonal one do you think
I solved it
all right most of the people are saying
it's like 75 yeses 25 knows 25 percent
25 percent
a quarter that's roughly a quarter no
reason I mentioned that
um
it would be funnier if I were pantsed in
public well maybe that'll happen someday
too you never know
all right that's my uh Theory
um
if it turns out there are alien parts on
any of these ships
I will be the most surprised cartoonist
in the entire world there are no alien
ships up there
I'm quite sure of that but I could be
wrong I'd love to be wrong that'd be fun
all right do you think the AI is good at
flirting
do you think if uh if you were
accidentally chatting with an AI
do you think the AI would do a good job
of flirting with you
well it's been tested there's actually
an app where you can tell the app
to flirt with the other person using AI
now you get to look at it first so you
can improve it or not but I saw a
demonstration
uh on CNN they were testing this app
called key key AI that helps you know
what to do to chat up your your uh
Target
that's terrible the target of your
attraction
but it turns out that AI is a perverted
creepy and weird and uh it's uh not so
good it's just creepy it goes sexual too
fast
for one thing but then it just gets
weird and creepy
just like people
so I don't know is that different than a
human
what what percentage of men don't go
sexual and creepy too soon we all go too
soon
damn it you wouldn't want it any other
way
if if there's one thing that men can
promise you like as a group we can
promise you all women we can promise you
this we'll go too far
I promise you doesn't matter what it is
is it dangerous oh we'll do it
is it ill-advised let's give it a shot
is it the craziest thing anybody ever
did in the world oh that looks
interesting
no that's what we're here for
where men will go too far we'll go too
fast too soon too far every time
that's what we're for
and that is not a fault that is a
feature
that is a feature if you took that away
from us our country would fail overnight
it's like stupid men you know I say that
with love because I like men but uh it's
basically men who go too far too fast
take too many risks it's Who We Are
yeah you can't take that away from us so
if AI is uh emulating men and it goes
too fast too soon too creepy too
perverted
perfect
now we would hope it could do better
than men and maybe someday it will but
at the moment it's matching men so it
can't do flirting at all because men are
terrible at flirting we're awful at it
and I'm personally of course I'm
tremendous at it as as of all of you but
the other men the other men who are not
listening right now they're all bad at
it we're pretty good yeah you and I but
the others oh the others
all right let's talk about Russia
and Ukraine
I remind you that a hundred percent of
what we hear from there is unreliable so
whatever I tell you if I don't tell you
the other side of the the story don't
worry I didn't believe the story I told
you
so you don't have to say well what about
the other side because I don't even
believe the thing I'm telling you so no
argument needed
but uh here's my question
so we hear these reports that the
Prisoners the Russian prisoners are
being used as a human fodder and The
Story Goes that they they send the first
wave of of prisoners and they all get
mowed down
but you know the other side uses up some
of their ammo I guess and then they send
another wave and they get mowed down and
after all their prisoners have been
mowed down the professional soldiers on
the Russian side you know they they make
their move if it's possible so that
seems to be what they're doing and then
if the prisoners or any of them
especially under the Wagner command if
they if they refuse to run into certain
death
then they murder them
so you only have a certain death behind
you and probable death in front of you
that's pretty close to certain so the
prisoners didn't know exactly what they
were signing up for and there's
indication that you know 20 or 30 000 of
them have already
been pressed into service but there are
about four hundred thousand of them left
so there's around 400 000 people still
in Russian jail
and I see Putin solving two problems at
once
he is emptying his jails getting rid of
most of the crime in Russia because most
crimes repeat offenders I'll bet
is that true is most crime in the United
States repeat offenders
probably 75 percent
you know you get new people coming in
for the first time but I feel like once
you're in the life you're a repeat
offender so Russia is actually has a
chance
to win Ukraine if they just keep sending
waves of human sacrifices forward and to
reduce crime in Russia by 75 percent
didn't see that coming did you
so you know how you always yell at me
not all of you but whenever I say it
looks like Ukraine is doing better than
expected
and then I say I know I know I don't
trust it that's just the reports that
are coming out
but it looks like Putin given that he
has you know no love for the prisoners
clearly
it looks like he can solve his crime
problem and take over Ukraine
it looks like he's got a path to do both
of those things
and I don't I don't even know if the
average Russian cares the indications
are that the average Russian doesn't
care at all
just as not interested in how many uh
dangerous criminals are are chewed up by
gunfire from ukrainians they don't care
at all
I'm not sure Americans would care that
much you know we might complain more
about I don't know if we'd care more
so
so Putin has a plan that is not is not
crazy
all right here's the news I was waiting
for but it took this long so the
Washington Post is
reporting that uh Clapper is now
complaining about how he was
characterized for the
the 50 current and prior Intel people
who signed the documents saying that the
hunter laptop looked like
had all the earmarks of
Russian disinformation
now at the time
I'm sure I pointed it out in public wait
wait wait everybody he's not saying it
is Russian
he's saying it has all the earmarks
which is what you say when you want to
leave yourself an out later
right that was obvious from the start
that the 50 Intel people gave themselves
away to say well we were right
it looked like it
we just said it looked like it and we
were 100 right that's just what Russian
tradecraft looks like so we're right why
are you complaining
we didn't say it was we said it had all
the markings up
and it did
so why is everybody complaining about us
being right
that's what that's what clapper's saying
and do you know who predicted that we
would have this day when they said hey
we didn't say it was we just said it
looked like it I did yeah I predicted
that because as the news reports as well
it allowed the politicians and Biden
to conflate looks like with they say it
is so Biden was then allowed to lie and
he asked for now you know years he's
allowed to lie and say 50 people said it
was Russian
and then the 50 people who said it said
well not exactly we said it had all the
earmarks
but here's what's interesting they're
throwing Biden under their bus the wall
The Washington Post is the Washington
Post is
revitalizing Clapper and their deep
State cronies I say that
with a wink so they're revitalizing and
saying hey these people were never wrong
what they said was accurate but they're
throwing Biden under the bus
you see it now right that when the
Washington Post does that specifically
The Washington Post you know that this
is the thinking of the Democrats
the thinking of the Democrats is clearly
they're trying to get rid of Biden
and clearly they're trying to
rehabilitate their their uh their flying
monkeys
right so the the 50 Intel people are all
the flying monkeys of the wicked witch
and they're trying to rehabilitate them
now because they might need them
you don't think Clapper will be back on
the air saying that uh Trump uh is
hiding Russian spies in Mar-A-Lago of
course he will but the way he'll say it
is we're all uh
I'm not saying uh I'm just saying the
way the Russian tradecraft works is they
usually hide in the basement of
billionaires running for president it's
the way they do it I'm not saying he's
doing it and they'll say he's doing it
I'm saying everybody in my business
you know they're looking at this they're
saying that's all the earmarks as all
the looks of uh of a billionaire who
would keep Russian spies in the basement
of Mar-A-Lago because that's how they do
it
and then a year later when you find out
there are no spies living in the
basement of Mar-A-Lago what does Clapper
say
nothing he waits for the walls The
Washington Post to write a story that
says he only said it looks that way and
it does so he was right
and then Clapper gets rehabilitated
so
they they had it both ways
now I believe that Trump can say that
the election was rigged
because of the the laptop stuff now
I also say
why is it that we only found out about
the laptop at just the right moment to
affect the election
I don't know I I hate it when an
election is decided
by coincidence
if it is a coincidence but it wasn't
true that everybody had a like a laptop
to be discovered but it's just the
timing of it this
I don't know I I don't like the fact
that an election is decided on the son
of a candidate losing a laptop
like that doesn't feel like how we
should be making these decisions
but it is relevant you know when there
there is a there is enough of a
connection with Biden and bad things
that uh is relevant
all right um
let's see what else is going on
so
I went to my Pharmacy to
pick up something and still masking
California is still masking in medical
facilities
uh there was reporting on is there
another study or is it the same one
showing that masks did not work at a at
a public level
is that because I read about that today
but I wasn't sure if it's the same
reporting from last week that they're
just late about or is there a brand new
one that also looked at the other
studies
so I believe all the studies about masks
were bunk
that's what I think I think all the
studies and masks were poorly done
studies because you can't really study
it in the real world
if you believe that masks work which is
what the medical community mostly worked
you can't really test it against the
real virus in the real world
so whatever all those tests were
there were something that was like a
proxy for the test or should suggest
what would happen or they're highly
indicative but they're not testing the
real world
that said there's no evidence that they
work at a global level
now uh
I remind you that since what I do here
is make predictions I made one today
that those that those things were
shooting down are our own defective
weather balloons
that's like a specific prediction the
value of what you watch here is not just
that I might say you know a different
take on things but some of the different
takes would be predictive
so
I need you to agree with me
that when I tell you I did or did not
predict something correctly that's
useful
is it
I think it is you should know if I if I
think I predicted something correctly
so at this point it's really clear that
I was the best predictor of the pandemic
by far there was nobody who came close I
I think I'm in my own category I don't
think there was anybody even in my my
class
I got the masks completely starting from
fauci lying about whether he believed
they work I'm the only person who got
that
first person to doubt fauci first person
in the country to say fauci was lying to
the public
got that right now that's separate from
the question of whether masks work what
we know is that he lied because he
believed they weren't
secondly I said
probably technically it makes a little
bit difference but you won't see it in
the big numbers so therefore it's
unjustified as a mandate
that's exactly where we are so my
original view on mass is 100 validated
likewise vaccinations and everything
else 100 validated at this point
um and I think that the Dark Horse
uh podcast
they're still making the case that
um you can tell the difference between
correlation and causation
by the fact that you predicted it
do you buy that so if you said I have a
hypothesis that if we test this we're
going to find this is highly correlated
with this other thing then you test it
and sure enough the thing you imagined
or you hypothesized was true therefore
that's probably more like a a system and
not a guess
because you hypothesized it you tested
there is a correlation probably
causation
well that could work in some cases if
you repeated the experiment over time
Etc but the trouble is there are always
more than one reason for things to be
correlated
in the real world it's messy
and there are lots of correlations
so just predicting that something will
have a correlation doesn't mean it's
causation
and
you know I think we all understand that
but and now by the way I'm
mischaracterizing
um Brett and Heather at uh
at Darkhorse I'm mischaracterizing their
argument a little bit but it's it's
feeling like
there's a little more speculation in
their scientific process than you'd
expect
and some of us don't listen to every
freaking podcast available that's good
now I've also solved the uh the UFO
weather problem and I think that you
should know that
because that would determine whether you
listen to my next
um or how much credibility you give my
next prediction
your comments are interesting today
you're all in a weird mood today
am I wrong
I I feel like you're all in a weird
headspace today is it because of the
news
there's just weird news that everybody's
sort of thrown off a little bit
yeah is it because it's Valentine's Day
there's something different about you
today like collectively
am I right
flying monkeys triggered you
[Music]
well anyway
um
I saw a provocative tweet from Mike
cernovich
so
I'm not sure I completely agree with
this
and I'm not sure if it's you know meant
to be hyper hyperbole so it's you know
kind of true but not completely true
sort of thing
but I'll read it
the the this is why you should follow
Mike cervich because you'll see thoughts
and ideas that you're just not seeing
anywhere else
so follow him for sure uh here's his
tweet today he said the smartest Boomers
were managing trains and infrastructure
gen X's talented ones knew they couldn't
get those jobs anymore due to hiring
quotas
and went to laptop gigs
huge holes are opening up now people
aren't even close to ready for the final
boom or die off
so the implication here is that when the
people in my generation are retiring and
dying that we won't know how to fix
anything
do you agree
or do you think that's hyperbolic
now I'll give you both sides of the
argument all right both sides of the
argument
it's definitely true that some people
didn't go some white Boomers did not go
after some kinds of jobs
because they knew they couldn't get them
I don't know if they became laptop
Warriors like I'm not sure that's the
same population that was considering one
thing I have more I had more more think
that they're in the 40 unemployed guys
in the midwest I don't think they just
learned to code so this might be some
hyperbole there but in general these are
forces that were were in play
um
and do you think that when the Boomers
die off then everything's going to fall
go to hell
there could be some of that there
definitely could be some of that but
here's here's another lens on the same
situation
here's another reason that our
infrastructure should be crumbling you
ready
it's always easier to give funding for
something new
it's hard to get funding to fix
something before it breaks and that's it
that's it
we're done that's the whole story in
theory every uh Advanced civilization
should go through a period of Decay
because of that fact
so what we should see is that we're
building an amazing sparkling brand new
AI
so the new stuff is getting funding like
crazy
but when's the last time we built an
airport
right so it's really hard to get anybody
to fix something before it breaks like
how much money goes to fixing Bridges
before they collapse some some probably
not enough right so it's always going to
look like your old stuff is falling
apart
because your old stuff is falling apart
it's sort of built into the way our
brains work I don't think it's a talent
problem exclusively
I think it has more to do it is a talent
problem but I think it's also just the
effect of we like new stuff more than we
like old stuff that's it
um but it is a problem I mean it's a
gigantic problem I don't know what we do
about it
that ladies and gentlemen
concludes my presentation for those of
you on YouTube
if you're also a daily coffee with Scott
Adams consumer you might be interested
that we're now once again
selling the mugs
so I tweeted uh you can see it in my
Twitter feed from yesterday how you can
get your own
coffee with Scott Adams mug complete
with the simultaneous sip written on the
back and what's written on the bottom
let's look
Ah that's right it says Ah on the bottom
can you fit your fist inside the mug
no
but it's a 20 ounce mug
so if you've got a tiny fist
put it right in there put it right in
there
yep be like throwing a hot dog down the
hallway
and if you understood that shame on you
uh offices that apply to marriage
yeah yep sort of it does
um naval's into about David John uh
knowledge creation of the human race
really
Naval
did a talk with David Deutsch
all right well I'm definitely going to
listen to that
like if you don't know those two
individuals
just trust me
I if you don't if you have no idea who
noval ravacant is and you don't know who
David Deutsch is
you don't need to just just trust me it
would that would probably be the most
interesting conversation you'll ever see
I'm just guessing but probably
oh breakdown why that is so uh Naval I
sometimes refer to as the smartest
person I've ever met
and I've met a lot of smart people
uh David Deutsch
is in just the right let's say
um scientific philosophical space for a
conversation with the smartest person I
know
there's no way that isn't going to be
awesome
more than more than Elon
don't know but I don't know Elon
right so I'm only talking about people
I've met in person
is it weird that I've never met Elon
Musk
how many people think that's weird
it just feels like it would have
happened right it just feels like in the
the natural course of things we would
have been in the same place at least
once but we've never met
yeah
you will I don't know it would be a
coincidence if we did
let me let me tell you my uh philosophy
on that
um when you're a public figure
is very very common two varies
very very common twice
um for people who say hey you're famous
and I know this other famous person you
two should talk
and then I say why
well you're famous and you're
interesting this other person is famous
and interesting so how about we set you
up for lunch
to which I say
why
why did that other person say they want
to meet me no but I'm sure they would
because they're interesting you're
interesting let me put you together and
then I say I don't do play dates
I really don't I don't do play dates I
know you think that you're toddler and
you know this other toddler will will
have a good time but I don't do play
dates I don't I think I think maybe they
have their own life and they don't need
me at all I don't think I add anything
to that other person's life my Baseline
for having lunch with somebody
would be that I think there would be
something in it for them
that's the Baseline like what's in it
for the other person
just randomly meaning famous people is
fun it's fun I love randomly not eating
not even randomly I love meeting famous
people
it's one of the coolest things about my
job but I don't look for it because
looking for is just weird
people
that's what I think so I tend I tend to
have uh contact with people I have some
reason to talk to and I think maybe they
would they would find some benefit as
well
is that egotistical
so Linda says it's egotistical
I would think it would be the opposite
wouldn't be the opposite like
I would think egotistical was oh I I
belong at this table with this famous
person they really I imagine this
imagine if you will
how busy Elon Musk is
and let's say he agreed to go to lunch
with you
do you think you're helping the world
doesn't he have other stuff to do that
might be kind of important
like I can't imagine 45 minutes eating
lunch with me like moves the ball
forward in some way but 45 minutes that
he's you know running his multiple
companies that are changing civilization
that feels like a good 45 minutes so I'd
rather he spends that time you know
doing what he wants to do
yeah I'm not saying it wouldn't be
entertaining it's just a it's a strange
ask
to take a stranger's time without
without a specific benefit for both
uh 51 flying monkeys yeah
yeah we'd have plenty to talk about of
course yeah it's not a question of
having nothing to talk about we'd have
plenty to talk about that would be the
case with any public figure
uh
no I am a narcissist
somebody said I I proved I'm not a
narcissist I'm totally a narcissist but
but there are two kinds
there's one that's damaging and it's
just like destruction the other just
likes to get attention for doing good
things
have I mentioned that I never do things
for one reason that was the beginning of
my uh podcast today I talked about why I
would never do anything for just one
reason
nothing important anyway important
things I do for multiple reasons so if I
can make a dent in fentanyl or Tick Tock
persuasion or something like that if I
could make a dent in something
I do it because it's good for the world
and if the world is happy with my work
they will be good to me
why can't I have two objectives
does anybody have a problem with that
I could have two objectives and be a
narcissist and say I love it if I got
attention for doing something right
when I showed you the uh I I think I've
solved the
you know the weather balloon thing the
octagonal weather balloon let's say I'm
right
how much would I enjoy that
a ton
a time do you know why
well I guess I'm a narcissist because I
would love the attention for being right
and for being right
would wouldn't you
would you not enjoy attention for being
right
that feels like something everybody
would like
I might like it more as demonstrated by
the fact I put more I put more effort
into attaining it right so that would
suggest I am a narcissist
but I'm I'm quite overtly I'm trying to
be as transparent as possible this
totally works I I think you want people
like me to want to get attention for
accomplishing things
don't you
yeah I I
I would think you'd want more of that
not less of it
so but there's a whole other kind of uh
narcissist who we're really just out to
destroy Life as we know it that's a
different thing
if you're happy with your decision then
you should be happy with that
um
my motives are all transparent
now and and here's the third thing
so I like solving problems for the
public
I like getting you know attention if I
do a good job
and I've also monetized the the podcast
so I'm making money too
does everybody have a problem with that
is a reason I can't do three things at
the same time help you make money
have some pleasure while I'm doing it
right
three things
all right
um
Thank you Lisa
does anybody need to be calmed down
about any current problems uh Lisa was
saying she enjoyed my work during the
early part of the pandemic where I was
calming people down
and by the way the uh
my belief that the supply chain would
not break because we would infinitely
adjust
that was true
wouldn't you agree
that the supply chain had a lot of
pressure on it but I knew there were so
many people and it was a top priority
that we would just adjust like crazy
because that's what we do that's what
humans do we're good at it and we did
right on schedule and we did it was
close let me tell you this supply chain
thing
you had a reason to be afraid of that
that was real that was a real risk it's
just that we work through it
all right the biggest risk right now
that I see is inflation would you agree
I'm not worried about Russian nuclear
war
maybe I should be but it's just not I'm
not seeing the signals at all I'm just
not seeing the signals for that and I'm
not worried about all that war with
China do you know why
you know I am not worried with like a
hot war with China
because China is run by engineers and
smart people
do you think they're going to start a
war with the United States like a hot
War
it wouldn't make any sense because they
can get everything they need without
that
I think now taiwan's a special case but
they can become the biggest economy just
by doing what they do and just continue
to do it they have so many more people
that is pretty much guaranteed that'd be
the biggest economy
um they could have uh military dominance
just by building continuing to build
more stuff funding it so they don't need
to destroy the United States
and in fact we're our cousin a big
customer
so there is no there's no mechanism
let's say
there's no realistic possibility that
China launches nuclear weapons
intentionally at the United States
it would have to be an accident and even
that is so remote it seems weird
all right so I don't see I just don't
see that
because the the one thing that you could
say about a nuclear attack is that the
leader of the country who did it would
be dead very quickly would you agree
if you're the leader of any country and
you start a war
you're probably going to survive
right because lots of times you end up
negotiating the end of the war but if
you launched a nuclear attack
we would kill you first
am I right so I'm sure that we know
where Putin is like what a cities and
would you agree with that
do you think the United States always
knows at least was City Putin's in maybe
not what building but what a city we
would just take we would just Target
that City
because the nuclear war is the worst of
everything so it's not like you would
hold back
we would just Target that first and
here's what I think are here's what I
think our nuclear stand should be
our nuclear stand should not be you know
if you attack us we will all out attack
you back
rather it should be if you launch a nuke
at us
suppose it's just one for whatever
reason
we're going to Nuke you back but we're
going to aim you at your leader
and we might have to take out Moscow to
do it
but we're only going to fire one
and we're done
so after that we're done but you're
going to lose your biggest city and your
leader because you you nuked us
that's not negotiable
so you might as well you might want to
spend a few days getting as far as you
can from Putin because Putin is going to
go up in a fireball it's going to happen
in the next week you've got one week to
leave town
and I don't care what town it is if he
hides in the middle of Moscow
we're going to drop one nuclear bomb and
only one then we're done but we're going
to take out Moscow because that's where
he is so if you think Putin is anywhere
in your city get out you've got a week
because I think we would have to make it
very clear that we're after their leader
and not looking for anything else
let nothing out so I'm not sure if that
would be a good military Doctrine but
that's what I would do
you think Scott sees the holes in that
idea what are the holes in that idea
is a hole that they could keep launching
and we would be too slow to respond
I mean if it's multiple nukes
they're all bets are off right I'm only
talking about a situation where somehow
one get launched one got launched
because I think that's I think it's far
more likely that one would be launched
and that we would just let it land
what do you think if Russia or China
launched one nuke
even if it were at a major U.S city
yeah we'd probably shoot it try to shoot
it down
but assumed we miss
I think we would take the first one
we would never say that and never should
but I think we would take the first one
and then we would say
all right
you've got 10 minutes to give us your
leader
and in 10 minutes they would give us
their leader
I think we should just ask for their
leader and the other country would give
them to us that's what I think
yeah I think they would execute their
own leader
to save their family because everybody
who is anywhere near that leader was
going to be vaporized unless they killed
that one guy
uh everybody you know and your families
and you you'll all be dead unless you
kill this guy
of course they would yeah they would
kill their own leader uh on request
because the the alternative is a is a
complete nuclear annihilation
so we can never say that you know you'd
never want to say the enemy well if it's
just one nuke we're going to wait and
see
but I think we would the dumbest thing
we could do would be if one nuke was
coming our way to launch a massive
attack
that would be the dumbest play
uh launch had a warning if if it's more
than one
we probably would launch on Mourning
if it's one I think we'd wait and see
I hate to say it but I think we would
all right um
that's all I got for today hope you
enjoy your Valentines once again this is
the best live stream you've ever seen in
your entire life
