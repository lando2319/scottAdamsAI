do you hear this
oh that's the sound
yeah that's the sound of crisp paper
coming out of my new hp printer that was
just installed
working like a champ and i think that
that is a sign of a great show to come
great show and
if that's not enough
i'm just getting started
that's right the white board behind me
don't get too excited i know what that
does to you but wow it's going to be a
good one and if you'd like to take it up
a notch all you need is a cup or a
margarita glass a tanker chance to start
a canteen jug or flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee and join
me now for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine of the day the thing makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip
it happens now
go
so good
well
so it turns out that alabama
is getting crushed in their icu capacity
so they're over capacity half of the
people in there are there for covid
so that's what's crushing stuff
but they say only 12 of the patients in
the hospital are fully vaccinated
which means
it's not really a problem of vaccinated
people it's a problem of unvaccinated
people
and i was thinking
have you noticed how
getting a vaccination is a lot like
voting
alabama basically voted to not get
vaccinated because i think it's the
lowest vaccinated state or one of them
so the people in alabama
looked at the news same as you did
did their own research
maybe not the same as you did
and
came to the conclusion
in a sense they voted to be an
unvaccinated state
relatively unvaccinated
and they got what they wanted which was
no icu capacity
i don't know what to do about people
getting what they want
right
because on one level you want everybody
to do well and have good outcomes but
what if they choose bad outcomes
what if they get exactly what they chose
i don't know i feel as if the people in
alabama had the same information
everybody else did
now could they be right well in the end
what if people who got vaccinated grow
horns
well if that happens those people in
alabama are going to look pretty pretty
smart aren't they because you'll be
walking around with your vaccination
horns and you'll be like gosh i wish i
hadn't gotten vaccinated because i grew
horns
and then you go to alabama and
everybody's like no horns and you're
like
these are freaking geniuses
they saw this coming
and they
they made the right choice anyway the
point is we don't know who will be right
but we can say for sure that alabama got
what they voted for
in a sense
jack
uh had a couple of good tweets today as
he often does
um he's got a little scoop i guess an
inside story saying that uh biden is
telling staff
that he wants to go back to delaware
he hasn't been
sleeping well this week
home
did anything happen this week
that would make a sitting president
lose sleep anything anything ah
the weather no no
was there anything in the headlines
that would make a president
feel anxious or lose sleep
i can't think of anything
anybody anybody you got anything i got
nothing so clearly biden is correct
that the problem is probably the bad
problem is bad
he's got a bad bed in the white house
but that delaware bed is just firm
enough
he doesn't say if he uses a my pillow
topper in delaware but
i'll bet i'll bet he's got a my pillow
topper because that's the good bed
and
um so he wants to stay in delaware but
here's another way to interpret that
because there are always multiple ways
to interpret
the other way to interpret it is that
the cat is on the roof you know the joke
it's an old joke cat is on the roof the
short version is that is warning you
that something might happen to the cat
later but we don't want to break it to
you right away well let's just say the
cat's on the roof
later we might tell you the cat fell off
the roof
maybe he has an injury
and then later we'll say the cat passed
away but by then you're all primed you
know you're
you're kind of ready for it
i feel like they're readying the public
step one
make a really bad decision
step two
stay in delaware because you can't sleep
step three
say that you've got a little bit of a
headache
step four you're feeling tired step five
well pretty soon
president camalieris
so that's what it's looking like
the only slight flaw with the plan just
just a little flaw with the plan
it's a great plan
except for the part of the kabul harris
is even less trusted than biden
now
let me tell you how brilliant this plan
would have been if the vice president
had any capabilities whatsoever
really good
what about a good plan because biden
would have beaten trump for the
presidency then a capable person would
have slid right into that
job and that would have been pretty
pretty good
but for that plan to work you don't want
your vice president to be less competent
than somebody whose brain stopped
working
about nine years ago
but that's what they did so
there's your good planning
rasmussen says
ask people how likely
do people think it is likely voters how
likely do you think it is that harris
would replace biden before his term is
over
51 percent said it was highly likely or
somewhat likely
so over half of the country
thinks it's at least somewhat likely
that the person who got elected
president
won't make you four years
now
how much less trust could you have in
your government than think they won't
even like survive
you know basically people are putting
similar odds on biden making it through
as the afghan government surviving the
taliban
yeah they're not that different
you know one was one was like a six
month remember the intelligence agency
said that the afghan government would
last maybe six months
um
which is very similar to what people
believe abiding will last
so there was a point
where we weren't sure if the afghan
government or the american government
would last longer
i'm not making that up
there was a real point this year
where the intelligence people weren't
quite sure if the afghan government
would fall before the american
government meaning that biden would
leave office
surprise surprise
all right but 26 percent say uh
it's not likely that uh biden will leave
office
uh or they don't know 26
what is that close to it's very close to
25
that's what it's close to and as you
know 25 percent of people will get the
wrong answer on any survey
doesn't matter what the topic is
25 of the public
gonna get the wrong answer
or act like they don't know
so uh let's dig into this uh afghan
withdrawal story yeah i'll tell you why
this is interesting to me
because there's just a ton of psychology
involved in analyzing the whole thing
and that's the that's the interesting
part to me
the number one psychology
uh layer here is dunning krueger
you know dunning krueger is everybody
thinks or it's when people think that
they're more capable than they are
how many of you are pretty sure you
could have done military logistical
training better than the experts
pretty much all of us
i think all of us really
now are we right
can we really do military planning
better than the experts
we actually think we can
in this specific case people are like
in this case i think i could have
but could we let's dig into it a little
bit and find out if you're all done in
krugerdup or if you're actually
one of the smart people who could have
gotten this right
so uh the chairman of the joint chiefs
um general milley
he said that he was explaining things he
said that the intelligence indicated
there were multiple possible scenarios
after the troop withdrawal
and that he saw nothing warning of a
total collapse within 11 days of u.s
departure
all right let's say that's true
now don't assume anything anybody tells
you is true because everybody's covering
their ass at this point but let's just
play it through let's say it was true
because i think they're saying this
consistently
that
nobody believed
that the army would fall in 11 days
now what is it i always tell you about
democrats
that they get wrong
in the comments
right in the comments tell me why do i
always remind you that democrats get
wrong every time that's right human
motivation
human motivation is their blind spot
every time democrats get something wrong
it's the same thing
it's the same damn thing every time
what did they get wrong this time
human motivation
what what does an afghan government who
believes that their survival
depends on american military presence
what do they do
when you withdraw
they run
human motivation
are you surprised
now the only thing that should have
mattered is we should have talked to the
the people in the afghan government said
hypothetically
if you saw the u.s military presence
drawing down and it was it was trying to
get to zero pretty quickly whether it's
months or days but pretty quickly what
do you think you'd do
how do you think you'd act
if the american military left
what would they say well they probably
lie right but
i feel like you could have deduced
that the afghan government didn't think
it could survive
and if the afghan government didn't
think it could survive
whether we left quickly or slowly what
the hell are they going to do if they
find out we're leaving
they're going to run
or they're going to join the taliban or
they're going to do whatever it is that
looks like they could survive
so
um and then the second question i i ask
is
why are there so many people there
i'm i'm no genius about afghanistan but
didn't we know months ago we knew months
ago that you needed to get out of there
if you were an american or if you had
any risk once the taliban took over
didn't you know that
months ago to get the hell out of there
weren't they all warned months ago
how much responsibility do you have for
people who have been warned to help
themselves and then chose not to
like where does your responsibility end
when people
do the wrong thing right in front of you
i don't know how many troops do you want
to risk
saving people who wouldn't save
themselves
it's a
sort of a philosophical ethical question
so
let's say
let's take a look at
the whiteboard are you ready
let's go to the whiteboard
so here's my interest in this
i'm a little bit interested in knowing
if anybody made a mistake right in the
decision making
but i'm way interested in how decisions
are made
and
you know just the process of decision
making so i'm going to draw it out the
way i see it
i see that there were
two options
but in your mind you can of course
translate to there were infinite options
in between but just for analytical
purposes let's keep it simple and say
you know if these two options give us an
answer
maybe it would be similar for the the
ones in between as well
so
if we do a fast exit and that's what
happened our military starts packing up
the and we know this we don't have to
guess we know the afghan government
immediately left
and that created a bunch of cat chaos
and the the only hope of getting
getting the people out
the 30 000 people the only hope
is that the taliban gives them safe
passage
now what are the odds what are the odds
that the taliban would give the
americans a safe passage
well let's look at human motivation
now we know the taliban are kind of
crazy
so we think oh they'll do anything
they'll kill anybody and that's
certainly a big risk
but
what is the taliban's big
self-interest
what do they want more than anything
the taliban want more than anything
to get american military out of there
what would be the worst way they could
get what they want
the worst thing they could do is start
killing those
americans who couldn't get out or
anybody else who wanted to get out it's
the worst thing they could do
they've already said that they're not
going to go after the interpreters
i don't know if you could trust them i
mean that would be kind of iffy right
but they're saying the right thing
which means that they understand where
their self-interest is and they're
pursuing it
if somebody announces here's my
self-interest and you can look at it
yourself and say yeah that is your
self-interest you want us out first
then you might turn into a very bad
people again
but at the moment
just stay cool and you'll get everything
you want just stay cool for a month get
all the people out
you'll be fine
now could you have depended on that to
be true
not really because it's the taliban
right you can't really predict all the
way to the end
but you could predict chaos i think that
was predictable because you could
predict that the government would fall
that's how human motivation works as
soon as they're exposed they're going to
take care of themselves and get the hell
out of there
so that's what we ended up with but
let's say we've gone the other way and
done a controlled
trump-like uh withdrawal where we kept
forces there and did an orderly
evacuation
how would that go
well a lot of people are saying well
that would have worked
you keep the military you get rid of all
you get all the evacuations done and
then you remove the military very
orderly right
makes sense pretty much everybody would
think that makes sense
but there's one problem and it's the
place where i differ in assumptions with
most of you
it happens right here
i think that as soon as you begin the
civilian evacuations
you've signaled to the country that
you're leaving
why would people who are afraid of the
taliban wait
what would make them wait around
i think that the afghan government falls
under both scenarios and all the ones in
between
that's my assumption which makes me get
to a different opinion than you what is
my assumption based on
human motivation the same human
motivation that made the government fall
when we left quickly
would be exactly the same
as it would make the government fall if
we left slowly
because in both cases they'd say oh
hell i gotta get out of here
one time slowly one time fast but in
both cases that has to do with the re
the people leaving it doesn't have to do
with the government the government would
probably bug out about the same time so
imagine trying to evacuate people
as the government is falling
and you don't have enough forces because
you've already drawn down you can't
protect everything and i guess
we're being told they couldn't protect
the embassy kabul and bagram at the same
time they didn't have the forces
couldn't do it
so they had to make some choices
they made them and they were all bad
choices but you know leadership right
you got to make bad choices if you only
have bad choices you still have to make
a choice
it's leadership
so
i believe that if it had been a slow
withdrawal you would have seen something
closer to a civil war
if the afghan government had tried to
stay and fight there would have been a
civil war
door-to-door
probably any any people who couldn't get
out of the country at that point
probably would get killed because there
was no point in not doing it
so
i feel as though the slow withdrawal
would have caused the same amount of
chaos
because the government was going to fall
anyway
um and then you would have a civil war
and this might happen before you got
people out
so you might be evacuating people in the
midst of a civil war
seems worse now of course it was a civil
war it just happened 11 days so you
barely noticed it so
here's how
economists
debate each other
and it's different than the way the rest
of the world debates each other
the way the economists debate each other
is they usually
just look for where you have a
difference in assumption because
economists generally think the same you
know they have a similar kind of
reasoning skills
they know how to compare the right
things they know the difference between
short ter short term and long term
they know what a sunk cost is etcetera
so the only place we tend to disagree
is not the reasoning so much as in the
assumptions
and so i think the only assumption
that puts me on a different page from
some of you is the assumption that if we
done it slow and orderly
the afghan government would have stayed
in business and kept things going i
don't think there's any any reason to
believe that's true
so
in the comments
is anybody persuaded
to the following point of view
that we can't know from our perspective
as civilians sitting here we can't know
if that was a mistake
because we don't know what the other way
would have been
because you don't know if the afghan
government would have still surrendered
so quickly
that it wouldn't have made much
difference
um yeah we're all we're all guessing
that so
um
economists like paul krugman
you know
what what mistake does paul krugman make
doesn't he always make the same mistake
human motivation
um
yes
all right so i'm looking i just want to
see if
um oh somebody says plausible
all right i just wanted to see
if any any of you would agree with me
that we really don't have the
information
or the insight to know how poorly things
went
so now of course trump is doing uh
exactly what trump should do which is
he's going at this hard
and man you do not want to give trump
this much of an opening
because he is just dancing on
on the graves right now
i mean trump
is if you wanted to say like what is
trump good at
it's this
trump is really really good
at spotting an opening
that's you know got a little weakness
and just going in and just killing it
and he's doing that now so he's giving
some interviews yeah and
you forget
it's easy to forget how much we
appreciated just the way trump talks
everything he says is just closer to
like something that's real and raw than
what other politicians say
and and even if you you know if you hate
him and you don't like what he's doing
you still feel there's some kind of
weird truth at the bottom of it isn't
there or at least it's his truth you
know he's telling you his actual opinion
um now of course there's plenty of
hyperbole and fact-checking problems and
stuff but weirdly trump has this
strange honesty that comes through in a
lot of stuff
and and here's another example trump
said i realized i had a loser with
chairman speaking about
mark milley the general
and this is the single greatest
embarrassment i've ever seen and then he
went through the logic of how he would
have kept troops there and and withdrawn
people now when trump tells it
he has the advantage of hindsight
so trump can tell the story as if he
knew all along that the afghan
government would fall in 11 days
right because we all act like that we
all act like we knew that well we knew
that
pretty obvious afghan government was
going to fall in 11 days we didn't know
that
you didn't know that you just knew it
was going to fall
now if the afghan government had lasted
a few months
probably things would have been fine
right
we probably could have gotten people out
and the afghan government would have
been you know
maybe good enough to help get people out
so
you know trump has the the advantage of
hindsight but that's politics you know
he gets to he gets to dance on this one
and he is so good job and persuasion
trump is doing and
and who can argue that he wouldn't have
done a better job
you can't
you can't argue that you you i mean
i can give you a intellectual argument
about how maybe he would have done a
better job
but you don't know
you don't know
there's no way to compare
and it seems to me that trump was on a
faster schedule of drawing troops down i
don't know how that would have worked
out better
right i mean trump's trump's claim is
that he would have done it faster
but more controlled
okay
i i think it's just the advantage of
hindsight
i feel as though any president who is in
office would have been killed by this
issue
so trump
he gets the win that the vaccinations
didn't get
you know as widespread as they could
have and we're still in the coronavirus
problem so that's going to accrue to
biden even if there's nothing he could
have done about it
and
uh and then the afghanistan thing is
going to look like biden's problem i
tell you
what would have been luckier than trump
losing the second term
think about it
yeah think about it the luckiest thing
trump ever did was lose the second term
because if he'd been president his whole
administration would look like
this
it would look like bad news on
coronavirus followed by bad news on
afghanistan would have been terrible
but now trump gets to say well if i'd
been there
things would have been better and he's
not wrong
you just don't know
i mean it might be wrong just no way to
know
all right
um
one of my favorite stories
of the day
is that apparently larry david and alan
dershowitz got into a screaming match at
a grocery store
which
uh which is pretty funny to me
so can you just imagine that because it
seems exactly like a skit
from
larry david show and i hope he turns it
into a skit
let me make a suggestion
larry david if you're listening
ellen dershowitz
if you're listening
just put this on curb
this is a perfect episode you probably
already thought that i don't have to
tell you that right it's like it's like
i think i'm telling larry david what a
perfect episode of curb your enthusiasm
looks like it looks like this and i
think he knows it so
if you want to get a lot of people
watching your show
invite alan dershowitz
to just do an episode and just do the
scene
do the grocery store scene
whereas i don't know if you know how uh
curb your enthusiasm larry david show
i don't know if you know how he scripts
it but he only scripts it approximate
so that the actors are kind of doing
their own thing and making up lines you
know to a model
but they they stay within the model and
make up their own stuff wouldn't you
like to see
alan dershowitz playing the role of
ellen dershowitz running into larry
david playing the role of larry david
in a grocery store
exactly the way it happened
would you like to see that you know and
add a few maybe add a few you know jokes
to exaggerate a little bit come on
that would be the best tv
how could you not watch that show
that would be great
and here's the thing
you know it sounds like larry david is
you know genuinely mad at ellen
dershowitz for supporting trump
and
here's what you don't want to do
if you get into a public disagreement
with somebody
here's a little tip here's a little tip
on managing your your public
your public personality
don't get into a public argument
with the most verbally gifted lawyer
in modern times
it might not go well
right
larry david excellent at writing tv
shows and appearing in them excellent
but
arguing your case
alan dershowitz a little bit better a
little bit better if you wanted somebody
to argue to the supreme court
who do you pick larry david or alan
dershowitz i think i'd pick ellen
dershowitz and here's what
uh ellen dershowitz said which
became one of the quotes in the press
uh so dershowitz is talking about larry
david and about this situation he says
while he was writing bad jokes i was
helping to bring about peace in the
middle east
and dershowitz told us what has he done
now
how much do i frickin love this response
it's actually true
you know that right
that dershowitz actually did
help create peace in the middle east you
know not as much as you know
jared and navi berkowitz but
he was part of that
this is this sounds like a joke right
larry david wrote jokes
and alan dershowitz
in part because he did have a
relationship with you know the
administration and he you know he was a
critic
as well as a supporter based on where
the law went
you know he was following the law it
looked at me like he was just following
the law i didn't see actually any bias
honestly and i would call it out it's
not like i'm such a team player
that you know i can't identify somebody
who's just being a team player
but i had never saw that with dershowitz
did you
did you ever see dershowitz say
something
that was contrary to the law
right
somebody says it's a boring topic for
non-americans it probably is
probably is do non-americans not know
who dershowitz is or larry david
i guess it depends where you are but you
do need to know those two personalities
however
yeah yes
you don't want to get into an argument
with somebody who is contributing in a
very productive way i would guess
to peace in the middle east
right that's not a fair fight
one
wrote really good jokes
the other
help solve the most unsolvable problem
in the entire world
peace in the middle east i mean it's we
don't have peace in the middle east but
got a lot closer
so
that was good
all right
here's another little uh
tip
if
you're looking to escape go to somebody
and you want to make it look like if
there's a big disaster
you want to make it look like somebody's
problem somebody made a mistake
you want to pick somebody who looks like
general mark camille
now
um
also the is austin who's the
secretary of defense
those two guys
standing in front of the public
as sort of that you know the leadership
pair
they look dumb
now luckily for me
one of them is white
so because otherwise you'd be like you
racist
why do you say that the black guy is
dumb
i don't say that
i say that there was a black guy and a
white guy and they both looked numb to
me
now
are they dumb
clearly not right you know clearly if
you had either of those guys
take the s.a.t test or an iq test
against let's say me
they might beat me
i mean on paper they might be smarter
than me i don't know maybe
but
can we agree on this
no matter how smart they actually are
and i can't imagine you could become a
general or secretary of defense without
being pretty darn smart
however smart they are
would you agree with the following
statement that they don't look smart
anybody
and again you know this isn't racial
because it's a white guy and a black guy
and they both have that same
sort of vibe to them
they just don't make me feel confident
right
and they looked a little extra dumb
because the afghanistan situation primes
you to think that they're dumb and then
they act that way and it's just uh
it's just a little too much
yeah they're woke yeah you know it's fun
to tie that together and say oh they're
so woke and that's that's the real
problem
but i'm not so sure
i'm not sure that's the problem
um
all right here's my next question for
you
if if it's true that the
uh
the vaccinated states
have lots of icu capacity and the
unvaccinated states such as alabama are
running out of icu capacity
is there anybody
including my mascot anomaly you know my
mascot he used to be my critic but he
just became so silly he's more like a
clown so i feel like he's more of a
mascot than a critic at this point
but
my mascot still thinks that the
vaccinations are a mistake
is there anybody who at this point
and this is a question not a statement
it's going to sound like it's a
rhetorical question but it's not there
yet
could we
in the comments
tell me your opinion
can we conclude with what we know now
that the vaccinations worked
now that doesn't mean you don't need a
booster
so i think of them more as therapeutics
but
did the vaccinated states get a better
outcome than the unvaccinated states in
the comments
tell me do we have enough data yet to
know just in terms of the icu traffic
all right i'll just limit it to just icu
capacity
can we say that vaccinations work
just for icu capacity
let's see in the comments
a lot of people say no
a lot of people say not yet
i don't know that you're wrong
because what if i told you from the
beginning don't look at one state
and don't look at one other country like
sweden
and think that that tells you something
those are illusions
we so easily can be fooled into saying
oh
uh lithuania did one thing and got a
good result so it must be that one thing
it's not
there are lots of variables going on
let me ask you this
is alabama about the same
bmi about the same weight as the rest of
the country
yeah he didn't see that coming did he
yeah if alabama is also substantially
fatter
than the rest of the country
no matter what was happening their icus
would have
much more problem right now i don't know
if how much that's factored into any of
this
but oh and somebody says that they have
i'm seeing in the comments they have a
larger black population and we know that
they have worse outcomes
do we know for sure
and i honestly don't know the answer to
this question do we know for sure that
the vaccinations are the difference
in the icu
capacity
now
i'm leaning toward
yes right so i'm seeing most of you say
no but i feel like most of you are
saying no because
you're you're skeptics
right i feel like you're sort of
committed to the skeptical position so
you're saying well it's not proven yet
and i would agree with you by the way
that i don't think it's proven to a
level that i'm willing to say it's just
a fact
but i think we're moving that way
it feels like we're you know we're
moving in a direction where questioning
whether vaccinations
helped a hospital capacity
i think it's moving in a direction where
it will be dumb to question it fairly
soon but not yet
i would say so far you're on solid
ground
to generally say we don't know what's
happening anywhere or why
that feels like a pretty good position
to be in for a long time
but over time
that complete you know
ambiguous view of the world will start
collapsing into
some things we know worked and some
things or at least science will decide
some things worked and some things
didn't
um
scott is shilling for his big form of
bosses that killed his stepson with a
fentanyl patch on his arm
dr johnson so one of my trolls here
let's get rid of you
hi the user on this channel i can't even
tell
if these are real trolls
like who would really think that i'm
shilling for a pharmaceutical company
like you'd have to be pretty dumb to
have that opinion
um
and by the way
if there's a pharmaceutical company that
would be willing to pay me
to shill for them
please contact me make me an offer
i can't imagine how much they'd have to
offer
like how much money would i have to take
to sell somebody's like pharmaceutical
stuff i mean
let's take the assumption everybody has
a price
right just take that assumption
everybody has a price
so let's say i have a price
what would i have to take
to
sell pharmaceuticals to you without
telling you that that's what i was doing
because if i got caught
i mean that's the end of my career and
reputation and everything else right so
what would it how much would you have to
give me
yeah my current income level and you
know lifestyle etc what would you have
to give me
uh somebody said
that they might offer 50 000. yeah i
mean what they would have to pay me
would be something in the tens of
millions
to you know to to bend my ethical
construct
and yeah i'd like to think that they
couldn't do it right i'd like to think
i'd turn down a billion dollars
but i also believe in human motivation
and if you really got offered a billion
dollars
you might get flexible you know we all
like to think we wouldn't
i'd like to think that myself i mean i
genuinely like to think that i would
turn down a billion dollars
but until you're in the situation
you know you can imagine that cognitive
dissonance would get the better of you
and you'd be like you know i was totally
opposed to this at ten thousand dollars
but now that you're offering a billion i
see the wisdom of your argument i mean
that's what would happen
you you started thinking the other side
wasn't as bad
and
well
you know if they gave me a billion
dollars i could you know help people
with it and that's not bad you would
talk yourself into it at some dollar
amount you were talking yourself into it
but my dollar amount
is nowhere near what they would pay
right i mean i would be in the tens of
millions
are they gonna pay me tens of millions
when they can get
you know somebody at anomalies level
for
five thousand dollars
i mean not him because he's on the other
side of the issue but you can get
somebody with a big audience
who doesn't have money
right so
so what i i tell you all the time that
if you have a degree in economics where
you understand business and business
models you can see around corners
so somebody who thinks that i would be
taking money to shill pharma products
doesn't understand economics very well
because you couldn't come up with a
price
where that business model makes sense
for me but you could for somebody who
had a big audience and didn't already
have money
so if you're if you're thinking an
influencer let's say on instagram
is shilling that's pretty good guess
maybe yes maybe no but it's a good guess
if you're guessing that somebody who's
already rich is shelling shilling for a
pharma company
it's very unlikely
i mean anything's possible right but
it's deeply unlikely that i would take
i mean do you think i would take a
hundred thousand dollars to shill a
pharma product
not even close
do you think i would take a million
dollars a million dollars let's say tax
free let's so let's two million dollars
so i get a million dollars after taxes
would i take two million dollars
before taxes to sell pharmaceuticals to
you and not tell you i was doing that
no freaking way
no way because a million dollars
wouldn't change my life in any way i
wouldn't even notice the difference
so
learn economics and you can see around
corners this this is one of those
i mean clean cases of that
all right
[Music]
let's hope
i do hit these points too long don't i
you know one of the uh problems with
having a diverse audience you're you're
all over the board in terms of what you
know about and
etc is it's really hard to craft a
general
live stream that hits everybody's
attention span just right
so i'm aware of that
um
and did you notice i'm seeing the locals
comments here
um
did you know notice the dilbert comic
this week
the dilbert's employer is doing gain of
function tests on the employees
trying to take that headline and match
it with the dilbert comic and
unfortunately the game of function
experiments on the employees
the
the gain of function experiments made
them grow tails which actually made them
more efficient so they like the tails
all right
somebody says diversity doesn't work
why are you saying that is that even
related to the topic diversity doesn't
work
what
i would disagree
whoever said diversity doesn't work i
disagree
i i agree
that it's not a solution but i disagree
it's always negative there are lots of
situations when having you know more
points of view representative
represented gives you an advantage
every situation is just different
i don't think you want diversity for the
sake of diversity
but it's a mistake to say diversity
hurts you it just depends on the
situation
uh
scott schtick is getting
started to get kind of tired chris b
says well you know what it is is that
my analysis
usually persuasion
influenced
i can only i can only talk about the
news
and if the news gets in a rut
it does affect me
right i can't make up news
but uh maybe i should
um
oh
just looking at some of your comments
here
you need trump yeah we all need trump to
keep us all fired up but i have to admit
i'm going to admit that
my life has been a lot calmer
and i would say that my mental state has
been better without trump
can anybody say the same
now i can still you know wish we had
trump for a variety of topics
so that's still true
but as i've said it's it's
i don't think there's such a thing as a
good president and a bad president i
think you have presidents that fit the
topics of the day and ones that don't
and i think trump fits some topics
really well and then others you know
like the coronavirus may be less so
all right more about desantis uh he
hasn't done much today has he
yeah
um
treatment tense in florida is that
what's happening
you know i wouldn't look too much at the
contingency planning states are doing
like we hear some stories about you know
such and such a state is uh bringing in
like refrigerated trucks for bodies and
stuff that's just smart
you know preparing for stuff just makes
sense i don't judge that
all right that is all i have for today
i've got to go do some stuff and i'll
talk to you tomorrow
