see if this works I just uh quit and uh
re
reinitiated can anybody see me do we
have video and
audio look at that video and
audio
good
uh just give it up
there there's somebody there trying to
debunk my debunk of the uh of the
drinking bleach chokes there is no
debunk of the
debunk don't waste your
time only audio on video
H so Audio Only on locals all right I'm
going to turn off
locals let's see if we can kill locals
oh all
right looks like that didn't
work trying to kill it but I
can't wa we got technical problems
people but nothing we can't
solve rumble's
okay um is anybody seeing video on
locals looks good
all
right looks like you got a lot of
complaints about the technology
today no video for you at
locals is there anybody who's seeing the
video on locals I need you to say I see
video on
locals is there anybody who's willing to
say that you see it on locals
stream will start
soon getting all kinds of answers maybe
it's a difference between the browser in
the
app
oh so you really have no nobody's going
to answer the question either
right
uh really you're not going to answer the
question if you can see the video
local says the stream is ended well it's
a new stream so there's a second Stream
So I killed oh that's what it is I
killed the first Stream So if you're
seeing a dead one it might be the first
one the second one should be
working it looks like that's all you
want to talk about today is your bad is
your technical
problems all right well I'll tell you
what I'm do instead of asking you and
not getting an answer I'm going to look
at it
myself see what
happens all right
um
okay so I'm I'm watching myself live on
locals so everybody who says it's not on
locals I'm I'm literally on locals at
the same time I'm Broadcasting from a
different different
device you can see this right so there's
no question about whether it's working
on locals because you're watching
it you're watching it in real time it's
working so why are so many of you saying
it's not
working all right well here's what we're
going to do we're going to try to press
on you turned it off twice when I did
have both audio and videos someone is
pranking you
so but it had to be multiple people
because it's not one
person all
right I'm a des and there's no video on
locals on the desktop PC there's no
video I I believe you're
wrong and I'm going to go to my desktop
and check see I'll see if the browser is
working uh
let's see so on the app it definitely
worked but we're going to get to the
bottom of this because I can't do
anything without
it all right log it in on the
browser trying
again the stream was too
short well that's interesting
yeah the browser um so the browser is
not working for
sure so try the app because the browser
is definitely not working so that that
was the problem is that the people in
the browser were seeing it not working
but the people on the app were seeing it
working all right well looks like that's
the best we can do for
today all
right have you ever noticed that if I
don't start off well and never get gets
better has anybody notied
that why is that not
working there we go there we go there
you
are all right well
let's see what we can
do Andrew the most recent entry is the
pre-show the most
recent
God I'm going to have to turn off the
comments because it's all you want to
talk
about and I can't really do the show
when you're doing
that all right
so if anybody wants to clear their cash
or any of that
stuff uh go ahead and do
that oh my
goodness what a complete a complete
disaster I'm drinking some coffee and
trying to
recover all right we probably have to
stop doing the pre-show cuz this seems
like that's what's messing up the
show so anyway
man well I'm glad you're here with me in
the morning anyway uh let's see we got
uh only 11 people on
locals
really
866 on
Rumble all right well here's your
simultaneous
hip ah
all
right you migrated from locals all right
so you're jumping over to uh
Rumble
good all right good for
you well here's the uh here's the news
of the day if you're watching the
Dilbert comic if you're a subscriber
um you would be seeing that Wally is
trying to bage his multiple AI
girlfriends so if
you're if you're subscribing to Dilbert
you'll see Wally try to figure out how
to have a herum of AI girlfriends and
they're not happy about it all right so
I've been asked this question a number
of
times uh this morning uh have I seen The
Joe Rogan show on whether we really
landed on the moon or whether it was
faked
uh I I haven't and I'm told that if I
were to watch it I would be totally
convinced that we did not land on the
moon how many of you who have seen it
would agree with that characterization
that if you've seen the Rogan I guess
Joe Rogan was talking about it
um Michael I I'm just GNA I have to take
a pause here why did Scott make a second
version of his drink bleach H debunk PDF
because the first proved his own debunk
was false
no nothing like that happened so stop
hallucinating just stop hallucinating
nothing like that happened in the real
world take your
meds take your meds go back to sleep all
right you're literally
hallucinating all right so the uh Rogan
the Rogan show that I didn't see um do
you know what I'm going to say about
this can can anybody anticipate what I'm
going to say about the show I didn't
see uh it's the documentary
effect so I've been challenged if you if
you watch this show Scott you're going
to believe that we did not land in the
moon of course of course I will that's
what I tell you I tell you that every
documentary is
persuasive and if five minutes after
watching The Joe Rogan program program
I'm completely convinced that we fake
the moon
landing then it would take me 5 minutes
to watch somebody who is involved with
the program say um yeah I did it myself
I was there it was real and then I would
be 100% convinced it was real so here's
what you should not look to as your
guide how certain you are because you
saw one side of an
argument your your level of certainty
that comes from seeing one of an
argument presented over you know an
extended period has
no no validity um or predictive
power the no matter how convinced you
are doesn't mean
anything nothing absolutely nothing and
if I were to watch it on your
recommendation which I probably will by
the way I probably will watch it um I
would be as convinced as you are but
unlike you I would say to myself oh that
means
nothing
nothing nothing however convinced you
are by watching that doesn't mean
anything there's no information value in
watching one side of a discussion if
there's anything I could teach you it
would be
that um we're still waiting for the
Patriot
front uh to reveal itself you know we're
we're all watching the guys that a lot
of people think are feds dressed up in
their khakis and pretending to be uh
some kind of white
nationalist now uh I think it was Elon
Musk who said the media has a startling
lack of curiosity about their real
identities it it's pretty startling
isn't it that these same cats are in the
news over and over again and nobody in
the Press has tried to follow their
truck nobody's gotten you know like a
you know figure out where they rented
their truck or or anything anything does
it remind you of uh when the government
looked for white supremacist in the
military and they couldn't find
any the problem is that the feds have
this whole narrative about all the white
supremacist but they can't find any so I
I think it's pretty obvious that's a
fake group I mean I could be
wrong but it' be really surprised now
let me ask you this do they have a
website
if I I didn't look but if you were to do
a Google search on the Patriot front
would a website pop up so you could see
what they're about and what they believe
and maybe you could even join them if
you agreed with them or is it the only
organization in the entire world who
marches in public year after year is
organized and doesn't have a
website not not email blast that goes
out to everybody that maybe somebody
could get a hold of just nothing like
that just no no online presence
whatsoever now how in the world are they
supposed to
Prevail with whatever it is that they're
promoting if there's no way to contact
[Laughter]
them isn't really the whole point of
demonstrating to get more people on your
side and they don't have any way to
join it's so fake it's so fake it's
hilarious well air of the dawn has some
new music based on uh some of my
podcasting and the baset case Theory so
if you haven't heard that it's on my XV
today there's a big breakthrough in
sodium battery chemistry um Mass
synthesis
so I think it's the mass synthesis part
not just the fact that they can do it
but there's this new kind of battery
coming these sodium batteries are
supposed to be the
best and we're going to need a lot of
sodium batteries for your home
robots um New York City reached a $2.1
million settlement for toxic whiteness
discrimination so there are three white
women who were replaced they say with
less qualified people of color now less
qualified in this case means you know
somebody had a college degree and
they're replaced with somebody with a
GED I think in one case um and the three
white women won their discrimination
suits they they were literally replaced
for being white and no other
reason in the real world that happened
well we're going to replace you with
some people of color what do I do wrong
nothing you're just you're white
now do you think the floodgates will
open yes they
will because now you can get a Payday
hey white people if you've been
discriminated in employment go get your
pay it's right here you can win now so
it's a winnable
case go get your money let's get
paid that's called reparations
reparations now uh my EXP experience of
life is that for the first 25 years of
my life or so maybe
26 um it was a man's
world so from the time I was born in
1957 to early 80s mid 80s I would say it
definitely was an advantage to be a male
in
America sometime around when I was about
25 26 it changed abruptly and and all
economic opportunities just you know
dried up at least if if they had any
choice of hiring somebody besides you so
I would say for the past I don't know 35
years it's been massive discrimination
against white men which I call
reparations now if it's not reparations
then I think the white people need
reparations of their own so either we
should cancel the conversation about
reparations because they're already paid
many times over or
the white people who lost their jobs for
35 years should get some
reparations I mean reparations are
either a good idea or they're not
so why wouldn't you 35 years of direct
discrimination against white men that's
very reparation worthy yeah yep so
either all reparations or no reparations
I say just be
consistent so on my uh I pinned on my ex
profile a new detailed debunk of the
drinking bleach Ox uh you saw in the
comments there's a gentleman who went
down the what I call the hoax
funnel now the hoax funnel is when you
find out that something you believed
especially if you said it in public has
been
debunked so with uh and there's a hoax
funnel for all the major hoaxes and what
it is is soon as you call out the main
thing they claim they Retreat to a
lesser claim that's sort of in the
domain then you debunk that and they
Retreat to yet another lesser claim
until they get to the bottom and then
all their claims have been debunked and
then you know what happens they start
over at the top like you never had the
conversation and that's what happens
with the fine people hoax and the
drinking bleach HS it starts like this
he never mentioned
bleach so of course he didn't mention
drinking bleach it's because he never
even mentioned bleach and then the hoax
funnel people go okay okay it wasn't
bleach but he said disinfectants you
know he meant bleach he meant injected
into your body then I say he never
mentioned injecting any anything into a
body okay okay he said bring it inside
the body can you somehow bring it
inside and then I say but he wasn't
talking about uh liquid disinfectants he
specified UV
light and then you know what happens
after you've you've uh debunked bleach
and you've debunked liquid
disinfectants and you've made it very
clear they bookended his comments with
light so you knew it was light no doubt
about it do you know what people say
they say the other guy talked about
liquid disinfectants
separately
so that must mean Trump meant liquid
disinfectants no it means that the other
guy talked about liquid disinfectants
separately
that's all that
means it doesn't mean Trump was because
Trump was very specific light and light
was being you know being talked about
for testing at the
time so you can see here there was
somebody having a um a mental condition
uh over in Rumble who is screaming but
Scott you debunked yourself nothing like
that happened I mean you could read it
yourself it it's as clear as it could
possibly be and uh but the people who
are uh suffering some kind of TDS are
just imagining that they see words that
aren't on the page it's kind of
fascinating so anyway speaking of things
which aren't true uh Spielberg is uh
allegedly going to help Biden with his
strategy and he's been in multiple
strategy sessions now does it make sense
that the greatest movie maker of fiction
would be helping Biden yes it does has
Biden uh courted other makers of fiction
yes he has uh youve heard of Rob Riner
famous maker of fiction you've heard of
Stephen King famous maker of fiction do
you see a pattern yet let's see here are
the things that Biden ran on the Russia
collusion hoax fiction the fine people
hoax fiction that January 6 was an
Insurrection hoax fiction the drinking
bleach hoax f fiction the inflation is
totally under control
friction
fiction and basically his entire
campaign is fiction and then he just
hired a fiction director for
advice could it be any
clearer are there any questions left
it's literally they're trating it like
fiction they're not hiding it anymore
they just blatantly will'll just make up
some stuff and we'll have this you know
crazy demented guy say
it but don't forget how many lives that
Biden is saved when he was a lifeguard
and that was even after his uncle was
eaten by cannibals so yeah you better
hire the fiction directors for for the
help I wouldn't I wouldn't get the
reality people
involved I saw a uh some stats by Rob
Henderson um well he was reporting the
stat that's on X 35% of American Elites
then that would be defined as people
with postgraduate degrees earning
150,000 per year or more and live in
large cities 35% of those Elites say
they would rather cheat than lose an
election
35% said they'd rather cheat in an
election than lose it whereas uh
um regular ordinary voters people who
were not the elite only 7% would be
willing to
cheat so if ordinary normal people 7%
would be willing to cheat but of college
educated or postgrad uh people making a
good living in a large city 35% of that
mov be willing to
cheat now we have mail and
Bots whether the number is 7% or 3 5%
it's enough to change the election
results so how in the world does anybody
think our elections are not
rigged given what we've learned since
2020 now when I say uh you know I don't
mean that they necessarily counted the
votes wrong
necessarily but if you have an ability
to rig and you have a large percentage
of people who say yeah I would and then
on top of that there was a separate
survey showing the percentage of people
I think one and five admitted doing
something illegal with mail and votes
admitted
it so somewhere in that 7 to
35% range is people who are absolutely
willing to cheat and they have the means
and the opportunity to do it and that
that's the election that we designed
intentionally intentionally because we
know how to make an election where that
doesn't happen make it a official day
off for everybody paper ballots two
people looking at every ballot so
there's a Republican and a Democrat
you're done the same
night no doubt about it it's audited
basically you could audit at the same
time you count the votes you just need
two people and you could easily get
volunteers how hard would it be to get
Republicans to sit next to the Democrat
counting the votes and vice versa it be
easy the the fact that it could easily
be done and we don't do it is really all
the evidence you need that there's no
seriousness about a fair
election now as I've said before I'm
pretty sure America would be better
described as a a criminal organization
maybe for the past several
decades and we're we're in a competition
with other criminal networks such as
china such as
Russia and and I think to imagine that
any of them are some kind of represent
of government is just naive at this
point it it's just a bunch of criminal
Enterprises battling it out for you know
ultimate control that's what I see I saw
a advertisement for a cirrus jet that's
a private jet tiny little jet you could
buy and it's got a feature now where if
the uh
pilot um becomes incapacitated passes
out dies or something the passengers can
land the plane by pushing one
button did you know that it can land
itself at the at the airport the
destination airport I think or the
closest one I'm not sure but it's
literally one button you reach up and if
the pilot passes out you go oh you push
the button and the plane goes and lands
itself
perfectly now let me tell you what
profession I would not be entering at
the moment
pilot I'm not sure that's a long-term
job anymore I mean it might be but if
you could land a jet by pushing one
button and don't you think you could get
better results with a AI than with a
human pilot maybe not right away but
probably within a year the AI will land
that plane way better than a human pilot
faster reflexes you know no human error
I'm sure
well there's now already a robot called
an
astrobot I guess that's the company so
post by Bar
Z um and it showed this robot cooking
and cleaning and folding laundry and
doing basically anything at a fairly
good
speed now it's
coming it's coming people the the age of
the robots will be upon us and I don't
know if you've had had this issue but
there's some things that we know are
going to happen that are so big I can't
make my brain think about them and this
is one of them that we will all have a
robot in maybe a year well not all I
mean it's there going to be a price
point but people can afford a robot are
going to have a robot in a year and
they'll just be working in your house
just working in your house and I can't
even hold that in my head really it's
sort of too big of a thought but there's
a whole bunch of stuff they're just too
big to think about like what are we
going to do with our debt I don't know
it's too big to think about maybe robots
are the solution to the
debt no robots for you oh you're getting
a
robot uh Reed Hoffman you know famous
billionaire founder of LinkedIn PayPal
Mafia Reed Hoffman he created an AI
generated deep fake of himself and
interviewed it
that's right he did what I have been
planning to do but he got there first he
fed a a personal AI he fed it with all
of his books so they could talk like he
did and then he made a perfect uh
version of it that would he would talk
in a split screen and have an interview
with it and he interviewed
himself and it was pretty darn good now
I'm going to do the same thing um I
think I'm going to revise
my uh estate plan to have some money to
keep my AI running after my death
because I'm building the Dilbert Museum
in my house here you know maybe it'll go
somewhere else later but at the moment
um in a year or so you'd be able to tour
the Dilbert museum with my robot or with
my AI deep fake on a video screen so you
could have me explaining or answering
any question from any my podcasts or
books or or or posts I
guess so that's coming now that's
another thing that's way too big for me
to even hold in my head I can describe
it and I can imagine it but it's way too
big to hold in my head that in one year
there'll be a robot me walking around
giving a tour in my
voice it's just too big I can't really
hold that in my head even though I can
describe it it's the weirdest thing
all right I got a question for
you so it looks like there's a good
chance Tik Tok will be either banned or
sold to an American company right now B
Dan says it's it'd rather go on a
business in America than sell it but
we'll
see question who was the first person
public figure to call for the uh Banning
of Tik Tock in
America who who is the first public
figure to call for
that does anybody remember
it was
2020 pretty sure it was
me now uh I think Trump did call for it
in 2020 but it was after
me I think Rand Paul was after me too I
think now I would also like to ask you
this question if you
remember um is somebody saying not you
no not you is not the right answer
if it's not me you have to give somebody
a is um so I posted my uh post on
it yeah I think Trump picked it up after
I
did so I started complaining about it in
February of 2020 I think Trump later in
the year was talking about it now how
many of you remember that when I said I
wanted to ban Tik
Tock you didn't think that was possible
I told you I was going to
single-handedly ban Tik
Tok and then you watched me do it right
in front of
you what what do you make of
that did it really
happen did I tell you in public that I
would personally ban Tik Tock and then
is it not happening just the way I said
it would and when I first brought it up
did you think it was impossible there's
no way way it's going to there's no way
it's going to
happen I bet you did bet you thought it
was
impossible
yeah yeah I believe I was the first one
to call for the ticktock ban now um have
I ever told you the hypnotist can hide
in plain
sight have you heard me say
that the weirdest thing about being a
hypnotist is that because people don't
believe that you can do the things you
can do you can say it in public multiple
times you can do it in public right in
front of people and they will still
think you didn't do
it there's there's almost nothing I
could do that would make you believe
that I had anything to do with
this even though I called it down in
public right in front of
you anyway just a interesting little
side note
um The Guardian a the publication of the
UK uh has an article talking about the
demise of what they call Twitter how a
utopian vision for social media became a
toxic
mess Elon Musk pointed out that the
Guardians traffic is down 2third since
2020 and uh the traffic on X is up it's
up yeah so the uh traditional media is
continuing to embarrass itself while it
goes out of business circleing the drain
the
guardian meanwhile there was some kind
of zombie event in Washington DC called
the uh the White House Correspondence
Dinner have you heard it all all the
zombie reporters who will not have jobs
pretty
soon must go to traditional
event and uh Colin just Jo made fun of
Biden for losing all of his black
support
which is funny cuz Colin Jo made fun of
me for the same thing true
story is I remember Colin Jo was making
fun of me on SNL when I got
cancelled so he stands in front of Biden
and makes makes fun of Biden basically
for the same thing so it's all about me
all right
um so what he said was this was calling
Jo or Jou or just I don't know he said
uh my weekend co-anchor Michael Chay was
going to join me here tonight but in
solidarity with President Biden I
decided to lose all my black
support uh well I think most of the
jokes were pretty
lame so according to the hill Biden is
tied or he's either pulling ahead or
very close to Trump in the National
polls right so that's reported in the
hill despite all observation to the
contrary but CNN has a new
poll which says that Trump is leading
Biden 49 to 43 if it's a two-way race
but it isn't so if it's a three-way race
and you throw in RFK Jr you've got uh
president Trump leads Biden 42 to
33 now I keep telling you that if Biden
wins by a 10-point difference it's too
much to
cheat he's almost there he's looking
like a nine-point difference according
to CNN and CNN is not likely
to you know confess a poll unless
they're pretty serious about it all
right 55% of the people pulled this is
remember this is CNN's poll says that
the Trump presidency was a success but
only 39% say that about Biden these
numbers are not close and by the way
these are the numbers I did expect to
see based on the headlines based on
everything I observe I would expected a
you know nine 10 point difference
between them and I would expect people
massively to think Trump was more
effective and sure
enough
well not to be outdone MSNBC had a panel
of uh of uh undecided voters
so they had the screen with the the zoom
pictures of um I guess the one host and
then all the independent people and the
host asked uh raise your hand if you
think Biden's economy is worse than
Trump's and then the poor host of nmon
BC who asked the group of very diverse
very diverse
Independence raise your hand if you
think Biden's economy is worse than
Trump's and then the host
said so that is uh
everybody every Everybody raised their
hand every
person and the poor MSNBC person is like
ah maybe I should have asked before I
asked that question don't ask the
question if you don't know the answer
the lawyers tell
you well you want to hear the best story
there's so many best stories now I don't
know how true this story is but it's at
least a little bit
true and Julie Kelly is reporting that
there's a new
um new revelation in the mar Lago
boxes you
ready and new revelation in the mar Lago
boxes so it turns out that there was a a
pallet full of boxes that was not at
maral Lago that was held by the
GSA so the GSA being the you know the
group that controls all the documents
and the
GSA
um was trying to get the Trump
organization to take the boxes they were
trying to get rid of them so they were
trying to get the boxes delivered to
Trump at Mar Lago and the question
is were any those boxes marked
classified did the GSA set up Trump by
having a bunch of classified boxes and
then ask them to take the boxes so that
later they could say hey you got all
these
boxes because that's what it looks like
now it's not confirmed because for
example it could be that their boxes had
nothing confidential if that was the
case then it would just be normal to say
hey these are your boxes come get them
but what
if the really controversial stuff was in
the boxes that the G PSA was trying to
push on Trump and maralago what if it
wasn't Trump trying to keep them it was
them trying to give them to him and what
if some of them were classified now that
were some of them classified there's no
reporting on that yet so I don't know
that this is a thing it could be a big
nothing but it could be a thing because
we certainly don't trust anybody at this
point trusting the government would be a
bad play
all right so that's fun to
watch um Kathy Wood who runs a big
investment fund she said uh she was
talking about Robo taxis and she thinks
that the self-driving taxis are going to
be the hugest thing trillions of dollars
not too long and that Tesla might be a
big winner in that Robo taxi thing and
that Tesla is the biggest artificial
intelligence project in the
world and so if you're an investor and
you
think you think that's the way to
go then uh then that's going to be big
we'll see what the stock does on Monday
I'm I own some Tesla stock so that's
full disclosure I I own it because of
robots but autonomous Robo taxis are
cool
too so uh green party uh candidate Jill
Stein was arrested at an anti-israel
protest so
Jill
Stein isn't Stein a Jewish name is she a
Jewish presidential candidate who is
protesting against
Israel I don't think she's serious about
winning
that's I just don't think she's being
serious about winning at
all anyway she got arrested who
cares allegedly there's a new is
proposal for some hostage deal but you
know there's always a proposal so who
knows um but uh what is being offered is
the possibility the possible willingness
for quote a restoration of sustainable
Cal not a ceasefire not a peace but
maybe a restoration of sustainable Cal
at the same time there's reports that uh
the ID IDF is ready to attack any
Rafa but they might be waiting for some
negotiations before they do that so the
big Rafa attack would be the the maybe
the biggest bloodiest part it'll be
bloody if it's not the biggest
and I don't think that uh restoration of
sustainable Comm is anything but a
stalling tactic or
 does that sound like a real
thing to
you uh how about uh we get the hostages
back and uh we'll give you a restoration
of
Cal that sounds like a lot of nothing
but it sounds like better than not
saying it so sounds like uh sort of like
go back to your committee and do some
research yeah we'll have a restoration
of sustainable C that's what we'll have
all right ladies and gentlemen I can't
see your comments your comments stopped
a little while ago
I actually don't know if anybody's
watching uh looks like it looks like
you're still watching but that is the uh
the end of my comments for
today um I think I'll see if I can fire
up a locals feed after this
separately and uh see if I can say hi to
them don't know what happened to the
tech I think it has something to do with
starting two feeds so it's probably a
user error my on my part I think that if
I have the um Rumble going at the same
time as the app which I don't think will
be a possibility in the future uh I
think it might mess it up so it's
probably something I did anyway uh
that's all for now I'm going to say bye
on this stream and I'm going to open up
a stream just for the locals people
subscription only bye for
now for
