hey everybody
it's time for coffee with scott adams
sometimes the best part of your day and
sometimes the best part of
every day yeah and sometimes it's just
the best
thing ever it's hard to decide which it
is today but it's one of those things
for sure and all you need to guarantee
the high quality
of the day is a copper mug or a glass up
tanker jealous just style the canteen
jugger flask vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine
of the day the thing that makes
everything better except china
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
happens now go
that one was extra slurpee i think you
enjoyed it
all right well the rasmussen people
uh have a new poll out very
interesting very interesting they say
that
66 so two-thirds of likely u.s voters
think congress should investigate last
year's violent protests
you know which ones i'm talking about
i'm talking about the
you know last year there were the blm
and anti-fop
mostly in which more than 2
000 police officers suffered injuries
did you know it was that high
2 000 police officers were injured
why is that the first time i've ever
seen that statistic
2 000 that's crazy
um 21 don't think congress should
investigate
and the number of people who want
congress to investigate last year's
violent protest
uh as 66 is much higher
than the 49 who say they want to support
uh
nancy pelosi's looking into the january
6
capital protests let's call those a riot
and 42 say they don't support looking
into january 6th
so here's a question for you
all those riots last year
did all of their complaints get fixed
is that why
uh by the way for those of you on
youtube there's a little
sign in the back that might be useful to
you
it says jesus king is the audio is fine
yes jesus king is the audio is fine
um so
that's interesting because it seems to
me that whatever was driving the protest
last year could not have been legitimate
does anybody would disagree with that
statement that whatever was behind the
pope
the protest last year it couldn't have
been legitimate
because no problems were solved
am i right no problems were solved
so same amount of problem
but no protests interesting
interesting well i would say i would
want to look into that
if 2000 police officers were injured
in in events that are suspicious
and may be organized and maybe organized
in ways we don't understand obviously
they were organized
well in other news the milwaukee
milwaukee bucks
are the nba champions for the first time
in 50 years
uh two surprising things about that
number one um
two surprising things number one
should i just turn off uh youtube for
today
so it looks looks like you got some uh
static over on youtube so we're gonna
turn off youtube for today
and if anybody wants to watch you'd have
to have a subscription over at locals
