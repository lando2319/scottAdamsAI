[Music]
hey
everybody come on in it's time for
coffee with scott adams
best part of your day
yes it is and in a moment i'll be
traveling
to the future i haven't tried this
before
it's a little bit dangerous but i'll be
moving to
2021 and then i'll quickly come back to
the present and tell you what i saw
if i don't make it well i guess i'll see
you at my funeral in 2021
but but
before that what happens before that
i think you know i think you know it's a
simultaneous sip and all you need
is a copper bug or a glass of tank or
chalice or stein a canteen jugger flask
a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the dopamine hit of
the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip
and it happens now
ah i don't know if you can feel it yet
but there is a temporal shift being
formed
um if you don't if you don't mind i'm
gonna
i'm gonna do it now i'm gonna go to the
future
this uh this won't be easy so
ah the technology is not completely
tried
and so um well we'll see what we can do
i'll put on the safety glasses because i
don't i don't know what's going to
happen honestly
this hasn't been tested so i i'm only
going to do one year
because who knows what happens if i do
more than one year
but i'm going to try to do one year and
if i never see you again i'll miss you
and well i just don't know what to say i
love all of you
i'm i'm gonna try to go to the future
now and get you some intelligence about
what's happening
but hold on hitting the switch
hold on hold on
[Applause]
whoa whoa
that was intense i
you won't believe what i saw oh my god
oh my god now before we get going
i know what some of you are thinking
you're thinking i don't think he went to
the future
is that what you think are some of you
thinking
i don't think that was real i don't
think you went to the future well i
anticipated that
so obviously i brought something with me
from the future
um you don't have one of these do you
let's see if you can find one of these
in your store
no that's 20 21 right there
yeah this came from the future and
that's how you know
i was in the future so
here's what we found out um
portland didn't work out uh we had high
hopes for portland but
it didn't go exactly in the way you
hoped
because i know the optimists were
thinking
well maybe it calms down a little bit
the protests stop
pretty soon it'll be a gleaming city in
the northwest
and something we can all be proud of but
it didn't go that way
i'm sorry to tell you portland
actually was renamed
the the value of the property actually
declined so much
that it was purchased by and i hate to
say this but
have you ever heard of the port-a-potty
company they make port-a-potties
they purchased portland and renamed it
so now it's
port-a-potty land so it's just a giant
outdoor bathroom for anti-fog
so that's not that's not as good as
you'd hoped
um the you i know what you guys you're
wondering
who's the president right for those of
you just joining
i just did come back from the future
2021
where i brought this calendar back so
you would know i really was there
and you're probably wondering who is
president
right that's why you're wondering all
right
well that didn't go as well as we hoped
either
i know a lot of you thought oh i hope
president trump gets reelected
didn't go that way sorry
was it kanye no
was it joe biden sort of
sort of you know by election day he had
continued to decline so he was no longer
allowed to use
pencils or anything that a sharp point
on it
but that didn't matter because he had a
strong vice president
and to everybody's surprise a lot of
people thought he would pick
kamala harris you thought that too i
hadn't even predicted that
i had predicted he was going to pick
kamala harris as his vice president
choice
it didn't go that way it turns out he
just went with the deep fake
kamala harris so there is a real kamal
harris but
she had some cosmetic surgery it didn't
work out
so in the end the democratic party
decided to just go with the deep fake
so the the country is being led by
essentially a digital reproduction of
kamala harris
what she used to look like and
i think it's powered by ai
but i'm not sure because a lot of our
regular politicians
couldn't pass the touring test either
so no it's comparable
but let's get to the other news uh as i
remember it
back from 2020 there were some other
things going on
there was a big earthquake in alaska
i don't know if you heard about it in
your local time
but there may or may not be a giant
tsunami coming toward
alaska which is maybe the scariest thing
i've ever heard in my life
if you've seen the line of cars that are
trying to get out of there
so we'll be watching that with great
anticipation
but ron that is my advice
for the citizens who are on the coast
of alaska run and
one more reason for me not to move to
alaska i didn't need a lot more reasons
but
that sort of solved it for me um
did you see that kanye continues to be
the most
interesting person on the planet you
can't take that away from him kenya
does kanye even have the ability to be
uninteresting
he can't do it he has that in common
with
president trump and i think on some
level they they recognize that in each
other
a complete inability to be uninteresting
he just can't do it he doesn't know how
to be uninteresting
so i guess he was tweeting about his
divorce and
you know implicating his wife for having
potentially an affair with
meek mills but maybe not you know maybe
that's not what he meant
we don't know but there's something
interesting going on there
even chappelle went to wyoming
and hung out with kanye for a while and
i thought
i i don't know how any of this could get
more interesting it just couldn't be
you've got everything if you had to say
to yourself
all right scott try to put together the
most
interesting story that you can and you
can pick from any domains and you can
just
put them together just mash them up
what's the most interesting story i'd be
like well
i know presidential election that's got
to be in there
okay uh how about something with a
famous
artist kanye okay um
we would love to throw the kardashians
in there
okay throw the kardashians in there um
can we make it salacious can it be
something with maybe
an indication of possibly some sexual
something
okay throw that in there can we have a
feud
maybe a rapper feud really famous ones
okay
we got that can we have a new album come
out can we throw some
religion in there can we have children
and abortion
can we can we bring it all in there can
we get
racism let's put it all in there
and kanye managed to put it all in there
at the same time that he's announcing
a new album and i'm just going to go out
on the limb
and say that that album will sell quite
well
i think it'll sell quite well
i do not think that you need to worry
about kanye siphoning off
a lot of votes in november it doesn't
look like it's heading in that direction
so uh and he even teased that maybe 2024
was a better time for him to run
we'll see we'll see i told i've been
telling you for a while that no matter
what happens in 2020 it's kind of genius
for him to put his name out there so
he's always in the conversation
and will be for the next four years no
matter what happens in november
um i feel as though
i've been watching the news and watching
social media and i feel as though
the country needs a new cabinet
it should be a cabinet position that
only has one
function when there's a big news story
political story that cabinet will decide
which side is more like hitler because
if you've noticed
pretty much all of our political
conversations end up
with well you're hitler well no i think
you're hitler
no you're hitler no no
you're hitler and sometimes it'll be a
clever comeback to that
and it goes like this no no you're
hitler
and and sometimes there'll even be
another clever comeback after that that
goes like this
no no you're hitler so we need a
um some kind of a cabinet level position
just to sort out who's hitler because i
can't tell
you know i'm looking at portland for
example and i'm seeing antifa
and they look like hitler to me but they
think that the
federal officers were
who are doing some law enforcement up
there they think they look like hitler
how
am i supposed to know who's hitler
somebody
needs to solve this for me tell me who's
hitler so i know who to hate
here's some potentially good news a
uh there are two big uh technical
developments
in face masks i don't know if it's good
that we're talking about technical
developments
and face masks i suppose that's
you know sort of like saying the
airliner went down but you know
somebody's pet survived so it's
sort of you know it's too bad we're
talking about face masks at all but
a quebec company called
i3 biomedical or i think
said they have some kind of a coating
they can put in a face mask
that deactivates 99 of the
the virus so that's pretty cool
who knows how quickly that could be
ramped up or if it's as good as they say
but at least people are actively looking
into how do you make your face masks
really really good at the same time mit
has a prototype
of a silicon mask sort of a permanent
mask that you can easily
you could easily disinfect and
apparently that's
going to be a whole level above other
face masks both of how
how much it covers and how well it
filters
so those are two developments just today
that you know who knows if those
specific things will
ever reach market but it does show you
that people are doing a lot of stuff in
that space which is good
um did you all get a chance to listen to
that
uh yanny and laurel situation you know
what i'm talking about
when things sound you can listen to a
tape
and one person will hear one word
clearly but another person will listen
to the same thing and hear a completely
different thing
but clearly and we've seen this audio
illusion a number of times
most famously with yani and laurel but
yesterday there was just a great one
where i think it was yesterday when
kelly mcinerney was doing her
press conference and
the one of the reporters either said
this is what the reporter claimed you
won't engage oh you won't engage
but if you listen to it on the tape and
you've been primed
to hear it this other way it sounds
exactly like
you're a lying
now those two don't even sound the same
do they
you won't engage and
you're lying b-word
those don't even sound similar but if
you've listened to it
you can hear them both you can hear them
both
can you believe it so you have to
experience it to know that that's even a
thing
and when i heard it i could hear both
but then i but once i heard the lying
b part i could hear that more often
but i'm sure that the actual sentence
was you won't engage
and i think it was but having
experienced that
having experienced hearing the same
words
clearly two different ways
what do you think about roger stone and
what he is alleged
to have said on the phone to somebody
when he was talking to the disc jockey
who believed he had used the word negro
now if i understand the rules
can somebody help me with this i believe
the rules are this
there's no situation in which i could
use the n word
you know the the real n word there's no
situation in which i could use that full
word
even if i were talking about someone
else using it
i think we all agree with that there's
just no there's no situation in which i
can personally
use that word and i agree with that
because it's such an ugly word i don't
have any problem with that
i do think that's a word that needs to
be treated
special right that okay we all agree
that one's just way over the line
let's take it out of our take it out of
her vocabulary
but my understanding is that if i were
to use the word
negro referring to somebody that would
be
you know racist and inappropriate but i
can talk about the word
if somebody else used it i think that's
still okay right
right i'm still okay don't get cancelled
for that
you gotta you gotta look for all the all
the traps
you gotta know where all the trap doors
are
so uh you know i listen to roger stone
say what sounded exactly like the word
negro but after you hear
the kaylee mcinanny situation where you
could hear two completely different
sentences based on
whichever one you've been primed to hear
is it possible that roger stone didn't
say
the thing you can clearly hear
clearly i mean there's no doubt
when you listen to it okay i heard that
very clearly
but i also heard lying
completely clearly and it didn't happen
didn't happen it was not part of reality
but i experienced it
just like it was right in front of me so
could roger stone actually be
telling the truth this one time
i don't think so you know if i had to
bet on it
if you said scott you're going to put
your own money on this
and you have to bet was the word you
heard
completely clearly on the roger stone
thing exactly what you heard
or is it one of these yani laurel
situations well i would still bet that
he
used the actual word i'm just i'm just
introducing
uh the thought that when you see a story
like that
like the roger stone story and it's
based on you're
hearing it with your own ears how much
weight
should you put on that if you heard it
clearly with your own ears how much
certainty should you have well it's no
longer 100
it used to be it used to be you'd be
pretty much 100 sure
with the roger stone thing i would say
well okay i'm i'm 90
sure but you can't really ever be 100
sure can you we're just not in that
world anymore
all right so let's here's an update on
tucker in the new york times
so tucker had claimed that the new york
times was preparing a
an article about him in which his new
uh home location would be revealed
now there is not there was not
a allegation that the new york times
would give his street address
but rather the allegation was that they
would describe it with enough
clarity that internet sleuths could
figure out where he lived
you know they could narrow it down which
would end up being about the same thing
so tucker complained about this publicly
much of the public was on his side
saying this is way over the line if
that's what's going to happen
and the new york times came out and said
no we told him we were never going to
reveal where he lived but of course that
was probably a lie wasn't it
probably they were going to give enough
hints
in a lifestyle story that's what they
said it's going to be a lifestyle
story oh no it's not even going to be
negative it's more about your lifestyle
and of course if we're talking about
your lifestyle well
you've got to describe the situation in
which you live it's perfectly reasonable
because you know the new york times
likes to do lifestyle
lifestyle stories about their
conservative
nemesis nemesis the nemesis i guess
so the new york times has zero
credibility on
their claim that they weren't planning
to do anything of the sort
because it looks like they were planning
to do exactly that
but maybe tucker scared them off and we
won't see that
so we'll wait for details on that i'm
now i'm wondering if there will even be
an article
because if they're smart they'll kill
the whole article
that you don't you don't want anybody
looking at that article and saying
oh i think i can figure out where he
lives from this
because yeah as i said before
i'm not going to try to tell you what
might happen
to the new york times but it would not
be a free punch
if you know what i mean the the blowback
to the new york times
i think would be something they've never
seen before
and they've had a lot of blowback on a
lot of things i would think over the
years
but if they actually targeted uh
tucker's family the level of blowback i
don't think
would be precedented i i think that
would be just
such a nuclear option that um
i don't know if the new york times would
actually survive as a company if they
did that
but we will see
so the united states has mysteriously
but maybe not mysteriously
abruptly ordered a chinese consulate to
close
in where was it houston
uh somewhere in
the in texas anyway so they closed it
and the the vague accusation is that
they were
spying and collecting information and
stealing intellectual property all the
things we know that they do
and uh china has complained
now the importance of this story is
direction the importance of the story
is direction it's not where things are
with china but where they're heading
and it looks to me like decoupling is
unstoppable at this point and we may
even
stop uh i don't know it's possible that
we'll end
political you know any kind of
diplomatic
situation with china it could go that
far
um so trump did a press
his press conference that he hasn't done
in a while in the coronavirus situation
and it was hilarious to see how his
critics
treated him doing everything that they
wanted him to do
so what they wanted the president to do
was to say
it's bad and it looks like it might get
worse
so he said it he said it exactly in
those you know in
those terms and they wanted him to be
pro face mask and he was so he
unambiguously said
use face masks if you can't socially
distance
so and then he didn't speculate too much
on medical stuff which is where he gets
in trouble
so on some level you'd have to say it
was kind of perfect
it was kind of perfect the the public
and mostly his critics but also i think
a lot of republicans were saying the
same thing
that hey you need to fix your messaging
on masks
you need to fix your messaging on the
seriousness of the situation because
you're being accused of not taking it
seriously
you have to be more leaderly so we need
to see your face
talking about it so he did all
everything that he was asked of him
he was literally meaning he showed up in
front of the public
said what he was going to do etc and how
was he treated by his
critics did they say thank goodness this
is exactly what we wanted
we're on track now no they said it took
too long
it should have been done sooner which is
the generic
standard complaint about everything
there's nothing you can do that's right
that couldn't have been done sooner so
they always have that to go to
but now the the big complaint
that's on cnn because they've run out of
their basic
complaints so now they have to get a
little more creative about what the
complaint is
because it's easy to criticize them for
not wearing a mask
like it's simple you've got a photograph
the public thinks about it they're
wearing masks i mean that's an easy one
he doesn't like masks or he won't wear a
mask
but if he starts getting that right and
it appears that
he's he's getting a handle on that they
have to go to more exotic
um criticisms and here's the one that uh
stefan collinson
is using in uh on cnn and i i always
read his article for the laughs
it's freaking hilarious uh how he can
turn
something into nothing or nothing into
something i mean
by by just talking about the president
with bad words
he's really sort of a genius at turning
uh
it into a negative anyway
so he's retreated to the following
complaint about the president
and i don't even understand it and it
goes like this
that the president is not being um
leaderly enough in pushing for
better testing and especially contact
tracing
because those are the things that other
countries did to
get past the coronavirus or get on top
of it
here's my question to you i don't really
understand that
do you because if our tests
can't give us a result for six days or
whatever
and they're terribly inaccurate and
they're not widely available on demand
just because you want one
i don't think we're capable of doing any
of this stuff and would it matter if the
president said
try harder is there somewhere in the
country
that somebody should be trying harder to
invent a test that works quickly or to
do something i'd like to hear a little
bit more from the experts
on this question of of
whether that's even a thing my personal
bias
is that you can't test your way out of
it in a big country like this
if you were an island i think maybe you
could
so if you were an island and you had a
small problem
i think maybe you could you could test
and contact
trace your way out of it and even if the
tests weren't perfect etc
maybe that would be a big part of the
solution but if you have
the united states with you know
thousands and thousands of new cases
unfortunately where we are i just don't
know that contact tracing is even a
thing
because i think it's just too big am i
wrong about that so i'm looking for
some fact checking and if anybody has a
link to somebody later on twitter
to tell me if that's real because i just
don't know if that criticism
is hitting the right scientific and
practical notes
i mean it would be great if you could do
it if you were magic
and you could just do it that'd be great
i just don't know if we have the
capability
to make testing and contact tracing
actually work
i don't i'm skeptical about that
but i could be convinced
the the associated press has announced
and i don't know i guess they're
announcing it again that they will
going forward they will capitalize the
word black when talking about
black uh citizens in this country i
think
in particular but they've decided that
the word white
will not receive the same treatment so
if you're white you'll be a lower case w
if you're black you could be a capital b
uh i'd like to be among the first
i know i'm not the first to say this is
blatantly racist
because it's blatantly racist but i'm
going to extend that a little bit
to this the phrase
white supremacist is just the n word for
white people
and anybody who calls a white person a
white supremacist
uh unless unless that person is labeling
themselves
i suppose if if if you were in a group
that called yourself a white supremacist
and somebody said you were one that
would be fair because you would be
self-labeling in that case although i've
never met anybody who did that
um but if you're calling just ordinary
people on twitter
or ordinary politicians or just ordinary
white people white supremacists
i would say that is blatantly and
completely racist
it is a way to minimize white people
it is a way to lump them all together in
the most
grotesquely racist hit lyric hitlerian
way i could ever imagine
so my personal approach going forward is
that if anybody uses the word white
supremacist
in the n word kind of a sense
as just an insult to a white person that
i will treat them as a racist
and i also think that anybody who's used
the insult white supremacist against a
specific person
and i'll give you some exceptions in a
minute but anybody who's
made a tweet calling somebody a white
supremacist
i think they should lose their job
because if you did a tweet using the
n-word
you'd lose your job and you know uh i'm
okay with that
if somebody does a a social media tweet
and they use the n-word
if your employer sees that they should
fire you
they should fire you because you don't
want to hire anybody who's using that
kind of language
even if they're doing it on their own
time i'd be perfectly okay with firing
somebody for using the n-word in public
absolutely
no no no hesitation
but i think we should apply the same
rule to anybody who's used
the word white supremacist against a
specific person
now here's going to be my exception
white supremacy white supremacy
or white supremacist system
still okay still okay
because that's not racist if if somebody
says our system the way it's organized
is organized in a way that the white
people mostly who
are the elites it keeps them where they
are
i would say okay i wouldn't use those
words to describe it but if somebody
wants to say
that the system that keeps mostly white
people in power
is by definition a system of white
supremacy
i would say i can see that you know just
as a
objective description of the situation
now that's different from
should how do you change it what do you
do about it you know is it really a
problem or is it just the way things
turned out
those are all different conversations
but as a description of the system
i'd say yeah that just that feels
objective
true what do you do about it is a
different conversation like i said
but if you're calling a person a white
supremacist
then that's just the n word for white
people and i think you should be treated
the same
that is my opinion because as
uh charles barkley quite wisely said
you can't end racism with racism
right you can't end racism with
hate and more racism doesn't work
you either play by the same rules or we
don't
now i've got a question about portland
that i don't understand
and i think this has to do with the fact
that
uh people are not like me you know
sometimes you assume that
in fact i was thinking about writing a
book
in which the book would be the biggest
illusions of life
so i would just put together the things
that hold people back the most you know
the biggest illusions
and you know one of the one of the
things on the list would be be yourself
that's like the worst advice but i've
read about that before
uh and i just forgot what my point was
me oh portland
so the biggest illusion in life i think
is that people think the way you do
there's probably no
single illusion about your reality
that is more universal and more damaging
the imagination that other people think
the way you do they just don't
people are all over the board and as
soon as you say they think the way you
do
then you become that mind reader then
you say i know what you're thinking
because if i were in that situation
that's what i'd be thinking that never
works
people are just too different i always
say it never works you could get lucky
but here's why i don't understand
portland
and it's because if i were let's say
let's say i were a retail business owner
in downtown portland
where i lived in portland and my life
had been largely destroyed
by antifa and black lives matter while
the mayor
just watched what would you do if you
were not with antifa
and you were you were let's say
sympathetic to black lives matter
but not to the the protests and you
watched your mayor
allow your entire life to be destroyed
and do nothing what would you do as just
a regular citizen see this is where i go
wrong
because i know what i would do i'm not
recommending this
okay so let me say this up front i don't
recommend this
this is a very bad idea and what i'm
going to say next you should not do this
i'm just telling you what i would do
every single night i would get my
friends together
we would dress all in black we would
pretend to be
antifa and we would put graffiti on the
mayor's house
every night until there was nothing left
of the mayor's house
but graffiti now would you get arrested
for that apparently not
apparently not nobody gets arrested for
graffiti right
the in fact there were some antifa who
marched on the mayor of oakland i think
last night
and they graffitied the mayor of
oakland's house
did any of them get arrested no
no nobody got arrested and if they did
you know suppose it was new york for
example if they did get arrested
they would just be released no bail
that's it
so the thing i don't understand about
portland is the regular citizens
are they in favor of the protesters
because they act like they are
they act like they're in favor of the
protesters
if this were my retail business that got
destroyed by the mayor
i would be in the mayor's driveway every
night
dressed in black with a mask pretending
to be antifa
and i would just tag her house every day
i'd be back there every night and she
would be very frightened
she would be very frightened but i
wouldn't do anything dangerous
because i'm not i'm not violent but i
would make sure that her house
represented something very much like the
business that had just been destroyed
i would make sure that the protesters
had an impact on the mayor that was
equivalent to what was happening
to the the businesses downtown so that's
the part i don't understand
is why are the regular citizens of
portland
not doing the most obvious things that
you would do that's just the most
obvious thing
it doesn't take me to figure that out
right
so this is giving me pause
about whether trump and the federal
the federal agents let's say the
department of homeland security
whether they should get involved or not
because it doesn't seem to be that the
regular citizens of portland care
they don't seem to care because caring
looks different
they would be having their own protests
they would be organized you'd see them
on tv
it would look very different wouldn't it
as far as i can tell the citizens of
portland just
don't even care so why should i care
why should i ask a federal agent to go
into harm's way
to fix something that nobody's asking to
be fixed
the mayor is not asking for it the
citizens of portland apparently are not
asking for it
and antifa is not asking for it
so i just consider that confusing i
don't know what the deal is here
here's my uh prediction i think this is
safe
the polls will narrow before uh
november is that a safe prediction
that the the difference between biden
and trump is going to start
shrinking and by by november it's going
to be
maybe no difference it's going to be
very close to even by november i think
that's a
what do you think would be the reason
for that well some of the polls i
believe are illegitimate
meaning they're not trying to be
accurate and they're trying to show
biden ahead i think they have to
they have to let's say modify their
approach
so that when it gets to election day
they can say well
by election day we were pretty accurate
we just barely missed it
so they they have to in order to cover
up their malfeasance
they have to get closer by election day
i think that's what happened last year
actually or that's what happened the
last election actually
now some some of the pollsters such as
rasmussen
will get there sooner because i think
they're actually doing real polling
so so they'll probably be there sooner
because i think the public is going to
have this conversation
with themselves it looks like this by
november
here are the things that you can
reasonably
safely predict based on current trends
now there'll be still way more surprises
right
so probably the election will be
determined by whatever
surprises happen between now and then
you know
so so the straight-line prediction is
always dangerous
but if you straight-lined it if you did
you would see that the
economy will probably be surging back
it won't be back to where it was but
probably in november
it's going to be stronger than it is
today so that's good for trump
i think that vaccines will be either
already rolling out or almost rolling
out
so that our optimism about this will be
higher than it had ever been
because science will you know eventually
have some solutions by november so
covent is going to look less scary
because it looks like we'll be on the on
the verge of having some vaccines
even if they don't work it's going to
look like it's going to look like a
solution is coming
and then the other trend that i think we
can predict is that biden will continue
to decline
he will have more gaffes uh he will
avoid more
press conferences he will he will have
begged out of any
any kind of uh any kind of a debate
now what's interesting is that even the
supporters of biden
have finally come to accept that he's
not all there
have you seen that i feel like there's
some kind of capitulation
on the left in which they they used to
be saying no
biden's fine there's nothing wrong with
biden
that was just a few months ago now how
do they talk
how do biden supporters talk about their
own candidate
now they say things like well you know
the vice presidential choice will be
especially important this time
right and they say things like well
maybe he's lost a step
right he's not as nimble as he used to
be
you know so even the left has now at
least
fully embraced this is there's something
happening here with biden
but because the election is still
relatively far away
in in our minds not in our calendars but
in our minds is still a little bit far
away
you the democrats still have the option
of thinking trump or no trump
so the frame that most of the people
have
is not biden versus trump although
that's that's growing in importance
it's still sort of trump or no trump and
biden is just the
he's just a stand-in for no trump people
are not really saying give me biden
it's still trump or no trump
in november it's going to be biden or
trump
because you know your mind will just
continue to get focused and more focused
and more focused
and on election day it will just be
binding versus trump
and biden won't even be all there
so i think there will be a number of
people who say you know
if we had any kind of a coherent
candidate i would vote for that democrat
but we didn't get that we just didn't
so maybe i'll take a chance on the other
guy
so one of the things you're going to see
is a lot of anecdotes you're seeing them
already about
there was that person who was a never
trumper who decided to vote for trump
there was that democrat who'd been
voting democrat for
20 elections in a row but this time my
neighbor says
he's voting for trump but you know the
same anecdotes are happening in the
other direction right
the the left is telling all their
anecdotes yes are all these people
they voted trump but now they realize it
was a big mistake and they're voting for
biden this time
so you should ignore all of those
all of those anecdotes have no useful
purpose first of all most of them will
be untrue
and second of all it's happening in both
directions but nobody can count it
you know nobody's actually got any kind
of an accurate poll
to know if there are more people
crossing this way or crossing that way
so you should ignore all of those
stories they have no meaning
whatsoever
yeah both sides do that all the time all
right
um orange man
orange man versus hologram
so here's a little uh extra uh
mystery so we were talking about kamla
harris
and she appeared uh talking about i
guess was about john lewis's death
recently and it looked like i said that
it looked like she had
a plastic surgery of some sort and then
i saw
i think i saw her appearing after that
as in yesterday and she didn't look like
the same person
in other words she didn't look like the
person who had the surgery
it just she just looked different and i
don't know if i heard if i saw an old
interview or a new one
can somebody confirm whether kamala
harris
has been on a televised interview
since the one we saw that her face had
some
changes now if her face was actually
just a cosmetic surgery situation which
it looks like
by november it's going to look terrific
in fact in a few weeks it'll look
terrific
so she you know she may just look
amazing in
a few weeks somebody says they didn't do
the neck that's what i was going to say
because the the current
uh video i saw i thought it was current
but i think maybe i'm wrong about that
um didn't look like there was any
surgery on the neck
somebody says a chemical peel
i don't know that that would cause uh
the structure of the face to look
different
so i'm not i don't think it was a
chemical peel
oh yeah we're still talking about
whether biden wants to defund the police
or simply take their money and
move it somewhere else totally different
totally different
oh no it's not defunding it's just
taking the money and giving
what i guess somewhere else um
all right that's all i got for you today
and i will talk to you
tomorrow if i don't get canceled today
