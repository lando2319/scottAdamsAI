[Applause]
good morning everybody
and welcome to
the best thing that's ever happened to
you in your whole damn life it's called
coffee with Scott Adams and I don't
think
there's ever been a finest finer moment
in the history of
well the universe really
how would you like to take it up a level
I think you would yeah let's take it up
a level
all you need is a cup or a bug or a
glass of tanker tells us dying the
canteen jugular flask of vessel Liberty
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamines of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous hip but it
happens right now go
oh
so good
so good
well today only
normally you know I've got two feeds
going at the same time so one from
YouTube and one from the subscription
service locals normally I allow the
locals feed
to be open to other people
just during the live stream
but today I'm going to close the live
the locals stream
to everybody except subscribers because
I might have some stuff for them that I
don't want to share with the rest of you
anybody notice any uh anything trending
today on Twitter
yeah you know it's going to be an
interesting day when you you wake up and
you check the news yeah see what's in
the news
oh it's me
it's the damnedest feeling
like you wake up in the morning what's
new oh it's me
so if you're not aware I tweeted
yesterday that dilber got
canceled in 77 newspapers
I'll talk about that right after I talk
about a far more important story
that'll be my second story
the first story
have you seen the story about the uh the
woman who's a teacher with enormous
prosthetic breasts
now you've probably already seen the
story of sort of yesterday's story so
it's a little old already
but I just wanted to weigh in with this
one positive thought
now if you haven't seen the visuals the
the actual visual of it is sort of the
story
so it's uh
so as a woman who identifies as a woman
but if you were to look at this woman
you'd say to yourself hey that looks
like a man wearing a wig but that's
unkind and that's not the point that's
just the visual the other part of the
visual is that this woman
uh is wearing gigantic prosthetic
breasts with super prominent nipples
now when I say gigantic I don't mean
Double D
I mean like beach ball size like
I don't know if there's actually any
human beings
who would have her her body size
and that breast size so without
Prosthetics so they're Prosthetics
so but we don't know the story
so here's the best part of the story
it's either a really good prank
like a really good one somebody was
really committed to the prank now I
don't know if that's the case
but if it is the case
that this is a prank
I found my new hero
I so hope it's a prank
I really do because I wanted to be the
best prank ever
because if it is a prank it's a really
good one to fooled everybody
I mean even people were reported that
thought it might be a prank but I'm
going to go with it anyway
uh but here's the other possibility
the other possibility is it's totally
legit
and and this is a person who is just
living their
preferred truth
and doesn't give a what you think
about it
and you know if that's the case
if that's the case
hero
hero
there are only two possibilities here
this is either the greatest prank ever
hero
or this is somebody who doesn't care
about what you think to such an extent
hero
that's all I have to say about it there
are only two possibilities and they're
both hero
I love this woman
so I don't know no matter what else you
think about it and how it connects to
the bigger stories in life I don't think
it does
I mean you can make it connect to
everything else but I feel like this is
a story about one person
right
I it's it's a person who identifies as a
woman
that's all I do anything else would just
be us speculating but I love the fact
that either way you speculate it's a win
so that's not the only one this week
this here's another one that's a win
my favorite story maybe of the whole
year
would be the shipping of the migrants to
Martha's Vineyard all right most of you
love that right
how much did you enjoy
just the political theater entertainment
of that whole spectacle you loved it you
loved it
now what did the Democrats think of it
did they hate it
not really not really they didn't hate
it because they got to show that they
could take care of them now they did it
in their
way which the right criticizes hey you
have the military to take care of them
but they did show empathy they did take
care of them and then they get to
complain that the that the Republicans
are all a bunch of Nazis and
they're acting badly so the the
Democrats got their talking point
and they also got to act like Heroes
because they didn't reject them I mean
not right away the right is arguing well
you rounded them up in 24 hours and took
him to an army base but they were all
well-fed and Happy
now what about the immigrants themselves
well-feded happy did they feel like they
were political Pawns
no
so I think here's the thing that the
general public doesn't understand about
the Immigrant population
but the people who have been sort of
marinating in it for years as I have you
know where I live where I live you're
always around the Immigrant population
and here here's what I can tell you if
you're not
they're awesome
they're awesome
this is some of the best people you'll
ever meet in your life
and here's a perfect example
you wanted them to be all worried about
wokeness and political stuff and
rightness and who's right or wrong and
who who's using people as political
pawns because that's what you're
thinking about right
they're not thinking about that
they're just hey everybody's being
friendly to me hey I made it to America
gosh this wasn't as hard as I thought
I'm on an airplane I've never been on an
airplane
the immigrants are in a completely
different
headspace that you can even imagine you
can't even imagine
like they're they're basically in the
headspace that you would want more of
not less of you'd want more of that
you know this this is why I'm more
pro-immigration than many of you are
because the people coming across I get
to see them up close
right now of course there are criminals
and terrorists and you need some control
over the who gets in I'm not arguing
that
but I'm saying that as a population
they're way more awesome than you give
them credit for way more awesome
in attitude and work ethic and just
a lot of ways it just is pretty awesome
group of people
and let's not be NPCs let's not be NPCs
because what were the NPCs say in this
conversation what's the most obvious
thing to say
what's the most obvious thing to say in
this conversation
but but but they're illegal
you don't need to say that
it doesn't have anything we all know
that it doesn't sound like I'm arguing
for illegal stuff not I'm not you didn't
need to say that
no you don't need to say but but illegal
every time there's a conversation about
immigration you really don't because
everybody gets that part that's that's
never the part that's you know in
question
I mean
You can disagree on it but everybody
knows that's the question all right
here are some more ways to spot NPCs I
tweeted this today
um you could use it too if you see my
tweet take a screenshot of it of it
because every time somebody acts like an
NPC
don't engage them
it would be like talking to the uh your
lawn sprinkler oh the lawn sprinkler
seems to be moving I think it's alive
let's have a conversation with it no
now talking to an NPC is like talking to
a lawn sprinkler
just because it's moving doesn't mean
it's listening
all right so here are the ways one the
NPCs have no accomplishments or stories
no accomplishments or stories it's like
their history doesn't exist
uh they believe art is not subjective
this is the funniest part they believe
there's something called good and bad
about art or humor or movies or drama or
music or books
that's not a thing there's just stuff
some people like and some people don't
that's it
if you believe that it's a yes no
situation you're an NPC
and they're binary thinkers in general
my team good your team bad
so they don't get any nuance
there's no such thing as nuance
they say the most obvious things one
could say in this situation so when I
talk about Dilbert getting canceled in
newspapers what do the NPCs say
what do the NPCs say
when I tweeted that Dilbert got canceled
in a bunch of newspapers
oh I'm sorry Garfield
right
the NPC is flooded in
to say I'm sorry Garfield
or to say well I guess that's because it
sucked
the most obvious things that anybody can
say
all right
um
so let's talk about the news
Bloomberg has an article
about Dilbert becoming the voice of
anti-esg sentiment
now I didn't read the article because
it's
subscription but Bloomberg's pretty big
entity and if they start talking about
Dilbert becoming the voice of anti-esg
then that means I got the attention of
the people in the business world
so the business world now is aware and
becoming more aware
that the Dilbert take on ESG is to mock
it
now just to be clear
I love the objectives of the ESG
who wouldn't want
you know less CO2 if you've got a choice
who wouldn't want
um
you know better social behavior who
wouldn't want a company that represents
the public in terms of its governance
Etc I want all of those things those are
all great things
but what I make fun of is how people
Implement good ideas
yeah management is a good idea right you
can't have big companies without
management
but I mock management all the time is
that because I think companies should
have no management
oh it's about how they do it it's not
that you shouldn't have it
so same with ESG
I don't mind that people have you know
lofty opinions about how to make the
world a better place and that
corporations should be pitching in to do
that it's just that when you throw CO2
in with
racial governance and say it's like one
big score
you get some weird Behavior that's the
funny part all right
so uh so now Dilbert is uh
really now the most prominent Target
critic of ESG which as you know is being
pushed by the largest financial entities
big
you know big hedge funds and BlackRock
and people like that so the big big
Financial entities
tend to like ESG because it gives them
by the way here here's the most General
um problem with ESG
if you know anything about business it
goes like this
you never want to insert anybody between
the business and the customer
that's all you need to know about ESG
because that's what they're trying to do
they're trying to essentially govern how
the company Works independent from that
company's relationship with its
customers
and anytime you put somebody between a
business and their customers you don't
get a good result
it's the same with government
we I acknowledge that some government
um you know regulation of companies is
just necessary because capitalism is
messy some is necessary
but I think we'd all agree there's
something that would be too much
too much government getting involved and
getting between the customers and the
and the company basically
so that's the problem you don't want to
have too many bosses
have you ever worked for a big company
where they say I'm your boss but you're
also a dotted line report to this other
group
how's that work out
that never works I think two bosses well
what it does work for is the employee
it works for the employee because the
employee can always tell each boss that
they don't have time because they're
working for the other boss
yeah you ever do that in a corporation
when you got a dotted line to report to
somebody else your boss gives you
another project and you say oh
I'd love to work on that boy would I
but I've got this other thing that I'm
doing for the other boss that you
assigned to me remember when you gave me
the other boss that other boss has
filled up my schedule
I wish I could do something about it but
I can't
so that's the problem with the sgm it's
that wrong wrong chefs in the kitchen
too many chefs
um
coincidentally
while dilber is being
the most notable critic of ESG and while
large Financial entities are the biggest
promoters of it
did you know that most newspapers are
owned Now by large Financial entities
did you know that
hedge funds investors basically people
just investing just for the money of it
not not for any other reason
and one of those uh big uh Financial
entities I don't know what kind of
business they're in actually but they
own among other things I guess they own
a big chain of newspapers the fourth
biggest chain of newspapers and they
have 77 papers
that are all part of One Financial
entity
and they decided to revamp their Comics
page
make you smaller add in some things and
subtract some things and one of the one
of the comics that got caught
is Dilbert so Dilbert won't be in 77
newspapers
now
some people said my God is that because
of what you've been saying politically
to which I say how would I know
I would have no way to know that right
because I I don't have direct contact
with the newspapers like that goes to
the syndication process so they don't
talk to me
now when a new when a newspaper cuts a
comic
especially if it's a let's say a high
profile comic
typically they give a reason
and it's an obvious reason right it'd be
a reason like
um the readers don't like it
you know sometimes I run a poll the poll
is you know highly unscientific it's
just who decides to answer the poll
um so sometimes they give a reason
they'll say oh it's low rated sometimes
they might say it doesn't really fit our
kind of reader you know maybe we're more
rural
Dilbert is more of a urban thing they
might say something like that
in this case no reason was given
okay no reason was given no reason was
offered
so that doesn't mean they don't have a
reason and it doesn't mean that the
reason is anything but Financial
I just know that typically I would hear
a reason but in this case I did not
for whatever that means
now some people said but wait you're
making the seem as if they uh
they canceled you for some reason other
than the comic
to which I say I didn't say that I'm
just telling you what's happening
you should know that I'm
um I was at Great risk of being canceled
because the content I was putting out
and I told you that in advance I told
you in advance my odds of getting
canceled are very high right now because
of the concept
and you can confirm that I I signaled in
advance a very high high likelihood of
being canceled
now at the same time that I was
signaling to you there was a high
likelihood of being canceled
the fourth biggest change has canceled
me
that doesn't mean the one led to the
other you get that doesn't mean that not
necessarily
now some people said Scott Scott I work
in research somebody said this on
Twitter I work in research
the way these decisions are made is you
do your research you find out what the
customer is like and then you get rid of
the ones they don't like
but why are you complaining if the
market has spoken the market has spoken
there's nothing else to this story
well let me tell you how it really works
they don't have any data they don't they
don't even try to gather that data right
for 30 years I've been saying
why don't they gather some data because
when I first started I thought Dilbert
was more popular than the newspaper
thought
so I was always if you had some data you
could see that people like my comic more
than some other data
yeah the albonian Revenge maybe uh so
anyway the first thing you need to know
is it's not it's very unlikely that data
had anything to do with the decision
because newspapers just don't use data
that way never have believe it or not
they never have
so how does somebody make a decision
who do you think made the decision about
what was ended what was out
in all likelihood one person
in all likelihood one person made the
decision now it had to be confirmed by
probably a few different bosses
but it's very typical in that industry
that they'll trust the person they that
they gave the assignment to
so if they say your job is to figure out
which Comics we're going to keep and
which ones to go
and then they come back with a
recommendation
generally the recommendation would just
be accepted
I mean that would be the normal way a
newspaper would do it so often it's just
one person
right
now if somebody said well probably they
got rid of Dilbert because it cost more
so they're getting rid of the expensive
stuff to save money which would make
sense in most cases right
do you think that
well let me tell you about the economics
of comics
they cost almost nothing to the
newspaper they're so cheap do you know
what it costs for Dilbert to run in one
newspaper for one day
give me a number what do you think what
do you think is the number the dollar
amount that one newspaper pays and of
these 77 newspapers these are supposedly
be local smaller markets right
yeah something like ten dollars
it's hopefully like ten dollars
oh no I'm sorry ten dollars a week not
per day I'm sorry not per day it's more
like ten dollars per week
right now a lesser comic might be seven
dollars per week
a big paper might be 25.
or even more right now I haven't looked
at the numbers for a while there might
be a little inflation there so you know
maybe it's a dozen dollars versus eight
dollars or something like that but let
me tell you one thing they did not do
it was not basically a cost decision so
the one thing I can tell you for sure
is it wasn't based on cost
because Dilbert cost about the same as
everything else right
so it's probably one person's decision
probably wasn't about cost it was more
about I don't know
any number of things who knows but a
business decision
um
so it but in terms of uh now when I said
that the seven dollars that's for a
small paper right
so I don't know how many of the 77 were
small and how many were big
but one of the biggest papers was the St
Louis dispatch
I think that was probably the biggest
and the chain and they canceled it as
well
so
um
we don't know why it happened and I'm
not making the claim that it was because
of politics
but I can tell you that Dilbert was the
most probably the most popular comic
that got canceled in that group
probably
but I don't have data either
but when I say most popular I mean
probably most popular within a segment
of readers the trouble with Comics is
they tend to address a segment each
there are no Comics that apply well
Calvin and Hobbes I guess apply to
everybody but mostly Comics are like
here's a comic for a family here's one
for you know about a pet
here's one about single women right so
Comics usually go for a category
if you tell me that the category of
cubicle workers
has a as a more popular let me say this
way office workers if you tell me
there's a more popular comic among
people who have a let's say a job with
an office then Dilbert
I would be very surprised
and and the category of people who go to
work in an office is enormous
so if you can explain why they would
take away probably the most popular
comic in one of the biggest demographics
at the same time that the other ones
were the ones that people didn't read
that looks like the situation but it's
possible they had some data I'm not
aware of
very possible
it's possible that they have some
considerations I haven't even thought of
it's possible
I don't know
so there's no way to know what's beyond
it but but I will tell you that the only
time it ever happened was when I did
things that I told you in advance were
likely to get me canceled
so I just know I just know the timing
was
interesting
um
I don't like to give that one Financial
numbers so I'll say that the impact on
me is uh substantial
it's not like get out of the business
substantial it's not like I make less
money than most people substantial
but it's substantial
there are thousands of newspapers but
177 is a big chunk
all right
um there's a
I I got into a conversation about this
that led to the conversation about
how uh white people are doing real well
in Corporate America
so there was a gentleman uh looks I
don't like to assume people's
identification but based on his profile
I would say he's a black
a professor at a college
and I told them that I lost two jobs in
my corporate days because I was a white
man
and that my bosses in both cases told me
directly
we can't promote you because you're a
white man
and he said prove it
and then I said how about I do this I'll
tweet this conversation and I'll let all
of the other white men who have worked
in Corporate America
tell you about their experiences so you
don't have to believe me
I will give you an avalanche of people
with similar claims do you know what he
did as the Avalanche started coming in
he challenged every one of them to prove
it
all of them
now I think he ran out of steam after a
while
but I did it just to trigger his
cognitive dissonance and I wonder which
way it will get triggered is he going to
go away thinking that hundreds of people
lied to him on Twitter
because he might he might go away
thinking oh my God hundreds of white men
just lied to me directly on Twitter
probably
I mean he thought I lied to him
and and he challenged me to prove it and
I thought to myself I wonder if I could
I mean I I know the name I can remember
one of my bosses
the other one I might be able to find I
mean I could probably hunt down my
actual bosses
and I could ask them and I'm reasonably
sure they would tell me
you know exactly what I said I mean they
were in the room too why wouldn't they
and you know neither of them work for
these companies anymore so they had
nothing to nothing to lose nothing to
gain
it would be sort of interesting wouldn't
it I'm actually thinking of hunting him
down and doing it but I but I offered an
easier way to test
I said why don't you ask any white man
who has worked in Corporate America
don't believe me you don't have to
believe me just ask any white male
who works in a big corporate Enterprise
ask them if they've been discriminated
against directly
just find out find out for yourself you
don't have to wonder you can just ask
I'll bet you got a neighbor I'll bet you
got a neighbor you can ask
so the whole prove it was obviously uh
somebody who knew that cognitive
dissonance was coming at him hard and
and he's struggling to survive this
because imagine how much that would uh
mess up your entire world world view
imagine being a black American adult
you grew up believing that the one thing
that's clearly true is that for the last
25 years
it was a good deal to be a white man
and a bad deal to be a black man and
let's say you grew up for 25 years that
was your point of view and then you see
a tweet in which hundreds of white men
tell you that that wasn't the case
and they give you direct specific
examples
yes I did not get this promotion they
told me because I was white yes I was
qualified for this but they said I
couldn't do it because I'm white what
would that do to your mind
if your mind thought you had spent 25
years in one environment only to learn
that wasn't where you were
you were in a whole different world that
whole time and never knew it and the
reason is white people can't complain
that's part of the deal
do you know why I can complain because
I'm close to retirement
that's the only reason
do you think do you think I made a big
public mess back when it was actually
happening to me because I suppose I
could have you know could have gone to
the Press
could have written articles about it no
no it would have been suicide
the reason you don't hear about it is
that people are too smart to talk about
it
because it makes you just sound like a
whiner oh white people you know you you
would immediately be accused of being a
whiner and nothing good could come from
it
but
do you know I I can say this full
thrilledly at this point
I can do this in public
it's because every one of you
not the people I like
but anybody who has a problem with
it that was my truth and do you know
what I said to the gentleman whose name
is uh
I don't know what his first name is but
i j Bailey
and by the way I have nothing against
this person I think that I think he was
asking exactly the right question and he
was challenging me in exactly the right
way
based on what he believed was true and
what I was presenting
so there's no this is not a criticism of
Professor Bailey
Professor Bailey is acting just the way
a normal person should act in exactly
this situation it's just that he's
finding himself in a situation he
probably didn't expect
which is fascinating to me to just see
how he reacts
uh
anyway I think I had some other point
there that I forgot but
that's what's happening with me
so I don't mind telling uh Professor
Bailey what really has happened because
um I can take the Heat
now
what happened when I tweeted that the 77
papers canceled me what do you think was
the reaction on social media
well
probably 40 to 50 percent of the people
on social media have the following
reaction
yay
it's about time yeah I'm saying that
I've seen that in the comments it's
about time they got you
it's about time boy you had this coming
to which I asked what exactly did I do
to have this coming
now I know the people on uh so I want to
see if I can get some NPCs riled up here
I'm so I'm knowing locals you're
friendlier
but uh no Maggie isn't an answer tell me
what I did
don't tell me what Maggie did I was
never a mega
what did I do
uh
tell me let's say I'm just waiting I'm
just waiting for somebody no Trump
supporter that's just a generic sentence
well what did I do
had a comment for what
nobody it got really quiet on YouTube
foreign
they consider you a trump guy yeah but
I'm I'm talking about people here I'm
not talking about other people
I you know that there's somebody there
are people here on YouTube
who are just here to hate on me right
so I'm I'm asking you to tell me why
give me give me the one reason
give me the one reason that when I wake
up every morning
literally with the thought of how I'm
going to make the world a better place
because it's sort of the only thing I
have to do that has meaning at the
moment
tell me tell me exactly how that hurt
you
somebody says I'm anti-women no
literally nobody is anti-woman
unless you're like a psycho or something
no
but but don't just say what I'm anti or
what I am tell me what I did
what did I do to you
was it was it when I made uh
having a Telehealth doctor across state
lines legal when it wasn't legal until
uh I asked the president to sign an EO
was it your new health care that you got
for free
that I give people who
at least liked Albert
was it the fact that uh that I wrote a
book to tell people how old and they say
it worked
is it because I described politics in a
way that people could understand it for
the first time
in terms of persuasion
tell me what I did
seriously
to get give me one example of what I did
because most most of the complaints are
you are
right that doesn't help you are Maga
well I'm not
you are anti-woman no
no I'm heterosexual you couldn't be more
pro-woman than I am
but seriously I I'm asking quite
seriously
tell me something I did
that offended you
and it just got really quiet so all of
YouTube just went completely quiet I
mean there are comments going by but
none of them nobody's going to take the
bait because here's the thing there are
a number of you on on YouTube who just
had a moment
you assure that you hated me
you were sure you had reasons and when I
asked you for any what did I do there
were none
do you understand how hypnotized you
have to be
to hate people when you don't know what
they do or
anything about them
you ignore all the good reasons I'm
asking for the good reasons
nothing
now you're lying about what
do you see a reason there that I don't
see you spread pandemic panic
all right uh locals people
um I I spend every evening
with this blanket wrapped around not
this one but another blanket wrapped
around me
specifically to tell people everything
would be okay
I spent my full-time energy
for six months
doing two live streams a day with the
express primary primary intention
of calming people down and telling them
everything will be fine
now and somehow you went away with the
impression that six months of work
on behalf of the public
was the opposite of what happened
isn't that interesting remember I told
you that people can't tell the
difference between a thing and the
opposite of the thing
the the number of times you see that it
never is less mind-boggling
right
yeah I swear if somebody murders me
someday
the my reputation will be I'm a murderer
you know that right
if somebody murders me just like
randomly
like half of the country will think well
he had a coming he was a murderer
it's like people literally can't tell
the difference between this thing in the
opposite of the thing
40 of the country will just hear the
opposite of the thing and think that's
the truth forever
just stop going to Starbucks
all right
um
here is the creepiest story of the day
there are some adults you probably heard
this who ran over an 18 year old over a
political and killed him over a
political problem but here's the update
Machiavelli's underbelly who I talk
about all the time his Twitter account
you must follow
do you hear that
you must follow it's not optional it's
Machiavelli's underbelly and you should
immediately go to Twitter as soon as
you're done here unless you have another
device and follow him here's why if you
want to see the future
he is showing it to you
and it will twist your brain in pretzels
all right let me tell you what he did
yesterday and just just take a moment
to absorb this a little bit
this actually happened this is a real
thing this is not speculative this is
not something in the future
this happened yesterday
this 18 year old who was killed there
are photos of him
you know when he was alive
and uh Machiavelli Machiavelli's
underbelly animated the photo so that
you can have a full conversation with
the deceased in which the deceased is
describing how they were killed and why
and it looks not like a computer
it looks like the real person talking
you want to go to another level
you ready for this
Machiavelli's underbelly offered on
Twitter and I assume it's a joke just to
make a point
that if somebody would pay him x amount
of huge amount of money
he would animate fetuses who had been
aborted
or if the other side wanted to pay him
he would show the that the babies grew
up to be
so he could take either side
for you know some millions of dollars he
could take either side and animate any
horrible persuasion you wanted now
let me stop you here I'm sure he was
kidding okay
this was not serious I'm sure he was
kidding
but he did it to to catch your brain on
fire and it worked didn't it
this is this is now
I don't know how much I can and
reinforce with you he animated a dead
person to talk about the the the
circumstances of his death
and it looked real
you wouldn't know the difference if he
didn't know you wouldn't know the
difference
so if you don't see how this is going to
change everything
you better catch up because this you
don't want this one to sneak up on you
right
this one you got to watch carefully so
follow that account
all right uh Putin
you decided to escalate with a partial
mobilization
a partial mobilization
boy you know those ukrainians are afraid
now
oh no
Putin did a partial mobilization
well let me tell you what a partial
mobilization means it means that their
reserves are being activated
now the reserves I understand are
veterans
who are retired from the military but if
they have special skills and stuff that
are being brought back
now what do you think would be the
quality of the Fighting Force
when you bring back your veterans
who can't remember how they did their
job
and probably they were happier being out
of the army than in
then also they're extending the the
military service of the people who are
in the in the war
uh indefinitely basically
so if you thought you were going to do a
little war rotation and you had a few
months left and then you were coming
home Putin just told you you're never
coming home
now you didn't say never
but he said you're not coming home
anytime soon
got a war to win
now let's bash that against uh something
I saw today
that there's a John Keegan's book The
Face of battle and uh I'm a terrible
person because I meant to note who
tweeted this
so if you know who tweeted this
give them a shout out in the comments
because I'm I'm being a bad I'm being a
terrible live streamer because I uh I
thought I copied and pasted that but I
missed the name of the person anyway
um there's well-established evidence
according to this John Keegan book that
shows that combat Effectiveness falls
off quite rapidly within 140 to 180 days
so if you're in a war zone and you're
fighting every day
at the end of 90 days you're probably at
your maximum fighting ability
meaning you've sort of gotten practice
you've gotten used to it and now you're
you're at your maximum after 90 days
your Effectiveness starts falling off
sharply and it's the sharply that's
important because it's not gradual
sharply and at around 140 to 180 days it
really falls off a cliff
basically people just want to go home
and the ones that are already in the war
the ones are being extended many have
been fighting for more than 200 days
so morale disappears at about 140 days
to 180 in a war zone and many of Russian
troops have been there 200 days and they
just extended them
this really looks like Russia is losing
badly now of course it's fog of War you
don't need to be an NPC
to come in here and tell me that I've
been falling for Ukrainian propaganda or
Russia propaganda don't be an NPC
Don't Tell Me I'm Falling for the
propaganda of one side or the other
because we all know it's all propaganda
we all know that anything I say on this
topic is likely
likely to be propaganda and likely to be
overturned later okay
I wonder if I've stopped the NPCs
because I think they're still going to
do it I think telling them not to do it
doesn't make any difference to an NPC
let's just give it a moment
all right
did that work wow maybe it did
so what it looks like is if I were the
ukrainians this is the persuasion that I
would start to use on the Russian
soldiers because I'm pretty sure they
can get you know their persuasion into
the the ground troops directly or
indirectly and it will look like this
you're never going home
that's what it would look like you're
never going home
that that would be pretty powerful
wouldn't it but
if you come to Ukraine we'll take care
of you
if you join our side you can come home
immediately not home but you'll be out
of the war immediately and we might even
feed you if you want to join our side
yeah so
um I don't know what the Ukrainian
fighting morale is but I assume it's
better
only because they're in their home
territory
so I know there are too many unknowns in
this to make a prediction but it does
look like the Russian army is collapsing
um
yes and the best persuasion is one that
already fits your fears and your biases
did you know that
if you want to convince somebody of
something
tell them something that already fits
the framework that they have in their
head of how things work
right so you imagine that they already
maybe don't trust Putin so much
so then you tell them okay he says it's
extended but he really means you're
never coming home
or you say he says you're extended but
the truth is There's No Escape Route
I don't know if that's true
but imagine imagine hearing that
Putin is saying that your your service
has been extended but he had to do that
because there's no Escape Route
sometimes it's better to give him an
Escape Route I've been told because you
don't want them fighting for their life
you want them to escape
to get out of there
you've seen UK soldiers running to
Russia
I'm sure it's worked both ways
Machiavelli is spelled
m-a-c-h not not m-a-k
just if you ask your digital assistant
how to spell it just say how do you
spell Machiavelli
yeah you'll see the spelling in the
comments there m-a-c-h
all right
um Rasmussen says that uh Republicans
have more excitement about voting in the
midterms 64 percent of Republicans are
very excited and only 56 percent of
Democrats are very excited
and only 38 of unaffiliated are very
excited
so what does that tell you
I think it tells me that the the party
that's out of power is probably more
excited about voting isn't that always
the case which is probably exactly why
the uh the midterm elections tend to
flip-flop yeah so I think this is
telling us what we expect in this
situation the ones who are behind are
excited to get in there and try to
change it the ones who are ahead are
like ah or ahead
seems okay now less excited and the ones
who don't have a team at all are the
least excited
because they don't have a team to back
and I think in a way this perfectly
tells you how much the team persuasion
is worth
right so if you didn't identify with a
team a Democrat or Republican
you were the least likely to be excited
about voting in general
but if you identified with the team
suddenly you're all excited about voting
now cause and effect could be backwards
here it could be that the people who
care the least are the least interested
in joining a team
but I feel like it works both ways that
once you you join the team you suddenly
take on the excitement and the you know
the feelings of the team and The
Narrative of the team and and then you
can see it's the difference between 38
being very excited and 64 percent
and that the difference between 38 and
64 is partly
that the unaffiliated might be less
political but partly I think that
joining a team just gets you excited
about the team
Banger versus Team pero
you know I don't know do you think the
the pedo stuff that
um
here's what this feels like I remember
in 2016
the big persuasion was cuck c-u-c-k
as in cuckold as in you know we we
earned a bunch of stuff in America but
we're just giving it away to these other
countries that didn't work for it I
guess that was the context and I always
had every time I heard that I thought
that is not persuasive
that is so not persuasive
and while I hear the pedo stuff I have
the same thing
that is so not persuasive
it's not because if you're a Democrat
what are you going to think no they're
not
this sounds ridiculous if you're a
Democrat you just think oh there's those
cute people again
I think it's anti-persuasive
because if the best you have is calling
the other size pedophiles
then you don't have a political problem
right remember when I tell you that
people come after me personally
it's them signaling that they don't have
any kind of argument
so if you're doing the same thing with
the Democrats and you're coming after
them for
you know whatever personal things you
imagine they're doing
probably you didn't have a good enough
argument so maybe you should work on
that
it's not supposed to be persuasive
well I think different people are using
it in different ways there are
definitely some people who are just
genuinely concerned about the issue
and and they want to you know float the
issue and make it a bigger deal and so
there definitely there are people with
good intentions
but beyond that when I saw in the
comments somebody said we should frame
it as team Baga against team pedo
that takes the legitimate question of
you know grooming and whatever else that
takes whatever legitimacy there is in
that and just reduces it to a political
nothing
so if you want to take your legitimate
concerned
and turn it into a nothing
make it political
if you really want to help children
make sure that you're cleanly going
after the specific Bad actors and you're
not going after just Democrats as soon
as you say all Democrats or petos at
least because they support them well
you're just being like them you just
became them
because what do they say everybody
everybody's a uh everybody's a racist if
you're Republican because you allow them
to be in your party
right so you're just doing the same
thing to them there's no persuasive
ability to that
same as calling someone an NPC somebody
says now the NPC persuasion has a
functional point
right the functional point is to make
them stop saying the most obvious thing
it's just from my personal my personal
preference
and it worked
when I do the NPC call out the NPC is
almost always just disappear or they
they spin into some kind of cognitive
distance that's funny
so you can't tell me it's a bad idea if
it works
and it works for me in exactly the way I
want it to work if it doesn't work on
you or or for you I don't care it's not
for you
um
it doesn't work comrade
well I observe it to work oh here's the
here's the point I forgot
oh I'd be so mad if I completely forgot
to tell you this so back to the story of
the uh
the black college professor who is
challenging me about the veracity of my
claims that being a white man in
Corporate America is is a tough deal
because you're discriminated against And
he as I said earlier he challenged me to
prove that
that it actually happened to me and I'd
lost two careers because of being a
white male
and I replied back
why are you denying my lived experience
I'm just waiting because I assume
there's Applause
I I assume that wherever you are you're
applauding right now possibly standing
possibly standing
because hasn't that been the entire
argument
that when when the Republicans say hey
the actual police brutality if you look
at the stats is somewhat
you know not big
but then then what do black people say
well you know you can keep your
statistics our lived experience is that
the police are brutalizing us that's our
experience
now I'm telling you that my lived
experience was I lost two careers for
being a white male
does the standard not apply to me does
my lived experience count for nothing
remember I told you that the best
persuasion is that you don't
debunk the other side
you Embrace their point and then you
amplify it
Embrace and amplify it's deadly
persuasion
as soon as you say you're wrong
you're done your persuasion ended the
minute you said you're wrong
you get that right
hey let's talk about this topic you're
wrong and we're done
we're done there's nothing else to say
everything you say after that is like
blah blah blah blah blah because the
person just heard you wrong
but if you say to that person you know
that's a good point
that's a good point
you know people's lived experience is
important we should not diminish that
and by the way
just so you know I am completely
consistent because I do honor the lived
experience of the black population of
the United States I've said that
publicly
and whether or not that matches the
statistical truth
I think that's interesting and we should
know about it maybe it's important
but if your lived experiences that the
police are brutalizing you that's that's
your life
so I mean that does matter
it matters
right so I'm just using the same
standard it's exactly the one I apply
to other people so you can't give me on
hypocrisy I'm just being consistent and
I'm asking you to be consistent too
that's all
um
you lost two jobs because your child
drove up the group medical expenses God
I hate that
ugh
that's like the ugliest
the ugliest part of reality right there
now I do the same thing with reparations
if you say no to reparations
you lose
because then you're an uncaring bastard
racist or something so I don't do that
I say you know
this could be a good conversation and
you have a good point
certainly the government did bad things
to black people nobody doubts that
so let's have that conversation it's
just that when you embrace it and
amplify it you end up with uh what about
the black African kings Who Sold those
people do they pay some reparations what
about the people in the north who fought
to free the slaves do they still owe
money so by embracing the idea and then
amplifying it so you can see it in all
of its features
you end up being persuasive
but as soon as you say no bad idea well
that's the end of the conversation
Embrace and amplify
so I heard some people have already used
the technique since I started talking
about it and with good with good result
it's actually my fourth career uh they
got cut short
because you also have to count my
Dilbert TV show that got canceled for
not appealing to Black audiences
because UPN the network it was on
decided to have a block of black
um content so it was like sitcoms of
black families and stuff and Dilbert was
on that night and it wasn't a black
content
property and so it got canceled
so I've lost two corporate jobs and one
TV show
for essentially my identity
you used to embrace and amplify on a
million dollar deal and it deleted their
top concern boom
good job
good job
is there anybody here who has learned a
tech a persuasion trick from me
that they've used in their real life
let's say usually your career and it
worked better than you imagined like
you're actually surprised
watch the yeses go by yeah over on the
locals
um so on locals I get more of my
persuasion lessons it's all yes it's
like a flood of yeses so these are
people who basically have learned a
skill
that can express itself almost like
magic
it's not magic it's just technique but
it's it's impact on your life feels like
magic yeah
now now let me ask you this
think about the you know the little
nuggets of persuasion that I've taught
you and the ones you've used and all the
people are saying yes have already seen
that it made a big difference right
these are not small differences in most
cases you use you use the technique for
Big Stuff
get a raised career you know
relationship stuff like that
now imagine me
I learned hypnosis in my early 20s
I've been studying persuasion for
decades
do you have any idea what I can do at
this point
you don't
you have no idea that's the only reason
I'm still alive
because if anybody had any idea what I'm
capable of I would be killed immediately
and I can say that out loud because
nobody will ever believe it so that's
the beauty of it
if I thought anybody could believe it I
couldn't even say it out loud but nobody
could believe it it's completely beyond
the human ability to hold in your head
I've been challenged someday to write
sort of my biography that would be
released after I'm dead
so you can find out what things I've
actually been involved in
if you had any idea
you would be amazed
all right so and you have to assume that
people seek me out right
because I do this publicly
obviously people have sought me out to
solve problems
and sometimes I do
um
let's see what else is going on today
we talked about the woman with huge
prosthetic breasts and about Dilbert
well those are important things
um
yeah I think we got I think we covered
it all
uh uh what does your agent think about
you killing Dilbert well I don't have an
agent
um one one of the benefits of my skill
stack
is that I don't need a financial advisor
because I have those skills
and I don't need an agent to negotiate
except for the book deals that's a
special industry I do have an agent for
the book deals
uh because the way uh book publishing
works is that the agents are almost like
employees of the public the publishers
now not all agents right but the top
agents the ones with reputations and
track records they actually do for the
Publishers what the Publishers are not
staffed to do for themselves which is
find a book that's going to sell
so the publisher wants to talk to the
agent but not every agent they want to
talk to the ones that always have a
track record of finding and promoting
good books
so if you want to if you want to be in
that industry
after you're maybe after your first book
if you get lucky somehow you want an
agent because the agent will get you a
better deal than you could have
negotiated yourself they just know how
to do it
so being good at negotiating
which actually used to be my job
um
one of the things you should know is
when you shouldn't do it
so when I'm negotiating for a big deal I
will always hire a lawyer
to be between me and the party I'm
negotiating with and it's not always
because the lawyer has better ideas than
I did
because usually on the business stuff is
just my preferences tend to rule but the
lawyer keeps a a buffer between you and
the other entity and that gives you a
whole different set of tools
because you could ask for things through
a third party that would be a little
awkward to ask for in person
because it they could just stretch a
little further than you can because
they're doing it on your behalf
but if you're in the room it's easy to
give stuff up
let me give you an example I hired a
lawyer when I first got my Dilbert comic
contract 33 years ago
and so most of the things I negotiated
were things I told my lawyer I wanted
but one of the things the lawyer
suggested was well why don't you tell
them they should pay for your drawing
supplies
like your papers and pens and stuff
and I said no they're so small ball
like I'm trying to do this you know big
career changing contract I'm not going
to have them pay for my pens and paper
and this is crazy
and they said well why don't we just ask
for it
because then it'll be one thing we've
asked for that we have to negotiate away
so we'll ask for it just so it becomes
an asset to give up
and I'm like all right whatever
you know it was just to me it was just
ridiculous but he asks for it
negotiations happen and it gets lost in
the mix
like I I think The Syndicate just sort
of forgot about it it was one of the
things they talked about and and then
when the final thing was done it was
still there
so that this thing actually survived
through because The Syndicate also
thought it was so small
that it wasn't something they wanted to
talk about and I forget what it was it
was something like
I don't know fifty dollars a week or
something
so we just put in there that they'd give
me fifty dollars a week for the entire
15 years
and every every time I would get my uh
royalty and I'd see that little number
in there I'd laugh and say oh my God my
lawyer paid his entire fee
because over the over the years that it
ran it just kept you know racking up
until the the lawyer was free
the lawyer was free
he paid for himself just for asking that
one thing that I never would have
thought about
and also the lawyer pushed them harder
than they've ever been pushed they said
now you know I wasn't there sometimes
people like to say that oh this was the
toughest negotiation I've ever had this
sort of the thing people say but they
were quite convincing that my lawyer
pushed them harder than they've ever
been pushed and do you know why that
could happen
it's because I know how to negotiate
and I had a secret that other
cartoonists didn't know
it goes like this if you're a brand new
cartoonist and a Syndicate offers you a
contract it's the biggest break you
could ever have
the last thing you want to do is screw
up that opportunity
and so a new cartoonist would say I'm
going to give them everything they asked
for because the last thing I want to do
is to make them mad and then they'll
cancel the deal and it's my only
opportunity
but what I do
is that they're looking for artists and
they're hard to find it's hard to find
me right so somebody who could turn on
nothing into a a major brand in the
United States in the world that's very
rare and if they think they found
somebody who could do that even
potentially which is what they're
looking for they're only looking for
people who could maybe do that if they
think they've got one they're going to
fight pretty hard to keep it
even before the contract is signed
because remember they have to talk
themselves into it before the offer even
gets to you so they've already talked
themselves into how brilliant it would
be if they hired you or worked with you
so I knew that I could push really hard
and that they would give me plenty of
warning if they were going to cancel the
whole deal
so I just pushed and pushed and waited
for them to say okay this is too far
we're going to walk away from the deal
and they never did
they never threatened to walk away from
the deal it was just a hard negotiation
and I got a little bit more of what I
wanted
um I think you did your oh times 30
years yeah no the first contract was 15
years so it was half of that
um and I don't think the second contract
didn't have that in there because I I
draw digitally
so I couldn't charge for my art supplies
because I draw on the computer now
uh if it wasn't king it wasn't king it
was United media so United media sold
much of its assets and my currency to
get has those
yeah the cintiq is where I used to draw
did that scare you did what scare me I
don't know what you're talking about
was I scared that I wouldn't get the
deal
no
no so that's that's where the experience
comes in
I know what it looks like when
somebody's getting ready to walk away
from a deal oh I guess that's the most
important thing
so here's the most important thing if
you're in a deal where you're sure the
other person needs you or wants you
right and you're both invested
you will get all kinds of warning before
somebody walks away from the deal
all kinds of warning especially in a
corporate setting in a corporate setting
they've already told their bosses the
deal is going to happen
they do not want to go back to their
boss and say okay I couldn't get a deal
done
everybody else can get a deal done but I
couldn't get a deal done
so you usually have the corporate person
by the Nads
because they've got to once they've said
I'm going to make this happen and they
do
they got to make it happen and you know
that
right
um
uh
best episode yet
Maybe
how much are they authorized to spend
yeah
uh a lot of young artists get their
souls taken from them well I was aware
of that so there was a history of abuse
by the syndication companies long long
ago we're talking you know decades and
decades ago before my Syndicate even
existed really
and they would do these long-term
contracts and once you were the
cartoonist and you retired they would
just draw the comic for you with another
artist and they would just keep it so
the rights to the comic actually belong
to the syndication company not to the
artist so you could work for 20 years
drawing a popular cartoon and they could
just fire you
and then to draw your cartoon with
somebody else
but that situation
is no longer the case
um
oh in terms of the direction of the
comic industry the other chains are
likely to go the same way
so there's a pretty high likelihood that
Dilbert will be maybe canceled in half
of newspapers in the year
yeah maybe one to three years it will no
longer be a viable career
and I'll do something else now my plan
tentatively
would be to continue doing Dilbert but
uh on a subscription service
can anybody guess what subscription
service I would use
that's right
only fans
no not only fans but PornHub
uh locals of course now I haven't made
any decisions about that but the way I
would likely do it
would be to have a very low subscription
so that you could even tell you had it
and then you could read it as long as
you want but if I did it by subscription
I would I would be far more edgy
so subscription Dilbert would be
um
let's say all the controls would come
off so if you didn't think it was funny
before I guarantee you you're going to
like it after I take my uh after I take
the censorship off myself
to utilize a self-censor
as any professional would because I'm
making something for a specific market
right if you're making something for a
newspaper Market
you are obliged to make a product that
fits that market
I try to make a product that fits that
market but also enlarges it so that's
why I'm in the risky business I'm
enlarging the market and that's always a
little friction
99 Cents yeah I was thinking of a dollar
a month
well let me ask you this if if you could
pay a dollar a month and get 30 or 31
Dilbert comics a month
would you pay it
now most of you wouldn't
I know that 1990 won't
but some of you would
some of you would
and I don't think I would mix it with my
current locals Channel because I think
that it just it's different audience
if it's edgy
now the other thing I could do is put
other people's edgy comics in there with
me on a sort of guest basis not regular
running but if I saw anything that was
edgy I could put it there too
and maybe I would curate the funniest
memes and
and comics and stuff and put them there
too
you try for a year I mean yeah you could
try for a year for twelve dollars
that's not bad
dark Dilbert I I could create dark
Dilbert
oh that's not a bad idea
okay I wish I'd never heard that idea
because that's a little too sticky
oh my God
yeah if I if I leave newspapers entirely
and I go to a subscription service
I think it's going to become dark
Gilbert
I might even rename it
I might rename it dark Dilbert so that
if anybody bought a reprint book they'd
know what they're getting
oh
in 2018 you were accepting Transcendence
I don't know what Transcendence is
yeah the darkened divisive Dilbert
oh
that's interesting darkened divisive
Dilbert
um
yes in effect I could create a comic
syndication company with just locals
would you like to know how I would do it
all I would have to do is uh
is make deals with any larger entity
newspaper or whatever and now I'd have
to be out of my this would have to be
after my syndication contract expired so
I couldn't do anything I'm currently in
contract but if it expired
I could run a syndication of just
Dilbert through locals and I could tell
any newspaper that wanted to run it
that they can just go grab it off of
there and run it
all right
uh better get web address well I own
dilbert.com
so I own the you know the URL
all right am I sure about that yes I am
and that's part of the contract
negotiations
all right that's all for now I'll go
talk to you tomorrow
how many people did we get here not too
many
uh is there anything contractually that
would prevent you from launching a dark
Dilbert subscription service now yes
well
uh
okay I have to answer that more more
lawyerly and technically
so I have the rights to do anything
that's my own property that doesn't
compete with newspapers
so the question would be whether a
subscription service
that you had to subscribe to would
compete with newspapers
I think it would because that would just
be an online offering I think that's
covered in the contract so I believe I
believe I can't do that under my current
contract
but I only do short-term contracts at
this stage of my career
one to three I can't remember but my
contracts like I don't know a year or
two something like that
um
does anyone subscribe to the paper only
for the comics they used to but I don't
think so anymore
all right that's all for now
I'll talk to you later
bye for now
