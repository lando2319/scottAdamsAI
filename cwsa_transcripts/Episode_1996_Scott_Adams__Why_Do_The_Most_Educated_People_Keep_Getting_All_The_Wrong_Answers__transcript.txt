but I'm going to be asking people on
Spaces to chime in if you want to see
the live stream it's live on YouTube at
real coffee with Scott Adams and of
course on the locals platform every day
and if you'd like to participate in one
of the really most important
celebrations in the history of the
modern world is called the simultaneous
Sip and all you need is a cover mug or a
glass a tanker Jellison style and a
canteen Joe go or flask vessel of any
guy and fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopa being hit of the
day the thing that makes everything
better it's cold the simultaneous sip it
happens now go
ah
that's good stuff
all right well apparently I
um cause a little kerfuffle
kerfuffle on the internet
with a video that I put out yesterday in
which I said the uh I made a mistake of
calling them anti-vaxxers people didn't
want to be called that but let's say the
the pure Bloods the people who are
unvaccinated
uh I said that they're the winners
because we've reached Omicron and
whatever vaccination you got probably
didn't help you at this point
and so
if you're young and don't have lots of
comorbidities but you've got a
vaccination in your blood and you don't
have any real risk from Omicron you've
got an extra risk
that it would be great if you didn't
have so I'd say the people who got to
this point with nothing in their blood
that's
out of the ordinary
are the winners so I said that in the
video and I sent that around and it's
got about half a million views and uh I
was quite interested in them I'll give
you some of the the hot takes and we'll
talk about this in a moment and then
I'll take some take some questions on uh
spaces
so if anybody wants to uh jump on me and
insult me and criticize me in public
this would be exactly the time to do it
so please jump on if you'd like that the
the critics are the ones I want to hear
from so let me ask you this
don't get on Spaces
and compliment me
or say you like the show I love to hear
it but nobody else does
so for the benefit of the other
listeners just you know hit your
criticisms
all right
so
I was fascinated to see people's
reaction
when I told the unvaccinated that they
were the winners and that I'm
acknowledging that with No No
Reservations
and it's amazing the the uh the
reactions because one of the things I
wondered was could people take yes for
an answer
could you could you just say okay well
based on what we know now it looks like
you know you you had the winning
strategy
some people said oh I respect that
because you admitted you're wrong
other people said
you're being arrogant in the way you
admit you're wrong
so you're really still a dick
okay
um other people wanted to dance on My
Grave and tell me why they were so right
and why I was so wrong and I'm trying to
learn from them
and that's what we'll talk about today
and
other people wanted me to know that it
wasn't about winning it wasn't about
winning they care about people so it's
the caring about people that matters not
the winning and losing
but the funniest comment was this one
was why did so many intelligent people
fall for the shots we're going to talk
about this on Spaces in a minute I'll
set it up for you first
and I thought to myself I wonder if it's
true that there's any correlation
between education and
vaccination
so I looked it up and sure enough in Pew
research 2021
the highest rates of vaccination by far
are the higher correlated with the
highest education
so people with post-graduate degrees the
highest level that they measured 89 of
them at the time I don't know what this
is 2021 but at the time uh 89 were
vaccinated
which we don't really call vaccinated do
we we call them the shots the shots so
89 had the shots
college graduate is still pretty high up
there but
um you know less than the postgraduates
81 so it starts going down as you go
down people had some college but didn't
graduate goes all the way down to 69
these are a little different now but
this was 2021 and then people who had
only high school or less it goes all the
way down to 66 percent
and interestingly among Asian Americans
it's the 94 percent
so the the highest ratio is Asian
Americans and Asian Americans as you
know have um I think maybe among the
highest education levels right and
educational attainment
so what's interesting is
when I ask people how they knew how they
got the right answer and I didn't
they said that they had data and if I
listened to the data I would have had
the same answer too
and so this raises the question why is
it that the most educated people
tend to look at the wrong data
where the people with the least
education
who are looking at the right data or
they were using the right heuristic or
the right decision making
so why was that
and apparently I trusted the government
too much
uh and I trusted Dr fauci which is an
interesting comment
when you're talking about the creator of
the Dilbert comic who for 35 years wakes
up every day and says something about
distrusting large organizations
every day but I guess I trusted you too
much despite being the first person in
the country to call him a liar in public
I still own that I'm the first person to
call him a liar in public
for the pandemic maybe other people
hated him before for other reasons
and apparently I trusted fauci
and and didn't listen to all the other
scientists
so that was my problem they say
and
so here's what I'd like to suggest
we need a new way to check on our
decisions and this is suggested we're
going to the Whiteboard I didn't warn
you I should have
but this is this is sort of preliminary
but I think we need new ways to make
decisions
in the old days I would go to a doctor
for a first opinion but then I would
make the mistake of potentially going to
a second doctor
and what good is that going to do it's
basically two Highly Educated people
probably both sheep so to improve my
outcomes based on what we've learned I
should go to an uneducated person but
not
an ordinary uneducated person because it
turns out that the lower you went in the
education entertainment the more
accurate the opinions were so you want
not just an uneducated person but you
want to go as low as you can into the
uneducated Realm
and then
you want to also second you know maybe
double check your double checking with
the Rogue experts but not the not the
mainstream
the mainstream experts
tend to have a bad record
but um you want to be able to pick out
the ones who are not mainstream and then
believe them so this would be the new
sort of the new decision making and I
thought you could extend this a little
bit
given that this phenomenon is so um
so so strong
you know where you know where else you
see this climate change
if you were to look at climate change
alarm like who's the most afraid of
climate change
wouldn't it scale exactly with education
it would wouldn't it the the more
alarmed you are
it correlates with uh how educated you
are does it
and so so you've got the uh you've got
the Davos people
the the richest and probably most highly
educated group you're likely to get in
one place you know maybe academics would
be a little different but in terms of a
business Gathering it would probably be
the you know some of the highest
educated smartest people now
as you've taught me recently they're
getting all the wrong answers
right
would you would you agree with the
statement that you've got all these
brilliant people in one place
and you tell me are they getting the
right answers the wrong answers
it's all the wrong answers right
so here's what we need
instead of a Davos
now don't take this the wrong way
because I mean this is a compliment
we need a dumb Davos dumb Davos because
we've got a smart Davos
with all the smartest people and if
there's one thing we know about the
smartest people they are not good at
figuring stuff out
that that much we know for sure
so we did like a dumb Davos of the least
educated people and ideally the poorest
because the elites are giving us you
know all their Elite biased opinions you
don't want that you want to you want to
get the real people who got everything
right
so if you go down there and you get a
dumb Davos and again in this in this
context dumb as a compliment right
I remember
like I'm old enough to remember I don't
know if you are but
I don't know how long ago was it
probably a month ago I was thinking that
smart people were more likely
to get the correct answers
like that's how brainwashed I was like
oh you smart people who know how to
analyze things are going to get the
right answers like Elon Musk
a month ago I thought that guy can
figure stuff out
but it turns out he got vaccinated
so I have to revise that and really why
I should find out who at Tesla has the
lowest level of
analytical abilities and see what they
did
so I could get a second opinion
so we see those everywhere and I'm
thinking that if we do a dumb Davos dumb
being a positive in this case because
they get the right answers
wouldn't we be better off
and so I'd like to open it up to the
spaces people
um Erica are you there I think you've
got your I am here all right Erica
you're Pro um do you have any comments
on this I I know you I just asked you
out here to test the audio but uh do you
have anything to say before I invite
other speakers
comment would be I never considered
myself an anti-back sir I never really
thought about it
um
I was depending on smart people to make
a decision to match my confirmation bias
to not get it and yeah yeah that didn't
work out did it because it turns out the
smart the smart people were the dumb
people and the dumb people were the
smart people but what happens but what
happens when you know the dumb people
are the smart people but smart people
are dumb
I don't know very individual
for me and I remember Scott like waiting
to see what you were gonna do I'm like
okay Scott's gonna really think this out
he's gonna analyze it and then I'm going
to really have a better feeling about
what to do and you were and you were
really taking your time you weren't sure
you said I'm gonna wait as long as I can
and then well wait a minute wait a
minute wait a minute Erica you've you've
listened to me every day from the
beginning of the pandemic
why is it that your opinion of how I
handle the pandemic is totally different
than the people who only dipped in and
saw a couple of tweets for me why why do
you have such a different and wrong
opinion than the people who didn't
follow me
how could you so I think this is another
case I mean Erica is proving the case
again she has the most exposure to my
opinions and yet got it completely wrong
but the people who just saw a couple of
tweets totally nailed not only my public
opinion but my inner thoughts and my
secret of fears
so that was pretty awesome anyway Erica
thank you I'm going to take so see if I
can find a Critic okay
all right
all right I'm gonna remove
speaker uh this interface is a little
all right Carla
um let's see
Carlo you're going to add you as a
speaker are you there Carla
people take a while to turn on their
microphones Carla if you were there uh
activate your microphone please
if you don't I'm going to go somewhere
else
Carla you were removed from speakers
from not being fast
Randall has requested Randall come on in
here
Randall can you hear me if you can turn
your microphone on
sir thank you very much oh hi Randall
what would you like to say or ask or
criticize
um well I think it was a moving Target I
mean I think it can be right to varying
extents at different times I think as
Omicron came into existence it was an
absurdity to
uh keep pushing the vaccine and for
people to listen obviously Omicron is
not a genetic genomic relative of the
original Stars Kobe 2 strains as were
the other Greek letters and you know to
answer your question why people fell for
this I mean it is huge propaganda and a
social aspect and so forth but it was a
clear malfeasance I don't think we've
seen the back end of kind of the
political kind of Kickback scheme from
the pharmacology and whatnot from the
pharmacology pharmacology
companies and so forth but to keep
pushing this and now by valence and so
forth when SARS Kobe 2 no longer exists
on Earth is an absurdity as far as your
own position I think it's an amazing
thing that you you know kind of made
this very logical admission and you
should be you know proud of that I think
that if you've gone over the short-term
phase uh healthy I don't think there's
likely to be much more in the way with
long-term problems I think most of the
problems are on the short-term phase so
I'm I'm a medical doctor I'm not
intending to give you medical advice
over the internet and whatnot but I
think a lot of the problems are on the
short-term aspect uh okay I think we
found the problem here uh Randall you're
a medical doctor
yes sir well why aren't you listening
more to uh Alex Berenson
who's a journalist
well you should be getting because even
today well hold on hold on even today he
he told us on Twitter that long covert
is fake
are you getting your information for
like journals and stuff or do you get it
from Alex parents like a smart a smart
person have been listening
throughout uh the covet pandemic I have
not followed him today I don't follow
everything all things covered all the
time I think long covet probably will
fall into the same categories all of our
other previous kind of long uh problems
well you know there was a long you know
chronic mononucleosis we've had
neurostemia I think all through the
history of mankind we've had these kind
of kind of like quasi-depression uh
things you know fibromyalgia and whatnot
I think long covet will probably fall
into that category I think the study
that I saw from Israel that that there's
not that much of it really
um you know but people you know people
are funny things you know we you know
microbiologically radiologically
pharmacologically you can't find the
soul but people probably have them in a
sense or act as if they do and there's
Bart Simpson did and um
uh people will you know get torn up and
and swirled around in the tornado of
their emotions
um and I think I think that people will
you know think they have long covet
because they're you know we certainly
did nothing to help people get away from
covet away are you uh Randall are you uh
or I'll let me call you a doctor uh
doctor
uh are you suggesting that long covet
will probably not be real or it will be
real but as real as all of our other
long stuff
yeah I think I think it's look I mean
you know we treat individuals I I only
see individuals and I try to deal with
them as as you know helpfully as I can
and you don't necessarily want to put
you know you know kind of rub people's
noses in their their infirmities or
their their misconceptions and so if
somebody is tied to you know having long
covet I'm not going to argue with that
person right you know I think if you you
know were to do things pathologically
and somehow could you could do an
immediate dissection of you know super
MRI and and check all their cells and
whatnot I doubt you'd find a tissue
diagnosis of long covet in people
um you know I don't think coronavirus
per se is that unusual thing I mean
coronaviruses exist as long as human
beings you know coincident on the earth
and you know if you look at journals
before the SARS of 2003 or either either
one those are the you know 2019-2020
you'll find the coronaviruses by type
where the second leading named cause of
the common cold so you know zillions
civilians whatever you know of cases
over over a thousands of years or
hundreds of thousands whatever so
through the existence of time there have
been coronaviruses in humans and we've
never noticed this long covert before so
I don't think you know I think Stars
Kobe 2 is a slightly you know stronger
version because it came from the animals
uh you know it has a it didn't need to
have equilibrated with humans you know
the example I give is is coyotes and
dogs there are coyotes existing right
now and there are schnauzers existing
right now they're they're related and
they have some common ancestor with
probably more wolf-like than
schnauzer-like
um because the schnauzers you know and
puppies or poodles whatever all been
domesticated from wolves and coyotes and
whatnot but the coyotes don't need us
and coyotes can come and swoop down and
and you know like the dingo ate my baby
they can come take something and they
don't care and so when you have a
zoonotic virus they can come in and
swoop down and and be you know damaging
and then disappear
um but the schnauzers and and poodles
and whatnot they don't want to do that I
don't want to eat your whole eat their
host because they'll starve themselves
and so over time these viruses
equilibrate so what we're seeing now is
basically kind of an equilibration of
the the you know the tornado uh the
coyote uh the more you know evil or
whatever dangerous SARS Kobe 2 which
mind it was not that dangerous All
Things Considered if you look at the the
spectrum of influenza viruses
pre-vaccine so if you if you stack as
far as cov2 or SARS Kobe one up against
Spanish blue and both were you know
given to night populations naive no
vaccines extant in either population
um you know I would rather have SARS
Kobe 2 than Spanish Flu Spanish flu
killed a lot of young people and SARS
Kobe 2 predominantly killed in median
age at death was like eating two
worldwide and so it's mostly people with
infirmities you know multiple diagnosis
and whatnot but
you know we get getting back to the
zoonotic thing you know right now you
know in order for the fires to coexist
with people who come in cold water so
they don't have a zoonotic hoax they
don't have an animal host so the ones
that do can come in and slow down and be
difficult all the time like influenza as
a as an animal host it's probably
domestic pigs in China historically who
come you know brought into the house
because you know there's tiny Farms they
want to keep the animals warm so in the
winter they bring the animals back in
the house and they get you know they get
the sniffles from their pigs they go to
market and they spread the things so
every year we've had the you know the
Hong Kong flu that Shanghai flew this
flew that food but they're all Chinese
names because that's what the Chinese
Farmers have done and then Commerce
brings it around the world and so the
influenza tends to be more potent virus
doesn't need humans per se so it can it
can equilibrate in another animal and
then come back to people but the other
common colds you know adenovirus
rhinovirus all that kind of stuff we
just you know sniffle and whatnot
enviruses don't have brains but you know
in the population sense they don't want
to they don't want to knock us down too
much because then they will
um then they will not be able to persist
so if they kill somebody then that virus
and that person doesn't pass on to the
next person so on a populist again this
is kind of an iterative you know kind of
a huge massive computer problem in a
sense but you know trillions of viruses
and billions of people
that will be you can have it basically
have a choice you can be hugely virulent
or you can be hugely numerous so
transmissible or more powerful and the
ones that are hugely powerful like Ebola
don't tend to be hugely widespread
because they make like a meteor crater
they crash down and that's that and
everyone else moves away because we have
population response to the virus we move
away from it so a virus in order to pass
around billions of people has to be
surreptitious and not kill them so it
has to be like a good spy all right yeah
I I I think you got the uh the gist of
it I want to let some other people in
here but thank you uh doctor for for uh
all the background I want to just make
sure I get some more people in here okay
yeah
all right thank you very much
all right let's uh let's see who else
would like to talk uh doctor
Molly
Dr Molly James can you hear me
thank you good morning
uh do you have a comment or a question
protein and that is completely what
weaponized it has changed the face of
this that is why I have commented
repeatedly people are not dying from
covid they're dying up cytokine Storm
um which people fail to talk about this
is the reason that patients in the
hospitals did so poorly is because they
didn't recognize cytokine storm and it
wasn't treated we were treating for a
virus instead of an inflammatory
condition
um so you know the last speaker I would
have to kindly disagree that this isn't
quote a normal coronavirus and also we
have several syndromes you know he was
talking about long covid we have several
syndromes that are clinical in nature
that don't have a tissue diagnosis and
likely what happened is the inflammation
from spite has exacerbated or caused a
lot of inflammation and inflammatory or
autoimmune situations
um that are presenting as clinical
symptoms
now how is the uh layperson such as
myself
supposed to know which which of you two
doctors has the right take on it how
would we know the difference two experts
tell us different things how do we sort
them out
and most of those patients were treated
by the NIH protocols and died I then
left the ICU and treated with early
treatment and I had less than one
percent mortality and those were
patients presenting with stats in the
60s and 70s in severe distress it never
went to a hospital so what what did you
give them for early treatment
so we gave a combination of ivermectin
steroids medications like Singulair
cyproheptadine finasteride and then we
were using hyperbaric oxygen how many of
the people who died with these standard
treatment died on ventilators was it the
ventilators killing people
so the cytokine storm this massive
inflammation of blood clotting destroyed
the lungs right it created basically it
filled up the lungs so the patients they
said I can't breathe right what they
meant is I can't take a deep breath in
because their lungs were filled up with
his inflammation and so when we put them
on ventilators we had to do that because
they were breathing 40 50 60 times a
minute right there was no other choice
they would have become exhausted and
died it's like if you went to run a
marathon but the marathon never ended
okay right but the lungs were very very
fragile so and we didn't treat them
properly for their inflammatory
condition we they were getting six
milligrams of dexamethasone twice a day
if somebody has an airway compromise we
get 40 milligrams of dexamethasone a day
you know in the ICU completely under
treated let me ask uh sort of a patient
in question
so you had this experience which is
dramatic the differences between those
two sound like night and day but did you
find that you couldn't convince other
doctors and professionals that your take
was the right one
um yes I have but most of those people
aren't in clinical practice
or they're not in practice uh so you're
saying that the people who have the same
experience as you are largely on the
same same side
so let me go back so the people in the
ICU are not convinced right that
entire profession
that's why people continue to die and
it's dropped dramatically since Delta
went away I want to point that out as
well because since homicron came we're
not seeing cytokine storm which is why
you're not hearing about ventilators so
much right but those people in the ICU
are absolutely 100 convinced that they
have to vaccinate their way out of this
and they're they're completely
traumatized by what they saw we've never
seen so Much Death in the ICU as we have
during the last three years
um
so come to the early treatment side and
the people who are successfully treating
their patients absolutely buy into this
I see Dr Vaughn on here and some other
doctors that I've seen that are actively
treating patients and having good
outcomes well well all about hold on
hold on but but we're in the age of
Omicron now everybody's fine like how
can you really tell the difference
between good and bad treatment for
Omicron don't they all just get a you
know tough tough few days and they're
fine no matter what you do
um
yes and no what I can tell is people get
better faster when you give them early
treatment but I don't disagree with you
we're not seeing the death that we saw
before okay all right thank you doctor I
appreciate that all right bye for now
all right that was interesting let's get
a uh non-doctor on here
let's see who's who looks very
non-doctorous
I want to look I'm looking for somebody
whose face who looks like they're really
going to give me a fight
all right Caroline
Caroline you look like you're
ready to fight
I don't think so but we'll see all right
Caroline is your oh there you go you
microphone on
all right I'm here hi do you have do you
have a question or comment
[Music]
a lot of people won
they find out that they're wrong
um an acknowledgment feels like a lie
and your video and this space are
evidence of a whole lot more
thank you but no no compliments I'm
sorry no no no no compliments insults
only
all right or or criticisms if you have
any
um I my my comment was that I think
um to the question of the space where
educated people getting the wrong
answers on vaccines
um I think in the community of Highly
Educated and credentialed people
um the culture is really to rely on the
on the education and the credentials of
the people around them and we maybe put
a little bit too much stock in that and
so I just wanted to draw a distinction
between people who are educated and
people who are curious
um and I think that a lot of the people
who did get this right
that I've observed in in my life are
people who who are curious they're
curious about the people around them the
world around them
um because I wouldn't even say skeptical
they're just people that want to
understand how now what about things
work what do you think do you let me ask
you this do you think that there are
people in the category of
who did not want to get vaccinated
but if they had they'd still be alive is
there anybody in that category or is
that empty
yeah is it is there anybody Dead who
would be alive had they got vaccinated
let's say during Alpha and Delta not not
so much now
I'm
I would have to say that I'm sure
there's always exceptions I would have
to say I'm sure that maybe somebody
would have had that situation I don't
think that the evidence bears that out
at all so so at this so at this point
you would say the evidence does not show
that there's any population that
benefited from the so-called
vaccinations that there's not somebody
alive
who would otherwise be dead as far as
your take on the data
correct there's I mean you couldn't make
that argument that argument for an
entire segment of the population
absolutely there's nobody let's say over
65
who died who didn't need to let's say if
they'd taken the vaccination you believe
there's nobody in that category
are there any people who died who would
not be dead had they been vaccinated
like any
man
I my gut is no I mean the evidence does
not bear that out like I say there are
always there are exceptions to every
rule but there there is no evidence that
that is true so the so the million or so
people
who died
um did they die of the they died of
coronavirus or maybe they didn't maybe
they died with it okay all right uh
thank you Caroline Let's uh thank you
you're gonna get another speaker up here
appreciate it thank you
all right
David you're coming up
I hope your mic is on David
we're connecting here Davis can you hear
me
turn on your microphone if you can
your microphone is muted
uh okay that didn't work we're removing
David sorry about that
um let's try
um I think uh we're gonna go with this
monkey person here
somebody who's representing as a monkey
that looks like that will be interesting
I'm gonna go with the monkey
all right uh bam can you hear me
hi Scott hi you do you have a comment or
a criticism
I have a little bit of both all right
let's hear it um
I want to say I've listened to you for a
while and I appreciate you
um so in terms of the
the kind of the the access of
who can we trust
I think it falls apart into
what other background what's the
ideology
because
um
when you think about people how they
how they think about the pandemic it can
be about all the numbers
and you can think about how many people
did we save in general
and those are the scientists you know
they they think about the statistics
right but then there are other people
that think about
just giving all the information out and
treating each person individually
so I think that makes a big difference
on who do you you know who keeping your
trust so you would trust more of the
people who are treating individuals
rather than treating to the data
I want to get the information from both
and kind of you know
okay myself uh yeah do you have I'm a
Layman I'm not a scientist I'm not a
academic
why uh what what why do you think the uh
edu the most educated people got the
wrong answer why do you think that is
well in part I think it's because they
have less time to look at people's
backgrounds like some people that I
followed through the pandemic
I had followed from before
and I had a separate amount of trust in
them from way back but when they came
out and gave some comments on the
pandemic
I had already
developed
trust in them in general okay and I knew
their ideology a little bit more than I
did of the
you know the scientists and the TV that
came from the CDC or whatever
so the ideology difference okay all
right I'm being asked to invite some
different people on so I'm going to move
on and thank you for your comments
okay thank you thank you
let's see
um let's see I I heard you say
did somebody say that Brett is on here
Brett Weinstein
is he still I don't see him listen to
too many people in here let's see I'll
do a quick search and see if he's there
uh
there's a ton of people who you're
mentioning that I can't see because the
the interface changes as I scroll see
that
so you can't even scroll down it's
actually changing as you scroll so you
don't even know if you've already looked
at that page
I don't even know how to find anybody
here oh can I do a search
can I do a search all right sorry it's
just a terrible interface
it was not terrible interface but when
you get
oh my God it's just dancing all around
here you can't
yeah you can't even barely select things
it's just moving all around
well I got way more oh we got 1200
people listed
that's crazy
all right uh sorry I'm being boring but
it's it's hard to pick from the
interface because it's just dancing
around here
but I don't want to pick just from the
people on the top of the list
so I'm going to randomly
pick uh
Mike
can you hear me
Mike take your uh take your microphone
off
that's not good Mike
yes can you hear me I can hear you do
you have a question or a comment on why
educated people yeah
sorry about that
I just wanted to let you know
I don't agree with you all the time but
I appreciate your uh you know your views
and perspectives on things but
couple of
criticisms maybe even Paula is
that
um one of the things I noticed earlier
on Dr Robert Malone is on Joe Rogan I
felt like you were kind of dismissive of
that discussion
well yeah you have to be specific not
dismissive of discussion but rather a
specific fact or a specific point
I feel like you I don't know I that was
just one of the things early on and um
now you're are you are you aware that I
made the same decisions as Dr Malone at
about the same time and for the same
reasons oh yeah yeah absolutely okay and
um I just and there was that and then
there was a treat that you put out that
I think rubbed a lot of people the wrong
way where you tweeted that
for the vaccinated it was a Tuesday for
the unvaccinated you're in the middle of
a deadly pandemic thank you that's the
thing I see that retweeted a lot thank
you okay thank you that that's exactly
what I was hoping somebody would bring
up how many of you remember or saw a
tweet of mine in which I said after I
got vaccinated in 20 whatever it was uh
and I tweeted that for the
the vaccinated now if you're
unvaccinated you're in a deadly pandemic
and if you're vaccinated it's a Tuesday
or Wednesday whatever I said how many
saw that
right a lot of you did
all right so I've got some feedback here
so turn off your
mic after mute you
I had to remove him he had his speaker
on so it was feedback
um
so let me explain that
how many of you thought that was a fact
that I was that I was relaying data
did that sound like a data argument to
you
because it shouldn't
did you take it as an opinion
because you you should have taken that
as how I felt
how I felt was
I had now done everything I needed to do
I had no more decisions to make
at the time the masks had already
dropped they came back but at the time
there were no masks so I had no masks
and once I was vaccinated I could you
know go anywhere and I could travel
internationally I could take my vacation
to Greece
so when I got the vaccination
my feeling was I have no more pandemic
related problems but the people who had
not got vaccinated were still living
under
you know lose some constraints that I no
longer had so to me the pandemic was
over
I'd done everything I needed to do
and you know I had my freedom back
temporarily Mass came back
so
a lot of people have fact checked me on
my feeling
does that make sense
why were you fact checking me on my
feeling that was how I felt
that's how I felt
Jenny is saying take the L jetty
why do you think we're here
you might be missing the context here
Jenny
no my feeling is my feeling you can't
fact check a Feeling
can you
who's fact jacking my feeling
Jenny taking the L is the only reason
I'm here
so you're too much of an so I'm
going to get rid of you
so so the funniest thing about uh my
video I mean I I pinned the video saying
the people who didn't get vaccinated are
the winners
and there's still somebody out here
yelling take the L I'll take the L
it was like you can't take yes for an
answer so Alex Berenson dunked on me on
Twitter today and he he uh he wasn't
happy to take my he wasn't going to take
yes for an answer he was a little bit
angry about the things I've said about
him in the past
didn't didn't take it too well
so some people don't want to take the
take the win all right
Ian
Ian are you there
I think he will be
foreign
hey Scott how's it going good how are
you good what would you like to say
today
I mean you know you mentioned how a
feeling made you take the vaccine right
no no no no no no no I didn't say that
what was it what's the reason you took
the uh the vaccine was it just the data
was was that this whole reason well
there wasn't any data
true so there was a risk of long coveted
which might be zero or might be extreme
and we knew less about it then
and there was a risk from the virus
itself
which we did we didn't know how
engineered it was so there were two
extreme risks that could not be measured
and then the tiebreaker I did the same
tiebreaker as Dr Malone and Elon Musk
which is I needed to travel what I
wanted to travel internationally
and so I had two uh impossible to
measure risks
but the only thing that was unknown is I
wanted to travel
so I got it and then I traveled I'm
still alive but I have the now I have
those chemicals in me and who knows what
those will do while the risk of the the
risk of the virus itself is now you know
dropped to basically zero
so what was your question
oh looks like you dropped off I have to
add them back on
all right Ian
oh I think he disappeared
bummer all right uh let's try somebody
else
let's try
I was somebody who's gonna give me a
hard time otherwise this won't be fun I
don't the people who agree with me are
are not going to be a good show
so let's look for uh Mike
another mic
are you there
Mike
your speaker is muted unmute your
speaker Mike
okay
is not quick enough Mike is deleted
gotta be quick folks you got to be quick
um yeah I was looking for Adam I I
invited him once before
and he didn't want to come on
but about ah damn it it's the interface
Marty blarfest
turn off your muting
already blocked there you are
all right okay
hey got a question or a comment
well I'm I'm happy to disagree with you
about something in a minute if you want
but I will point out I'm sure you're
well aware of the answer to the question
why
are educated people getting the wrong
answers
that's it
you know cognitive distance issue right
there that's all that is because we
don't even know who the educated people
we call educated some of them have
college degrees and they're not really
educated
but so you say that the Lesser educated
people were uh had a immunity to
cognitive dissonance in this not at all
not at all
so we all found the answer we were
looking for then why did the why did the
educated people get the wrong answer
I get you
the issue the issue I don't actually
don't have any issues that I think it's
remarkable how you handle things uh
given all the assaults but I will say
that from the very beginning of the
pandemic and vaccines and everything I
thought it was very strange in the very
beginning when everybody talked about
the coming vaccine and how great it was
going to be especially president Trump
and there were of course some Democrats
saying we will never take the Trump
vaccine and I thought to myself I don't
think anybody would ever take that
vaccine no matter what why would you
take this vaccine that usually takes 10
years to make and and then all of a
sudden they have it in nine months
and there were just a lot of questions
about the whole thing and then when it
came time to talk about those questions
they were snuffed out by one side of the
argument and that was my clue when when
you can't have an open debate about
something
um the the side that's suppressing that
debate is not being honest and I thought
that would be obvious too nearly
everybody but that's the part that I
don't understand why educated people
couldn't understand because that's
that's that's the function I always have
felt
suppose you were in charge of the
pandemic
and and you believe that the information
you were putting out was correct and it
would save millions of lives would you
would you try to suppress the
information you thought would kill
millions of lives or would you let the
Free Speech do its thing
[Music]
being that they are supposedly educated
well I I'm
okay now let me stop and root it out
let's find out who really gave that
person the information I don't think you
know it wasn't one person beginning that
there was a consensus in the science
there was a lot of disagreement on the
science of what little data was left to
us and it turns out there is there was
no consensus but we were led to believe
we were intentionally led to believe
there was some kind of consensus and
there never was it was just the
government
leaders taking the side of the most
coercive argument that's all it was all
right thank you for your comments
thank you
speakers I think Ian's back
um well I'm bringing Ian up here let me
clarify
there were of course brilliant and
highly educated people on all sides of
the debates
my phone just like randomly crashed all
right you're back let me just finish a
point and then uh we'll go to you Ian
um somebody was saying that I wasn't
making the point that there were
highlighted educated people on both
sides there were it's just that the
trend
is a very strong Trend that the more
educated you were the more likely you
took the vaccination so I'm not saying
only smart people who are on one side
nothing like that all right Ian go ahead
so the question I wanted to ask you and
this is kind of like a weird thing right
so I kind of figured out pretty early on
that the vaccine didn't really work
right because it wasn't really showing
efficacy against Delta and then when
Omicron came in you know you hold on
hold on Ian Ian yeah when you we have to
clarify in this conversation when you
say worked we found out early on that it
wasn't stopping transmission but he but
yeah that's what I'm referring to yeah
wasn't stopping in transmission and so
you know by your definition of a vaccine
it kind of feel in that aspect right
right then you know some uh scientists
supposedly you know came out and said
that hey it's showing some efficacy in
the hospitalization rates now we don't
know if that's you know entirely true
the sample size is really small at least
the ones I've seen so I don't know if
the there's some dispute there well hold
on let's do it the fact check are you
saying that there's a dispute today
that vaccinated people are doing better
than unvaccinated people in hospitals is
that the question I think that was what
does
what they're saying people who had a
vaccine were showing that you know they
had better results in the hospitals I
don't think that actually is true
nowadays because the vast majority of uh
of people at least the ones that have
been sampled have been vaccinated right
in countries like Japan you know 90 of
the population plus you know has been or
at least actually closer to 100 have
been vaccinated and yet everybody's
still getting sick they're still getting
in the hospital so I don't think there's
any real significant difference I mean
China's the same way there's uh
thousands of hospitalizations a day and
they've all been vaccinated with their
you know version of inside of that yeah
but but Ian Ian you how do you compare
what they would have how sick they would
have been without the vaccination when
that category doesn't exist well
it worked at all because of the weight
of vaccines were developed like it was
simply too slow the rollout was too slow
the technology is not there it's not
fast enough to keep up with the uh the
mutations of the variants so you know by
the time Omicron came out it was pretty
clear that omicron's fairly safe right
it's uh for most people it presents as a
as a mild cold and it effectively
provides natural immunity this is
something even Bill Gates said he says
it's basically natural immunity and we
kind of don't need the vaccines anymore
and yet you still have fauci out there
pushing the vaccines Biden is pushing
the vaccines I mean a lot of governments
are pushing the vaccines not all you
know some of them simply stopped the
Mandate at that point or even if they
you know were thinking about doing a
mandate they just skipped it entirely
they even dropped uh Airline
restrictions like my country for example
Malaysia Singapore uh you know uh even
Germany they were like okay we're not
even going to restrict people from
traveling to and from their countries if
you know even if they don't have the
vaccine right so it's pretty clear that
a lot of Health authorities were like
okay this is not a big deal anymore
right but the question I wanted to ask
you right is that why did so many people
take the vaccine even early on despite
kind of figuring out that it didn't
really work I mean like I took the
vaccine I I don't know why I did it like
and I'm I'm asking myself that question
why did I take it with even knowing
logically right logically like that my
heuristics tell me that first of all
don't trust the pharmaceutical companies
because they're just there to sell
vaccines and secondly I mean if it
doesn't work why the hell take it at all
because it wasn't effective right I mean
what what was what was the date that you
took it because when I took it the
entire medical community said it totally
worked when did you take it I took it
maybe about three months after three
months after you know uh so we already
had some data showing wait wait wait
wait wait wait wait hold on you're
telling me you took it three months
before I did
uh no no no no after after you did after
you did
do you know when I took it
uh I don't know it went I'm assuming day
one I'm assuming you got it day one
right oh God no I I I I was I'm not
going to take a day one vaccination what
the what the do you think I'm
gonna be the first one to take an
experimental vaccination seriously I
don't know so hold up hold on seriously
oh hold on I want to see if there's
anybody else who thinks that do you
actually think
I would have been first in line for this
vaccination does anybody think that
that's that's a polar opposite of
everything I was saying at the time I
told people I was going to wait as long
as possible because most of the
complications happened in the first few
months so it would be actually insane to
take it first I I waited uh at least six
months or so before I touched it and six
months after it announced they were
still saying it was super effective
against transmission which by the way
for a clarification my understanding is
it was but only against Alpha which
didn't last long enough to make any
difference and it was right it was a
little bit a little bit effective on
Delta and then you know after that
basically nothing so when I took it the
vast majority of the experts were saying
you know we don't know if there's going
to be side effects because nobody could
know that but they were saying it's
definitely stopping you from getting
Alpha probably helps you a lot against
Delta but that's all we know and we're
trying to flatten the curve now now if
those things were true then it worked
except for whatever unknown you know
future problem shaft which is a big big
variable but in terms of uh if you took
it during Alpha and Delta
are you saying that you don't believe it
had any protective value for those
people let's say over 65
who took who took it right in the middle
of the worst Alpha Delta do you think it
didn't have any any effect
took it during Delta right but I don't
think it had any effect on Delta I think
it did have an effect on Alpha like
perhaps in places where Alpha was just
introduced right um where else was still
going around now you know about all that
all that you know the entire medical
community disagrees with you and would
tell you not the entire let's say 90
would disagree with you and say that it
made a big difference on survivability
of Delta I'm not saying that I'm saying
the medical community that's what you're
saying yeah yeah I would say I would
disagree with them because simply
because of the just the logic right I'm
not a scientist right but the logic is
that uh the virus I mean sorry the
vaccine is developed to counter just a
specific variant of the virus you change
a few things and suddenly it's not the
same virus anymore at that point right
it's like it's like influenza right but
it is seen for a certain strain for it
and you can kind of predict uh what you
know that strain might be which is what
they're using you know like AI now I'm
just trying to predict it
but I think you're I think you're
missing the sort of a basic thing about
the vaccinations is that they're never
exact you know so if if the virus morphs
in some ways but not always then the
vaccinations still work because they
could still identify it so so it might
work on the you know the first variation
but it's not it's not going to work on
the thousandth variation for sure
right yeah right yeah I mean I get that
so I mean let me ask you this too
effective on Delta all right Ian let me
ask you this do you think there was any
chance that the vaccinations during
Alpha and Delta uh helped the Health
Care system
not crash
I mean I I realized the time the science
I don't believe so so you think probably
the Health Care System would have been
pretty much the same but even if nobody
got vaccinated right and yeah and you
know that's opposite of what mainstream
science thinks
not now
I I don't think they're not arguing it
under I see I think this conversation
we're always conflating Omicron and
Alpha and Delta
I think I think mainstream everybody
thinks omicron's not going to kill him
and so vaccinations might be a little
Overkill unless you're you know 100
years old but
during the Alpha Delta phase
if the experts were right and at this
point of course we have to doubt all
data but if they were right then it
would have made a big difference in
keeping the hospitals operating
you know if you think that's important
now you you could argue that that's not
as important as their freedom and free
speech and you know getting the
information out there and you know not
having mandates and all that those are
separate but
but the argument is did it make any
difference during the peak of Alpha and
Delta that's that's the only vaccination
question that I think is interesting
because once you get to Omicron it just
it's obviously just a money grab I mean
I don't see any I see no medical
reason for that and you know maybe you
could give me some data someday that if
you're 85 and near death it'll buy you a
month or two I don't know but in general
I don't think anybody's thinking Omicron
is going to kill them these days
that's right all right thank you Ian
thank you for having me uh for having me
up all right thanks a lot
all right
how about one more
what do you think
one more
all right uh let's talk to uh
Owen
Owen turned on your microphone
take that mute off oh and there you are
hey hi Scott hey Owen how's it going
classify myself as this goddamn critic
but for the purposes of this
conversation I'll try and challenge my
critic all right
um I I think a few of the
criticisms I have or the mistakes I
think that might have been made is um
one goes back to I'm sure you remember
there was a live stream you did with a
risk management Matrix where you kind of
laid out here's how you think we could
think about the risk of taking the
vaccine versus the risk of being
unvaccinated can I call that uh roughly
yeah go ahead what's the point
well the I think what shocked me as you
were walking through this was that you
got to the point where you said
here's the long-term risk of taking the
vaccine
and you said that's unknown so we should
just treat that as zero
and I that part didn't make any sense to
me at all yeah well I I can see what I I
can see I can see why that didn't make
sense because I didn't say anything like
that
that's the opposite of anything I would
say
no no no no no I would never say
anything I would never say anything even
in that universe
you you think I would ever treat a
vaccination as a zero risk
what you're agreeing with me right now
but um no well actually but but but just
think about it logically
you should have known I wasn't saying
that because nobody would say that that
that's like something that literally
nobody would say there's not a doctor
who would say it there's not a Critic
who would say it there's not a patient
who would say it but you think I
actually said that in public literally
nobody would say that
but let me let me tell you what you
might have heard
right you might have heard something you
thought was that
so here's what I think you heard that if
you looked at the risk of uh long covid
that was totally unknown
and if you looked at the risk of the
vaccination
it was totally unknown
so since both of those are potentially
big and totally unknown you should treat
them like they're not part of the
decision and that's what you heard which
makes perfect sense
but if you just say you're ignoring one
of the big risks that I would never say
that I'm saying that there are two big
risks and they're both unknown so you
have to treat them as equivalent
unknowns they don't they don't move you
in either direction
that's what I said
okay well in any case I think and to be
fair when you went through this risk
management Matrix you said very clearly
everyone should make their own decisions
on how to weigh all these different
risks you were just laying out the
Matrix for people and then you walked
through an example of it but I think
your example probably colored
how people perceive that and that kind
of leads into my next criticism is that
um
I think one of the reasons that people
perceive you as being pro-vax and pro
mask and all these other things that I
do think are mischaracterized is that as
I listen to you you know I don't know
maybe 100 times going through let's talk
about this aspect or let's talk about
this study or let's talk about this
particular way of thinking about the
pandemic or the vaccines
the majority of those things were
discrediting anti-vaxx arguments
and you know you had all sorts of
disclaimers saying I don't know if this
is true or I you know I don't I'm not
telling anybody whether or not to get
the vaccine but when you then proceed to
say here's why this anti-vaxx argument
doesn't make any sense or isn't credible
which is usually what you focus on is
whether something's credible but it
definitely leads people to believe that
you're on that side of the argument
because you didn't spend nearly as much
time talking about here's why the
pro-vax arguments don't make sense or
here's why the pro mask arguments don't
make sense and I know you're a
persuasion expert so you had to abuse
somewhere where I would think of how you
would perceive that way yeah and and I
didn't care so that was something I
wasn't trying to fix
so you're you're right I was completely
aware of that and had no interest in
fixing that at all
um but here here's why I'll tell you my
internal thinking but your your
observation is correct because that's
your take on what was happening so
there's no argument on your
subjective uh impression but here's why
I didn't uh criticize the other side
I was the first person who told me the
vaccinations wouldn't work I predicted
that before warp speed started like as
it as was announced it was very clear
that they've been trying for 20 years to
get something that was that would work
as a vaccination as a coronavirus all of
the experts said we have no idea how to
do it and it's not going to happen in a
year and then it didn't so that was the
very first thing I said the second thing
I've said consistently and always I'm
the creator of the Dilbert comic strip
I never believe anything that comes out
of big Pharma big government big
Corporation
I also say follow the money works every
time and you don't need to know anything
else about the vaccination side of the
argument
to me to me the entire pro-vaccination
criticism is how much money is involved
and then you're done
right and and I've always said that you
can't believe the data I always said
that I'm going to wait as long as
possible because I don't trust that you
know on day one I definitely don't trust
it but at least I'll see how many people
die in the first six months so to me the
argument against the vax meaning against
trusting big companies is just so
stipulated and given that it needs no
explanation
whereas the the anti-vaxxers were
primarily swimming in misinformation
primarily
so I'd say
95 of the anti-vac stuff was wrong data
and misinterpretation and maybe maybe a
hundred percent of the pro-vac stuff was
wrong
maybe it might have been 100 wrong I
don't know but but the the pro vac side
is so
discredited on obvious grounds big money
people you don't trust the governments
you know those things were I think
everybody knew that and everybody knew
that the vaccinations were not tested as
much as normal ones everybody knew it
was a new technology everybody knew
there was coercion so those arguments
didn't need to be made because everybody
could see them plainly but you're right
that I quite intentionally
stir the pot of the of the people who
were the let's say the uh the most riled
up because I thought it would be useful
to help the Skeptics know which parts
they shouldn't rely on in other words I
was the skeptic of both the
um Pro side and the anti I was skeptical
extreme skepticism on both sides but it
is nonetheless true that although most
of the anti-vaccination arguments were
based on ridiculous data and
misinterpretation of data and confusing
causation and correlation which is what
I like to talk about
um it is nonetheless true that if they
didn't get vaccinated and they got to
the age of Omicron they won
now the people who didn't get vaccinated
and according to the medical
professionals died because of it
hypothetically
they lost
so I'm just saying if you just look at
the outcomes the people who simply said
don't trust the government there's a lot
of money involved they're going to be
right 80 percent of the time
wouldn't you say
yes I do yeah I agree with you on that
yeah it does it doesn't even matter what
the topic is right the people who say
look look I don't care what the topic is
could be climate change could be
vaccinations could be the world economic
Forum it could be anything whatever it
is
80 of the time the government's lying to
you and it's not good for you
so if you just took the the heuristic of
follow the money
do they have a billion dollar reason to
lie oh yeah they do yeah they do we all
saw that like nobody was confused by
that there's nobody who didn't
understand the size of that risk so it's
nonetheless true that the people that
the people like me who took it
analytically
we got one answer the the most highest
Highly Educated trained people got one
answer and the people who used a rule of
thumb look look they're obviously lying
you know they're hiding stuff they're
asking for immunity they're doing
everything you would do if you were
Shady
and if you do everything that you do
when you're shady we're gonna assume
you're shady
so don't put that in my arm
and that that argument turned down to be
one that if you didn't die
you won
well I would also take issue with saying
that the other side the anti-vax side
didn't approach it analytically I I
think many of them did and I think many
of them Dove deep into looking at
studies I mean I read hundreds of
medical studies and well hold on hold on
hold on that that means you believed
some and you disbelieved others and none
of us have that ability unfortunately
nobody I did not just take them at face
value in fact I had a network of people
many of them were doctors that we would
discuss these things in depth and try
and debunk them so it was more of a
group effort right but we know there's
no amount of group that can know what
the date which date is correct there is
no mechanism there's nobody can ask
there's nobody who's good at it there's
nothing but we have no way to know what
it is we're vaccinated people in it and
unvaccinated people in it so we got a
lot of perspectives no the getting a lot
of perspectives doesn't help you as much
as you wanted to because it's a lot of
people who don't don't know what they're
talking about if you add them together
they it doesn't improve
well in any case I you know I I think I
don't think it was permitting people on
the anti-vac side just a a rule of thumb
decision though I think they were
analyzing it and to your point yes maybe
they have just as much cognitive
dissonance and
group think or you know errors in terms
of saying I'm only going to trust the
things that agree with me I'm sure some
of that is true for me and for all the
people that I consulted with but 100 of
them I do think that if there was an
analytical approach there I mean I was
looking at studies that was saying the
spike protein is what's causing the
damage coronavirus and that seemed to
never get connected in the media with by
the way that's the same Spike Protein
that's in the vaccines all right but I
would I would argue that your view if
you believed if you believe some of the
medical data but not say the mainstream
that you're that's not a date argument
that that's an argument that the other
people are liars
which was right
right which turned out to be the
heuristic that was correct the other
side's lying so I'm lying or they're
just wrong I mean I think a lot of them
may have certainly believed what they
were saying
and how would you know how could you
judge even with the help of the the
other people were looking at it how do
you how can you judge what it was
correct in the data
honestly would still say I'm not sure
like I'm not 100 certain of either side
I would just say that the risk
management decisions seem to me seemed
pretty obvious that that with all these
unknowns it doesn't make sense to take
this treatment especially with the
disease that is not nearly as deadly as
they were saying it was well let me then
let me uh
let me test your logic then
so so do you believe that long covet is
is real or did you believe it when you
made your decision to fax or not vax
what do you believe that long covet was
a real thing or no
I would I would have put a low
probability on it maybe 20 or at least
that it's true but it's only true in the
sense that there's there is a post
vaccine vaccine or post disease fatigue
syndrome that applies to any major
illness like if you're in the hospital
there's a time it takes to recover and
right so some of it might just be the
normal amounts of that right that which
which could you know make a drag on for
six months or so so you so you had an
unknown risk of covet
and then you also add an unknown risk
from the vaccination itself
unknown yes but I I tried to at least
assess a probability so I put took my
own age my own health lack of
comorbidities into account I mean in my
in my case I actually thought my parents
because they're very old probably should
take the vaccine but part of that
calculation in my mind is that because
they're older even if there are side
effects of the vaccine well they're only
going to be alive a certain number of
years anyway as a young person how old
are you
I'm 51. all right so you're you're well
below the old people level so do you
think you could compare your decision to
somebody who is older
so I I was in the category where
the professionals were saying okay
you're you're in the category where you
should get vaccinated if I were If I
Were Young if I were 51 and thinner I'm
not sure that I would have and if I
didn't have asthma uh I'm not sure I
would have so your decision in mind
actually sound the same
in other words if I were young I would
have said oh
the risk is low so I'm going to take my
risk of low covid I'll take a risk of
long covet if I'm young and healthy
but uh not so much if I'm older and I
have some risk
yeah Scott I have no
clearly made the same decision I don't
know I'd have to think about it because
you know if I were 65 and if I had
comorbidities maybe that would have
affected my decision but I I don't
follow you for getting the jobs yeah and
by the by the way I don't calculation I
I don't claim that I made a correct
decision
so I've always claimed it was guessing
on my side where people got angry is
when I said I think it's guessing on
your side too that's where everybody got
mad
yeah no I mean I my criticism is just
about you know
the fact that you're saying well the
analytical people made one decision and
the other people were all using a rule
of thumb
whereas you know I mean I think I did a
very deep dive into research and talking
to all sorts of people and listening to
all sorts of perspectives and seeing my
decision based on that analysis not
based on just I don't trust the
government and the story okay so I I was
skeptical of all the government's
information but also all of the Skeptics
information you you were a little more
uh convinced by the the Skeptics
argument whereas I gave them all zero
credibility
yes although I mean in many cases I I
did not believe some of the Skeptics
information especially the ones that
were very hyperbolic or you know the
ones that are saying everyone's going to
die and they they were all sorts of
theories that people would put forth
about how you know it's gonna just be
the end of the world it's a depopulation
no I didn't buy into any of that like it
it's just on the whole when I put it all
together and when I have to come up with
a decision I certainly fell out on the
anti-back side and it seemed a pretty
easy decision once I looked at all the
the arguments and data and perspectives
what what's your uh education or a field
what do you do for a living
mostly in technology Consulting so so
you're you're attacked your rational
Tech kind of a brain
thank you Owen and we'll we'll see you
on see you on locals
thanks I appreciate all your uh Twitter
interaction as well
for now all right I think we've done
what we need to do I wasn't watching
your comments as much as as I should
have but uh for those of you on YouTube
You're unaware that if you look at my uh
pinned tweet
you're going to be happy because that's
where I say that the people who didn't
give backs are the winners
that's why you want to hear right
so go go look at that you're missing
some context the ones who are saying you
refuse to say you were wrong the entire
context of today
is that I tweeted a video of me saying
that the the people who didn't give axed
are in the better situation
because if you didn't get vaxxed you
don't have any risk of the vaccination
itself
and nomicron's you know if you're young
and healthy especially omicron's no big
deal especially if you've been infected
before
all right
anybody else have a uh problem
uh we all lost you lost your little
brother
I'm sorry about that
you knew from the jump
well I would like to learn from you
that's why I think we need uh Dom Davos
because the people who knew before the
data was reliable
and they knew just from you know
heuristics and from their common sense
and their logic
you need to teach me how to do that
because
my
my education experience
didn't teach me how to be certain before
there's any information I don't know how
to do that but you guys nailed it so
you're the winners
all right
by the way
if you haven't looked at the comments to
my uh to my video in which I say the
non-vaxed are the winners you have to
read the comments because they're
hilarious maybe just to me I don't know
but I thought they were hilarious
all right that's all I got for today
we're gonna go I'm gonna talk to the
locals people for a minute bye for now
