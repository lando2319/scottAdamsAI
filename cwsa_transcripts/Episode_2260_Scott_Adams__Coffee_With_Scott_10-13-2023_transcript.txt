good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams now
shorten to
cwsa because that's how cool we are we
don't need full words anymore no no no
no no if you'd like your experience of
cwsa to go to new levels all you need is
a cuper mugar glass a tanker cheler
Stein a candy Jer flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee enjy me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dopamine here of
the day the thing that makes everything
better it's cold the simultaneous Sip
and it happens
now so
Sublime well we'll talk about all the
things happening in the news don't worry
I like to start with some appetizers
mental appetizers I call them now I
mentioned this before but I think it's
worth restating Bill Gates in a recent
interview that's been getting around the
internet said and I
quote uh there's a lot of climate
exaggeration said Gates the climate is
not the end of the planet so the planet
is going to be fine and quote no
temperate country is going to become
uninhabitable now is that a big
deal or not a big
deal don't you think that's a big deal
and I and I feel
like when you're watching the the world
fall apart with the you know the war in
Europe and the war in the Middle
East I feel like we're starting to put
climate change in
context I I feel like there are some
things you can worry about when you
don't have other problems let me ask you
this have you ever seen less news about
the
trans situation in
America I've never seen less trans
news now while I'm fully you know
sympathetic to the trans
situation certainly want them to have
perfectly good lives whatever makes them
happy
but I'm not sure it was ever the most
important issue in the
world it it was closer to the bottom
certainly critical issue to people
directly involved but I think we're
seeing a a real adjustment of our
priorities in real time when you start
to think about eating and
survival you know you're worried a lot
less about people's uh sexual Orient
orent ation and genders and stuff like
that but climate change I think is in
that
category um that people are going to
understand that maybe there was a little
hyperbole involved now I like the fact
that Bill Gates said it because Bill
Gates is the one
person that everybody kind of thinks
he's you know sort of the voice of
climate change in a way I mean I think
of him that way I don't really think of
a
Greta you know or or or
you know they're all deeply involved but
I feel like Bill Gates was the one
person who understood all the technology
you know he knows nuclear he knows coal
I mean he he's got a sense of the whole
field and if he says it's
exaggerated how are they going to ignore
him I feel like this is the like a real
changing that to me this feels like a
real inflection point and how the world
thinks about climate
change we'll see
well Tucker is making news being
provocative Tucker
Carlson and one of the things he said he
came up with a bunch of provocative
quotes but this one this one's uh pretty
pretty provocative he says what's
happening on the southern border isn't
just an invasion but a crime the
politicians and NOS responsible for it
are criminals who should be punished
accordingly do you think that our
politician should be in
jail for their current
policies because that would be
Biden well just Biden really it would
just be one person because in America
there's only one person who makes the
decision so does he really think that
Biden should be in
jail for a policy that isn't working
out really
jail wouldn't that be
just um kind of repeat eting January 6's
mistake then imagining that people who
are politicians and maybe they're doing
their
job maybe they would make
mistakes but are they Criminal Just
because people died from their mistakes
it's pretty severe so I'm going to
disagree with Tucker that these actions
are criminal they are absolutely not
criminal they are genocidal they're
genocidal they guarantee that there will
be genocide in this country if if not
reversed almost
immediately so now Tucker you were
completely wrong they should not be
punished as criminals um but we should
take seriously the fact that they've
allowed
genocide uh
consciously it's a conscious decision
because there's no way they don't
understand what they're bringing into
the country now to be clear the vast
majority of immigrants just looking for
better life and I I welcome them even
the illegal ones I'm I'm happy to have
illegal ones here too if it turns out
they're here for the right reason you
know it's not my first choice let let's
be clear First Choice is full control of
our
borders but I'm not super concerned
about
hardworking Christian families coming
across the border and trying to fit in
that that's just not where I'm going to
put all my worry but I do think we need
a secure border however
the fact that they can come in also
highlights the fact that anybody else
can come in and there's no way we're not
being invaded by
terrorists you know that right there's
no way the terrorists are staying home
they're definitely coming in and we're
going to see something not too unlike
what happened in Israel um probably the
next five
years five years I guess you're going to
see something like that so yes whoever
is bringing genocide to our country
maybe we should consider different
leadership let's talk about the speaker
of the
house now I'm not sure I know all the
you know the back room dealings and
personalities and all that but I did see
one thing that I liked a lot so when it
looked like it was going to be Jim
Jordan or Steve
scalise Jim Jordan endorsed the other
guy he endorsed
scalise now I'm trying to figure out how
clever this
was because it could turn out just to be
freaking genius because what happened
was scalise found out he couldn't get
the support he needed for the job and he
took himself
out now Jim Jordan seems to be the
likely person to take the job after
endorsing his
competitor oh you you can't win harder
than that
yeah just think of anything that's a
bigger win than endorsing your opponent
and then
winning that that's the perfect
situation the the whole job of the
speaker is to figure out how to make
people get along you know and Jim
Jordan's sort of a fire thrower but you
know he throws his fire at the Democrats
so the fact that he would play it this
way which
shows you know real skill I think it
looked like real skill now this assumes
I'm making a lot of assumptions here I
can't read his mind but I'm assuming he
knew that
scalise either would get the job then it
would be easy to work with him which
would be not a bad outcome or he would
not get the job and Jordan would look
like the across the aisle well just not
across the aisle but he would look like
a peacemaker It's Kind of Perfect yeah I
don't have a strong opinion of about Jim
Jordan one way or the other but if the
Republicans think that's their
guy you know I don't have a special
problem with it or I don't really have a
prediction about it either uh I would
say he's very
capable seems very uh seems well-liked
in General on the Republican side um so
we'll see that could work out um I saw
Matt
Gates saying that uh you know somebody
questioned how this could be an
improvement you know wouldn't it have
been better some say to just let
McCarthy stay there because he was good
at his job and we you know we'd have
somebody in charge during these critical
times to which Matt Gates said he lied
repeatedly so if we get somebody in the
job who doesn't lie to us repeatedly
that's an
upgrade I agree
totally that you can't have a speaker of
the house who's lying to you
repeatedly his whole job is to be
trusted I mean that's that's so baked
into the whole core process if if if
somebody's making promises to to people
you know in order to pull a little
Coalition together for some some
specific thing you can't lie to those
people there will never be another
Coalition so you know I can't fact check
how much lying went on and if it's you
know more than the usual politician or
anything like that I don't have a sense
of that but I love that as a standard I
love the standard that you'll fire Your
Own Boss for lying to you repeatedly I
don't think I could love that more
honestly now again McCarthy would
probably say he didn't do any lying so
let's let's be honest I don't know
exactly who's doing what but if it's
true that that the boss got fired for
lying to the uh staff you know
effectively I love that that's that's a
move ahead so Matt Gates I think you get
the win on this in my
opinion um now all the smart people um
you know the smart people right smart
people the pundits the people we've
elected to lead us yeah the smart people
they are unified in one thing they're
saying that not having a speaker of the
house uh is causing immense harm to
America
and I couldn't agree with it more but
let me just list all the immense harms I
mean just so far I mean it's early but
just so far from not having a speaker of
the house let's see some of the immense
harms were
um
um well never mind never mind next
story Salon has a big uh article
um
about the Trump lovers being being a
cult now it appears that that's going to
be a main line of attack this time that
it's a cult oh don't join the cult they
don't know what they're doing because
they're in a cult so Salon talks to some
psychologists who I would recommend you
never ever go to a
psychologist every time I see a
psychologist making any kind of comment
about the news you know something that's
Rel related to the news I just shake my
head and say okay that's the experience
I had you the one time I went to like a
marriage
counselor I thought I might be with the
dumbest person who ever lived that's
what I thought so but apparently the
ones they talk to will say things in the
news and be on record uh not exactly
painting their profession and Glory but
uh one of the psychologists they talked
to said that uh the trumpers the magga
people are a cult because and this is
important for the definition of a cult
because people would be afraid to leave
the
cult
what
what have they heard of
disantis he's making a lot of news he's
like a a governor he's running for
president do you know that uh Dave
rubben back D
santis and I still talk to him I know I
know like like if he texts me I'll
actually return his
text he left the
cult and yet
amazingly I don't hate his guts
he's still the great guy that he was
before who knew who knew you could
actually be a reasonable person and
leave the magga
cult I you know I'm the perfect
example uh you know I was obviously well
associated with sporting Trump at the
moment I'm uh endorsing
V I've had no problems with that was I
supposed to be ostracized from the
cult where when did that happen I
registered as Democrat this year just so
I'd you know uh slime the Democrats with
my own bad
reputation nobody
cared nobody cared uh what what is it
that what is it the Democrats are
seeing that would
suggest Mega people couldn't change
their mind and live a happy
life it's like ridiculously easy to do I
didn't I didn't even know there was a
risk nobody told me there was some risk
involved to that I had no
idea
well
um speaking of Colts I remind you that
on Monday I have a volunteer a Democrat
and a mega hater has volunteered I
finally found somebody who would do this
in public so on Spaces the audio feature
on the
xplatform on this Monday
10:16 at uh 6:30 p.m. eastern time I'll
be talking to you if all goes well I
hope he shows up I think he will um and
I'll be deprogramming a democrat in
public now I want to be clear it's not a
debate it's not a debate debate is
useless I'm actually going to deprogram
him or that's the attempt now before you
get
all you know cocky and you think ah
we're going to deprogram those Democrats
I could do the same thing with the
Republican it would be different
topics but I could do the same thing so
don't get too cocky if if this works out
I might do a republican next because
there's nobody who's not in their own
bubble there's nobody who's not in the
bubble in
fact um as I tweeted today the world is
in what I call phase one of waking
up in phase one of waking up which would
be another way of saying you know
learning to understand your actual
reality better that would be the waking
up part in phase one we we realize that
our
adversaries are not always uh you know
stupid and evil and
underiner
brainwashed would you say that that's an
accurate statement of the people you
disagree with would you say that Hamas
is
brainwashed you would yeah of course you
would would you say since most of my
audiences leans right would you say that
the people on the left are brain washed
do is that word too strong or would you
agree with that characterization yes yes
now and you know of course as I just
mentioned you know the people you're
calling brainwashed you know that
they're calling you brainwashed you all
know that
right so we're in phase one where we're
sure we're not but the other people are
and the fact that they're calling us
brainwashed well it's just another
symbol of how brainwashed they are
that's phase one that's where we
are phase two should we survive as a
species to get to
it
is understanding that we're all in our
own Bubbles and there's no such thing as
the other person is
brainwashed they are but it's really not
about the other person being brainwashed
it's about everybody everybody has the
opinion assigned to them by their choice
of media now they start with a
preference you there might it might even
be baked into your your jeans a little
bit there's something about that I think
that's true but beyond that your your
specifics of your belief are just from
the media and it's just brainwashing and
it applies to both sides now I want to
be clear that doesn't mean that both
sides are
wrong you get that right when I say
wrong I mean in terms of any policies
that come out of it one side is going to
have policies that work better than the
other side and you know not necessarily
always in the same side so so policies
are different from the fact that one
side might be brainwashed well actually
both sides all right so if you'd like to
see the first part of this the phase one
deprogramming Monday at 6:30 eastern
time I hope that actually
happens it'll be live so Anything Could
Happen including um the guest not
showing up but I think you
will all right yeah NBC News uh has
embarrassed
itself I missed this story but
apparently yesterday or so they had
claimed on NBC news that they had quote
gained access to the community notes
function on
X and once they had gained
access they determined that uh uh that
instead of fighting false and misleading
information there were false things on
that had been totally
unattended and so therefore this
community notes
thing not so good that's what they said
and then the fact check came in from
Community
notes that's right Community notes fact
jacked NBC story about Community
notes um
and
here's what they
said um I will paraphrase you did not
gain access to any special Twitter
system they merely talked to somebody
who does community notes and there's
just somebody who is a community notes
person who just showed them their
screens and do you know about those
things that they were
uh that they were ignoring they're just
things that they had not yet added note
to that was NBC's big story they looked
over somebody's shoulder and didn't
understand what they were saying that's
it that was their investigative
report so just so you don't think Salon
is a ridiculous uh NBC news
also some ridiculous
 and if I mention
MSNBC let's talk about them
apparently they experienced a 33%
decline in Prime Time ratings because of
how they covered uh the Hamas uh war
with
Israel 33%
decline
now how do you get declining ratings in
a hot
war is that the only time that's ever
happened in the history of the United
States you know since we've had
media I've never even heard of that have
you do you think during the the gulf
Wars do you think that there was any
news network that lost viewers during a
war I'm not even sure this is true I I
feel like maybe the news isn't
true I mean could they really have
dropped 33% now I understand what the
problem was they were a little bit maybe
trying to be balanced about something
that their viewers thought it should not
be
balanced right it's probably what it was
um but man they just got creamed
well Fox News num shot up
42% even CNN that went up
177% MSNBC down
33% now here's what I think is
happening I think they lost their Jewish
audience and their uh Jewish supporting
audience you know any anybody who is
like-minded uh that's probably the whole
story so MSNBC was
not were they to
woke does that apply because I'm not
sure where a wokeness overlaps with what
anybody would think about the Middle
East the Middle East is kind of separate
from a wokeness isn't
it not
completely yeah well there you go go so
MSNBC learned a valuable lesson
today
um I think it's interesting that when I
got up this morning and checked the X
platform one of the words that was
trending was
brainwashing
brainwashing was trending and it wasn't
because somebody had been captured in a
military sense and
brainwashed it's now being used as a
headline word to describe the things
we're seeing which we used to describe
other
ways why do we describe it as
brainwashing now when we used to
describe it as just people
disagreeing what's
different what changed to make people
what what what changed to make people
see it as
brainwashing probably
me
just one of the things it's just one
just one of the impacts was me I've been
reframing this as two movies on one
screen for a long time if you hear two
movies on one screen long enough and
then you see you know example in action
like a war is a good example then you
see it so clearly that at the very least
you know the other people are
brainwashed at the very least we used to
think that the news was
real when we believe that the news was
real it kind of did make it didn't make
kind of
sense I got a little error
here oh looks like uh streamyard is just
totally
stopped we got a complete stop the
rubble killed
it can't restart
it got no
comments let's see if I end it and
restart it see what happens oh it's
completely dead give me a minute G to
reboot
this oh I can't move
this let's see if I can even close the
window streamyard itself is
dead
hello people is anybody still
there oh look at
that looks like we're
back all right sorry my uh screen froze
up there but we're
back all right as I was saying
brainwashing is uh
trending and
uh um I got the I got this comment today
on uh on the xplatform from a user
called
Pisano who said among other things he
said I'm thoroughly enjoying your new
book reframe your brain reframe your
brain
my new book that's changing lives all
over the place if you don't have it you
really
should probably the most important book
I've ever written probably because it's
changing people's lives the fastest and
the most but here's the question that
Pisano has he says as a trained
hypnotist master of persuasion why are
you and others like Robert chelini
trying to launch widespread reframes to
make the world a better
place so Pisano is asking with my skills
why don't I fix uh you know World Peace
World piece
now I don't I don't like to complain but
most
authors get asked for
autographs sometimes people say oh could
you add more than the autograph could
you say you know to my brother you know
John and put a little message there
almost never does somebody ask an author
to use his powers to force World
Peace but to you Pano I say challenge
accepted challenge
accepted all
right um ramaswami is making news at the
very hardest time that anybody could
make news which is when there's
something more interesting going
on and uh he's getting a lot of heat so
uh Hannity he went at it with Hannity
Hannity just sort of went off on him
and how many of you saw VI talked to
Hannity give give me your one sentence
impression did one of them come off
better than the
other cuz I had a view about it but I'm
biased it it looked to me like hity had
some kind of a weird
meltdown is that what you
saw it it looked like Hannity was trying
to take vake out of the race and failed
completely but he basically just made
himself look like a partisan in not the
best way so that that was my impression
but you know I'm Pro V so I might be too
biased about that I was wondering if you
saw out the same
way all right well so after that uh
others piled on one of them is uh uh
Matt
Whitlock and he tweeted this he said
this is the 300th time V has said
something
inflammatory uh been presented with his
own words
verbatim and feigned more outrage that
he was being somehow
mischaracterized uh this is embarrassing
and he should drop out all right here's
what you need to know first of all I
don't think Matt meant 300 times
literally that's a little thing we call
hyperbole do I criticize him for using
hyperbole no because I know what he
means what he means is too much 300 is
just Hyperbole and those who don't
understand hyperbole end up debating the
wrong things it's not about the count
it's just directionally he's saying this
guy does this too much but here's a
little uh media watching trick for you
when you see the word verbatim used this
way this is not something you should pay
attention to and I'll tell you why but
listen to how it's used just look for
the word verbatim in the
sentence um this is the 300th time V has
been presented with something uh in his
own words
verbatim and then feigned moral outrage
that he was being somehow
mischaracterized to which I tweeted back
almost all of the major political hoaxes
are based on verbatims a Verbatim is a
signal of a hoax he's using it as a
signal of Truth No it's all you got this
backwards
Matt Where Have You
Been anytime any time you see somebody
oh it but it's
verbatim watch here's this video clip of
the president of the United States
calling neo-nazis fine people look it's
verbatim it's verbatim yes it is
verbatim and it's also so an a context
that literally reversed his meaning from
condemning them to praising them that's
is reversed as you can get he condemned
people but then they said it's verbatim
the part we we're going to selectively
cut out it's called a rupar when you
selectively edit and take the verbatim
and then what do people say when you
complain that it's not
true I saw it myself on
video so when you hear the word
verbatim or the words I heard it or saw
it
myself that's like a 90% likely signal
for fake news it's really reliable
people don't use those words about real
things there's some words that people
consistently use for things that aren't
real and once you learn those words you
spot them right away as soon as you see
that word
verbatim so yes it's probably the right
words but the wrong
context um then Dan krena who is not too
happy with
vake um I guess there's a difference in
how much
military response the two of them think
is appropriate V would be more let's not
get involved in any military unless it's
directly for America's benefit you know
not this indirect stuff like oh maybe
China will attack Taiwan unless we
attack Ukraine you know not this
indirect stuff if it's directly
involving us such as the cartels then
yes military that would be V's view I
think I'm characterizing that correctly
but
um Dan Credo says of a v enough of the
homas
apologists V ramaswami is dangerously
ignorant when it comes to issues of
National Security and Foreign Affairs
it's apparent from his a little list
below I don't know what the list was
they has zero understanding of the
region or existing American policy in
the region zero so the if I can
summarize Dean kreno says that V is a
Hamas apolog
ologist and uh too
inexperienced to be making decisions at
this
level well I've got a couple of
observations about that number
one anytime you see uh these words and I
should have added this apologist I'm
going to add that I thought I had added
that
apologist
whenever you see these
words and I'll give you a better view
here in a
second oh no I lost my
cap all right here's three words that
will
reliably um identify somebody who's not
a legitimate debater
now there the people I'm going to
mention I kind of like right so it's not
about the the
people but they're not being good people
when they do this right so it's more I
shouldn't say the people are bad I
should just say that they're doing
something bad all right if you say that
somebody
compared Gaza to the Holocaust do you
think that happened in any real way
there there are people who will make
that comparison and they will be
canceled immediately but do you think
that they meant that do do you think
that they meant that they're the same in
all the ways never so if you see
somebody say Hey you compared this bad
thing to that bad thing and man let me
tell you this other bad thing is way
worse and you compareed them you're
canceled anybody who uses this word
compared they're up
because you never did that people just
aren't comparing all the things they're
usually comparing one thing for
example uh I mentioned for context that
um although there were 27 Americans who
died or so in the Hamas attack and
that's horrible and just almost
monstrously hard to even hold in your
head and of course that was a small
subset of the larger you know
tragedy but for context I
tweeted uh that about 200 people
Americans a day die from fentanyl
overdosis about 200 a day a
day now somebody's going to say because
you know they will Scott did you just
compare overdoses which are optional
because people don't have to do drugs
did you compare compare that to somebody
coming in and like decapitating babies
like how did you compare that and the
answer is no I didn't compare
them you did that's your word I said
it's good context wouldn't you like to
know is 27 a lot of people to die in one
day turns out it's not and of course the
circumstances are completely different
but if you're talking about
death do you know those 200 people
that died
today they don't give a
 about how other people died they're
just dead so dead is dead so here's what
I'll compare the feelings of the dead 27
people with the feelings of the Dead 200
none of them are happy about it however
they got there but of course the
circumstances are completely
different uh the moral equivalence
argument I saw Ben Shapiro with this one
now I'm going to give I'm going to give
a semi free pass to anyone with Jewish
Heritage this
week would you agree that's
appropriate if if you're just talking
you know even in public I'm going to
give you a free pass you're going to say
things that go too far in my
opinion and I'm going to let that ride
because this is not this is not exactly
a a logic contest right this is not a
logic contest this is about insanely
Deep
Emotions and the response is going to be
based on emotion plus power there will
never be a logical element to what's
going on you we'll make the arguments
but we're in a situation in which you
don't want to get too logical it's just
not what what's happening
here so when Ben Shapiro said hey stop
making a moral equivalence between what
is and will happen in
Gaza compared to what happened in Israel
because one is a defensive act largely
and the other is an offensive
act to which I
say I don't think that's what people
were doing I think literally zero people
thought there was a moral equivalent
now the only way there's a moral
equivalence is in the real uh let's say
uh you know angels dancing on the head
of a pin philosophical way in which you
would say which I say by the way this is
my my view once you've achieved pure
evil don't tell me that somebody did two
times that two times pure evil is just
more pure
evil once it's pure evil what happened
in Israel
you know there's nothing to compare it
to it's just pure evil you could have a
higher death count but is that how we're
keeping score not really we don't keep
score that way maybe we should but we
don't all right and then
apologist if you see the word
apologist that's just that's just not a
good
player right do you think that V is an
apologist
do you think that he
approved of
Hamas like why would you say that about
an
American when we're kind of you know
we're kind of under pressure too here
why would you say that about an
American that you know it isn't true so
anytime you see these words these are
not people you should debate you should
close them down and run
away they're just just they're they're
operating on some pure emotional level
they're not trying to
be they're not trying to be logical and
win a debate they're trying to they're
trying to demonize you to take you out
of the debate that's the better way to
put it they're trying to demonize you so
that your words will not be heard
because they don't like
them now I'm not saying that there
aren't you know people who are doing
exactly these things but you never see
it you know like in the public debate
the is not apologizing for terrorists
it's just stupid it's
stupid all
right so uh here's a few things I would
say to that
um number one Dan kenwell seems to think
that experience in National Security
would be a pretty big
Advantage I would say that experience in
government government is most correlated
with
corruption the number one correlation
with experience is
corruption that's a reframe you can take
to the
bank do you know why people liked Trump
because he wasn't a career politician do
you know what that implied to his
supporters it implied that he wasn't
corrupt when Kena says need the
experienced people to do that you know
how I hear
it the corrupt people need to be in
charge that's all I hear the the people
who have figured out how to profit from
the military-industrial complex you
can't do that on day one that's not day
one stuff that's uh I've been here for a
while I've got the right positions in
Congress I've reached the level where
I'm important enough that somebody would
want to give me a
reward yeah experience in
government is a signal for
corruption doesn't mean every person but
I sure as hell would not prefer
experience over the smartest person
who's ever run for office who could
learn your job
overnight sorry to say it see I I keep
saying this like I haven't heard anybody
else say it but we haven't seen a v run
for office we've seen lots of rail smart
people a lot of you know um IV League
people people who you wouldn't want to
compete against in an IQ contest they're
really smarter people have run for
office but we haven't seen a a
vakee maybe not since Thomas Jefferson
uh ran r or something but uh or Hamilton
but he's the
type who can figure out your whole
job like while you're getting
coffee
you haven't seen this before so people
people don't know how to evaluate him
right even if you don't like his opinion
today and you say but your opinion is
underformed because there's this thing I
know that you don't
know give him 10 more minutes tell him
the thing that you know that he doesn't
know and we're done here and now he
knows
it he's not like other people he's not
rejecting opinions that disagree with
them he's actually considering them and
sometimes even adjusting from them and
you're seeing it in real time we've
never seen this before so comparing him
to other
people it's just not fair well fair is
the wrong word it's not useful oh by the
way uh arold Schwarzenegger has a new
book um title of the book is be
useful and apparently that's that's his
his advice this his advice book it's
called be useful let me ask you where
have you heard that
before is there any other advice
book that had as a a key theme be
useful yeah it's like the main theme of
my book had failed almost everything and
still went
big and I thought to myself did his
ghost did his Ghost Writer just read my
book it's like the title of his book I'm
I'm
a as the comments from the people who'
have read my book are telling you it's
it's like a main theme of the book I've
never heard anybody say it before I did
because I've been asked in interviews
you know can you sort of summarize your
view of success and my view of how to be
successful is just those two words be
useful because your entire
value to a potential mate to an employer
to your friends to everybody is be
useful if you're trying to be loved
because of who you are bad
strategy you should be loved for what
you
do right just well maybe B you know it
might be different for women women can
actually be loved for who they are
men and children can be loved for who
they are men have to
perform you maybe he makes that
distinction but I don't know anyway that
was little
aside
um I had a little exchange with uh an
Israeli resident this
morning
and I don't know how do we even approach
this topic without getting cancelled but
let's see if I can couch it in other
people's opinions because it's not my
opinion would you agree with the
following statement that the uh radical
islamists will use whatever happens in
Gaza as a um
propaganda tool
forever
forever they will use it to recruit they
will use it to get World sympathy they
will use it to get money they'll use it
to get power what does that sound
like I'm I'm going to get canceled right
now I know I
am
all right here's what I'm not
doing the next things I
say are not comparing I'm not going to
do that there will be no
comparing there's no moral equivalence
nope I'm not going to make a moral
equivalence there's no
apologist I'm not being an apologist for
anything I'm going to tell you what
other people are going to do and think
this is this is not me I'm just
predicting what other people are going
to do and
think Israel is handing Hamas their own
holocost and they have no idea what is
going to cost them in the long
run now I want to be as clear as
possible there isn't really any
alternative to what they're
doing I can't think of one and they have
a complete right to
self-defense complete right
that is unquestioned and I can see
nothing else they can do except exactly
what they're doing if it if it were my
country 100% on board now I don't have
to take a moral or ethical stand about
something that is only going to happen
one way it would be like taking a moral
and ethical stand against the rain the
rain is just going to
rain it's just cause and effect I don't
take moral stands against cause and
effect when Hamas came into Israel and
did what they did they destroyed
Gaza but I think they probably knew it
and I think maybe the bigger plan is to
destroy
Gaza um kill their own people Marty them
Marty as many of their citizens as they
can to try to get something that would
be the equivalent of the Israeli
superpower which is the Holocaust
narrative
now I'm not comparing them this is not
me comparing them I'm telling you what
other people are going to compare
because if you're Palestinian it's going
to feel like a holocaust to you right
it's not a fair comparison but it's sure
going to feel like
one so I asked my smart friend from from
Israel you realize that you're you're
giving them their own Holocaust right
and he said that he hadn't talked to
anybody who had was had that Concept in
their
mind did you you could all see it right
is it a blind spot for the Israeli
citizens because they just know they
have to do what they have to do and you
know there's no way you could convince
them that anybody would see this like
the Holocaust but I feel like they might
be in a little bubble
there because I think outside of this
bubble um the islamists are going to
make a lot of hay with
that you think they get it I don't think
so I don't think so now let me close
this by saying I'm not comparing it to
the Holocaust I'm not being an apologist
for Hamas I want them all
destroyed um and uh I'm also not making
moral equivalence I'm not doing that I'm
just making sort of sort of a
military
observation so in
theory when Israel is
done if done is even a word here um with
whatever happens in Gaza it should make
their security situation much much
worse in the long run do you think
so am I wrong about that because it's an
interesting trap that Hamas set for
and the trap is that they have to do
what they have to do and I agree with it
completely but it's going to cost them
more than they can
imagine how can it get
worse how can it get worse have you seen
the crowds in Jordan trying to cross the
border to join the fight it can get
worse by bringing more people in who are
willing to run toward Tel Aviv shouting
death to
everybody the the the thing that get
worse is more people on the side of the
bad guys that's all I that's that's the
whole game
here well if you are spending any time
online you know that the uh situation in
the Middle East has turned into I hate
to say this and I don't mean this to
make light of it but if you look at the
news coming out of Gaza from the people
who are supporting
Gaza it's turned into a dead baby
contest they are literally competing to
see who can show the most horrific
images of actual dead
babies it literally became a dead baby
persuasion
contest man if there was ever a time to
take a time off from social
media it's the worst thing I've ever
seen by far would you agree I've never
seen anything even close to how bad this
is
and I'm talking about the way it's um
being reported and how social media is
handling it but the the images that I
wish I could never
see I can never unsee all right like my
brain is actually
scarred the initial stories about the
you know 40 beheaded babies which we're
still trying to figure out what is and
is not true but obviously it was a it
was a horror of you know unspeakable
magnitude no matter what the details
were but I even no matter how much of
that was exactly true and how much of it
was directionally true I have a whole
movie in my head of the thing that may
or may not have happened the way it was
described do you have the same problem I
mean I can't get that out of my head no
matter how exactly true or generally
true it
was so so I mean that just lives in
there and now I'm seeing the images
coming out of Gaza I'm never going to
forget them I spent just like a few
minutes just a few minutes and I I got
in the wrong place you know I hit a
hashtag I should have hit and
boom and
wow I don't think I'll ever be the same
honestly I think that I feel like I have
brain
damage actual physical brain damage from
looking at those pictures cuz I'm I I'm
not the same it turned me into something
else anyway
um what else is going
on here's a weird story that Israel
bombed the only Planned Parenthood
building in
Gaza now I'm no military expert but that
feels like opposite of their
objectives uh AOC had a tweet or a post
that somebody said she deleted that she
was blaming the um blaming Israel's
attack of Gaza as well not the attack
but the turning off the water and the
electricity and starving them as
collective punishment which would
technically be a war
crime oh before I talk about this I need
to
mention that I'm not going to be
comparing I'm not going to be your moral
equivalence I'm not an apologist okay
you have to say that every time you
talk um but is it what is the technical
answer to the question is it a war crime
to turn off facilities to the
public because you're after a small
subset of the
public now what would not make that a
Warcraft it is collective punishment
right
ask S russan yeah but maybe war is
always Collective punishment yeah
hoshima how how was hoshima not a
Warcraft because it was mostly mostly
citizens right 99% citizens how is that
not a war crive I guess I don't
understand what makes something a war
crive so somebody says that her post was
taken down it might be because she
learned it wasn't a war crime I just
don't know the line is maybe I'll do a
little research on where the line is
well today is the so-called day of
Rage which uh some media Outlets have
called the day of
protest do you think there will be uh
violence in the United States today
people who are supporting the
Palestinians or maybe even supporting
Hamas some say
yes well there'll be protests apparently
the White House is putting up uh Gates
and
security I wonder
why why why would you put up security
around the White House for this but you
didn't do much security for January 6
well that's a interesting question for
later
uh banino says it's fake the day of rage
and the real one will come later well I
think there might be lots of V ones
coming
later yeah you know the the advantage
that the United States has and it's a
big one is that we're
large so you you could introduce you
know a thousand people into Israel and
they could bring the country to its
knees uh if you introduced a thousand
people in the am in
America uh they would be spread out or
they'd be in one place where the
military area would just zap them so it
kind of the the geography doesn't work
so well but obviously there could be
unlimited Terror attacks yeah there
could be unlimited
911s there's nothing would stop that but
not it's not so much a bunch of people
running at you with guns yelling that's
not so much going to happen
here all
right take out one school or sporting
event yeah that's probably what they'll
do all right do you think anything will
happen uh in America because of this
situation I feel like I feel like
wokeness won't go away but it's taken
quite a blow and I also feel that the
anti-woke people are getting a lot
braver
is that my
imagination I mean the things that I'm
seeing being said in public are things
you couldn't say one year
ago would you agree things you could not
say in public one year ago people are
saying unreservedly in public yeah and
that's a big I think that's a step in
the right place might mostly be because
of the xplatform is the you know last
fashion of Free Speech
but I feel like something's
changing yeah feels like something's
changing yeah there's a French teacher
who got stabbed and somebody got stabbed
over there but I don't know that could
have been just a crazy
person yeah the stock market has been
weird hasn't
it let's check it right
now well it's uh it's
down looks like it's broadly down
except for makeup makeup is
up
Ulta all right um aren't all terrorists
crazy people
well I don't know if they started that
way but they might have they might have
been uh brainwashed into it I'm not sure
if brainwashed is the same as
crazy oh was it chachin okay
well here's
what here's what won't win you the
election in
2024 I'm going to take away your
rifles I don't think that wins the
election um I don't understand how Trump
isn't up compared to Biden by 20
points I it's really baffling that this
is looks like it'll be close it's just
really
baffling
well I would say this uh unreservedly
and without
hyperb um in 2024 you're going to be
voting for your
life in ways that I don't think has ever
been the case because if we don't get a
president who will close the
border we will be
dead I think that's a given and not
because of Hispanics coming over they
they're not really the
problem
they'll never let it
happen I don't think Trump is up more
than 20 I don't think that's
real yeah Trump is going to have to have
like an enormous organic lead on
Election Day or else nobody's going to
believe the result if he doesn't
win the most dangerous thing that could
happen in the country is Trump losing a
in a close race when the poll said it
wouldn't be
close and we might be heading for that
that would be really
bad um all right ladies and gentlemen
I'm going to close down the feed over
here for YouTube and Twitter thanks for
joining sorry about the technical
problem and I will see
you
tomorrow
