now I want to tell you that you don't
have to be a racist to use YouTube or
any of the other Google products but it
does help it does help um if you'd like
to take this experience up to levels
that even racists like Google can't
understand all you need is a copper a
marar a glass a tanker CH Ain a canteen
Jugger flask a vessel any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
yay join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopam of the day the
thing makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous Sip and happens
now
go oh that's good that's
good well let's see what's happening so
Netflix apparently has some new series
Texas Lindsay is posting about this and
and apparently it's it's a reality based
thing based on the allegation that there
are 8X CIA people who run the
world um I would recommend that you
watch that
[Laughter]
quickly before Netflix coincidentally
goes out of business or possibly there's
a terrible terrorist attack on their
data center uh because if any of this is
true they're all going to be killed and
it's called The Octopus
murders so I'm guessing after watching
enough Mike Ben's material about how the
how the country is really being
run uh this is really interesting now
the allegation is that that the octopus
which is all the tentacles of the you
know the shadowy people apparently they
can just murder anybody they
want you know I'm going to watch that
I'm all in on that
Netflix um I'd be well I'm just kind of
amazed that it even exists AR you kind
of surprised that that even exists and
got on got on to Netflix
anyway speaking that by coincidence if
you were a subscriber to the Dilbert
comic which is the only way you can
watch it now either on X you can
subscribe or you can get lots of my
political stuff plus the comic on the
locals Scott adams. locals.com but you'd
be watching watching today the CIA doing
a takeover of Dilbert's
company how long do you think it takes
the CIA to completely Dominate and take
over Dilbert's
company it goes like
this have you ever been to any sketchy
Islands now since Epstein
died here's a video of you in a blue
dress and we're done 10 seconds 10
seconds it took the CIA to take over
company while the robots are coming I
guess open AI is uh going to use a
company called Figure to make the robots
that their AI will go into so they're
calling it embodied
AI embodied
AI we don't need a new new name for
robots unless they're smart robots I
mean do we really call it have to call
them smart robots that's sort of like do
you remember years ago when they called
computers
multimedia
computers and you knew that would go
away because all computers are
multimedia you know eventually so it
seems to me since all robots are going
to be AI we don't need the word embodied
AI pretty soon maybe by the end of the
year that one will be gone and what do
you think is this the beginning of the
robots taking over are you worried that
there will be a real robots that are
doing their own thinking I'm going to
say
no going to say
no I I think that we will easily handle
that risk I'm not worried about the
robots um I I think you know we we know
how to make consumer
goods that you know get rid of most of
the risk I worry about AI That's in the
system you know some AI that gets loose
in the internet in general and it's
disembodied so I'm not worried about
embodied AI because I think we can stop
them by stopping the body we'll probably
have you know a kill switch on the
physical body but I do worry about AI
That's a virus
someday that seems like it'd be a
problem and I think there's some report
now that there is an AI virus that can
hop from one AI to
another that's pretty scary so I'd be
worried about
that uh the Pope has made a strong stand
against a gender ideology he calls it
Pope
Francis uh and I realized that if I had
not read that the pope's name is Francis
I don't think I would have remembered it
how many of you how many of you if you
were quizzed on the street would know
that the name of the pope is Francis
it's Pope Francis I'm just curious how
many of you would have known
that now is it because I'm just not
paying attention and all popes look like
the same guy to me oh a lot of you would
have known it okay I'm kind of impressed
I suppose if you're Catholic it's
easier um yeah but I didn't even know
his name it's weird is that because the
pope is that much less
important because I or or this one's
less of a superstar oh it's probably
because he's less of a superstar he's
not going around you know doing a lot of
fancy trips and stuff but anyway he says
that gender ideology is is the worst
danger of our time it makes everything
the same and I guess it gets rid of the
special what do you call the special
tension between the spe the Sexes that
is
productive well that's the Pope's point
of view do you think gender ideology is
the worst danger of our
time that that feels like a a bit of an
exaggeration really I would say Dei is
more
dangerous because because I think
there's natural limit on the gender
ideology stuff I think is mostly limited
to the mentally ill and you know some
very small percentage of people who have
something that's more legitimate you
know like they're born
different would you
agree I think gender ideology has a
natural
cap you there's a limit to how how
brainwashed you can get I don't think
you're going to brainwash the average
person and I and I think
um here here's another I don't know if
this is a good comparison but did you
know that the percentage of young women
who are vegetarians in college is like
super high did you all know that when
young women go to college that the
number this like a third like onethird
of them are vegetarians or something
it's real not high number but then as
soon as I get out you know it normalizes
with the rest of the population probably
the same with uh same seex
experimentation you know there's a lot
of stuff that happens when you're young
that you decide not to do
later anyway I I see his argument I
don't know it's the biggest problem I
feel like it's naturally limited but
we'll
see I think Dei is the bigger
problem um Glen Greenwald is talking
about uh something that could be called
Russia derangement syndrome but he
hasn't used that phrase that's my own
um you talk about a few current examples
so there's somebody on on the
xplatform uh says that Senator Schumer
should investigate speaker Johnson
because he's working with
Putin so now we're blaming the Speaker
of the House you know who's never had
any kind of suggestion of that kind of
impropriety suddenly he's working with
Putin because everything you don't like
is Putin and then
separately uh Pelos Pelosi recently
called on the FBI this is Greenwald
saying this to investigate prop
Palestinian protesters to see if they
have Kremlin
ties so now we think the pro Palestinian
people are maybe Russian inspired maybe
Johnson is being run by the Russians and
uh as Greenwell points out is a form of
mass Mental
Illness but is it do you think it's Mass
mental illness is sort of the same as
Trump derangement syndrome because this
feels a little different you know what
it feels
like it feels like more evidence that
humans are no different than Ai and that
what we think is our thinking is really
large language model
patterns if if you just dropped in you
know an unprogrammed person like a human
being you just dropped them into a 20 24
and you just say you know listen to how
people are talking you know try to form
some
opinions uh you would find that there's
such a a thick discussion that is
usually people know they're lying you
know that remember the
original um the original Russia cusion
thing the people who created it knew
they were lying I imagine a lot of the
people who spread it knew they were
lying so the large language model would
be trained on nothing but lies about
Russia would you agree if you trained a
large language model explain Russia to
us it would be trained on 100% lies
because that's all we ever hear about
Russia we never hear anything real about
Russia it's all lies or it's all you
know put in a context that's friendly to
the people telling the
story so how would people be different
everything that a human learns is is by
looking at what else is going on you
know they're looking at the total
Society what people say and it's exactly
the same as AI so I'm not sure this is a
form of uh Mass hysteria the way Trump
derangement syndrome definitely is this
feels different it feels that there are
so many lies on the topic that it has
become essentially embedded in our
intelligence that the first thing you
suspect is Russia is just on the top of
your mind so I think it's really a top
of Mind
problem uh and the fact that there's so
much repetition of these similar kinds
of lies that I don't know if it's it
doesn't look like mental illness to me
like Trump derangement syndrome
literally is mental
illness literally it's a mass hysteria
this doesn't look like it the Russia
stuff looks like some combination of
pattern and lying and you know something
a little more ordinary but terrible
terrible
it's a problem but more
ordinary it
feels well here's something that's not
ordinary and uh apparently I became a
semi viral uh clip because I doubted
that this could possibly be real and I
still
do because I can't wrap my head around
it I just can't wrap my head around this
could be
real uh that Canada so end wokeness is
uh on and uh the xplatform says this
says Canada is trying to pass a new law
though crack down on hate on the
internet and other telecommunications
and the bill would allow judges to
sentence a person
to life in
prison for advocating um genocide in
words so if you went on Twitter and said
uh everybody in some category should be
killed
you would go to jail for
life for your
opinion now I think you're very bad
person if you think everyone should be
killed but let's let's game this out a
little
bit so let's say that uh you say that
the situation in Gaza is a
genocide now I'm not going to agree or
disagree I'll say for example that um
erduan from Turkey says it's approaching
a genocide or is it is a genocide and a
lot of commentators are calling it a
genocide again not my opinion I'm not
giving you any opinion on that I'm just
describing it so suppose we get to the
point
where uh it's a common
opinion that what's happening in Gaza
let's say it's a common opinion in
Canada hypothetically that whatever is
happening at some point starts to look
like a
genocide and people start using that
word and then what happens let's game it
a little bit
further if somebody goes on and says you
know what goes on social media and says
I think what uh the Israeli military is
doing is exactly right because in my
opinion let's say it saves more lives
later or there was nothing else you
could do whatever whatever the opinion
is again not my opinion I'm giving you
some
examples would you be very close at that
point
to have advocated
genocide because other people including
the head of turkey have said this
thing's a genocide and then you just
said you're in favor of
it you don't have to use the word
genocide apparently you just have to be
in favor of it on social
media now did I just describe a case
where everybody who said a pro-israeli
thing could be sentenced to life in
prison I think
so that is that too much of a stretch if
if it is commonly understood to be a
genocide I'm not saying it is I'm saying
if Canada you know decides government
wise it's totally a genocide and then I
say Israel is doing the right
thing do I go to jail for
life because I accidentally was in favor
of a genocide according to somebody
else's definition of that word
well this is the worst looking thing
I've ever seen in my life now let's take
me um if you follow the news you know
that the news said that I said something
terribly hateful about Black
Americans that's the way the news
reported it what's the
truth what I said was uh oh based on
this uh professional survey a very large
percentage of black Americans seem to
have a bad opinion about me for being
white now that's either true or not and
so I said if if it's true you should
stay away from people who have a bad
opinion of you do I go to jail in Canada
for saying that they you should stay
away from people who are trained by Dei
and CRT and esj actually trained by the
government officially trained by the
government to see me as the problem and
that I have their money and need to give
it back reparations
Etc now you should stay away from that
situation you should run away from it if
you can I don't know how you could
really it's hard to get away you'd have
to cease that or something but has
nothing to do with any quality of black
Americans it's not about genetics or
culture is literally about white people
brainwashing a segment of the population
to hate me because if it weren't for the
white people there wouldn't be any ESG
and CRT and Dei it would be this
marginal little idea that people ignored
it's white people I was complaining
about did anybody understand that by the
way I don't know I don't think I've ever
said as clearly as I'm saying it now
there would be no
problem if white people weren't the main
cause so I think people took it as an
attack on Black America because that's
sort of the bad wording I used I said
stay away but not stay away because I
don't like like them I love black
people I I've had only positive
experiences in person only in person
100% positive experience I like I like
anybody who's got an interesting story I
like anybody who's nice to me I like
anybody who's got a sense of humor and
that usually covers most people right
most people are nice to you if you're
nice to them so I love black people but
if the government is going to weaponize
them against me and why say the
government I'm not talking about black
people in the government I'm talking
about mostly white people promoting it
and letting it happen so my problem is
specifically with my
people my complaint is my people the
problem that my people are causing is a
rift between me and black Americans that
I would very much like to enjoy you know
a full relationship with but it's very
hard when when my people are teaching
black americ Americans that I'm the
problem how am I supposed to navigate
that so I say I'll stay away from it
because I don't know how to navigate a
situation where my people are telling
some other group they should hate me
what do I do about that you should get
away try try to find some way not to be
in that situation whatever it
takes now according to
me I've said nothing that is hate speech
only good advice
that basically anybody would agree with
if you explained it the way I just
explained it literally nobody would
disagree nobody but if I traveled to
Canada or became a Canadian citizen
let's say I'm a just a
visitor could I go to
jail how do that
work I mean it's a it's a law in Canada
I don't have to be a Canadian citizen do
I what if I just simply I'm in Toronto
and I I send down a post from to
Toronto do I go to
jail yeah the fact that I don't know the
answer to that question at the same time
we're watching Russia I'm sorry I I
called it uh I called Canada Russia
because so
similar um watching them go after Jordan
Peterson for his free speech trying to
take away his
license I would never travel to Canada
for tourism Canada is actually
completely off my list as of today you
know before that I would have said H
they're not going to bother me I'm just
a tourist you know I I feel sorry for
the citizens but if I just want to visit
that's no problem but at the
moment if this were to pass I would
never go to Canada I would feel that
that would be literally a risk of jail
and it would be high risk it wouldn't be
a low risk it looks like it would be a
pretty high risk because you know if
you're a political person you know the
the uh The Feelers
around so Canada you just uh destroyed
your tourism for people like
me uh Elon mus says that grock the AI
he's created for the
xplatform uh will soon be able to
summarize complicated legislation so you
know what's in
it how much do you love
that you might actually understand what
you're uh and and it's funny that
AI we would have to use AI to untangle
the confusopoly that our government
intentionally creates it's all
intentional so that we don't understand
what they're doing we actually have a
government that's a confusopoly
meaning that we can't really participate
because they're lying to us about
everything we don't even know what we're
talking about most of the time we don't
have real facts uh you know what they
tell us is too confusing to understand
all the laware against Trump is so
confusing now if you're not actually a
lawyer it's really hard to follow 91
indictments four cases several venues
different schedules yeah so what if
grock could summarize the
bills do you think he
can do you think
grock uh at any time in the future with
any amount of Correction and tweaking
could summarize
legislation I'm going to say no I'm GNA
say it's going to
fail do you know
why it's going to fail because AI is
trained on humans and humans can't do
this do do you get that
yet in other words uh if if a human
looked at one of these bills and let's
say we were smart enough and AI is smart
enough to know what all the parts are so
so we could at least you know sort out
what it's doing what would you do that
what once you understood it what would
you do suppose you had to describe
it as soon as you go to describe it
which is the useful part like here this
does this or this does that it's a
narrative
so AI can't do narratives or if it did
it shouldn't because the narrative is
the brainwashing the propaganda the
framing we don't want it to do
that but it can't not do that it doesn't
have the
option so you're either going to have
one that's biased by its creators in one
way or biased by its creators in another
way suppose the bill said something like
um like Biden is saying
so Biden is saying the Republicans are
to blame because they didn't approve the
Border bill that would give funding they
would be uh very useful to reducing the
illegal flow so what would grock say
about
that that's a narrative not a simple
description would grock say uh they're
asking for some money for the border and
just just leave it at
that because you wouldn't know if that's
good or bad right suppose it said it's
money for the border that definitely
will make it easier to stop
illegals is that
accurate because I thought they do a
clever thing where they say everybody's
legal you see where I'm going with this
we play this game where we call the
illegal migrants legal because we just
make him go through a certain doorway
doorway where if you say can you say the
word Asylum uh Asylum good enough you're
legal now you see what I mean so we turn
them from illegal to Legal simply by
saying you're legal now that's all
that's all we do now would grock pick
that up would it know that the purpose
of the bill the funding to increase
border uh funding would they know that
the secret real reason for that is not
to
decrease any anybody it's basically just
to bring them in under the legal
umbrella but it's all the
same whether they came in and gave their
name or not it's all the same so do you
think grock could ever learn to sus out
what is the
trick and and what is the real
implication I say no because the only
access it would have would be um Nar
narratives that we've created so the
best they could do is say here's what it
says I've simplified it here's what the
Democrats tend to say about it here's
what the Republicans tend to say about
it but it's not going to go further than
that and you know that's all that we
have on TV right now if you put if I
turn on the TV and say hey tell me about
this border Bill I'm going to hear
Republicans say this Democrats say that
and I don't know what's true I just know
what they say so I think the problem is
that we
imagine that AI is intelligent in some
independent way it's not it's just
reflection of us and we imagine that it
can solve a problem that is sort of data
factual when that was never the problem
the problem is not just
understanding the details of what it
says it's all the narrative
interpretation you know who who's in on
this who gets helped by it who gets
elected because of it that's all the
real stuff that's the stuff you got to
understand and grock's not going to get
you
there all
right um Tucker Carlson is saying that
the Biden Administration helped install
a pro-chinese government in
Brazil uh which immediately shut down
opposition media and began arresting
dissidence they talked to two of its
victims all right right every part of
the
statement makes your eyes go what wait a
minute the Biden Administration
installed the government in
Brazil we installed the government of
Brazil of course we did because we
install all the governments in in our
Hemisphere and and if we don't the CIA
has to get fired because that's their
job yeah the job of the CIA is to make
sure that our
hemisphere is kind of on our on on our
team and everybody knows it
right so I guess you know nobody should
be surprised at that but it's just funny
to see it in writing you know you're not
supposed to write it down you're just
supposed to sort of know it um but was
it a pro-chinese
government I don't I don't know about
that um I suppose that would be an
opinion but I would like to add that uh
why do we think that our government is
better than that
you know the the way it's framed is oh
you know too bad they don't have our
freedoms
Here Am I Wrong that we don't have
anything like a free
press we don't have freedom of speech
not even close we we have an America the
freedom to say things that don't bother
people who
matter we have the freedom to say things
that don't bother the people who matter
if it bothers them you will get
cancelled
and you just won't be able to talk to
anybody anymore because it bothered the
wrong people we don't have any freedom
of speech
here not even a little bit we have only
the freedom not to bother important
people which is exactly like having no
Freedom so we have uh fake news uh here
that uh I mean basically we the most of
the press is controlled by the CIA it
looks like at least for the you know GE
political stories and so we have the
freedom to be part of a fake news entity
and we have the freedom to listen to
fake news and on social media we know
that we're being suppressed if the
government doesn't like us so in my case
um I I'd love to know if Elon Musk can
even answer the question of why I'm in
such a silo that not even no Democrat
ever sees my material now on social
media I have over million followers and
I don't think anybody who's a Democrat
ever sees my material we're so little
it's trivial so what is my point of even
talking I I have no persuasive
capabilities because I don't cross over
to anybody who disagrees with me I end
up talking to people who largely agree
with me and maybe we'll learn something
or a better way to say it but yeah is is
there anybody here who's a Democrat that
is here because they want to hear a
different point of
view anybody even one
person I'm just looking at see if
there's anybody
here oh we have an ex
Democrat that's as close as we can get
yeah no so we have fake freedom of
speech because you can't get your speech
to anybody who disagrees with you and
talking to people who agree with you is
like pretty close to not even
close to free
speech
uh what other fake freedoms we have well
uh let's see Katherine herriage the
reporter was far from
CBS and she was one of the people uh who
reported on the hunter laptop story
Etc and so she might be too much of a
truth tell teller people are suspecting
and now there's a judge that's uh
holding in holding her in civil contempt
for refusing to divulge her sources does
that sound like uh freedom of the
press freedom of the press does it sound
like uh the courts are doing their job
just objectively doing their job well
let's find out a little bit more about
this
court let's see
uh uh the the judge
uh Chuck Ross um who's at Chuck Ross DC
on the xplatform he says the same judge
in Obama
appointee uh so the the judge who's
holding Katherine harage and civil
condemn same judge an Obama appointe
blocked special counsel John Durham from
mentoring evidence against Clinton
lawyer Michael susman that would have
detailed their plot to leak false Trump
Russia info into the media huh okay well
you know it's a small town you know
everybody's an important lawyer or an
important judge they probably had
contact with other important cases so I
mean by itself that's not too alarming
is it that's not too alarming so why
would we be worried about this judge
being some kind of like bias
judge oh also from Chuck Ross the judge
his name is Chris Roper he's married to
a Democrat lawyer Amy Jeff who
represented Lisa
Page do you remember Lisa
Page from the Russia collusion
situation yeah str's
girlfriend
um so now let me ask you this when was
the last time you could not predict the
outcome of a trial based on the
political leaning of the
judge I don't remember a time I'll say
it again when it was the last time you
didn't know the result of the trial just
by knowing who appointed the judge
it's pretty much every time you know
right for the political stuff you know
not not so much for the just ordinary
crimes but why do we have why do we have
a court if we always know how how it's
going to go based on who took took the
case as the
judge that's not even that that's
nothing like
Freedom that's not even in the general
neighborhood of any kind of a justice
system that's like real that's not a
real
system it I don't know what it is but
it's not any kind of real justice
system all right
um did you see the story about James
o'keef he went uh in Disguise again this
time he joined a gym Equinox Gym and he
found out the gym where a judge andoran
uh goes to the
gym
and and his disguise is he puts on a a
Tim poool
beanie and it works
again James O'Keefe Master of
[Laughter]
Disguise I'd like to give you now uh my
impression of James o'keef going
undercover here I am James o'keef you
probably recognize me but watch
this not James
o'keef you'd never you'd never recognize
me
now I swear to God he can go undercover
just by getting a
haircut he could he could put like a an
earring in his ear and go undercover
nobody recognize
it and I don't know it just gets funnier
and funnier every time he goes
undercover there's something about it
just gets funnier but here but here's
the Scoopy came away with the Scoopy
came away with is that the the judge is
kind of scrawny for a guy who goes to
the gym every
day he's got a little noodle arms you
know he's a certain age so I mean it's
fine uh but uh but then but then the
other part of the story is that somebody
else in the gym says that the judge is
uh is always creeping on the women and
there's this grainy video with no audio
I think where where the woman seems to
go like this like put her hand out like
she's you know telling him to go
away I suspect that's not what she was
saying probably was just a hand gesture
for whatever she was talking about but
he didn't go away so maybe it was so
maybe maybe he was creeping on her in
the gy I just love that
story I don't know it's just silly the
the whole thing the
the the
disguise the scoop I love every part of
that all right so of course Biden and
Trump visited the border at about the
same time in different places Biden went
where there wasn't much problem and
Trump went where there was a big problem
now I saw a video
yesterday and I need to a fact check
because I I don't know if it's real
because if it were real it would be all
over the news but it isn't is it true
that Trump waved to the uh illegals who
were on the other side of the fence
because they were chanting Trump Trump
trump is that
true oh my
god do you know that Trump could stop
immigration uh just by standing there
Trump could stand there with uh voter
registration forms for the Republican
party just just stand at you know
wherever the legal people are coming
through legally by claiming Asylum and
after they've been processed and they're
you they're basically freed into America
you just have Trump literally Trump like
actually Trump just stand there and hand
out uh
Republican uh
ballots and then you'd want in different
languages you'd want to say you know
what's the basic idea of a
Republican and what's the basic idea of
a Democrat now since it's the political
season you get to exaggerate she say all
right come on in you can sign up for a
democ to be a Democrat or
Republican and on on each of these
forums there's a brief summary of what
that
means you see where I'm going to
this every one of those people are
Republicans they just don't know it yet
it wouldn't take much so on the Democrat
form would be you'd be on the team where
your teacher can change the gender of
your child without asking
you we don't think religion is
important not so sure about
God uh we don't think you you know
should have this free free speech or
whatever and then in the Republican one
you'd be like strong religious Faith but
freedom freedom of religion is important
so you could have your own it's just you
know we like God you could have your God
just we like we're we're really big on
God uh we we oppose
abortion and the the Democrats uh would
like the right to kill you uh if you've
only recently been
born or something like that I mean
that's an exaggeration obviously uh but
I think you come up with something
that's close enough to being true that
characterizes both teams in a very
simple
way that a migrant would come over and
say okay well I like all of that stuff
and this stuff is exactly what I don't
want and then you say sign up for either
one and you would probably get I don't
know five to one picking the
Republican and they would just register
as Republicans without knowing too much
about the
system and it would scare the crap and
the
Democrats because I think that the the
uh maybe the ultimate third act for
Trump would be turning the migrants
Republican now let me ask you
this do you remember in
2015 I
boldly told the world that Trump would
be the most persuasive
person we've ever
seen and people laughed
haa he's a big old clown he's not
persuading anybody he's just getting a
lot of attention and I said no attention
is the first step the most important one
of persuasion so you just validated that
he did the best thing anybody's ever
done for persuasion which is you can't
take your mind off of him now watch what
he what he does few years later he's
convinced a majority of the country that
the election was
rigged look at the things that people
believe now that are now completely
compatible with Trump by majority not
everybody but he is the most persuasive
individual in all of American history
and nobody's even
close now suppose I told you in
2024 based on my spectacular Trump
prediction track record that he maybe he
alone could make three and a four
migrants
Republicans and nobody else could do
it think about
it all he'd have to do is try he would
just have to
try because you know that chanting Trump
Trump trump if you I'm pretty
sure that migrants especially
male have you noticed that Trump Appeals
to men more than
women so you've got just you know reams
of men over there who are you know I
would say personality and character-
wise maybe not that far from Trump and
they're coming to America because they
want part of that American
Dream they don't just like
him they want to be him let me say that
again I think you would find with just
just a little bit of scratching on the
surface that just right underneath the
surface you're going to find that
men who can pick up and leave their
country to make a new life primarily on
economic terms by
working they don't just like
Trump they want to be
Trump and I don't think the Democrats
see this coming which is hilarious to me
now I'm not saying Trump is likely did
you know make a case for it cuz it's you
know it might be might look like a
problem because he's also saying we
should stop them and send them
back but if he did try to convert him he
might find a lot of people in the
Democrat Party who are very Pro wall all
of a
sudden you know what would be
interesting he doesn't have to convert
them
all oh my
God he only has has one meeting with a
group of
them oh my
God he Trump just has to walk into a
room with 50 recent migrants that came
in Legally through the Asylum
system and just talk to them with
translators what would that do do you do
you think that they would be
impressed of course they would do you
think they would respond to his
personality and charisma
I've been in the room with
him
yes he he has more Charisma than you've
ever seen in your life when you stand in
the room with him it's just you know
like you're bathed in it basically
yes watching a short video of him
converting an entire room of migrants
into Republicans would be such a
GameChanger and you'd only have to do it
once with one room and it would become
it would just be Legend after
that now I suppose if it didn't work out
you know it let's say it's a you know
put together by Republicans if it didn't
work out I suppose you could get rid of
all the
video say well we
tried I think it would work though um so
there's lots of contrast about the
Border visit uh Biden could barely walk
and people are chanting for Trump and
all the border patrol people seem to
love him and yeah big difference
um Trump said
[Laughter]
something that is so perfectly
trumpan that I don't know I can't stop
laughing at it I'm just GNA read it to
you he actually said it a speech at the
border uh they're they're getting people
who don't speak
languages he said we have languages
coming into our country and nobody
speaks those languages
they're truly foreign languages nobody
speaks
them nobody speaks
of now obviously obviously what he means
is that there are very few Americans who
would you know speak some languages
besides Spanish I guess
but just the way he says everything is
so freaking funny because he it's so
provocative that he would go all the way
to nobody speaks those
languages all right so I wanted to
compare I thought it'd be funny to
compare the way Biden lies to the way
Trump
lies and I like to point out a dog not
barking you know the Sherlock Holmes
thing the there's a dog that's not
barking really really loudly and you
going to laugh you going to laugh when I
tell you what the dog
is when's the last time you saw a fact
Checker think about it when's the last
time you saw a fact Checker remember
they used to get a lot of attention
didn't they checking all those Trump
lies let me tell you some of the
terrible lies that Trump has told you
ready here's two of the big ones ones uh
the migrants coming in they don't speak
any language that anybody's ever heard
here's another one this is terrible uh
if the wind stops blowing your TV will
go
off if the wind stops blowing your TV
will go
off ah now let's compare that to things
Biden has said
lately he literally ran his campaign on
the fine people
hoax let's get a fact check in here hey
Daniel
Dale uh is the fine people hoax a real
thing of course not of course not uh
almost everything that that
uh that Biden says is an obvious lie
like just easily verifiably obvious lie
uh Biden went on The Late Night show and
said uh that Trump forgot the name of
his wife quite observably not
true where's the fact
Checker fact checker on
vacation now before I mentioned it how
many of you had noticed that there were
no fact Checkers they' all disappeared
when before it was like every single day
there' be like here's 25 new lies that
Trump told just as disappeared have you
noticed that Trump is not
saying things that just invite the
factchecking that
way he's running a very different
campaign yeah part of it is that the you
know the less he is provocative the more
he's going to win because basically he's
on a Glide path he can only take himself
off the Glide path right he can't put
himself on it he's already there but he
can take himself off so
uh watching Trump run what I would
consider a very disciplined campaign
would you
agree I would say that his campaigning
is super disciplined not like anything
we've seen before um I think it's only
speculative to think that
V's um let's say his influence is having
this much of an impact but I you know
remember I told you that Trump is not
who you think you is the let's see the
caricature
part you know he's often portrayed as
having a fragile ego and and all that
stuff and therefore you would think oh
he wouldn't want a strong personality
somebody is as powerful mentally
especially as as aake because you know
he might feel threatened by it or
something totally bad reading of the
man he likes smart people and he likes
their advice and he seeks it so if you
put somebody as smart as a vake you know
anywhere in the inner advisory Circle
he's going to soon dominate the advisers
because he's marter and Trump will soon
learn that the things he say you should
pay attention to them and that is a sign
of strength not
weakness right and that is one of I
think that's one of Trump's great
strengths he can take advice and he
asked for it when he was president a lot
this is this is a not so reported as it
should be when Trump was President he
often would query smart people just to
get more opinions it was a common thing
he did and not just political people
commentators as well so uh do you
remember when he was asking for
executive orders does anybody have any
good ideas for executive orders during
the pandemic well the call went out you
know sort of below the the range of the
media and individuals were kind
contacting other individuals just
because they were smart or just because
they might have some domain of
knowledge
so uh that's when I suggested through
the
system you know a series of
connections um that you do an EO
allowing um doctors and telea health to
work across borders during the pandemic
and he immediately signed an EO now did
he ever say hey I should have thought of
that myself I can't do that because
that's a good idea that came from
somebody else no he just said good idea
signed it all right that's that's the
confidence he has and if if you imagine
he doesn't have that confidence you're
missing the best part of the story he
does have that confidence the confidence
to listen to another
opinion all right um so let's watch the
fact Checkers that's pretty
funny uh speaking of facts Biden is
crowing that the crime rate is dropping
even the violent crime rate it's all
dropping dropping so I guess he wants to
take credit for that does anybody
believe that the crime R is
dropping I do believe that the violent
crime rate probably dropped since the
peak in the pandemic that seems
reasonable yeah but beyond that I don't
know
now um let's combine two stories Story
number one the American Americans are
not um replacing
young people so we'll talk about that
some more so we know America is not
having enough
babies at the same time we're not having
enough babies and that's going on for
some time now uh the violent crime rate
is
dropping that's the same
story if you have fewer babies the
violent crime rate goes down does
everybody know
that violent crime is mostly correlated
with how many babies you
have because young people are the
murderers senior citizens aren't killing
a lot of people so as soon as your mix
of population goes from a ton of young
people to bias toward old people every
single day along that uh path should be
a lower rate of crime if you did nothing
you if you did nothing your crime rate
would drop every day the violent crime
would drop every day just because of the
Aging population did Biden mention
that did Biden say crime is going down
because um population's getting older no
no because that wouldn't work for him
did he say that there was something that
he
did that made the crime rate go down I
don't
recall did anybody does anybody recall
that he said he did something I don't
I'm not aware of anything he did on
crime are you now we do you know that
locally you know the Soros funded
prosecutors
Etc are just releasing a lot of people
without charges or or greatly reducing
the charges now I have a fact check I
need does the criminal data registered
as a crime if you know the crime
happened but there's nobody to
arrest it's not just a crime if you
arrest somebody right it's a crime if
it's reported as a crime
so I think I saw some some Fox News
commentary where they were speculating
that maybe if you free somebody who's a
suspect it doesn't get counted as a
crime but I think the crime is still
counted as the crime is if it gets
reported now I would think there's less
reporting of
crime because there's probably a lot of
stuff that you just don't think it's
going to happen again so let's say
you're walking down the street past some
Dangerous Drug down person and they do
something that would be considered
assault you know in other words they
threaten to kill you or something and
you say to yourself well I could spend
forever uh yeah I could spend forever
going after this street person who
assaulted me basically a
threat threat of violence uh or I could
just keep
walking what would you do I wouldn't
report it because I don't want to be
involved with this some stre person
who's crazy on drugs but it doesn't mean
the crime didn't happen now as as you're
saying in the comments and I was going
to get there um I don't know if the
stores are reporting the crimes if they
know nothing's going to happen about it
but here's my bigger
question 50 people run into a Target
store and they clean out the whole
store and it's so bad that the Target
store just closes because they can't
have it happen again
how many crimes is
that
one is that one
crime or would you count uh every every
item that they took is a separate
crime I'm just going to guess they don't
count it as a thousand crimes if there
are a thousand people things that leave
the store I'm pretty sure that's
one am I wrong that's one I think I mean
I don't know but I'll take a fact check
on that but I think it's one crime if
somebody knocks over a jewelry store and
takes everything in the
store it's one
crime so these are crimes that are
destroying cities and Biden's up there
like crime is down well it was only that
one crime at Target this week took
everything took
everything um but I saw this reported on
NBC it's the only place I saw it
reported in the news uh I saw the news
report that Biden said it and it's
probably another news I'm sure it is but
where I saw it was
NBC it's the only place I saw
it did I ever tell you too many times
that if the only thing you know is what
is reported you don't know anything you
have to know who's involved and then you
know everything and C is famously
considered the uh basically a Democrat
tool CIA tool and not really a real news
organization so it's not really a
surprise the
NBC would be the one reporting this as
if it were true and there's not much to
talk about because I'm pretty sure it's
just bad
data right why would people be moving
out of cities if they didn't observe the
crime being bad do you think people are
moving out as San
Francisco because they were fooled into
thinking the data is worse than it
is nobody nobody moves because of some
data they move because they got
mugged they move because they were
attacked on the street they move because
someone they know personally just got
raped that's why you move you don't move
because the crime data looked one way or
the
other so as I often tell you if the data
disagrees with your observation that's a
big red flag and that's what's happening
in
there all right let's see
uh
um Supreme Court as you know is hearing
the immunity question about U Trump so
the question is can a president who's in
office be charged after being out of
office for things that were done in the
course of um in the course of the job
now whoopy Goldberg had this take she
said let's look at a scenario where the
Supreme Court says he is immune from
everything because because he was
President you know what Joe Biden could
do since he is presently president he
could throw every Republican in
jail
H well you know on one hand it's a
ridiculous
argument but on the other hand it
actually forwards the conversation a
little bit it actually
does because there's definitely a
problem of figuring out what is too
far or or let's put it this way what is
his um what is he doing within the
course of His official
job now if he simply rounded up
Republicans because he wants to win I
would say you could immediately re
remove him from from office and arrest
him because that's not the course of his
job as a
president am I
wrong that if he did a crime that
clearly had nothing to do with his
presidential
duties they he' still be arrested in
other words if he just goes and murder
somebody in the White
House you don't get to get away with
that because you're president did does
anybody think that am I
wrong it's only it's only if you did
let's say you did something like um
something in the name of National
Security uh let's say you issued an
executive
order and it it got implemented but then
later a court found out that it was
illegal could he be prosecuted after you
get out of office because you you know
you did something in the course of your
duties but it was actually literally
illegal but it was in the course of your
duties now I wouldn't want to see that
be prosecuted
the trouble is we know that Democrats
specifically and I'm sure Republicans do
can take any situation and bend it into
any scenario or narrative they
want so could a Democrat come up with a
situation where they're just doing the
work of the president by rounding up all
Republicans and putting them in jail and
the answer is yes yes whoopy you
actually have a good point there I hate
to say it it's not a bad point
how hard would it be for republ for the
Democrats to say I know it looks bad but
the president is in charge of making
sure the country does not overthrown in
a coup and it's now obvious that all the
Republican leaders are involved in a
coup so it's the president's job to
enforce the laws and protect the country
and so of course putting all the
Republicans in jail is perfectly legal
within our framework and even if you
thought it was illegal later
still in the course of his job so that
should be fine
right there there is a little bit of a
risk here and I think that Whoopi is
actually correct that if you can Define
things you know within a wide range as
we often
do you might create a a loophole here
that you didn't
expect now here's why I think that we
currently um don't have to worry about
it you know it hasn't been a problem in
the past
right we haven't had a big problem with
this issue in Prior presidencies and I
think it's because we all know what is
too far and if the Democrats try to
round up the Republicans under the story
that they're doing the right thing I
think the citizens would just know it
was too far they just wouldn't get away
with it January 6 is too far but also
will be corrected by history it will be
corrected the the correcting forces are
coming I think meaning that they will be
pardoned and the history will report it
was one of the worst uh abuses of
citizens by its government I think in
the long run it will look better than it
looks now but it's pretty terrible
now um so what I'm wondering is is Joe
Biden going to pack the Supreme Court
with the cast of The View
because it wouldn't be any dumber than
anything else that's
happening but I don't believe that the
cast of The you are where you should get
your legal
advice or or for me that's for
sure um but I'll be real interested to
see how this goes in my opinion Trump
easily could say that the things he was
doing were within His official duties on
the uh the Box gate stuff even though he
kept the documents after he was in
office so theoretically they could say
that part's a
crime I think the fact that he took took
the took the stuff while he was in
office is close enough to a de facto um
declassification that I would be
satisfied with that and I would be
satisfied if the same were true of Biden
right if the if the decision to take it
happened while you were
president I call that good I I'd be
satisfied and I and again if Biden did
the same thing I'd say the same thing
all right if you declass ified it even
even without saying the words just the
fact that you took it home I I very much
agree with the fact that if you took it
out of the White House you've
Declassified it you by obvious
intention I'd be good enough on that and
then on the question of the January
6 um I do think it was the President's
duty to make sure that there had not
been a coup
because remember Trump suspected a coup
he thought he won he thought it was
obvious and he thought maybe there's
some way to correct it if we just wait a
day to you know check a little more
carefully that's about as close as you
can get to exactly his job making sure
an election didn't get rigged so I think
the Supreme Court has fairly easy path
on this one but
again let us see if we can predict how
this will go um I know nothing about the
law I know nothing about the Supreme
Court I don't know enough about these
individual cases but I know Trump is a
republican I know the majority of the
Supreme Court are
conservatives uh uh how will I ever
predict which way this could go of I
assume that they it'll go exactly the
way you
think I think now if I'm
wrong oh my
God right if I'm wrong on this
one then the Supreme Court doesn't care
about the United
States because part of what the Supreme
Court does I'm I'm sure they don't admit
it out loud but I think one of the
things the Supreme Court probably all of
the members really really feel strongly
is that even more important than getting
the law exactly right is holding the
country together now you say but scottt
that's not their job their job is just
to get the law right very
specific and you're right technically
that is all they should do but in my
opinion um great respon sort of the
Spider-Man problem great
responsibility great power they have to
come together so with the great power of
the Supreme Court I do think they have a
responsibility that is larger than their
job
description and while I would respect an
argument that says no no you should
never act that way I get it I respect
the argument but I'm quite okay with
people seeing their responsibility is
bigger than their job description if if
they have good intentions about it and I
I think the Supreme Court
does so I think they'll save us we'll
see we shall
see uh apparently Biden has decided to
run on his
accomplishments okay um here's a
question here so here's another way to
know that we don't have a like a real
press in this
country there's some questions that you
say to yourself well I understand why
the Democrat press doesn't answer ask
those questions but why doesn't the why
doesn't the conservative press ask the
question here's the question Biden's
going to say the economy is great
therefore you know we care about the
economy therefore re-elect them here's a
question I've never seen
asked what are the things you did that
made the economy
improve because if you just did nothing
economies generally approve in our
country you could almost do nothing just
stay away from them and they kind of
recover free market so could you please
tell us what you
did that caused the
outcomes because one of the things we
know you did is run up the
debt how did that how did that help us
well maybe it Juiced the Juiced the
markets but doesn't it come back to kill
us later can you explain how how that
works can you explain how your increased
fuel costs help the economy can you uh
can you explain how destroying uh the
culture of the United States and all
companies with
Dei how did that how did that help the
profits can you tell us how the infl
helped the stock
market I
can everybody raised their prices and
that made the price of stocks go up it's
just
inflation explain what you did that
wasn't just
inflation um how about the uh all the
abusive regulations that you got rid of
did he get rid of any
regulations where did he add
them how about um how about that
infrastructure
bill can we trace the benefits of the
infrastructure Bill and what percentage
has been spent is that why the econom is
good because he did they kind of stop
saying infrastructure Bill there for a
while for a while they were saying oh
big accomplishment but I think everybody
stopped saying it why' they do that is
it because it didn't translate into
anything important
or it takes too long I don't know how
about the war in Ukraine was that so
good for our
economy was that good well maybe because
some of the money's coming back to our
uh our own
industry so I'd like to see somebody
just asked the question you've made a
claim that the economy is good and you
should get some credit for it please
tell us what you did that made a
difference now if this were
Trump here's what the story would be I
red I reduced regulations oh okay I can
understand how that would be good for
things
um I uh I increased the pumping of uh
you know oil and uh other energy things
so I increased I decreased the cost of
fuel which helps every industry oh I get
that okay I understand that um how about
I uh you know kept our military strong
but I kept us out of Wars because Wars
really bad for economies you know even
if it gooses it in the short run they're
bad for economies uh that would be a
good argument that'd be a good
argum so I think that uh and then Trump
could say I cut taxes Etc he'd still
have problems explaining the debt but he
would have a story where the thing he
did seemed to be quite directly
connected to to some economic Advantage
tariffs maybe you know tariffs are
nobody really understands them all
right so Mark
Elias a Democrat lawyer as Molly
Hemingway is reporting uh she says he
ran the Russia collusion hoax in
2016 and he was ahead of the efforts to
change just hundreds of election laws in
2020 which allowed the election to be
rigged
uh what's the comment of the he raised
dementia
awareness yeah I guess he did that um
anyway so Mark Elias uh you could say he
rigged the election but
legally nobody's nobody suggests you
broke any laws but by legally changing
the laws so there's more mail-in ballots
it guaranteed the Democrats would
win and and now as Molly Hemingway says
he's bragging about his efforts to get
noncitizens registered to
vote yeah it's it's exactly it's exactly
what it looks like I do caution you
again that if you think the only reason
the bord is open is is Democrats are
trying to get more
voters I don't think so I definitely
think there's something else going on uh
but that they're also taking advantage
of trying to register to them to vote so
I think the extra voters is more like
the side benefit of something else but I
don't know what it
is uh MSNBC had some authors on they've
got a book that says that rural white
voters are the most dangerous threat to
America uh and that it talks about all
their dangerous beliefs and their super
racist and they're all brainwashed and
they believe wrong things and all that
yeah oh my God it was written by two
white guys two white guys wrote that
their own people except the rural ones
are the most dangerous threat to the
country well here's how I see it rural
white voters are the single group that
you could describe totally with the
following uh three
words I'm going to give you three words
to tell you everything you need to know
about rural white
voters leave me
alone how did you do that so somebody
wrote exactly what I said as it was
coming out of my mouth that was good
nicely done you know me too well yeah
leave me alone all is the biggest threat
to America that people want to be left
alone in what world is that true
do you remember all of those uh KKK
[Music]
murders I
don't haven't they stopped
recently have you seen a lot of racist
murders I mean not by white people
against anybody else I mean they're all
in the news if they ever happen I
haven't even seen one in the news I I
think this group of people have been so
marginalized and uh there's no group
that has less power literally the least
powerful group in America would be rural
white voters except if there's a lot of
them they'll vote for somebody they
don't want you know want to be
president somebody the Democrats don't
want um the amuse account and others
have um warned us that apparently the
xplatform is
reinstated a penalty for misgendering
people so on the xplatform if you
repeatedly call somebody the wrong
proun you will be
deboosted if you dead name or um use the
wrong pronoun so even on the
xplatform uh you won't be kicked off but
you'll be sort of deboosted people won't
see your
stuff deboosted means uh people don't
see it as
much so this will be the real test
um yeah this is a real
test it's a real Edge case for musk so
we'll we'll see if he keeps it there my
guess is that he wasn't directly
involved with that
decision so you know the staff probably
has some you know
holdovers anyway I don't know I could
see how that could be hate
speech but it's
but that's one that Society is going to
have to work out like I think we're
going to need to decide if that's ha
speech you know if it were racial it
would be if if you said you know some
racial insult to somebody and X Deb
boosted
you we wouldn't complain too much would
we so if somebody's uh giving the same
kind of treatment to an adult who chose
to
transition I don't know I I think it's I
I think we're in a in an area where we
need to maybe get get together a little
bit better as a
country yeah it's a dangerous
one um Megan Kelly's having a good laugh
over this funny Willis and Nathan Wade
stuff and apparently the evidence from
the friends of them is pretty clear that
they were in a long-term relationship
long
before um which I assumed from the
beginning actually
and I'm not going to tell you why I knew
that they were in a long-term
relationship except maybe I will tell
you in the
manave I don't want to tell you in the
open format but there there is a
clue that they had been in relationship
for a long time and it was never in the
news yeah it's
speculation but it has to do with how
men and women
operate and and us being sh
shallow okay you just want to hear it
don't you you're terrible you're going
to make me say this I know I'm going to
get in trouble for
it I see I saw photos of fonny um that
were a few years old and I've seen
photos of her
currently she doesn't look the
same are you with me so
far she doesn't look today the way she
looked a allegedly when the affair began
allegedly have you seen a picture of uh
Wade's
exwife look at his
ex-wife she's not just
pretty she's really pretty like she's
really really
pretty now look at uh fonnie from the
photo from about the same time period
she looks pretty good she looks pretty
good how's she look
now uh in my opinion he does not leave
that wife and cheat on her for what
fonny looks like
lately I'm positive this this affair
started when she looked different I hate
to say it because it's
so I mean it's so
icky but it's as soon as I saw the
pictures of how she used to look
compared to how she looks now and then I
saw what her what the guy's wife looked
like I said all right human nature you
don't leave that for that I'm sorry I'm
sorry you know I'm not happy that I'm
saying it I'm sorry you just don't it
would be a very rare thing to see that
happen anyway next story uh Elon Musk is
suing open Ai and Sam Alman and the
other Founders I guess Greg Brockman and
some other folks and uh the lawsuit is
because uh quote open AI has been
transformed into a closed to Source de
facto subsidiary and you know Elon Musk
wanted it he he he
invested under the clear understanding
that it would be an open source it
became a for for-profit Microsoft own
thing and he's suing over it you know
I'm a little
surprised because the way he talked
about it he gave a sort of an oh well
you know oh well they took a zillion of
my dollars and lied to me but he's going
after him now of course he also competes
with grock
so kind of makes sense from a
competitive
standpoint all right um Zion lights
which is the name of a uh living human
uh woman
um talks a lot about uh nuclear industry
it's a good follow if you want to follow
somebody who's who's always on top of
what's happening with nuclear especially
uh and green stuff in general but
nuclear in particular uh Zion
lights who goes by the um name on the
Expo on the xplatform as Zion tree all
one word Zion tree anyway she's saying
today on post that Germany once known
for its engineering prowess tried to
replace all base load power generation
with wind and solar and now has some of
the highest prices for
electricity which of course is reflected
all the product costs and so the entire
German economy is in the doldrums
According to
some so what do you think of
that is that
accurate do you do you think that they
um they became too
woke still feeling guilty you know about
the Holocaust of course and so feeling
that they have to be sort of extra
extra liberal and nice I
guess and that as soon as somebody said
oh this this climate affects minorities
worse than other people then Germany had
to go all right I guess we're all in
because they they can't say no
anything that would even be a a whisper
reminder of the
Holocaust so certainly you can
understand why they are the way they are
but uh it does look like they sabotaged
their own economy I do expect they'll
figure a way
out
eventually
um
so watching the uh the Democrat pundits
flip out and and really look like they
have mental illness especially and
MSNBC because there's a possibility that
the Supreme Court will make it uh
possible for Trump to become president
and not put him in jail um I mean the
effect of it might be that he goes to
jail if they don't rule he had
immunity and watching the level at which
they're flipping out suggests that they
know it's their only
play now that's scary isn't it the
people who we believe are the Legacy you
know sort of the the Natural Evolution
of the people who murdered
JFK allegedly are the same people
looking at Trump and saying uh under no
circumstances can he become
president so they think that putting him
in jail uh will work because even if
he's not in jail you know like
physically uh the Democrats are all
saying that they've pulled and people
are far less likely to vote for him if
he's a
felon I'm trying to give my
dastardly conspirator laugh I have to do
that
better let me
explain human beings to apparently a
large group of people have never met one
it goes like this if he murdered
somebody
and you put him in jail less likely he
would get elected are you following me
so far if he robbed a Target
store got
caught got convicted well that wouldn't
be a felony but let's say he sold over
$950 it's a felony he gets convicted
probably fewer people would vote for
him if
he gets convicted of uh anything that's
like a real crime probably I think
people are less likely to vote for
him but
suppose it was obviously lawfare and
obviously and obviously a
political
prosecution and he gets a
felony what happens
then they think he'll give fewer votes
I
think Republicans will walk through
glass to vote for him if he gets lawf
fared into a
felony walk through glass people who
have never voted will
register people will take Grandma in her
 wheelchair and they'll drag her
through the whatever
snow I will
vote if he gets a felony I haven't voted
in years because I don't like to vote
because it makes me a team
player makes me more biased than I
already am but if you put him in jail
for law fair or or even just put the
felony on him whether he spends the day
in jail I'll vote I'll vote there's
nothing you couldn't stop me you you
couldn't tie me up to a chair I'll I'll
be voting yep that's all it takes so I
love the fact the Democrats are so not
understanding uh let's see what were
they called uh let me look it up uh the
dangerous white rural
voters have you ever heard of them
because those dangerous white rural
voters are going to come from
everywhere they're going to
materialize like you didn't even know
there were that many of them all right
if you want Trump to win for sure law
far I dare you I dare
you because we'll stop at nothing at
that point all the controls are off now
I've said if he spends one day in jail
and I don't mean to sound this is like a
threat and I definitely don't want any
violence no
violence but if he spends one day in
jail all the rules are
suspended all the rules of civilization
are susp ended at that point now I'm not
saying they should
be I'm not saying do anything violent I
don't recommend it don't do that I'm
just telling you what's going to happen
it's just cause an effect if you take
that that control off of the country
that we just don't do that we just don't
lawfare the other side if you're going
to break that
rule all the other rules go away at the
same time there's no
rules we'll just do what we have to do
and I don't know what that looks like
honestly I don't know what that looks
like but it's
dangerous all right let's talk about
other dangerous
things
um this is Glenn Greenwald
again um Gaza is a risk of it's just so
horrible uh one quarter of gaz's
population might be uh at risk of
famine which sounds is
perfectly in keeping with what we're
observing
um and you know it's tons of children
and and even the malnutrition that
they're having now will be a lifetime of
problems you know even if they survive
it's going to be a lifetime of problems
from the
malnutrition and more and more people
will call it a genocide that's you know
that will be up to you to
decide um I'm still firmly on the
position that if you weaponize your own
children don't complain to
me right so that's that's sort of my
whole that's my whole argument don't
weaponize your
children
and there's no right side on this
anymore there's just what Israel is
going to do like it's hard to be in
favor of what you're
seeing you know children starving how do
you be in favor of that at the same
time the at least Hamas not the starving
children but Hamas created a situation
where it was almost
guaranteed so if you create a situation
that's almost guaranteed to kill your
own
children I don't
know it's hard for me to to know what to
do with
that but I think Israel has to do what
Israel is going to do and the faster it
gets done the better off they will be I
think uh meanwhile California your
reparations are still alive that's the
dumbest thing um I'd like to help
calculate the reparations I've told this
before but among the things you need to
do to do it
right um if they want to do it right and
of course they do of course you want to
get right is uh you'd have to include of
you know of course some calculation of
what uh the the descendants of slave
should be out but you'd want to make
sure that calculation included the 30
years of direct employment
discrimination against white men in
every major corporation in
America um if there's anybody here who
is a Democrat this would be the part
where you say that never
happened and then we laugh at
you does anybody want to say that never
happened that there wasn't the 30 years
of direct employment discrimination
against white
men anybody want to give me a laugh and
say I don't think that ever
happened um how about this so you'd have
to include that and subtract it from the
reparations what do you think would be
more I don't know I'm not even sure
which number is
bigger um I know it cost me Millions but
I'm a special
case um you'd have to factor in crime if
there's any differential by by
race because crime is an expense and in
a way it's a um privilege to the
criminal because the criminal often gets
away with it and gets key free stuff and
then there you know there's some money
to keep them alive in prison Etc so
somehow you'd have to factor in
differential crime
levels uh you want to include any excess
social programs if there's a racial
difference in who gets them so if
they're more of one one group that was
getting uh social programs you'd want to
include that in your calculations you'd
want to control you want to have a
comparison group a baseline so you know
what you're comparing to and the
Baseline would be a control group of
people who stayed in Africa their
descendants you know or their
descendants you grew up in Africa and
were never put on slave ships in the
first place so you'd want to see how how
Americans are doing versus
that um you'd also want to compare uh
how black people are doing at the moment
to white people with similar educational
options not similar educational
outcomes but similar options in other
words there are uh poor white people who
go to terrible
schools and there are poor black people
who go to terrible schools if if you had
any way of ranking them you could say
okay let's see how they both did if it
turns out that the white people who went
to bad schools that are just as bad as
the black you know dominant schools and
they they excelled that's a good
argument for reparations you know there
might there might be something to that
like oh maybe that's where the systemic
racism is coming
in if you found out that the black
people with similar education were
actually doing better let's say because
everybody had a college education um the
black candidat is more likely to get
hired in America at the moment and for
the last 30 years that's been true so
you'd say oh more likely one group than
the other so you'd have to calculate
that in I wouldn't be
surprised if at the lower education
levels there is far more discrimination
against uh black applicants you know
just trying to get a small company job
and maybe it's a white employer Korean
American and they're looking at the the
white guy or the Korean applicant versus
the black guy and they both have a bad
high school education probably there's
more discrimination against the black
applicant probably I don't know for sure
I'm guessing but in Corporate
America it's the opposite so you'd have
to you know do some kind of net of that
if you could figure it
out but here's the shorter version of
that uh all our data is fake because uh
the only thing that drives the outcome
is the assumptions now I did data
analysis for a living I mention it all
the time when in my corporate life and I
knew I could make any outcome I wanted
by changing the assumptions the data is
the same I just changed my assumption of
what matters so reparations is like that
there's no such thing as a number that
is the right number there can't be
because it's all narrative and
assumption and should they come up with
some dollar amount that just robs me and
gives it to other people I'm going have
to deal with that and that would be a
pretty strong argument to leave the
state I'd hate to do it because I you
know I like a lot of things about the
state but I don't think I could stay
here if they just decided to take my
money away and give it to other people
you know taxes are bad enough but at
least I understand taxes taxes at least
have a you know taxes make sense to me
even Progressive taxes because I think
it is literally true that I pay the
highest tax
rate um and I have more to
protect isn't that fair I have more to
lose because I you know acquired more so
therefore uh the infrastructure of the
country and the the military that
protects me is doing more work for me
than for somebody who doesn't own
anything
right I think that's actually fair that
I'm getting more out of it because rich
people simply get more
services now if you're um oh hold on
hold on we'll get to that point because
it's a good one so people are pointing
out in the comments but wait wait the
people on welfare are just basically
getting money if you were to look at a
welfare let's take one person to one
person all right so that's the right
comparison just one person to one person
if you took one person on
welfare how much Public Services would
they get let's say their whole
life well I don't know what would you
think
$300,000 what's your
guess
$300,000 like a person who's just on
public service all the
time you're saying a million 100,000
some say well over a million let's take
a million you know just to work through
it mentally let's say it's a million
dollars so let's compare um me and what
I pay in taxes to the person who
contributed nothing to the
country and uh cost a million
dollars do you think I didn't cost the
country a million
dollars over my whole
life I don't know I use a lot of
resources if I have two cars instead of
one I don't I have one car um but you
know normal a normal person with
wealth um let's say I need police to
protect my home but the poor person
doesn't have a home and they live in
apartment building so it's like cheaper
to police
it what if I owned a private jet I
don't but that would require some
protection some government services some
airport fees I don't know I I think if
you really dug down and found out what
the government is doing for me and
compared it to what the government is
doing to a person who doesn't have
money you might find that I'm getting a
lot of
services but I I don't know if it would
add down
exactly but you see what I'm saying
right I am getting more services from
the government than a poor person
because the government takes care of
people's assets not just their physical
body so the government is is protecting
me my stock market Investments you know
their government regulations that
doesn't apply to a poor person so all
all the government expense to make sure
that my stock portfolio is
safe that's because I have money so
don't I cost the government
more now you could Al also argue that I
pay
more right but that's why I pay
more I pay more because I'm getting more
services
how often do you need do I do insider
trading not
often do I pay for it see I I don't know
so if you think it's
obvious I I would argue that point the
hardest I don't think it's obvious you
could certainly be right you could
certainly be right that I'm I'm adding
more to the system that I'm taking and
the poor person is taking more than the
ring that that could be
true but I don't think it's obvious it's
definitely not obvious I'd love to see a
calculation on
that all
right that's all I got for
now and I'd like to uh thank the people
on rumbled and the xplatform and the
highly racist Google product called
YouTube thanks for joining and I hope
you all find a way to rumble
because way less racist thanks for now
see you tomorrow same time same
place
