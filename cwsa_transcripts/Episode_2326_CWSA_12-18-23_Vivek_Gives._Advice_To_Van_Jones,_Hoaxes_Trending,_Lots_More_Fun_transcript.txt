good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and I'm
pretty sure there's never been a better
time in your life if you'd like to take
this experience up to levels and nobody
can even understand well all you need
for that is a cuper mug glass a tanker G
ofic jugg or flask of vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I
don't
I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dopamine the day
thing makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous sip it happens
now
go ah and do you notice I made your day
better without using AI Quantum
Computing or removing any CO2 from the
air yeah
I did
that well here's a question for
you this is just a mental
experiment you've probably seen uh old
videos that have been
restored of uh Americans walking around
the streets of of let's say New York
City in the early
1900s you've all seen those videos and
and we laugh because the people have
there's like zero obesity there's no
obesity nobody not male not female not
any age no obesity now men I'm going to
ask a
very provocative
question men of all those women that you
saw walking around in those 1900s photos
or
videos how many of them would do you
have sex
with okay it's all of them it's pretty
much all of them
all right now men men who just said you
would have sex with all of the women in
the
1900s fast forward in your mind to 2023
Christmas put yourself in the middle of
the mall whatever is your closest mall
now in your mind walk through the mall
and look at all the people men and women
now ask yourself what percentage of the
women in the mall would you have sex
with
voluntarily
2% 10%
5% I'm just going to put a hypothesis
out
there there might be a
reason that the that the population
isn't growing as fast as it used to be
maybe it's just really really
obvious now so that's just one problem I
believe we are less attractive to each
other I believe that's just a fact but
until on top of that haven't we also
become because we all have our own
little social media bubbles we can get
into haven't we all become more
different than we've ever
been I feel like the average
guy in 1900s they're all about the same
and the average woman ah they're all
about the same but today you know you're
into bird watching and I'm into Quantum
Computing and
like we we just don't have enough in
common because we have a Riches of
experiences and we have different
interests so there are pretty obvious
reasons why uh things are going negative
on
population there's a viral uh story on X
about some young white kid who uh got a
1460 on his SATs but could not get
accepted at Cornell
despite how he skipped a grade and I
guess he did some extracurricular stuff
that was good but uh as other people
have pointed out
1460 isn't really good enough to get
into
Cornell it it wouldn't matter what color
you were well actually it does I I
suppose if you were a a group that were
recruiting 1460 would be enough but it's
worth pointing out that
1460 um would be at the low end of
anybody who even applied yeah think he
would be in the lowest 25% of anybody
who even applied so I don't know if that
story is really about discrimination or
just it's hard to get into Cornell maybe
it's a little bit of
both here's a question I asked on
X because taker Carlson keeps saying
that uh there's something real about
these
aliens and that there are Parts he
doesn't even tell his wife CU they're
too disturbing and there's a spiritual
dimension into
it now he's not very clear about what
that spiritual Dimension is If he if he
has any Clarity on
that but I would think there's an
obvious skeptical problem here which is
what if we find out that life on Earth
absolutely
100% came from aliens from another
planet intentionally seeding us with
life here so I'm going to give you just
a mental experiment that I I gave to
people an X if you knew with 100%
certainty now I accept that there's no
such thing as 100% certainty which is
why this is a just a mental experiment
just a mental experiment but if you
could have 100% certainty that life on
Earth came from an alien planet and it
was
intentional would you continue believing
in your holy
books now keep in mind that was still
allow you to believe in God because in
that case God might have created the
aliens so the first thing you should
know about my question on X is that it
was a NPC trap do you know what the NPC
trap is an NPC trap is when you say
something that you know certain
percentage of the population will have
to respond in an exact boring way and
whatever is the most boring thing they
can say so because it was a trap I put
in my question
stipulated God could have created the
aliens do you know why I put that in
there because 100% of the time if you
say that you know maybe the aliens
seated Earth somebody will say but Scott
there's something you haven't considered
obviously Scott I don't think you've
considered that possibly the aliens
could have been created by
God now yes I I know you will say that
100% of the time that this topic comes
up so I put right in the right very
clearly stipulated God could have
created the aliens and what did people
say in the
comments well uh Johnny Fork says that
one would ask the where then did the
aliens come from then uh ultimately one
person is
responsible and then uh Amy is the bomb
responded no someone had to create the
aliens why not a God so yeah my NPC
tests I I sucked in a bunch of NPCs who
then revealed
themselves what's a really good form of
swimming or no good form of exercise
it's swimming soil and green The Matrix
those are all the things the NPC say but
anyway the point is that uh 63% of
people said that if they found out for
sure that their religious holy books
were completely made up it wouldn't
change their
faith even if they knew their faith
wasn't real they said they wouldn't
change their faith 2third two-thirds of
people said they wouldn't change their
religious beliefs if they found out with
certainty and this is the key with 100%
certainty they found out they weren't
true they wouldn't change their
beliefs now of course what's really
happening here is people are um
reinterpreting the question so that they
can Jeet right here's what they really
did well Scott there's no such thing as
100% uncertainty in anything I know
that's why it's a mental experiment you
don't get to say there's no such thing
as no certainty that that wasn't one of
the options but anyway um I believe the
answers I believe that two-thirds of
people would keep their religion
regardless of what they found out about
it and if they found out aliens seed the
Earth they would just say well but you
know God made the aliens so it's just a
new detail but it would kind of make the
whole Genesis
story a little
less
practical and then other people said but
Scott it's obvious that something had to
create the
universe does anybody think that makes
sense
I want to see if anybody will agree with
that is it
obvious that something created the
universe something that was not the
universe created it that's
obvious that's ridiculous it's not
obvious it's literally ridiculous it's
the opposite of obvious it's
impossible no the the the obvious answer
is that there was always something
something
here the obvious answer is that time is
not what you think and there was no
beginning it's just there was just an
no that's far more likely than there was
nothing and then something created
it because if there was something that
created it then what created the thing
that created it so yeah there had to be
something
here so there there's no way nothing was
here and then it turned into something
cuz somebody was not part of the nothing
created
it all right well enough about
that um according to rasmason
poll uh let's see if you can guess the
answer to this can you guess the answer
before I ask the question let's see if
you can do
it yep yep you have the right
answer that's correct the right answer
is
24% and a lot of people had the answer
before they knew what the top IC was
That's How smart my audience is yeah so
24% is how many people believe the news
media have given too much coverage of
the hunter Biden legal
problems 24% said there there's way too
much of this Hunter Biden legal problem
stuff in the
news way too
much uh but 51 say the media hasn't
given
enough and also 60% this is also
rasmon 60% of likely us voters believe
the problem of bias in the news is
getting worse and that's even worse than
it used to be so even more people
believe the news is getting
worse that's
progress I call that progress is that
good for Trump if people think the news
is less
Dependable yes because that's Trump's
message from the
beginning um there's
news that uh apparently people are
developing new cases of chronic
pain so that's a big problem chronic
pain just before I went live to the
YouTube people uh I asked the people on
the locals platform privately if they
had tried my test I I had challenged the
people who follow me on the locals
Community to stop eating wheat for 2
weeks and and the idea was I don't have
any evidence that wheat is bad for you
right I'm not a scientist I'm not a
doctor so don't take it for me I'm just
speculating that maybe people have
different U sensitivities to different
foods and wheat would be one I'd try
first now it doesn't mean it's the only
thing that might be causing you some
chronic pain cuz I I suspect our our
food sources are essentially compromised
I don't think we have safe food or even
close not nothing even in that you know
category now you can eat safely if you
to eat you know without preservatives
and a lot of chemicals so you don't do
the processed food but some people have
questioned whether uh our American
bodies are handling the wheat I don't
know the answer to that question so I de
saidd why don't we do a little
experiment and so I asked the people how
many of you be willing to just give up
weat for a few weeks just see how you
feel see if you lose weight see if
anything's different just as an
experiment and I asked just before I
went live on YouTube and it was just a
stream of people who had lost weight and
feel better and lost chronic pain now is
that scientific
no could it all be in our heads yes
totally could all be in our heads but I
I recommend this as a general system for
your
life the system for your life is you
should
continually um experiment with adding
foods to your diet and then don't add
you know don't change much except maybe
one food you added and then also
subtract some things you know you know
what to subtract anything that looks
like it might be a little suspicious
just see what happens if you feel better
keep doing it that's my advice however
in the same article they said that these
chronic pain
have now surpassed diabetes and high
blood pressure as you know three the
three chronic
problems what do those three things have
in common
maybe uh actually depression too what do
diabetes depression high blood pressure
and chronic pain have in common
maybe I think
inflammation I think inflammation is
probably the thing behind everything you
know and food so inflammation is the the
half answer the bigger answer is I think
this is all
food would would you have as much uh
high blood pressure if people were a
good
weight wouldn't be wouldn't even be
close weight is very highly correlated
how about
diabetes that's
food chronic pain chronic pain that
people didn't used to have it's probably
food
probably uh how about
depression well if you've got diabetes
bad blood pressure and chronic
pain and you're
overweight you might not feel 100% so
it's entirely possible that even
depression has a high correlation with
you know your General Health which has a
high correlation with what you
eat so I'd be looking at the food
sources RFK Jr is right on about all
that stuff here's something remember I
tell you that you don't understand any
story until you know the players like
who's married to who who's related to
who you who used to work for whom who
used to be whose boss if you don't know
that no story makes sense so if you saw
a story about uh let's say the Rolling
Stone
publication uh said there there's some
big lie about Tesla and then more than 2
million Teslas are being recalled
because of some problem with the
self-driving system wouldn't you say to
yourself my
God I'm going to think twice before I
buy a Tesla car based on this Rolling
Stone
report all right here's something that
left out of the
report the so-called
recall is just an automatic software
update that you don't have to do
anything about and it's probably already
done they called it a recall it was just
a software update and the software
update was something about being more uh
in the face of the driver in case they
were using the automatic driving you
know was more of a reminder to pay
attention to the automatic driving if
you have it uh if you have it
activated
now well what part of that is some
national story that there was an
automatic update like there always is
and it made their user interface a
little bit better that's what happened
yeah Tesla improved their user
interface automatically without any
action by the by the
owner and that got turned into by
Rolling Stone a big lie about Tesla and
a giant recall and they made it sound
dangerous all right so here's the things
you don't know about Rolling
Stone and oh did I not write down who
told me this damn it I'm stealing this
from somebody on uh the xplatform and I
did not write down who it was all right
well I apologize but I'm going to still
give you the content so this is not my
original
research if somebody knows who I stole
this from remind me in the comments
because I tweeted it um but here's what
we know do you know who owns Rolling
Stone publication it's owned by the
Pensky Media
Group and their chairman is a son of
Roger Pensky famous you know Automotive
Pensky person and let's see the father
of the person who owns Rolling Stone
what kind of business is the father
in oh owns over 200 car dealerships that
compete with
Tesla that's right so the guy whose
company owns Rolling Stone that guy's
father is a major competitor Det
Tesla don't you think that should have
been mentioned in the story it
wasn't and then what about uh Rolling
Stone itself so Rolling Stone is a
traditional publication who's it compete
with it competes with
X right X is the publication that says
that things like the Rolling Stone are
Obsolete and ridiculous and fake news
because it's obsolete and rid ridiculous
and clearly fake news now suppose you
didn't know that suppose you read this
story like it was just a story in the
news you would you would think there's
something wrong with uh with
Tesla in fact if you go just like one
level down Tesla is operating pretty
well they gave you an automatic update
and made something better without you
doing any
work the the uh the media landscape is
so slimy
that if you don't know these connections
you just don't know what's going on you
wouldn't know what this story is really
about all right here's something I loved
when I woke up this morning on X a
trending term was
hoax now do you know why I'm I'm happy
about that that the word hoax was
trending here's why I'm happy so I go I
click on it to see what is why that's
trending and some people are talking
about climate change being a hoax some
people are talking about Russia
collusion being a hoax somebody said
something about healthc care as a hoax
somebody said the Whitmer uh kidnapping
things was a hoax and somebody else said
the January 6 Insurrection was a
hoax yeah here we go here we
go there we go so the I'm going to say
that uh this is Mike cernovich you know
with his movie hoax and I think he's the
first person who started using that word
in the political context or at least
he's the most influential with it now I
adopted his word and i' I've tried to
extend it but it looks like it's entered
the language pretty heavily would you
agree that the fact that is trending and
is trending across topics suggests that
the
that the
frame that the news is basically a bunch
of political hoaxes and each one is a
hoax in which you can explain the hoax
and pretty pretty easily it's pretty
easy to say what the hoax is in each of
these
cases it feels like
winning as soon as I saw that word there
and I realized that it it applied to a
whole bunch of different
topics that looked like winning to me
yeah that there there's something in the
Zeitgeist now where when somebody sees a
story that looks sketchy the word hoax
comes to
mind
um Alina HBA who's Trump's
attorney um says that if Trump gets
elected they're going to go deep and
hard against the
Democrats well I mean some could argue
that that's already started in the
Senate hearing room
anybody it already happened in the
Senate hearing room yep somebody's going
deep and hard against the
Democrats
okay
look if somebody gets banged in the
Senate hearing room I'm not going to let
that go for at least 3 weeks 3 weeks is
my minimum minimum minimum level of joke
window after 3 weeks I'm going to say uh
it's a little old sort of a Jess smay
smell to it now ah we've talked about it
too much but for now oh it's gold it's
gold so there's that now what do you
think of the idea though that Trump is
going to go hard against the Democrats
if elected should they be saying
that do you think it's good
for Trump to say or his proxies to say
that he's going to go hard against the
Democrats CU here's my problem I really
think somebody does need to go hard
against all the
hoaxes and the and then obviously the
legal
 but I don't know if you should
say
it I don't know cuz saying it uh leads
into their narrative that he's going to
be Thanos and everybody will die when
he's elected so I don't know could go
either way I like that at least during
the primary season they're talking tough
cuz the base wants to hear it but maybe
when it gets to the
general when uh you know when the
nominations are over maybe then you
don't say that so much I'll do a little
less of that once it's once we get into
it a little
more Jonathan Turley uh is on the case
talking about Hunter Biden and whether
he'll be charged with criminal contempt
for refusing to appear in uh bpen I
guess to talk to
Congress but the interesting side
question which uh thly talks about is
that Eric swalwell apparently helped
coordinate and organize Hunter's
non-compliance in other words he
attended with him and you know they they
were sort of working as a team so the
question is
is Eric
sell uh risking going to
jail for just helping
hunter in what looks
like doing something that could create a
criminal contempt situation interfere
with the you know wouldn't uh wouldn't
swo be interfering with an official an
official uh let's say what what would
you call it an official process within
Congress because once the house members
are looking into
something isn't that an official process
is it any less official than uh what
Pence was doing on January
6th or is there like some subcategory of
what makes something
official to me it looks like somebody
was trying to thwart the congress's
official work so why wouldn't SW will go
to
jail uh you know at least in at least in
the same risk as uh abandon was cuz
there was a similar situation some
say nothing's ever really similar in
this legal stuff there no two situations
are really the same but there are
situations that make you raise your
eyebrow and say it's a little bit the
same maybe we should figure out what's
different I don't think this ww well is
in legal Jeopardy and I don't think
Hunter will be in legal Jeopardy but I
also don't think Bannon should have been
in legal Jeopardy so the these are all
edge cases people you could argue that
they broke the law I get it but you
don't really want people to go to jail
for this sort of stuff I
don't um Biden had a reaction to uh
Trump's
rally uh and here's what uh Biden
said after I read this see if you can
answer the question is it working right
so here's the democrat's obvious
strategy for beating Trump
see if it's working so Biden released a
statement saying tonight Donald Trump
channeled his role models as he pared
Adolf Hiller praised Kim Jong-un and
quoted Vladimir Putin while running for
president on a promise to rule as a
dictator and threaten American
democracy uh may I quote V
ramaswami presidential candidate
um who said about van
Jones well you know what he said about
van Jones that's my next story but let
me just point out that uh I don't think
it's working I'm going to call this the
Thanos strategy because Thanos is just
more ridiculously fictional you know the
the whole Hitler kimj and Putin thing is
like creating this fictional world where
Biden where where Trump lives in it and
he's friends with all the dictators and
he's going to be one it's a completely
fictional world so I think it's funnier
if you embrace it and take it all the
way to the full fiction of Thanos the
super villain in the Marvel movies who's
going to snap his be glove and half of
the planet will die let's just go full
Thanos if you going to th if you're
going to show you can to put in one
sentence Adolf Hitler Kim Jong-un and
Vladimir Putin
don't be a just go full Thanos huh
come on Biden come on go full Thanos you
can do it
now do you
agree that that this
attack doesn't feel like an attack
anymore it feels sort of like a
joke doesn't it just sound funny to you
when you hear it like when I read this I
read it as
humor literally and you know I'm not I'm
not saying that just to influence you
I'm saying I just laughed when I read it
yeah looks like we lost the comments oh
no comments are back all
right in a related
story um V rahas Swami was
speaking and uh he said and I
quote now I you know me I don't like to
use foul language in public so I'm only
going to say this because it's a
presidential candidate who said it in
public so
ordinarily I would never try to offend
your ears with such language but it's
news it's news so I'm going to cover it
you know hey we talked about Monica
linsky's
 right couldn't say that until it
was news as soon as you touch a
president's well you can talk about
that because it's news it's
news that's right I can say president's
 because I was actually the subject
of an impeachment says news you can't
blame me if it's news it's not my fault
right here's the news F ramaswami said
and I quote you've got this character
van Jones on CNN afterwards saying quote
this is the rise of an American
demagogue talking about V himself
this is Rise of an American demagogue
who is going to live 50 years longer
than Trump this is dangerous then V says
just shut the up at a certain point
just shut the
up Crowd Goes
Wild The Crowd Goes Wild now what
strategy what persuasion strategy is V
employing here successfully what what
what strategy is he
employing he's treating them like
clowns because the things they're saying
do sound
clownish and if you were to if you were
to respond to it as in my goodness I'm
not going to be a dictator that would be
such a mistake because then you're just
talking about how you're a dictator but
not a dictator and then it just people
think
dictator but he goes the other way he
just he just says just shut the up
which guarantees it becomes national
news it trended right guarantees it's
national news and guarantees that you
will mock van
Jones right I I actually like van Jones
I think he's awesome but he's also a
team player for the other side you know
unabashedly so I don't mind that I don't
mind when people are overtly
unabashedly taking a a team perspective
that's okay right if you don't lie to me
that's fine I don't mind that at all as
long as you're not lying to me and Van
Jones does a good job of you know not
lying in my opinion but he does use a
little uh hyperbole now and then and the
hyperbole about the dictators in the
Republican Party are ridiculous in in my
mind they are actually just funny so if
we get to the point where we treat it as
funny we're not going to look so
scary would you agree mockery is very
powerful nobody wants to be the mocked
person in the
conversation and all this dictator stuff
is so over-the-top
ridiculous that
vake I I would say if you were going to
grade this it isn't just it's not even
an
a this is like extra credit you know
this is like an AP Class A you know
counts as a
4.5 you you can't do better than that
that you take your whole day you know
take a whole day off today and try to
come up with a better response to Van
Jones then just shut the up at some
point just shut the up you can't
beat that that is literally an
unbeatable
response because it dismisses the other
side is ridiculous exactly with the tone
that you need to you joke about it
because it's so stupid
Perfect all right um I talked about this
I uh my dear Democrat uh post where I
told the Democrats how to get into their
brainwashing uh prison and it's up to
3.5 million views I told you yesterday
it had that it had that early indication
it might go viral three and a half
million people viewed it I saw that Elon
Musk responded to it with just one word
true I I like uh when uh Elon Musk gives
the really fast responses to things
sometimes he just says one exclamation
mark like if there's something in the
news that's just crazy you'll just do
the one exclamation mark But then other
times he go just ases the one word
Che so I'm sure that has something to do
with the traffic on it
but given that it has 3.5 million views
and that musk endorsed it and I saw a
lot of people say um it was the best
post of the
Year imagine how many posts there were
this year and and a number of people
just spontaneously and independently
said best post of the year which I don't
get and that's not something I hear even
even if I have this many uh views people
don't say it's the best post of the year
they just say they liked it so this one
must be special so I'm going to read it
to you again in full right because
there's something about this that's
really resonating with people so if we
can understand what is it about this is
resonating then you'll be more
powerful right so I'll just read it
again to
you dear Democrats I'm sorry your media
has done this to you I realize you have
no mechanism for knowing how brainwashed
you are and as a trained hypnotist I am
genuinely empathetic about it I mean no
disrespect because brainwashing is more
powerful than brains that's why it
works one way out of your mental prisons
is to ask yourself which countries are
okay with changing the basic nature of
the societies via unchecked
immigration if such countries exist and
unchecked immigration is working out
great for them uh you might be right
that the right-wingers in Trump are like
Hitler
if no such country exists consider that
you have been the victim of brainwashing
the real kind and that this type of
manipulation is the basic nature of
American society and has been for
decades next ask yourself if anyone has
ever used a complex model to predict
anything about the future climate change
or otherwise you will learn it isn't a
thing and never has been
models do not predict the
future nothing else does
either your real enemies are the
brainwashers in charge not the so-called
rightwing there is a common
enemy the political right can be duded
and wrong too but it never looks like
the result of organized brainwashing
just an attraction to conspiracy
theories too many of which have proven
true now do you feel the persuasion in
that do do you actually feel it because
that's sort of the dividing line between
just talking and persuading you have to
feel it or else it's not
persuasion too long it's too long but I
did get three and a half million views
let me tell you which parts of this are
active persuasion so you can reproduce
it
okay so I started out by saying you know
dear democr and that I apologized to
them I said I'm sorry and I have empathy
for their
situation if you start with
empathy you're going to get a better
outcome than if you start with you're
all
idiots right so the first persuasion is
you start with
empathy um and I say I'm sorry that it
happened to
you by saying I'm sorry that it happened
to you I make people think about whether
or not I'm really sorry what have I done
if they're thinking about whether I'm
really sorry about it I made them think
past the sale the sale is the something
happened to them I'm not talking about
whether something happened to them I'm
talking about how I feel about it so I
made them thing past the sale that's in
the first part right that's classic
persuasion uh I said I mean no respect
uh because brainwashing is more powerful
than brains so now I've given them a
graceful um
it is it mavelli who says you should
always leave your enemy once you've
defeated them always leave them an
Escape Route you don't want to humiliate
them you want to give them a way out so
I give them a way out which is hey it's
not your fault if somebody uses
brainwashing on you you're no you're not
magic you everybody's brain is
susceptible so now I've shown empathy
and I've also said there's a reason
that's not your fault
so I'm showing compassion and I've
already absolved them from blame before
I even get into the details that's
that's good
persuasion what else did I
do uh then I told them away out of their
mental prison which is also making them
think past the sale I'm not trying to
sell them on the fact that they're in a
mental
prison I'm talking about how to get out
do you see the technique again I'm not
not going to argue whether you're in a
mental prison that's a given I'm talking
about how to get out now if I tell you
how to get out wouldn't you be tempted
to try it if it were so easy it didn't
require any effort whatso whatsoever I
mean you just have to read the rest of
the sentence that's that's your entire
effort so you're saying to yourself
really there's I'm I've been I've been
brainwashed and you're going to get me
out of it with one
sentence how you not be interested in
that how do you bail out at that point
you're going to finish right you're
going to finish CU I'm going to tell you
how to get out of a prison that you
didn't know you were in and I'm going to
do it in one sentence you're going to
finish the sentence find out what I'm up
to all right so here here's what I said
was uh consider that
uh if there's some place where unchecked
immigration is
working then maybe you got a
point because as far as we know there is
no place that unchecked immigration is
working and logically it can't work work
I mean makes makes sense now some people
said to me but Scott in the
comments uh unchecked immigration is
what made America great like we we're
basically a nation that became the you
know strongest nation in Earth because
of specifically unchecked
immigration do you know what my response
to that
is there's another word for that let's
see what's it called when somebody's
already living in a place and then you
come in with all your people and
displace the people who are there and
take all their
land is that called unchecked
immigration or is that oh there's
another word for it it's called
colonizing
right yes if you want to be a
colonizer then how about your unchecked
immigration is a good way to get there
that's called
colonizing
colonizing
that that was the best that was the best
criticism to this
tweet that colonizing is maybe better
than you
thought all
right um so then I challenged them to
think about that so that they have
actually some meat to think about and
then I said we have a common
enemy uh what's the best way to make a
friend best way to make a friend is if
you have a common enemy and you're
working toward defeating the common
enemy so I say it directly got a common
enemy whoever is brainwashing you is not
my friend and they're not your friend if
they're brainwashing you so we have a
common enemy whoever is brainwashing you
is not my friend but I'm your
friend you know dear Democrat dear
Democrat who's who I feel actual genuine
empathy for I I could be your friend but
whoever whoever is with you
whoever has destroyed your ability to to
see reality through this intense
brainwashing they're not my friend and
I'm not even sure who they are they're
not
Republicans they're not Republicans I
don't know who they are but they're not
my friend and they're definitely not
your friend so we're on the same
team that's good persuasion too all
right and then I finish it off by saying
cuz at this point you know you you
assume by the way this is good writing
technique as well as good persuasion if
you know what people are thinking as as
their criticism you should address it
before they say it it's much stronger
than waiting for them to say it because
once they say it they're committed to it
and then it's hard to back off something
you said but if they haven't said it yet
and you can catch it and like kill it in
the crib then maybe it won't come out of
the mouth and then they're not committed
to it so it's easier to you know get it
when they're
young so I said the political right can
be diluted and wrong too cuz if I hadn't
said that that the right can be diluted
and
wrong then it's just a political
statement and then people have
permission to ignore it it's like ah
you're just on a team as soon as you say
I'm on a team you're kind of done with
your persuasion nobody's going to listen
to the team play so you got to say yes
this is something that that applies to
me and you equally but there is one
little twist which the which is that the
uh brainwashing that happens on the um
Republican side doesn't seem to be
organized it's people who genuinely
believe what they believe sometimes they
collect more people who believe the same
thing such as vaccinations such as the
election
Etc but it doesn't seem
organized or to the extent that it's
organized you can tell that you know
maybe Trump is the main voice to it but
there's nothing hidden
there's nothing sketchy or weird
happening it's just people say I don't
trust this thing I think there might be
a conspiracy theory here that's very
different than being brainwashed into
thinking as conspiracy theory very
different all right so that's the
persuasion take down on
that Trump said at his speech that Jimmy
Carter is very happy his administration
looks brilliant compared to what we have
right now is that good uh
persuasion really good
it's really good uh here here's the
trick if he had said Biden is terrible
well you'd argue with it he's not so
terrible he did some things I like you
might say if you're a Democrat but if
you say Jimmy Carter is happy about it
you've created a second question you
you've made the you've made him think
past the sale again from is Biden
terrible to is he the worst ever or the
second worst
ever so Trump makes you think about is
Biden the worst of all time or just the
second worst
perfect it's
perfect um I I like to think of Biden as
being a lot like Jimmy Carter the main
difference being would be uh Biden is
like Jimmy
Carter if all of Jimmy Carter's peanuts
had been stolen instead of instead of
growing on the
farm is that
fair
Biden is like Jimmy Carter if Jimmy
Carter had stolen all of his peanuts
instead of growing them on his farm I
thought it was good I thought I liked
it all
right also Carter never weaponized the
government as far as I know so in my
opinion there's no competition Biden is
far worse than Carter because Carter
meant
well let me say that again Jimmy Carter
meant well that is not the case with
Biden
Biden's in it for the
money let's be honest he's in it for the
money at least barle all right so now
the EU commission just opened a formal
proceeding against
X do you think that's because they have
a genuine concern or because X is a
threat to everybody in power because
Free Speech actually happens there this
it's because it's a
threat of course so the weaponization of
the American
government has now spread to the
weaponization of the European
governments and do you know what the
European government uh doesn't seem to
be complaining
about tick
tock tick tock right Tik Tock is
literally one of the biggest risks in
the world it's fine Free
Speech yeah if you can't tell that the
against Elon Musk are purely political
you are not paying attention at all I
mean it's pretty obvious that these are
purely political pretty obvious but if
you didn't spend a lot of time following
the news maybe it wouldn't
be well I see two opposing reports about
a potential border deal uh Joe Mansion
says might have a border deal this week
Lindsey Graham says uh not a chance in
the world there will there will be a
deal there's nobody's even close so but
I do like this I do like that the
Republicans are holding tight and
they're saying unless we get something
done that's really useful at the border
you're not getting any more Ukraine
funding how many think that was a good
play I don't I don't like the omnius
things where it's just a whole bunch of
stuff thrown into one big pot and then
you know everybody gets to Pork and
nothing good happens so I don't like an
omnius
but if you take two issues that can't be
solved and you can solve them by
marrying them and when I say solved I
mean at least we get some kind of action
resolution that does make sense so from
a systems
perspective thank
you that you know have I ever
complimented Congress before I don't
think
so maybe in my whole
life
this I'm going to compliment oh actually
I have I've complimented Matt gates for
causing trouble when when a promise to
him was not
kept I I'm completely on board with that
if if Matt Gates got rid of the speaker
for no other reason than because he
broke a promise to him I'm okay uh blah
blah blah other things I don't care blah
blah blah it hurts the Republicans
chances of winning election don't care
nope if you lie to your colleague and he
takes you down good good that's nothing
else to say I don't even care if it
hurts
me CU I'm in favor of a system where the
system works like a good system even if
sometimes it's bad for me and that was a
good system response if the system took
out somebody who lied to him good that's
what I want to see more of that please
um but if uh the Republicans get some
kind of Border thing especially since
it's an election year that should make
it easier to get something done there uh
they're playing it
right so Christopher Ray says that the
risk at the border is greater than ever
you know Isis and maybe Al-Qaeda and
everybody else might be coming
in I don't
know I I still have this big question
mark
about about why there haven't been lots
more domestic terrorist attacks in
recent
years why is that the only thing I can
think of is that our
surveillance systems that surveil
basically all Communications all the
time are really good and it can pick out
keywords and it can spot the bad guys
before they get too organized we must be
taking down potential terrorists like
every day and successfully I think I
can't think of any other reason we
wouldn't be seeing you know massive
terrorist attacks in the Homeland for
years how could it be none how's that
even
possible so I'm going to make a
prediction that there will not be a wave
of major terrorist attacks there might
be a spot here and there like there
might be a lone wolf or something I
don't think you're going to see a 911
because I think that our our uh Spooks
are so good at surveilling us that they
would pick up anybody on the mainland or
even outside it we even thought about
doing something and I don't think that
you can do anything without digital
communication these
days cos Peron says wrong in all
capitals you you should just say I'm an
NPC that would be more clear instead of
wrong I'm in NPC I just wanted you all
to know it swimming is the best form of
exercise and
also soil and
green all right there's something called
a Tik Tock Mutiny at least that's what
social media calls it so apparently
there are a number of ticktockers who
are in the US Army who are whining about
being in the service is terrible they
don't like the pay the food and they
don't like taking Fitness tests and
they've been complaining on Tik
Tock
now so these are the people that the the
demographic that the military needs to
attract to join the military is that
exact Tik Tock age group and now people
in the Tik Tock age group actual
influencers are telling people in the
age group that's a terrible deal to join
the
military should we assume that the net
effect of that will be a degradation of
our milit Ary
capability I think it's obvious right
somewhat
obvious that if people in the military
are directly telling other people don't
do it because I've never really seen
that before have
you I've never seen any kind of
organized you know digital negativity
about joining the
military so now here's the question if
you didn't know it Tik Tok is owned by
is owned by a Chinese company and
Chinese companies have to do what the
government tells them everybody
understands that Tik Tock is told us
they have a button that's literally
titled heat if they push that button on
a certain uh post on Tik Tok it will get
lots more attention so it gets more heat
goes viral so what would happen
hypothetically if China told Tik Tok to
push the button on the people who are in
the American Military who say don't join
it's a bad deal I hate it here what
would
happen it would destroy the fighting
ability of the US
military maybe for a
decade that's completely legal our
Congress our Congress allows our biggest
adversary
China to have total infiltration of all
of our young
people and then have a message that
would destroy the military capability of
the United States and what would China
need to do to destroy the military of
the United
States this is not an exaggeration this
is literally true one
button one
button one phone call and one
button hello this is the government of
China am I talking to the CEO of uh bite
dance yes
could you tell your Tik Tock managers to
push the heat button on these soldiers
who are saying don't join the US
military absolutely sir thank you
click
push and that's the end of the US
military is that an
exaggeration does anybody want to
challenge my my frame does anybody want
to say Scott that's a little hyperbolic
you're not going to destroy the US
military by pushing one button you
unless it's a nuclear button no that's
not an
exaggeration tiktock does have the power
to destroy recruitment of the US
military that's a real
thing and your Congress is not really
even too serious about stopping it not
really serious about it what does that
tell
you tells me only one thing there is no
possibility that Congress is anything
but bought
off I don't think there's any other
explanation for what we're seeing and if
there is another explanation wouldn't
you like to hear it and if somebody went
on TV tomorrow to answer these questions
the ones that I just brought up what do
you how do you think that conversation
would go let me tell you newsers so what
do you think about Tik Tock do you think
he should be
banned Congress person well you know
this issue of data privacy is very
important but you know I think we don't
want to ban it cuz Free
Speech thank you for coming thank you
for coming uh our next
story right because the the news is
obviously corrupt so they're not going
to even ask the right question it's not
about data security it's not data
security it's not privacy that is an
issue but it's about pushing that heat
button that's the one that destroys the
military
do you think you could get a news person
to ask the question correctly and turn
that into a like a TV hit now I have I
have seen it done but one and a 10 maybe
N9 and of 10 will be data security
that's that's the diversion and one and
a 10 will say but there's a heat button
and there will be mention of it but do
you think there will be anybody in the
news who would do what I just did to
describe to you how simple it would be
for China to destroy the entire US
military with one
button do you think you'll see that on
TV no do you think the Washington Post
will write an article about how China
has one button destruction Powers now
over the United States no New York Times
no no no it will be completely
ignored
yeah
um there's a story in the BBC that says
white men are 30 times more likely to
succeed in finance
jobs and they say it's because they're
coming from higher socioeconomic
backgrounds so I guess there's some
effort to want to fix
that and there some research showed that
there was that big
difference um what's missing from the
survey so let's let's say the survey is
correct and that white men are 30 times
more likely to succeed in finance right
what's missing is there any data that's
missing from the story that would maybe
give you better context on
this well allow me to
suggest did they ask all the different
groups who was
interested so I have a degree in
economics and MBA from Berkeley but I
don't like to mention it because I'm
embarrassed embarrassed by my ba but why
why do you think I pursued a a finance
related career
economics and then business do you know
what what was it about me was it because
of my uh I was born in a rich family so
I was always around money no no I was
born I was raised in a lower middle
class you know income my father worked
for the post office it was a clerk at
clerk behind the counter at the post
office right
the the house I grew up in was made of
cinder blocks that my mother and my
father built with their own two hands
that's right I grew up in a house that
my parents built themselves and they
never built anything
before you could
tell all right but no let me tell you
why I I pursued a an education in the
finance area I was legitimately
interested and when I looked at all my
options I said to myself huh I don't
think I want one of those jobs where I'm
Outdoors all day in the sun and the cold
and moving stuff that's i' get tired and
I saidd which jobs make me a lot of
money Well Finance sounded kind of
promising you take a lot of different
directions right you don't just have to
be a personal finance person you might
just be managing your own money but you
know useful skilled no matter what you
do with
it so I said to myself you know what I'd
like to make a lot of money I'm quite
interested in understanding how money
works and there's a word for it called
economics and then I pursued my
interests and then I did okay you know
cartooning is what mostly worked but if
you haven't heard my story if not for
the business education cartooning
wouldn't have worked for me because I I
had to use those skills to make
cartooning work it wasn't because the
cartoon was so good right
so if you don't have in your
survey um all right
you're how old was I let's say you're
15 survey 15-year-old kids and find out
what their interest is in a career and
finance what are the women going to say
the girls the 15-year-old girls what are
the girls going to say what are the
white boys going to say what are the
black girls and black boys going to say
what are the Asian boys and girls going
to say say would it be the same if they
had if you found out they all had equal
interest at age
15 but only white men
succeeded you got a real problem there
right I mean that's
clearly there's something going on and
you would suspect discrimination would
be the top of your
list but if you can't determine that
there's a difference in interest at age
15 then the rest of the stuff is
useless I I don't care how many actually
became Finance people I care how many
who wanted to be Finance people
succeeded because that would tell me a
lot if there were an equal let's say
ratio wise an equal pool of uh you know
black women who wanted to be Finance
professionals and white men and then
there was a big difference in outcome
I'd say you got to look at that that's
something you got to look at right it's
not the only explanation for why might
happen but you got to look at that but
if you don't know what the interest
level was at age
15 you don't know
anything and I'm really tired of people
looking for the problem at the end of
the
process if you're walking into an
employer's office and you don't get the
job that wasn't a problem that happened
this
week that's probably your whole life
like everything you did from your
preschool until the moment you walked
into that interview is what will
probably determine your success you know
it's not the only
thing but certainly I think we need to
focus on very young people's
strategies um I will tell you that
despite not growing up in a family where
anybody had killed it and made a lot of
money so I I wasn't looking at any role
models in my town there was one lawyer
who was sort of a role model because he
made money
um but my mother told me every
day I think every day it felt like I
mean not literally but she would say uh
you're going to college and then you're
going to be successful and make money
and then you're going to take care of us
in your old
age so I went to school I took it
seriously I made a bunch of money just
like she said I did exactly what she
said and then once I made a bunch of
money I bought him a a house to live in
Florida and I took care of him so from
literally from
kindergarten my mother put a program in
my head and my siblings as well she put
programs in all her heads you're going
into school you going to build some
school some skills make sure you're good
at something that was her she always
used to say that it doesn't matter what
you do she would say make sure you're
the best one at it now later in life I
came up with the B stack idea which is
a I think an improvement on that because
rather than being the best at one really
limiting skill I tell you to combine
skills until you're the best being you
in other words there's nobody has those
skills so it's a version of being the
best but it's a way to get there without
having the best talent in the world you
just combine things until you're
special so did I succeed
because um I'm a white man or did I
succeed because I was given almost at
Birth a a strategy that works for
basically
everybody wouldn't you
agree how how many of you were told from
the time you were in kindergarten you're
going to college be good as
something stay in a
jail did it work you tell me did it work
so a number of people saying yes if your
parents told you to get educated and
build a skill and stay on the jail did
it work yes of course it worked
right so yeah I I think the focusing on
what happens when you're an adult and
you can't get that job is just missing
the whole story the whole story is that
kindergarten experience
basically because I can tell you it
never changed you know there's no point
in my life where I I thought to myself
oh I guess I don't need education I
guess I don't need to be good at
something and then the my other biggest
part of my philosophy that's I think
been useful and Jordan Peterson says a
version of this as well so it's more
credible when he says it but if you're
not thinking of your future in terms of
being
useful you're not doing
anything you only get rewarded for
providing value
so if you're thinking how can I get
stuff you know out of the system like
what what's my mechanism for extracting
things from the system you're a
loser that is the loser way to think of
the system if you're thinking what value
can I
add you're a
winner now do you always get fairly
compensated for adding value no no I
wish I mean but the world doesn't work
that way if you keep keep adding value
all your life are you likely to be
recognized as a person who adds value
are you likely to get job offers because
that are you likely to attract a good
mate
yes yes you know you could make you
could not get credit for a lot of good
stuff you do but if you're just doing
useful stuff your whole life everybody
notices everybody notices and that will
make you stand out so the and and the
the be useful part wasn't exactly
something that my parents said in
words but um do you know the kids kids
raised today often don't have jobs or
even
chores have you notice
that like like a kid today would get an
allowance for just going to
school oh good for you you went to
school here's your
allowance uh do I have to work for for
oh God no you've got so much homework
you got your activities after school and
you have to have time for your friends
and stuff so no no there's no time for
that no you're not going to work that's
crazy but you know I tell people I was I
was making dinner for the family at I
know age 14 or something and we we were
always you know trained from the
youngest age to work on my uncle's Farm
to you know help around the I was mowing
the lawn shoveling the snow you know all
that stuff so nobody had to tell me to
be
useful by the time by the time I got to
college I had had an entire saturation
of there's something that needs to be
done you know what like that is so
activating to me Scott there's something
that needs to be done damn it because
I'm going to have to do it you tell me
something needs to be done and it's
important and I I can't even think about
anything else like I'm so trained to do
what's useful to other
people so be useful to other people
that's your lesson for the day and is
there any story that I should have
mentioned that I
forgot anything going on that I I missed
this
morning your husband did food shopping
for the family when he was 8 years old
in New York City yeah yep that's how it
used to
be
um kids first jobs are not paying
enough yeah there's something to that oh
yeah I forgot to talk about the
motorcade crash so Biden's motorcade I
think it was in DC right uh got uh
crashed into by a car I was in Delaware
somebody says in Delaware so a car
crashed into one of the SUVs in uh
Biden's uh big uh what do you call it
his motor cave and there there's a
picture of the there's a picture of the
driver of the car and police you the law
enforcement is standing you around the
car talking to him you should see his
face now people are prompting me to say
he's a black driver but that that's not
part of the story yeah the the driver's
ethnicity is not part of the story but
if you want to you know just picture it
in your head a little bit better imagine
the driver of the
driver he he runs into something so it's
already a Bad Day right if you crash
your car it's a bad
day and then the law enforcement people
surround your car and you realize there
were a whole bunch of people with suits
and guns cuz apparently they came after
them with guns out cuz they didn't what
if it was a threat or not so imagine you
look out you see all these well-dressed
Secret Service people and and they got
guns drawn and you're sitting in your
car and you're just a you know totally
innocent motorist um somebody said it
was a black SUV at night blocking an
intersection so maybe there was just a
visibility problem that's
possible but imagine the look at his
face when he found out what he just did
uh sir do you do you know who you just
ran into
too some kind of
SUV do you know who's in the car behind
it no the president of the United States
what the president of the United States
you just you just uh ran into his
motorcade we think you might be a
terrorist
[Laughter]
what
what so to me the funny part of that
story was I wish I could have a picture
of the face of the
driver when he found out what he had
just done because he thought it was bad
enough cuz he created an accident he's
like ah the accident's bad enough and
you're going to be in the newspaper and
you're going to be a little bit
famous woman in Texas shot a 14-year-old
boy who broke into her
home well good for
her uh all right I think that's all for
now not much happening on AI except just
keeps moving
forward um and I'm going to say is had
to fail ever coming back to audible
probably probably you can't buy it
now I thought the old Audible for had a
fail was still for sale but I'd have to
check on that um if not I'll I'll get
that done so the thing I can do now for
audiobooks
and um Amazon or let's see audible
wasn't accepting them but I think they
will I can use AI Now to create a
perfect version of me that will speak in
every
language so I can now do the Audi book
without reading it I'll just feed the
text into the machine the machine will
become me it will read it in English and
then I'll just say all right give me the
Spanish version and it will be my voice
in perfect span spish and Chinese Etc so
I can translate my book into any
language
now um but the not yet at the moment it
takes three separate AIS so it takes
three AI apps and you would have to
really know what you're doing to get to
get it to work I assume within the year
that's going to be one
app this seems like obvious direction
would be one app to create a deep fake
that can do anything you want three apps
is crazy
yeah all right so that's coming all
right that's all I got for now YouTube
thanks for joining I'll see you
tomorrow
