whoa i look overexposed here on
youtube
but over at locals it's looking good
looking good
good morning everybody
and welcome to
the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with scott adams gets
better every time you see it
very unusual because most things don't
most things you get used to them and you
say i've had some of that i don't need
anymore but when you watch this show
every single time it gets better
and all you need is a copper bug or a
glass a tanker chelsea style canteen
jugger flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day the
thing that makes your oxytocin
sing
it's called the simultaneous sip
go
richard's agreeing with me over here he
likes coffee too
i think we can bond over that
you and i
richard
we're like we're like one now
we're bonding over our love of coffee
eating hot dogs no that's just you i'm
not going to bond over eating hot dogs
i'm out i'm out all right let's let's
talk about the news
i'm going to start with a uh
news quiz
so i want to see how many of you are
paying attention to the news see if you
can answer this quiz
who is the first human being
to on a bird
normally the birds on people but
who's the who's the first human to
on a bird
first human to on a bird
i will accept as acceptable answers uh
magic johnson
magic johnson is an acceptable answer
um about elon musk
for
for cancelling the twitter deal
now
we're all looking at this and saying to
ourselves hey
although we have not been to law school
and we've never seen the actual
agreement between twitter and musk
i don't think that should stop us
from having a legal opinion do you
anybody
yeah do you think we should be limited
in our legal opinions just because we
haven't seen the agreement and we're not
lawyers
no
no
this is your first day on social media
that's not going to stop us and if you
want some medical opinions later
you come to me
i don't have any medical
experience but
i can definitely give you some opinions
because that's what we do here
well apparently the there's something in
that deal with musk and twitter that
said something like
elon musk would not do due diligence or
he waived his right to due diligence
and i hear people interpreting that as
well the joke's on you elon you asked
for more information to verify
how many bots there are in the traffic
and they didn't give you what you wanted
but hey too bad
because you signed a deal that said you
weren't going to do due diligence
to which i say
i'm no lawyer
but was that due diligence
does due diligence mean that they
twitter can make a claim that's not true
lawyers
lawyers
again i'm not a lawyer i'm just
looking at the story
can twitter
lie about the single most important part
of their business hypothetically i'm not
i'm not accusing them of anything
but can they lie
and then say well
you didn't do your due diligence
so i guess we can lie about the single
most important part of the transaction
do you think that's okay because because
elon waved his right to due diligence
now
i don't think that that's what due
diligence is all about is it
now correct me if i'm wrong
due diligence isn't about
you checking to see if they're lying is
it
isn't it about checking to see if
there's something that's been omitted
or something that hasn't been mentioned
right
am i right
yeah so you're looking for things that
nobody mentioned before it seems to me
again
not a lawyer
but do i need to be a lawyer
do i need to be a lawyer to say that
twitter can't legally lie about the
single most important part of the
transaction
and say well
you waived your right to look into it
that's not a thing is it
is that a thing
i can't believe that's a thing but i'm
watching twitter say that
that i'm you know the people on twitter
i'm watching the people on twitter
act as though he waved his right
to get the truth
i don't think you really wave that do
you
right so i'm seeing somebody say i'm
absolutely right have you seen anybody
say what i just said
i haven't seen it yet have you
did anybody say what i just said that
this has nothing to do with due
diligence
right
um
has anyone talked to jack dorsey about
this development that's a real good
question
i would be curious what he thinks
now number one
uh
first point not really because i already
made a point but uh
how many of you think that this really
means the deal is off
do you think it means the deal is off
because that's not how any of this works
you know if anybody's been involved in
real business
of course you walk away from the car
dealership when the price is too high
of course you do
do you think trump would have gone
through with this deal
let me ask you if this had been trump do
you think he would close this deal now
absolutely not
do you think um
name somebody who's a great negotiator
you know just
pick your billionaire somebody who's a
great negotiator do you think they would
close this deal
absolutely not nobody would close this
deal
cuban yeah do you think mark cuban would
close this deal
i mean
i could ask him he always has a he
always has a more interesting answer
than you know a yes or no so i don't
know what he'd say actually
but
here's what should happen
don't know if it will
but this
yeah i'm going to say this is the most
likely possibility
the most likely possibility
is that there'll be a new offer
based on the fact that they haven't
provided the information
and then you have to discount that risk
right
so if you were going to reprice twitter
you'd first take into account that the
stock price itself collapsed
right the stock price itself collapsed
so if you were going to make a new offer
you would have to make an offer that
takes into account that you don't know
if the traffic is real
so you would have to make an estimate in
your mind of how likely that is
and then say okay since i don't know if
the traffic's real i'm not going to pay
full price
but i can't pay nothing or else i'm not
going to get a deal so i'm going to pay
something ish
a little bit closer
to the stock price but maybe a little
less
actually i guess you couldn't buy it for
less than the stock price nobody would
make that deal
um should have got the shot equals
thinking past the sale all right
uh elon says 20
bots twitter says 5 they'll negotiate to
the middle
no
twitter can't do that
twitter can't negotiate the number of
bots they can't do that
they can negotiate the price
but they can't negotiate the number of
bots
now the fact that they could not provide
that information tells you they don't
have a business model
am i right
i mean that's that's the hyperbolic you
know version of it if you can't tell us
how many people are using the system and
your and your business model depends on
that number it's the single most
important number you know the amount of
traffic if you can't validate that you
even have that traffic with real people
you don't really have a business do you
it's like an artificial business like a
fake business
now it's
you know
there are enough real people that you
can say it's a real business but what
would elon be buying exactly you
wouldn't know what he was buying
so whatever the price is for that it's a
lot less than the first offer
and imagine how unhappy elon was when he
saw the price of twitter drop in half
after he'd offered billions and billions
of dollars because that was just wasted
money if he completes the transaction
that's just purely wasted money billions
and billions have just wasted money
but it's funny to make twitter begging
to be bought
so we went from elon wants to buy you
and twitter says no no no
to making twitter beg him to buy yo oh
you've got to buy us now you gotta buy
us now all right so meanwhile while this
is like the biggest story in the news
arguably
um
so yesterday i'm sitting in my garage
which doubles as my man cave
i'm just working on my laptop and i'm
sitting there in my pajamas
a little bit stoned
and
i decided to reply to one of elon musk's
tweets
and so the the one that i replied to
um was it started with elon musk saying
something about you know repopulating
the world and having lots of babies and
so that was how it began
and then nick cannon famous celebrity
nick cannon you all know him he weighed
in and he says right right there with
you my brother in other words they're
both in favor of having lots of children
and then
musk tweeted we must expand
scope and scale of consciousness for
civilization to flourish
and understand the nature of the
universe
so he wants to expand the scope and
scale of consciousness in other words
have have more humans
and have them go more places such as
space
so more people going more places would
expand the scope and scale of
consciousness
and then he went on to say in his tweet
musted consciousness resides most
strongly in humans
therefore we need more people
good stuff
so i read that and i thought huh
and i tweeted back just a reply to elon
musk i said
why is more consciousness good
clams seem happy
right
because my understanding of evolution is
that
we don't need to understand the actual
nature of anything
it just has to work
you know you you just have to
you just have to reproduce
so i was just sort of curious i said why
is more consciousness good because i've
heard elon say it a number of times
now interestingly he deleted his tweet
i don't know what that means so i'm not
going to put an opinion about why he did
it but the tweet in which he said we
must expand scope and scale of
consciousness for civilization to
flourish
and understand the nature of the
universe consciousness resides most
strongly in humans so he deleted that
after
i don't think it's because of my comment
necessarily but he deleted
um so i said why is more consciousness
good clams seem happy
and to my surprise
um
the the richest man in the galaxy as far
as we know
i think he's the richest human in the
galaxy anyway
so the richest humor human in the galaxy
galaxy who's probably also the busiest
human in the galaxy running multiple
businesses
worrying about this so he's in the top
of the headlines
and i'm sitting in my garage stoned in
my pajamas and i send him a message and
i get a response
does that just blow your mind
imagine being me
now i have an interesting life so
interesting things happen on a regular
basis
but there's something
so um i don't know i don't even know how
to explain it
it's completely mind-blowing
that i could just be sitting there in my
my little
mind my own business
garage and the richest man in the galaxy
is suddenly in a conversation with me
and it's in public
and so i'm now in a public conversation
with the richest man in the galaxy
over the nature of reality
did not see that coming
and didn't see it coming
so anyway i went on and because i'd
challenge why is consciousness even
valuable you know clam seem happy
and uh musk replied to me by saying
consciousness can understand the nature
of the universe
clams not so much
now people watching the exchange said
boom
mic drop
he gotcha
because that's what always happens on
twitter when somebody says any kind of
response there's always somebody who
comes in gotcha dude
whoa
yeah i'm reading your comments
and i'm thinking well i didn't really
feel that
so after
elon musk said consciousness can
understand the nature of the universe
clams not so much
i tweeted back
to what benefit
you know what's what's the benefit of
consciousness i said evolution never
needed us to understand reality before
and then later i thought about it
and i thought about how he said that
humans have more consciousness than a
clam
and i and i tweeted i'd call it a tie
so far
now uh do anybody yeah i got i got putin
does anybody know the uh context of why
i so confidently
um engaged with you know the richest and
arguably one of the smartest people in
the galaxy
it's because elon musk himself
i believe based on what he said
thinks we live in a simulation
which would suggest that all of our
consciousness so far has been a waste of
time
am i right
now again i don't want to put an opinion
in somebody else's head so i'm going to
be as careful as i can
but that's why i was asking the question
i'll just say that
the appearance of it
is that his main philosophy
is that consciousness has been worthless
so far
worthless because if we're really a
simulation everything we believed about
reality is wrong everything
if you if you had a religion and you
picked wrong
totally wrong
so
my understanding of his opinion which is
different than his opinion i want to be
really clear i i cannot
any time you say to yourself
let me characterize the opinion of a
genius
just know you're being an idiot at that
point you can't really characterize
the opinion of somebody smarter than you
and be confident about it because
whatever it was that made him smarter
than you is why you couldn't have had
that opinion in the first place probably
so i'm trying to be real careful about
you know assuming what he believed but
the reason i was asking the questions
and i was engaging is i saw a conflict
between thinking that consciousness is
important
and believing we're in a simulation
which would suggest that all of our
consciousness was a waste of time
or it was something
now
somebody else weighed in and made a
comment which was
amazing
which is that we know from
physics
and by the way this is something we know
if we can know anything i suppose
that you need to observe something for
it to exist or to measure it which is
similar
am i right
those of you have better science backing
than i do which is almost everybody
you have to observe it or measure it
for the wave to collapse or whatever it
is so reality doesn't become anything
but a possibility until it's observed
i see so many people saying no
really
look at the other comments though those
of you who are saying no look at the
other comments
now i'm not saying what your opinion is
i'm saying that physics opinion
like all of the well probably not all
but the main physicists
believe that reality forms because it's
observed
i can't believe how many knows i'm
saying here
seriously but i mean there are enough
yeses coming in that no people need to
have some pause right
i've got it all wrong
all right well it's according to the
copenhagen interpretation right
uh oh somebody says i'm a physicist and
now all right so i'll listen to you
i am a quantum physicist and no
there just has to be an observer
can you give me uh is there is it
possible to give me a quick counter
point to that because everything i've
ever read
said the same thing
that you have to measure it or observe
it
for the probabilities or possibilities
to collapse
observation just changes it oh
oh okay are you saying that the
observation doesn't create reality it
changes it is that is that what the
physicists are saying is that the change
you're looking for and what i'm saying
somebody said okay all right so i think
i think that may be just a language
thing that's not i don't think we're
disagreeing so let me say it in better
language all right so this will be maybe
more appropriate language
uh observation change is the thing
and so in my opinion that would be
called creating reality
if you don't want to call it that that's
fine but we're still talking about the
same thing so if you want to say it's a
change
uh i will agree with that as opposed to
creating something from nothing because
i wasn't indicating it was creating
something from nothing
but it sounded like that didn't it
so okay so we'll go with that there's
always something there
but when you observe it it changes it
and then that change becomes your actual
history
all right
so
um that was a long way to go to say that
consciousness
might be a 3d printer for reality
so we we have this assumption that
consciousness is important right
and and
it could be that that's you know why the
conversation sort of went to a dead end
kind of quickly
why is it that we think consciousness
matters
or that we should have more of it
you know there there was something in
elon musk's assumption going in
that i was testing because i didn't know
what the assumption was
still don't
but
why do we assume that consciousness is
good
it just is
and why do we assume that consciousness
is that thing that makes us special and
magic and spiritual and the most
important creatures what what if it's
just one of the things we do
why is your consciousness important but
not your eyesight
or your ability to hear or your
ability to you know do math or something
why is consciousness the one that's
that's the magic one
what if it's just another thing you do
right
so it could be that reality requires
consciousness
like a 3d printer
requires the physical form of the
printer as well as the material going
into it
it seems as if reality is
printing itself
but to the physicist's point if i can
make a terrible analogy the 3d printer
simply takes the raw materials and
transforms them into a thing
but the thing existed in a sense because
there were always the raw materials
so the the 3d printer changes his form
just as consciousness
can change the form of whatever was
there before we got there
how about that
so i see reality as some or
consciousness as nothing but
a 3d printer
it's not magic
it's not special it's not the thing we
need to maximize it's not how we got
here it's not what evolution even cares
about
it is simply a mechanical process
that we notice and because we notice it
because the nature of consciousness we
think it's important
how many times have i told you that the
thing we think is important is the thing
we think about the most
and the reason we think it's important
because we think about it the most
why do we think about it the most is it
because it's important sometimes
but not necessarily
so whatever it is that you think about
the most is going to be the most
important
now consciousness
by its nature is the thing that makes
you think about it
so if you think about your own
consciousness all the time because
you're designed that way you can't not
think about your own consciousness
wouldn't that seem like the most
important part of you
it would
you would be fooled into thinking that
your own consciousness was the most
important thing part about you
but no reason
there's no reason it's just what you
think about the most because you can't
you can't not think about it the most
so we've sort of talked ourselves into
the idea that consciousness has to fill
the universe
and tell us the nature of the world
and there's no there's no backing for
any of that there's no reason we need
more consciousness that i can come up
with you know why is it we don't have
enough i don't know
but
the trouble is if you're elon musk and
you're trying to sell the idea of going
into space
you have to talk to people
the way they can hear it
and when he says stuff like
we need to expand human consciousness
don't all of you say that sounds right
this is not your first impression
like when you hear that you go yeah yeah
we absolutely need to do that we need
lots of consciousness out there
the beauty of it is it feels right
i'm going to make another terrible
analogy
just to get you going
it's like when you asked billionaires
what was the secret to their success
what do they usually say in public in
public
what do billionaires usually say in
public
about why they were successful they say
passion do you know why they say passion
they say passion
because it sounds cool
and it sounds like something you could
do too
well if you would just follow your
passion like i followed my passion you'd
be a billionaire too maybe maybe a
little luck you could be a billionaire
too
but here's what billionaires can't tell
you
here's what they can't tell you
i'm way smarter than you i got lucky and
i had some special advantages
but you don't have any of that stuff so
good luck
billionaires can't say that
can mark zuckerberg tell you that the
reason you're successful is by any
objective measure he's way smarter than
you are
he can't say that
but that's the truth
can bill gates say the reason i built
microsoft and you didn't is because i'm
well objectively speaking i'm way
smarter than you and i worked really
hard
you can't
you can't say that you can't say it in
public so instead you say things that
sound good
to the people you're talking to i got
passion
worked hard
passion
it's all
it's
my book behind me had a failed almost
everything and still win big
has a chapter on passion being
but when i hear uh that we have to
expand uh consciousness into the space
i say that sounds great
doesn't it
sounds great
i'm all for it and i'm genuinely all for
it i absolutely
positively think that musk taking us
into space
is one of the highest priorities of
civilization
but do you know why it's the highest
priority of civilization in my opinion
because we can't help it
and we can't help it
we don't have the option of not doing it
because we're survivor designed
we're designed to survive
we're designed to take our consciousness
somewhere now we talk about it like it's
our consciousness that's an important
part but really it's just us
it's our genes it's us right it's not
the consciousness part so much
we just want more of us just like every
animal every plant you know we have this
ability to want
but it's still going to happen whether
we wanted it or not right that's just
our the way we talk about it after the
fact we're just going to do it
and the fact that elon musk had the
ability
to build a company that could take us to
the you know to the universe
he was sort of required to do it
this is something that most of you will
never understand unfortunately for you
not for me
you'll never understand the obligation
that you take on when you succeed
you'll never understand that because
until you feel it
it's just like
it's hard to imagine
and what i mean by that is before i had
you know any success to speak of i feel
like i was in a pretty selfish mode
meaning that
i wanted to acquire for my own benefit
and so i worked hard and
i acquired for my own benefit but once i
had acquired enough
just some freaky thing happened and i
thought oh crap what's happening to my
computer code in my head it's changing
and i suddenly realized that i needed
some other reason to exist because i had
what i needed and that was sort of my
purpose for existing was to you know
protect myself
and once i'd done that
i naturally felt some obligation to the
rest of the world
and so primarily the reason i do this
instead of you know 10 other things i
could do to make money in fact i could
make a lot more money if i weren't
spending my time on this a lot more
a lot more
probably 10 to 100 times more
and
but
when i do this
i feel a direct benefit to
other people
um and people tell me every day you
changed my life i read your book
everything changed you know you reframed
something you know i gave up drugs i
stopped drinking i lost 80 pounds i hear
these stories every day
now if you don't think
that's motivating
i mean that is really motivating
you would
you would give up a lot
to have that feeling you know it's
something you can't buy
except with your own with your own
suffering basically
so um yesterday this brings me to
another point
so let me just finish up on that i don't
think that elon musk had a choice
about building
spaceships to take us off the planet
because he had the ability
and he had taken care of his own needs
he didn't have a choice
you know it probably felt like it it
probably felt like decision making it
probably felt like free will
but we are designed
so that if you have the capability
to help the tribe
you practically can't help it
you're just going to be called into
service basically and that's how i feel
i feel that what i do here to the extent
that it helps people is i couldn't help
it
i i feel like i was dragged here i enjoy
it i enjoy it a lot but
i definitely don't feel like it was you
know free will they got me here
um
there's something else i was going to
say about that but i forgot do you see
that the sri lankans
they all
protested and they they
attacked i guess the president's
official residence and they occupied it
and
the president fled
um and i'm wondering how long will it
take msnbc to blame this on trump
was there something trump said
that caused this
because this sort of thing doesn't
happen on its own was trump maybe saying
something about
you should have a
peaceful demonstration
because i understand when he asks for
peaceful demonstrations it often causes
insurrections
so did he say anything about that
uh
all right
so anyway there's not much to say about
that um
there's a video of jenna ellis
one of president trump's
close advisors and attorneys and she was
talking about a wisconsin supreme court
decision today that she says finley case
invalidates
what team trump argued back in 2020 in
november that that election officials in
wisconsin had violated the state law in
the administration of the election and
only now we get a supreme court
wisconsin decision that says it was true
but you know what is left out of this
reporting so far
uh
what was that about
i don't know i saw the video something
got vindicated and validated but
if i were communicating this i would
have mentioned what it was
i would have mentioned what it was it
got vindicated and
validated and so
uh
but
wouldn't it be nice to know that it
seems like that's the first thing you
say in a story like that
if i were doing this story i would say
the wisconsin supreme court decided
today x
and x now validates and
i wouldn't i wouldn't go right to the
celebration
because it makes it look like
so
sorry
uh it could be i'm not gonna rule it out
it could be that this uh wisconsin
supreme court decision has some
some meat to it and it means something
and it revises what we understood
but i doubt it
i doubt it
so so you're saying the ballot boxes
were illegal do you think anybody cares
about that
should we care that there are illegal
ballot boxes
unless we know that
that's what the problem was
if we don't know that they caused a
problem do we care that they were
illegal
because you know in something like a
state election don't you think they
violate laws all the time
there's probably a million little things
they do wrong and it doesn't make that
much difference
all right well here's so here's my
skeptical uh take on this
um i am interested
that jenna ellis says that something
important was found
um if you say it i i'm in the comments
people are saying there's something
about ballot boxes if that's true i'd
like to hear that story
but so far i haven't heard a so what
that
would change any of my thinking
is there a so what to it
is there an assumption that a certain
number of votes would have gone a
different way
i haven't seen the so what but if you
have
um
that is a huge communication problem
i want to hear the show up first not the
celebration
so now people are speculating that china
was behind the assassination of abe
uh
shinzo
have i been saying his name backwards
the whole time
is obey his first name
i haven't said his name backwards right
the whole time
why why does everybody call him abe if
it's his first name
that feels inappropriate if you're
talking about a leader right
or or is it just because
uh
japanese say the last name first
okay got it got it
um so abbe is his last name but the way
they write it would be first somebody's
saying all right let's say that's true
apparently he spent his last days before
being murdered
defending taiwan from china
and making a big deal about how taiwan
has to be defended against china
and then he got murdered by somebody who
there's some report on social media and
this kind of sketchy that there is some
connection between the shooter and the
chinese party a communist party
but i don't think you should believe
that yet
and here's the question how many of you
think china wouldn't do this
not that they did how many think they're
capable not capable how many think that
they
they would have done it if they wanted
to
well then why would they is to make sure
that people don't talk about
uh keeping taiwan
of course of course of course
yeah the answer is yes
you know they're shipping fentanyl to
the united states you know via the
cartels
every day we know they're doing that
they don't stop
they've got
prison camps
every day
and we all know it
they don't stop it
so there doesn't seem to be a
correlation between knowing they're
doing something bad and then stopping it
so why wouldn't they kill them
because
all it would do is make it would be a
little chilling to people talking about
it right
what's it do to me
let me ask you this all right so i talk
about stuff in public
i've never really made a big deal out of
taiwan
because taiwan to me doesn't seem like a
so much a philosophical or right or
wrong question it's just a power
question
if taiwan has the power to remain free
it will
if china has the power to take it over
and decides to use it it will
at some tremendous cost
but there's not much to say about it
it's just a power play
whoever has it is going to win
so i don't i don't weigh in too much on
that because there's not much to say
about it
but suppose i did
suppose i was the kind of person who
talked in public and had some persuasion
you know i i would argue that i do have
some persuasive impact on politics might
be small
but some
how do you think that i would feel if
i'd been talking about taiwan a lot
and i saw somebody who also talked about
it a lot the same way i did just get
murdered
and maybe it was the chinese government
that did it how would i feel and would i
still talk about taiwan a lot if i had
been inclined to do that in the first
place
i don't think i would
i you know maybe i'm a special case
because
you know i'm i'm kind of done
meaning if i get if i got assassinated
tomorrow i'd be like
i had a good run do i really want to be
80
seriously
do i want to be 80
i don't know
so i don't have the same risk profile
that other others do if it's a clean
kill
that's a fine way to go
right
in fact i can't think of a better way to
go than having china assassinate me
especially if if the news got out
i don't think i could do anything better
for the country than get assassinated by
the chinese government for saying things
about them i mean that'd be a great way
to go
please
actually as a
as i think of all the ways that one
could die i can't think of a better one
can you
because that would be useful
usually dying is just dying
you know you don't usually get to like
save somebody's life you know in the act
of dying some people do
but if he had to die
being assassinated by
china
would be a pretty noble noble way to go
and it would get it give attention to
some of the things they care about
so i don't know
i'm going to say that china is capable
of doing that
and they're capable of doing it right in
front of you
you're painting a target on you well
although i don't talk about taiwan i do
talk about fentanyl and uyghurs a lot
i don't think there's any chance i'm not
on
the chinese communist party radar i mean
i do talk to their you know one of their
main trolls chen
i talk about chen he's got a twitter
account and i interact with him all the
time he's clearly one of the main
social media chinese party
people
and he denies it by the way
but twitter labels him as a state media
person
put a bounty on my own head
does scott have suicidal ideations
not really
more than anybody else
probably not
i thought you said you got chen killed a
few months ago
apparently not he
survived oh and he would be fun to
interview yeah interviewing chen would
be that would be hoot
all right so here's the good news
tell me if any that this is actually
reported most of this in the
uh in the news
so we've got the pandemic is winding
down
right and we still have lingering you
know omicron problems but i always say
that
the pandemic problem is
over
do you agree
pandemic is basically over it's down
down to the annoyance level
uh i would say and as of today
apparently the supply chain issues are
easing
so the supply chain
has already maxed out
and is improving did you know that
how many of you knew that the supply
chain problem is improving yeah the the
time it takes to ship
actually it's going down
so
adam's law of slow-moving disasters
lots of people adjusting in lots of
different ways
and we've peaked
inflation
may have peaked it's actually reversing
for a lot of key things
gas is down
wheat is down some other commodities are
down not everything
but we're seeing
some major changes in inflation so
supply chain is easing
the pandemics wound down inflation is
starting to peak a reverse
nuclear power is rising
nuclear power is is now favored gigantic
gigantic
you know variable for civilization
uh and we're absolutely decoupling from
china
right
now you say you don't see enough of it
there are not not enough companies
leaving but no companies need to leave
you just need to stop going there
and it'll take care of itself over time
that's it just stop going there stop
moving your manufacturing to china have
you heard of any major
manufacturer moving production to china
in the last two years
annie
any major manufacturer moved to china in
the last two years
i don't think so
you're saying because of the pandemic
but the pandemic in the in the first
place yes
but how about now
i don't think
i don't think anybody's moving to china
and we do see some people moving out
so
just think about this
and and also as i've said when
trump enters the picture we are seeing
reality in a whole new way are we not
and i think it's a productive way
because we now understand that the news
is completely fake
i'm not sure we knew that before before
trump
so now that we know that the news is is
completely a you know a put up job
that's a completely different view of
reality and of course the simulation is
a different view so we've got the
pandomic winding down supply chain
issues easing inflation reversing
nuclear power rising decoupling from
china one of the most important things
and and our our view of reality itself
is different
to which i say
we did it
we did it
do you remember two years ago
it just felt like we were in a deep hole
and the only thing that was coming to
save us was
and the was going down the hole and
every day was worse than every day
before and every thing was going
wrong do you remember
do you remember when we thought we would
run out of food in toilet paper we
didn't know if the pandemic would wipe
us out we thought we were maybe going
into depression china was going to
dominate us
and we'd run out of energy and climate
change would kill us
it looks like none of that's going to
happen
looks like none of that's going to
happen
and i've been i've been trying to you
know help you hold on for the last
couple years
you know try to convince you that this
is something we could work through you
know the adam's law of slow-moving
disasters
and sure enough
sure enough
humans
you know i just want to give like a
standing ovation to humans you know now
we're never done right there's always
tons of stuff to do
but i think even the uh
you know the the over correction of
wokeness is probably over
don't you think the wokeness reached a
point of obvious over correction so
that's over i think
it's reversing
i feel like almost everything is
trending positive
you just made elon's point
i'd need more about that
yeah
so
people
just take a pause it's easy to get lost
in the minutia of your day and it's easy
to get lost in the torrent of bad news
but just take a step just just for a
moment just pause
and just think about the
fact that civilization
just had
some of the worst things thrown at it
i mean these are just some of the worst
worst worst things that a civilization
could deal with
and we figured it out
we figured it out we did it
is it is anybody else on the same page
here i feel like i'm all alone in this
does anybody else feel
like
we did it
no not feeling it now i will agree that
things aren't you know where they need
to be i'm not making that claim
i'm saying that
everything that was going wrong we
stopped
we did
everything that was going wrong
it looks like we stopped
now inflation's a long way to go and you
know you're afraid of this and that and
you know food probably will be
you know a bit of an obstacle more but i
feel like we did it
i really do
i mean
you know
here's my my thing on the border
until we can resolve the question of how
do you deal with the fact that a
declining population is bad
but so is bringing in new people
we need to figure that out
right
now i get this there's not exactly the
you know same topics
and you want to bring in the most
qualified people and all that sure i i'm
with you on that
but i feel like we're not being
consistent as a
um a country
certainly the conservatives
conservatives are not consistent
conservatives know you need more people
and you're not going to get there just
by having more babies i mean you can
encourage it and that would be fine as
well
but you're going to need more people
and there's only one way to do it right
because the normal way of just having
more babies just stop working
so i'm pretty sure we need more people
and probably lots of them now that
doesn't mean our letting you know
opening the borders is good i'm just
saying that it may not be as bad as you
think
in the long run
short term yeah tons of pressure on the
system extra crying
yeah all that stuff's real
every bad thing you say about it is real
but it might be necessary it might be
like going to the dentist maybe having
more people
especially i say this all the time the
people who come here illegally
are a special kind of people
and if you don't if you don't live among
it like i do like i'm i'm just saturated
with
uh recent immigrants
um all the time you know i'm just a lot
of my day
is talking to people who were born in
another country
so what i see
now that
somebody says my servants
no
no they're they're often vendors
business owners
very successful people own restaurants
all kinds of stuff yeah very i'm not
talking about you know just
the the fellow mowing my grass and by
the way
i i just have to throw a little you
in your in your direction for saying
that
the guy who
came from god knows where
and and mows my grass
he once asked me for you know if i had
a suggestion
for where he could get a cheaper
apartment he thought maybe i had some
property or something that i could rent
i don't
but he asked me you know if i knew where
he could get cheaper and because he and
his his wife they had i guess a second
small child
and they were struggling
so i said i didn't really know where he
could do that but i asked him could he
use more business
and he said yeah you know because he
wasn't working at a capacity and if he
did work at capacity he could easily
hire new people to take on more business
so i said well how about i just get you
some new customers
and he said
okay
so you know that next door app
you know goes to all your neighbors it
turns out that everybody in my
neighborhood was looking for a new
gardener
or or just a huge number of people
wished they knew the name of somebody
who could be recommended as a good
gardener so i sent out one message
just one message
i think he got
15 clients
now that's a lot
if you're in that business
he's got two trucks he's got a crew
he's doing great
now when i tell you that the people who
come across the border are a special
kind of people
you don't know how how big a deal that
is
they are a special class of people
absolutely because they're self-selected
they're self-selected to put themselves
in an entrepreneurial
high-risk situation
and they're people who will do
anything to make it work
they will do anything they will chew
through concrete
to make this damn thing work
i want more of them not fewer than i
want more of them you give me them all
day long
it's a wonderful community
and
and far and away and by the way this is
this would be locally so where i live so
this doesn't apply to where you live
this is only where i live right it's a
higher end neighborhood
but the reputation of the you know
hispanic and
recent immigrants is way better than the
reputation of the people born here
do you know that
now i don't know if that's a surprise to
you but do you know
in northern california where i am so we
don't have as much of the border related
crime and stuff so we have a little bit
of an advantage of distance
but where we are
it is a well-known fact
that the hispanic working community is
the lowest crime most honest most
hard-working community
period
period
now
you know as soon as i said that i
thought okay you can think of some other
communities that you would put in that
category and i'll give you that so so i
don't want to say the best of all but
they're among the best
they would be in the the top category
you know if you were going to rank
groups of people which you should never
do
don't do that don't rank people
but if you did they would be you know
top 20
with you know whoever whoever you think
is awesome
legally and illegally yes yeah now i'm
not
blind to the fact that we should have
only legal immigrants i'm very strongly
in favor of only legal immigrants we
just don't have a system to do that
so i'd like to have a system to do that
so i'm not praising any illegality i'm
just saying if you think it's all bad
it might be just a matter where you live
if you live where i did it just all
looks good
i'm being asked
scott can you talk about race versus iq
do you think i should uh get on that
third rail
there's somebody trying to get me
cancelled here should i talk about race
and iq and just get canceled forever
i'm gonna talk about it anyway
because i i have a philosophy that you
can talk about anything if you don't do
obvious mistakes
right
so here it goes
let's say there's a big difference
i don't i don't know but let's say there
is
what are you going to do with it
that that's my opinion right there
let's say there is a difference
i don't know if there is
what are you going to do with it
nothing nothing
it might be interesting
there's just nothing you can do with it
so are you going to say to yourself
oh i don't know much about this
job candidate so i'll just i'll just be
bigoted against this person because you
know i think they're in some group
is that good for you
would it be good for you as an employer
to discriminate against somebody because
they happen to be in a group that you
believe
has some kind of like general
disadvantage that's not good for you
why would you do something that's bad
for you
what's good for you as an employer is to
really dig in and find out if this is
the right person
so
it doesn't help you in an individual
decision does it if you can marry
somebody or fall in love or date
do you care
that people who share something in
common with them
have some other
issue that doesn't matter to you because
it doesn't matter to your situation
so
so so what if it's true
does it matter now here here's a point i
like to make this really gonna
it's really gonna you up
let's say you're uh you're a
white racist
you're a white supremacist
um and you say to yourself but
uh white people have been inventing all
the good stuff
therefore
we should only let white people in the
country
because white people invented all the
good stuff
right that's the white supremacist might
say that
here's what i say what the did you
invent
white guy
white supremacist what did you invent
tell me i need more of you
why do i need more of you
i don't need more of you
i definitely need more smart people
but i don't need you
you didn't do anything for me except
cause trouble
so as soon as you start taking credit
for the accomplishments of complete
strangers who just share some genetic
commonality which has nothing to do with
you or your work or your smarts or
anything
you're in such irrational territory
that
you know i can't help you
now suppose you wanted to use iq as a
decision-making thing
well why don't you do it the smart way
socioeconomic class
if you forgot about everybody's you know
color and gender and all that and you
just said all right did you
have enough family resources to get into
a good school
and if the answer is yes
probably everybody's about the same
probably everybody who went to a certain
school and got a certain
uh grade point average pretty similar
right
so
as soon as you started thinking that way
so there's a little bit of uh making me
think past the sale which is what made
me bristle
when somebody said on here obviously
somebody's got a
it's a topic for them when somebody said
talk about race and iq
i feel as if you were trying to make me
think past the sale
what's the sale
the sale is that that would be useful
right
why why would you ask the question
unless you thought the answer was useful
and i don't buy the answer i don't buy
the answer that that would be useful
in fact i think it would be opposite of
useful
as long as you can look at individuals
that will always be more useful
it will never be useful to know that
they belong to a group that has some
kind of average now
now some of you are saying but scott
if we could blame all the problems of a
group
on low iq
then we can we don't have to work on it
anymore
we can just say it's your own damn
problem not my problem right
oh well it must be the iq
but
how does that help
wouldn't it make more sense to just
have policies that help everybody who's
in a tough spot
like it wouldn't change what you do
would it
you'd still want policies that would
help everybody of every color and gender
who's in a tough spot because that's
good for everybody
right i don't want to live in a country
where if i walk out my my rich
rich guy door
like everybody's killing each other and
raping and
living in misery
that's not going to make me happy so i
want the poor people to do well
i can't have a good life without that
um
all right
did you buy that
do you buy that
do you belie do you buy my framing that
even if you knew the answer to that it
would be it would be counterproductive
it would be the opposite of useful
some of you do not
okay
um one of my favorite topics is uh drunk
hunter biden
uh apparently his laptop from hell just
keeps providing i don't know why it's
taking so long for all this laptop stuff
to come out like how many how much data
did he have on that thing
but now we have some messages that uh
probably when he was drinking and
probably related to his family wanting
to get him into rehab
and he wasn't liking that at all
and while we do have evidence that
hunter biden refers to his father
as the big guy
the so-called big guy
we also know that he had a
sort of a clever little name for his uh
his stepmom uh jill
and so where joe biden his father was
the big guy
um he would refer to his stepmom as a
jill the entitled
now
to me
that uh is inappropriate
[Laughter]
it's the same name you have for okay
now um
i'm probably gonna get uh you know
demonetized or something for using the
word but it's probably the word is in
the news do you remember do you remember
when uh bill clinton and monica lewinsky
did their thing
and uh the the thing i loved best about
that era
is it made
a word you could say on television
you know you could just be in the news
and say yeah and uh
and he got a blow job in the white house
i'm thinking
i feel like this is a big step forward
for civilization
we can finally
say blow jobs in public but maybe hunter
biden has done that for the c word
too early to say too early to say i hate
that word actually
yeah dw is saying the same thing i'm a
guy
and i hate that word does anybody else
have the same
like i hate it but privately i use it in
joke form all the time so
let me do full disclosure
i hate it in public
i hate it in public
i love it in private
are you okay with that like joke wise if
i'm with somebody who also is on the
same wavelength i love it in private
publicly i don't want to hear the word
yeah i don't want to hear it
it's an ugly word i don't know just it
doesn't sound good
it's got bad letters in it
all right
um did you see the so on the same day
apparently joe biden read on the
teleprompter
the notes to himself
read last sentence again
and he got to the last sentence and he
said read last sentence again and when
he realized what he'd done he tried to
sell it as like he meant it or something
and it was very embarrassing
and then we get to
vice president harris who is in
also being accused of word salad
so here's here's lee
here's what she said when talking to
somebody in an interview
she said no that's
no that's right and that's why i do
believe that we're living sadly in real
unsettled times
and i'm thinking everything she says
has no real meaning does it
we're living in unsettled times
compared to
compared to
those times when everything was settled
do you remember that time can somebody
give me a date for that
what was the year everything was settled
until now
i mean the things she says not only are
generic
they're not even true
it'd be one thing to say generic things
but to say something generic that's you
know clearly meaningless as well
yes it's unsettled times look at all
that unsoldness
but here's the thing
although joe biden does
a mistake now and then
are you not glad that finally
we have a president
that the other world leaders do not
laugh about behind his back
well that's true right
i i can't believe anybody would say
anything bad about joe biden behind his
back
now
have we gotten to the point where
everybody can say
that biden was a mistake
i don't think we are i think i think if
you talk to democrats especially you
know if anybody was watching
they'd say yeah we got what we wanted
because at least he wasn't trump
but here's where i say yeah oh you're
ahead of me james
really
yeah that's the only thing you do yeah
you know um i'll give you that uh joe
biden is not performing as well as we'd
hoped
especially the progressives uh hoped for
more but you know overall i'd say we did
a pretty good job and and uh he's not
trump so yeah i'm pretty happy that we
got joe biden
really
really
really
all right
um
so you probably already heard this story
but the border patrol agents who are
accused of whipping the migrants coming
across turns out they weren't doing
anything like that 100 false
there was no whipping whatsoever
but because the democrats leadership are
uh
 awful people
um certainly not american in any sense
that i would like to enjoy that term
and are hunting uh republicans
this is more of the hunting republicans
they decided that even though the
charges against these border patrol
people were just trying to do their job
and
protect the country that even though the
charges against them were 100 false
100 false and nobody disagrees
right there's nobody who says yes they
were really true after all nobody
disagrees the charges were 100 false so
what did they do
release them and apologize
finally
i'm glad we live in a country where you
can just drop all the accusations and
the charges
say you're sorry apologize and let these
people get back to work
oh no that didn't happen
no that didn't happen
now instead they decided to these
guys by coming up with some more
 to charge him with bad language
and threats of force do you know what
bad language and threats of force are
called if you're a border patrol person
trying to stop people literally trying
to come across the border right there in
front of you do you know what it's
called when you use
a threat of force and derogatory
language it's called doing your
job that we paid you to do thank you
very much and for the biden
administration to decide that they're
going to make examples of these people
because the biden administration was
wrong
they are being punished for biden's
 mistake
you're punishing people who are less
powerful than you for your mistake
you're doing it right in front of the
 public
and getting away with it
and getting away with it
our outrage is just broken
it seems to me there would have been a
time when we would have been
collectively outraged about this enough
that something would happen but now
we're outraged about so many things
that we're just blinded to outreach i
mean i'm not going to work on it after
today
i'm really i'm really upset by this
i think this is a clear injustice it's
clearly not what it means to be an
american
that's my problem with it forget about
the law
forget about the politics
forget about all the
the drama the who said what who said
what forget about all of that
these border patrol agents
are americans
doing an american thing
for americans
to protect americans
and if you're attacking them i'm not too
happy about that
because you're not on my side because
you know who's on my side the border
agents
the border agents are on my side so if
you're against them i'm not on your side
anymore
so if you want a insurrection
just attack americans just keep it up
if you keep attacking american citizens
for no reason then we're gonna
have an insurrection
and this time we're not gonna leave the
weapons home
let me put it out there if you keep
attacking american citizens right in
front of us right in front of us you're
not even hiding it we're gonna
bring the weapons next time
now we're not anywhere close to that and
i don't recommend it don't do anything
violent
but
this is not cool
this is the stuff
that creates violence
if you if you accuse somebody of a crime
and you're wrong and then you and then
you find a reason to
prosecute them anyway
right in front of us
right in front of us
do you feel insulted that they're doing
it right in front of you because they
don't respect you the biden
administration does not respect you
because they're doing it right in front
of you they don't think you have any
power they don't think your opinion is
going to matter they don't think it's
going to affect them
 him
yeah him
uh but don't don't do anything violent
i'm just saying that this is the sort of
thing that can lead to something violent
so the biden administration doesn't want
that neither do i
so nobody do anything violent
all right
um and if i never see you again that's
that's probably why
so
how many of you are aware of the little
dust up i had with the internet
in the world talking about the options
that anybody would have for a troubled
team a male team in particular
and i said basically there's no options
there's nothing you can do
that's the short version of it
a lot of people pushed back and said
that you know good parenting would make
the difference etc but the la times
interestingly and by the way the la
times is a client newspaper they run
billboard so i have a client
relationship with them
but
they typically have been a little bit
derogatory toward me
so they've run some articles that were
less than flattering let's say in the
past
but this one actually
um
although they showed both sides and you
know i don't like the other side of it
but they showed both sides that's all i
ask so that's i'm good with that
and i think that they actually
did what i needed done
did what i needed done
now if you've watched me operate for the
last several years
you know that i do pick topics that i
think i can influence
and then i try to you know for the good
and i think this is a topic that i that
i really really felt i needed to
influence because i had some special
knowledge about it unfortunately
as too important
and it is if we can't if we can't lose
the myth
of parenting
being the
you know the thing that fixes everything
if we can't lose that myth we'll never
fix anything
and so i've said that you have to think
about your reality very differently to
get solutions now
you have to think of reality differently
and our reality is that free will has
always been an illusion
it's an illusion
your genetic makeup plus whatever forces
you know you experience are just going
to cause you to do what you do
and the the to imagine the superstition
that a little bit of extra parenting
technique would make the difference
you have to lose that illusion and we
can't do anything
and the la times helped me promote that
idea by talking about the story and some
other publications i think yahoo news
and some others and
um sam harris agrees she said
i imagine you would by the way
everybody's smart degrees
this is one of those topics where a
hundred percent of the people above a
certain level of education agree with me
and it's education not intelligence in
this case it's a you'd have to have a
certain exposure to a certain kind of
material so just being smart wouldn't
get you there
all right
so i would say that i had a really good
week
now i've talked about this before i'm uh
i feel like i could be a valuable asset
to civilization mostly america
by being able to take risks that other
people can't take
you know i i can go into the radioactive
place and you know turn off the the
reactor because i don't care about the
radioactivity but you might
you know i've reached a certain level
and i've got fu money so i can just do
some things so i knew that this was
going to be uh
like bruising i knew that when i entered
this argument about you know genetics
versus parenting i knew i was going to
get chewed up
you knew that too right i mean it wasn't
a surprise
but i thought i needed to get chewed up
on this one because the process of
getting chewed up is what attracts your
attention
if people were not chewing me up you
wouldn't have noticed it would just
would have been an opinion they were
coming and gone
but it was the fight
that brought the energy
and i think i've told you i'm an energy
monster
so
in the process of my critics trying to
you know demolish me
they brought me energy instead
and when they brought me all the energy
to try to destroy me
it became a news item
exactly as i hoped it would
and then when it became a news item
the news showed my opinion and you know
it
got much more play
and so i had a really good day
persuasion-wise or a week
so it was all trouble but it's trouble i
can handle it's not nothing outside my
my comfort zone
all right
that ladies and gentlemen
is probably everything i wanted to talk
about
yes yes it is yes it is
um
all right so there's some people
let me let me get to this point
i don't know what it was about the
parenting question that turned people
into binaries
but the binaries you can't have an
argument with
and the binary would be
parenting is all the difference
or parenting doesn't make any difference
is there anybody who thinks that my
opinion is that parenting doesn't make
any difference
because you think i actually said that
right
no i did not
no
uh i didn't say it clearly enough but
let me say it clearly now
depending on the person
right
so if you if you looked at all the the
young men
i'd say
you know just for conversation half of
those young men are going to turn out
fine
it's some percentage i'm just saying
half let's say half of the young men
were going to turn out fine
should they get better parenting
the ones that were going to turn out
fired no matter what should they
get the benefit of better parenting and
would that make them even better
yes of course yes do you think i
disagree with that that if you gave good
parenting to kids who probably were
going to be fine that they'd be even
better they might have
some more character they might you know
learn some things they might
all kinds of things all right so that's
the good kids but we're not talking
about those right
now let's look at the bad kids
within the range of what i'll call the
bad kids the ones who might become
shooters
at the farthest range there's the mass
shooters
but then at the beginning of that range
are the people who
may have some bad behaviors maybe not
they're sort of in that gray area what
do you think is my opinion
of whether you should put lots of good
parenting
and that would make a difference for the
gray area the the ones that are sort of
on the bubble do you think that i think
that helps
yes of course
yeah yeah i do
now i don't think it helps every time i
don't think everybody can do it but of
course
these are your kids do you think that i
disagree you should start that you
should try to help your kids all right
now let's get to the hardest core
let's get to the ones that in my opinion
nothing can help
in my opinion nothing can help should
you
not try to use every bit of parenting
you can to help anyway
what do you think is my opinion
is my opinion that you should ignore
them
or put resources into helping them now
remember i'm talking about the ones that
can't be helped
they can't be helped
but do you think i think you should try
as hard as you can anyway
yes
yes
do you know why
why do i think you should try as hard as
you can
when the kids can't be helped
why do you think i say that
see here's your problem you think that
because i say they can't be helped then
you shouldn't try nope not even close
you should try like hell you should try
harder you should try twice as hard
do you know why
he's your kid
[Laughter]
did i need to explain that to you
it's your kid
of course you're going to fight for them
of course
even if you think it's doomed
you're not going to stop do you think i
would talk you out of that
now here's the main reason
you're not so smart
you're not so smart that you know who's
doomed
right
if you could know who was doomed i
actually would say well
might as well not not waste your time
but you don't know
there are plenty of examples of people
who looked doomed and made it out
i i think of my friend bob
and i wonder if he's watching because i
know i know
i have a high school friend school
friend actually from kindergarten
through
high school
his name was bob
and bob
had a tough upbringing you know no
father
and bob got into every trouble you could
get into
i don't even have to list it if you can
think of it
bob probably did it
now bob was also muscular he was bigger
than most of us
and
he was a bit of a bully sometimes
because he was big and muscular and came
from a bad home and that i was i was
good friends with him or i'd like to
think i was
and he didn't bully me
yeah we were just friends
i would have i would have predicted he
would have had the worst outcome
of the people i grew up with
because he had every disadvantage he
just had them all
he really he had every disadvantage
but
bob was smart
and bob
didn't give up
for anything
for anything he just had that character
he was born with it right
he just didn't give up and he was pretty
smart
bob
took his absolutely nothing starting
place like no advantages whatsoever
and joined the marines
joined the marines
he lived yeah that's the good news he
didn't go anywhere they got him killed
they trained him in it and he became a
technical manager
and then took those skills into the
private sector
huge success
huge success
now here's the thing
would you have known would you have
known when bob was 16
and it looked like nothing was going to
happen except jail for bob
jail
bob was heading to jail basically and
bob was heading to drug addiction
something
but it didn't happen
it didn't happen
literally the opposite happened
and how many of you have heard stories
just like that
somebody says bob was white
yeah and that's a factor
but you've heard this right you've all
heard these stories the person who is
doomed and somehow made it out
so as long as there are people who can
make it out and it's your kid yeah
maximum effort all the time
maximum effort for those who are doomed
maximum effort for those who might be
doomed and maximum effort for those who
are just fine the way they are
maximum effort all the time
if you heard me say you should just pull
yourself out and watch them die
that's the opposite of what i'm saying
i'm just saying that if you don't
understand
that there's a class of young men who
can't be helped
you're really going to be
disadvantaged in trying to make a
difference right
you just have to understand what you're
dealing with and the big shift that i
would offer to the world is what i'll
call the the hypnotist shift and by the
way we're we're heading toward it since
2015 when i warned you that trump would
change how we see reality itself
i can see this coming
and we're not going to get to the golden
age until we accept it
and it goes
well
it goes like this basically you can't
change genetics it's primarily what is
driving us and instead of thinking that
uh 80
is you know our let's say parenting and
our free will and
all that stuff is more like 10 or 20 or
maybe even zero
we're actually irrational creatures who
rationalize after the fact once you
realize that
you might be able to
make it out
um
why ex what
maximum effort isn't magic that's true
uh scott do you believe that
psychedelics could be the cure for the
fentanyl crisis
cure is a strong word
but it could make a big big dent in it
now
fentanyl tends to be hidden in
a lot of other products
so we're not we're not just talking
about taking straight fentanyl which
some people do
uh
you're talking about addiction in
general and so psychedelics for for
addiction
does have lots of problems
don says scott loves drugs who doesn't
dog
who doesn't
do you drink coffee
do you try to eat right because it makes
you feel better
do you take an ass
do you take an advil if you get a
headache
you know i as i've often said
we like to think that you know the the
people who are winners in life are the
ones who stayed away from drugs
the losers in life are the ones who got
addicted
it isn't that clean
here's the way i see it because i live
near silicon valley you see a whole
different look
the people who made it
are on drugs
the people who failed are on drugs
the difference is which drug
that's it
the difference is which drugs there's
there's no such thing as the people not
on drugs
it's just not even a thing
i don't even know
you you might know two or three people
not on drugs
right
probably not
they're they're at least drinking on the
weekends or smoking or they're taking
nicotine
they're managing their sugar
everybody's drugging themselves you can
either do it poorly or well
and that's it those are your two choices
you can drug yourself poorly
or you can drug yourself well
you know the the biggest secret of
civilization is how many accomplishments
happened under the uh
unto the influence
specifically of speed or meth or
adderall
or anything that you know gives you a
lift
if you knew how much of civilization was
built on the back of drugs
you would be shocked
if you knew how many inventions
happened because somebody got really
high and it came to them
you would be shocked if you know how
much
how many ideas that i've come up with
that actually have moved the needle
actually changed things if you knew how
many of them were under the influence of
marijuana
you would be shocked
you would be shocked
you see those books behind you
that's all marijuana driven
and some people would say the one in the
middle
uh not the one in the middle actually
the one on the end
a lot of people would say it's the most
influential book written in the last 20
years
and and without marijuana it probably
wouldn't have happened
in fact i wrote every page of that when
i was high
so ideas such as systems versus goals
and talent stacks
and uh passion being
these were transformational ideas these
are ideas which embedded themselves in
the
into the you know the thinking of pretty
much all business people at this point
and
that all happened
because i wasn't thinking in my normal
way
all right
best substance for cognitive
augmentation
well i haven't tried them all and i
don't want to recommend
i don't want to recommend a drug i guess
so i'm not going to answer that
i don't think that you should listen to
me
about any kind of drug
um yeah liquor is probably the one that
has the least utility but it has some
social and sales utility
yeah i wouldn't do ambient
um
somebody says tom cruise is on a heavy
dose of performance enhancing hypnosis
do you think that tom cruise is not on
adderall
what do you think
he acts like somebody who's either has
the most amazing natural
biology
or or he's got a little extra going on
there you know
i mean it looks like it
so
if you were to take you know randomly
pick 10 people who seem high energy and
really high productivity and operating
at the highest level if you just pick 10
of those people randomly say okay
there's 10 famous
famous people who did really well so
i'll pick you know this billionaire that
entrepreneur you got your 10 and then
i'll take your 10 whoever they are
and then i'll see how many of them are
under adderall
what do you think it's going to be
n of 10
what would you guess
and if 10 highly successful people that
you picked yourself just randomly how
many of them do you think are on
adderall
probably eight
yeah i don't know i mean i don't know
the answer but it's not zero
yeah it
it could be eight
like if it turned down it was three i
wouldn't be super surprised but
i feel like it's eight
i feel like it's eight
and again i don't recommend it because i
think the downside's
and it's hard to get and it's controlled
drug and there's every reason in the
world not to do it but when you do it
it does make a difference
no doubt about it
how do you get it it's hard
somebody says russell brand must be
obviously
yeah when i watch russell brand do you
have the same feeling
um
it's like watching
like a tightrope walker
because he speaks so quickly
that you're positive he's going to have
to stop to think of the next word as you
see be often do a pause to think of the
word he never pauses to think of the
right word
and then the words that come out are
better than anything you've ever written
it's like okay you're just talking off
the top of your head and i just heard a
beautiful sentence
wait there's another one oh there's
another one oh there's another one and
he can just do
beautiful sentence after beautiful
sentence with high vocabulary and keep
it coming
i'm not going to say that he's on drugs
but i don't know anybody who could do
that without them
that's all
right
there have to be people who who can do
this naturally i would think
but i don't personally know anybody who
could do that
without an enhancement
right
i'm hearing saying somebody's saying
he's sober
if you're sober you can still be on
adderall
it's doctor prescribed now i'm not
saying he is all right so let me be
really careful
i'm a big fan of his and he seems to be
a brilliant person so then maybe that's
the whole story
i'm just saying forget about him for a
second he it's probably the whole story
he's probably just brilliant and that's
all there is but
other people i've seen
i've never seen an other person who
could do that sort of thing without an
enhancement
all right that's all for now no i'm not
an adderall i wish i were
i'll tell you my brief experience
with an adderall like drug in college
and uh if i could feel like that all the
time
yeah i'd do it but the downside is too
big
all right so don't do it don't do drugs
and that's all for now
see you later
