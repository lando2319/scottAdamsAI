good morning everybody
all of you youtubers i've already been
talking to the
people on locals and man
are you in for a good coffee with scott
adams today
one of the very best i dare say and i
haven't even done it yet
that's how confident i am that this will
be terrific
and the only thing that could make it
better really the only thing i can think
of
nothing else could make this better
except a copper bug or a glass a tanker
gels or stein a canteen jug or flask a
vessel of any kind
which you would probably fill with your
favorite liquid
if you're thinking ahead i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
makes everything better it's called
the simultaneous zip but it's going to
happen now go
oh so good
now let's talk about some of the news
uh rasmussen to the poll and ask likely
voters
ask the likely voters
who deserves more credit for the covet
19 vaccinations
surprisingly it did not
go the way that you would think it would
go
because wouldn't you expect that that
question would go purely
along political lines who did better on
the covet
vaccination trump or biden you'd expect
that to be on straight party lines
wouldn't you
you know any biden versus trump question
but no
trump got 51 percent uh
as should get more credit and biden only
41
which is pretty substantial pretty
substantial
but here's uh the interesting part about
this
in the age age group of 40 to 64
and what makes the age group of 40 to 64
interesting what's interesting about
them is that they're the experienced
workers people who have experienced
in life are between 40 and 64 and
they've just got a little bit more
vision about what you know how things
work
and i think that that group had 58 said
trump
so the people who have the most
experience in life
you know before they become senior
citizens uh
58 of them gave more credit to trump
now here's why compare these two tasks
rolling out vaccinations so that
everybody gets it and everybody is
informed
and it's paid for so that's a big
logistics
issue right how do you get all these
vaccinations to different places etc
so that's that's what biden is mostly
doing then compare that
to getting government institutions
to operate four years faster than normal
right these are not equal tasks
the task of actually getting the
vaccinations out to everybody
probably was just a budget question
because i don't think the president was
personally coordinating the trucks
you've got to get storage do you have
enough storage for these trucks
no no all that stuff the states were
coordinating it
you know it was driven down to the
lowest presumably driven down to the
lowest operators
the other people who knew where the
trucks were where where is my
refrigeration
how do i get it there so i think the
biden stuff
would have looked the same under every
president
would you agree with that that the the
biden's contribution
to the vaccination rollout which is
impressive
you know i give him uh i give him an a
rolling it out but i think any president
would have gotten an
a because the president doesn't even do
the work they just say
roll it out and then stuff happens but
how hard was it for trump
to get all of these institutions to
operate faster
that was bordering on magic but and i'm
surprised that
there are so many people in the public
who notice it but the real tell
is that the working age people the
people with the most
experience they recognize that what
trump did is far more of an
accomplishment than
what biden did even though but what
biden will do is more energy because you
know the rollout
is a bigger deal than anything but uh
yeah i think trump properly gets more
credit for that
um i saw a tweet which i agree with
from ian martizus
who says and i quote due to the relic
relatively rapid emergence of uh
kovid variance i'm just summarizing here
so because there are so many variants
popping up all people will eventually be
infected by the virus
do you agree with that now that we know
that being vaccinated
won't stop you from getting the virus it
just reduces the symptoms
would you say it's true given that we're
now in our second
season and this virus is not burning out
it's actually getting stronger
i hate to say it but it's getting
stronger
remember even the spanish flu burned out
in a year
or did it take two i can't remember the
spanish flu
but i don't feel like this thing's
burning out
it feels permanent which also suggests
it's engineered of course
but it feels like it's here to stay
so when you make your decisions about
how to
how to handle your your life from here
on in
do you assume you'll get it or assume
that you won't
because i i agree with this i think
basically almost everybody's going to
get it
maybe 85 something like that
so let's say uh let's say you're going
to
make your decisions here is your
persuasion tip if you're the government
you ready for this you're going to
you're going to like this one
there's somebody who says that they they
turn off the live stream
when i tease you about how good
something's gonna be before i say it
but i do it anyway um
if i were going to advise the government
how to get people
vaccinated i would say this
probably if you have comorbidities
you've already gotten vaccinated
probably
right the people with comorbidities are
far more vaccinated because it just
makes sense
their risk is different than everybody
else's but how do you get
how do you get somebody vaccinated who's
under 40 and healthy
that's the problem right because if you
say to somebody who's under 40
and healthy hey get vaccinated they'll
usually say
well tell me what's the risk of the
vaccination itself
which is nonzero there's a risk and
what's the risk of
dying from covet and they're going to
say
i don't know but the risk of covet is
vanishingly small but i don't know
enough about this vaccination
so you know everybody's guessing
because you don't really know the odds
of anything
but a reasonable person could say
all weighted down would you agree
would all of you agree that a reasonable
healthy young person
could make a reasonable decision
if the only thing they're looking at is
the risk of death
it would be reasonable not to take the
vaccination
do i get banned for saying that but hold
on don't ban me yet
there's a punch line coming don't ban me
don't ban me
i'm going to say something state
approved in a moment here and redeem
myself
it goes like this suppose they changed
the branding
for what the vaccine is because right
now you think of it as a thing that
keeps you alive right
right if if the only thing the virus did
was make you pretty sick
you wouldn't be that worried about it
you'd get plenty sick you'd get over it
it would be just like when i was a kid
we would just get chickenpox and just
get over it
but suppose you changed the branding for
people under 40
and you called the vaccination wait for
it
wait for it the treatment for
or the prevention for a long haul
covered
and you don't even talk about the risk
of death
you know why because if you're under 40
you think your risk of death is so small
that you don't even put it in your
decision
but if you're trying to persuade people
to get vaccinated
if they're healthy and say under 40 just
to pick a number
i would say hey would you like the
the vaccination to prevent long-haul
covet
now they might say come on how how
likely is it that i'll get long-haul
covered
well what are the chances so i looked
that up before i got on here there's at
least one study that says you have a 25
chance of long-haul covet
now go back to the prior tweet remember
ian martizus is telling us
in his view this is just an opinion kind
of speculative
that we'll all get infected suppose
that's true
i think it's a reasonable i don't know
what the odds are that everybody will
get infected but
it looks like it i mean if i had to
guess i'd say 85
will be infected eventually but i don't
know that for sure
however it's reasonable now suppose you
had
nearly 100 chance or 85 chance let's say
of getting infected and a 25
chance of long-haul problems
would you take a vaccine that was only
to
prevent the long-haul problems and
that's all they sold it to you for
it's like hey if you're over 40 we've
got a vaccination that will keep you
from dying
because that's what you care about if
you're under 40 and you're healthy no
co-morbidities we've got this vaccine
that will
prevent you from getting long-haul covet
it's different right because every time
i argue
if not argue but anytime i talk with
somebody who's anti-vaccine
they only talk about the risk of death
so don't talk about that talk about
long-haul
do you want the long-haul vaccine
vaccine or not
that's what it is because honestly the
risk of death from either the
vaccination itself
or from covet is so low
stop talking about it it just doesn't
matter anymore
to decision making it definitely matters
if you die
you know if your family member happens
to be one of the few people who die yeah
that matters of course
that's tragic but it doesn't matter to
you and i for our decision making the
risk is too small
you don't make a decision when you've
got to get bred that you're going to die
but you might
right you're going to go to buy a loaf
of bread you might die
but you don't encount you don't put it
in your decision-making because it's too
small
now here's another percentage that i
don't know the answer to let's say it's
true
that 25 of people who get coveted get
some
long-haul symptoms they seem to be
along the lines of inflammation don't
they
is everything that covet long haul does
to you
is it all under the umbrella of
inflammation
like inflamed organs and inflamed brain
and here's my question what do we know
about the
permanent the risk of permanent danger
could we say that maybe four percent
i'm i'm just making this number up right
could you say that four percent of all
the people who get
long-haul or maybe just four percent of
the people who
get coveted could get some kind of
permanent
restructuring of their organs that might
not be
optimal i don't know i don't know
but i'll tell you if it is that high i'd
want to know about it all right changing
the topic
the founder of the 1619 project you
probably all know her
nicole hannah jones so she's getting
criticized because at some point
she had been asked in an interview what
was the most
i guess equal country the country where
there was the least racism i believe was
the context
and she answered that it might be cuba
and noted that cuba does very well in
having a variety of
black and brown and white people and
seems to handle that
diversity better than other countries
now as you might expect
people said you know that comes with a
big dose of socialism that comes with a
big dose of you don't have any food
so there's a downside but are they
related
are they related is it the socialism
that's somehow causing them to have a
good result
why would socialism cause you to have a
better result integrating people
is it because there would be no rich
people
yeah everybody's equal because you're in
poverty right
i feel like that's what's going on
that the way you get equality is by
destroying the economy so that you don't
have rich people
yeah so she's getting criticized for
that
maybe quite reasonably but here's my
question
hold in your mind an image of
nicole hannah jones the founder of the
1619 project
and if there's somebody on locals who
wants to paste in a photo
for the rest of you that would help now
i'm not going to show it to you here
because
then it gets taken out of context and
blah blah blah
and i don't believe in making fun of
people's appearances
as a general rule but
if somebody makes a fashion choice
i think you can comment on that right
so if somebody just is not attractive i
don't think that's
you know that's not reasonable to bring
up in public
no reason for it but suppose somebody
consciously chooses a look
to present a present something let's say
hillary clinton would wear her pant
suits
which i think was actually a pretty good
choice to make her look you know
professional etc
could i could i comment on hillary
hillary clinton's pant suit
i think yes i think yes could i comment
on donald trump's
haircut i say yes because that's a
choice
right he wasn't born with a haircut it's
a choice
likewise uh project 1619 founder nicole
hannah jones
has made a fashion choice to have okay
on locals we're seeing a picture of her
to have red hair dyed red hair that
sort of tufts out in two directions so
rather than being let's say fully
rounded like
say the head of a mushroom it's more
distributed toward two directions
is it just me or do you see bozo the
clown
now find a picture of bozo the clown
and again i'm not trying to be unkind
we're talking about persuasion
i'm talking about somebody who is a
public figure who makes conscious
decisions about her appearance
who has decided to go with a look
which to my mind suggests
bozo the clown like that's the first
thing i think of
and i'm not i'm not trying to be unkind
we're talking about the
topic of persuasion right if you're
trying to persuade somebody on a
deadly serious topic racism
right slavery like deadly literally
deadly serious topics
do you want to pick a look that reminds
people of bozo the clown
no no don't do that
so that would be a persuasion fail if
anybody looks at your look and says to
themselves
i think i'm being reminded of something
it's either
bozo the cat clown or a rat
i hear a piano being played
at 7 17 in the morning that's weird okay
i don't know what that's all about
one of the things about being me is i
never know who's living in my house at
any moment
but apparently there's more than one
piano player um
so here's my other comment about hannah
nicole
jones no nicole hannah jones she's got
one of those names that you can put in
any order
let's call her nicole hannah jones and
if if you have a look that looks like
bozo the clown
it makes it seem as though you don't
have any friends who can be honest with
you
doesn't it feel like that's true i some
somebody in the comments says you're
like larry david
true so for quite a number of years
people have said to me
you remind me of somebody it's often
larry david
so i accept that i accept that now
there's not much i can do about it
like right i don't have much to work
with here but uh it certainly would be
worth noting if
it was some choice i made all right
um here's something i learned about
epstein's
death in jail uh i guess there's a new
book coming out
by let's see investigative reporter
julie brown called the jeffrey epstein
story
perversion of justice the jeffrey
epstein story is called
and here's what she says that i did not
know
here's a little bit more about epstein's
cellmate
do you know anything about epstein's
cellmate
well his name was nicholas turtaglione
tarteglione okay he's
described as a hulking ex-cop
facing the death penalty
on federal murder and drug charges i
think he killed four people
and he was epstein's cellmate now
epstein
was not dangerous in that normal way you
know that the violence way
he was obviously plenty of plenty
physically dangerous in his way
but is that normal you put somebody on
death row in with an
epstein is that normal procedure
don't know but apparently here's the
part that blew me away
tartaglioni had an illegal cell phone
epstein's cellmate had a
cell phone he had it
he had a cell phone
here's my question how many prisoners
have an illegal cell phone like as a
percentage
is it a lot i mean maybe it's a lot how
the hell do you smuggle in a cell phone
it has to be through the staff right
can you get a cell phone to a prisoner
in
any way except through the staff
the guards right you'd have to have an
insider being in on that wouldn't you
i mean i feel especially because um
i believe epstein's cell had a camera in
it
so the the cellmate apparently had an
illegal phone
in a cell that was being monitored by
cameras
how do you get away with that
how does the jail not have some way to
detect
a cell phone by now can't you detect a
cell phone
is there no device that will tell you
that a cell phone signal is being given
off
nearby i how do you have a cell phone in
jail in 2021
unless they're not trying very hard to
prevent it
so i would say that's pretty damning
and then cell officials say that the
contents of this illegal phone was quote
inadvertently destroyed the contents of
his
phone it was inadvertently destroyed
because that happens right the most
important uh
investigation of you know the last 10
years probably
and some evidence just inadvertently
because nobody thought to save any
evidence
it was like well most important uh
alleged suicide ever but
you know you better not save any
evidence
so that's all looking pretty unusual
um god i wish i could tell you some of
the things i know
one of the one of the hard things about
being me
is that i do hear news like long before
you do
sometimes months if not years
before you hear it and there's stuff i
hear that i just can't tell you
and it's well
i know that's annoying when i say that
so let's talk about the
tokyo olympics uh reportedly and i don't
really believe this story
but yeah we're gonna go with this
because i think this is fake news but
it's
it's fun it's fun fake news
allegedly the beds for the athletes
are made out of cardboard and they're
designed
so that they will collapse under the
weight of fornication
that's right you can sleep on them fine
but if you get all busy on them and you
become a
an olympic fornicator these beds are
designed to collapse
now let me stop and say i don't believe
anything about this story
i do not believe that beds were designed
intentionally to prevent fornication
at the olympics but it is a story
right so i'm going to talk about it
because it's a story but i don't believe
it's true
however it raises some interesting
questions
if you're a young single person at the
olympics and you're competing
which of the other athletes looks the
sexiest to you
i'm wondering do they have a lot of
private conversations over lunch it's
like
i got to get me a gymnast why because
you think they're sexy
no because i have a cardboard bed and i
need the smallest amount of weight
and i'm thinking gymnast 98 pounds
you know i could probably make that work
or is it the javelin throwers
is it just something about the javelin
you know what i mean
you know what i mean wink wink quake
javelin thrower
yeah the ladies like the javelin thrower
you know what i mean you know what i
mean
okay or is it the weight lifters is it
the big bulky guys is it
or or do they like the freaks they like
the uh the ones who can ski
and shoot yeah you
you get a you get a lover who can ski
and shoot
you got to ask yourself what else can
they do
yeah can they tickle your balls well
never mind
never mind i'm just saying that some
athletes can multitask
they're better at you know two things
some people can only do one thing
some people can only shoot some people
could only ski
but some people can shoot and ski
and i'm saying that could be a tell for
a good lover
not every time but i feel like the odds
are in your favor yeah
um anyway these are the questions i
think of which olympic athletes would be
the best lovers
i said the other day there should be a
fleet of drones
how is the word drone exactly than
appearing on my screen
in the comments exactly as i said
the story about drones that's weird
anyway
i asked i said there should be drones
for forest fires
in other words drones that are looking
for forest fires and spotting them
but also a an army of drones to bring
the water and
try to try to get to the fire as quickly
as possible
now the drones that could bring water
are probably a pretty big problem
because how do you load them up with
water
without a pilot i suppose that's pretty
hard
but could be done it's certainly well
within the ability of technology
someday if we spend enough money to have
drones that would fly down grab water
hey carpe good to see you and all the
olympic fornicators
but it turns out that california does
have a fleet of drones
did not know that so we do have a fleet
of drones that
i think are just looking for fires
they're not treating them
um and maybe yeah maybe small volume of
chemical foam exactly
so if if you cut the fire fast enough
maybe you know maybe 100 drones with
chemical retardant because it's not as
heavy i'm guessing
as water maybe
maybe that maybe that gets it done but
if i were
the california governor here is my
persuasion tip
persuasion tip i would be talking more
about this stuff
because the news is all about stuff
burning up it's just non-stop bad news
and what are you doing about it
and if you're a citizen it looks like
the governor's doing basically nothing
now what are the odds that the governor
and the state of california are actually
doing nothing
nothing nothing that more than they did
last year
is that possible are they really just
doing nothing more than they did last
year when the whole damn state seemed
like it was on fire
no they're probably doing stuff and it
probably matters and it's probably
pretty good stuff
so why aren't we hearing about it so
here's my persuasion tip
for the governor if you're doing
something about these forest fires
then then maybe
uh goodbye user
if you're uh
anyway skipping topics
um have you seen the photo about all of
you have by now if you follow the news
you've seen the photo
of the texas state democrats
who got on a plane and they were a bus
or something and they ran away
um
and and uh they took a selfie
of how happy they were and pleased with
themselves and smug
on that bus here's my persuasion
tip don't release a photo
that your enemies are going to be really
happy to publish
over and over and over again now
look at the face of the woman who's
closest to the to the camera
she was probably the one who was holding
the camera yeah i'm seeing
on locals somebody's posting it there's
a woman there with a creepy big smile
i'm gonna try to do it
like this i think i nailed it actually
this is her look
and the problem is that she's too
pleased with herself
am i right she doesn't look like
somebody who's doing something for the
good of the country
or you know she's found the only thing
you could do
to try to solve a problem she doesn't
have that
problem solver look if you know what i
mean
she has the crazed karen look
right karen
and she took the picture and she was
probably dumb enough to be the one who
published it
but really anybody else
would have known like the people who
did not take the picture probably looked
at it and said well
there's my brand
come on you love it when i make that
face if you're listening to this on the
podcast
and you can't see the visual of the best
physical impression
anybody's ever done of the karen on the
bus
well you've missed something good i'm
going to do it again you're going to
miss it again
pretty good wasn't it i think that was
my best work
well here's some fake news that you
didn't think was fake news
have you been hearing that the arizona
audit
the election audit found 74
000 ish ballots
that don't have a record of being mailed
in
what have you heard that
it's all over the news all over social
media that they found
74 000 ballots that don't seem to have a
a record of having been valid mail in
ballots
so have you heard that story do you know
it's fake news
how many of you know it's fake news
here's the real story that 74 000
includes early voting
people who did not mail and developed
they just
voted early and it includes
things that came in after some date
where they came up with their numbers
so between the two things the fact that
it also includes a whole
different category of voters which
should not be linked to online voting so
of course they're not in the records as
online voters
because they weren't they were never
online voters they just showed up early
and voted in person
so the whole 74 000 thing
looks like fake news based on the
auditors not knowing how the system
works
that's awkward now i could be wrong
because i'm using you know a cnn fact
check on this
so it could be but
i feel as if the bias here is in favor
of the fact checkers
i feel as if the fact checkers probably
got this one right
probably so ask yourself
if you if you watched a news source or
somebody tweeted that number around
like it was a fact and you accepted it
as a fact check where you got it from
just just take a look at where you got
it from and see if you want to trust
that source going forward
now remember what i told you early on
when the election was being questioned
and audits were happening and all that i
told you from the very start
that no matter whether there was any
impropriety or not
irregardless of how much there was or
regardless of how much there was
um the 95 of the claims
would be even if someday we
find that five percent
are true which we haven't found nobody's
done that
but even if we did still 95 of the
claims would be utter and
apparently this is one of them
all right the guardian uh is doing an
investigative piece
that looks like it could be important on
some kind of spyware program called
pegasus so there's a company the nso
group who sells this
surveillance software that allows you to
surveil
people on their cell phone but they say
they're selling it to
only intelligence agencies and you know
the good guys do you believe that
well you're safe because this technology
to look into anybody's phone
is only being given to the good guys so
it's project pega says yes thank you
so
so yeah your phone can be spied on by
anybody who has the software
and that means any intelligence agency
basically can get into your phone
now the scary part is that there was
some kind of hack where the guardian got
a hold of
a list of people that are being spied on
by this software
journalists
right now i'm gonna have to check that
list
to see if i'm on it right now i
don't know if i would be called a
journalist
but i'm i work in that domain right i'm
i'm an opinion maker in the political
sense
so i would think i would be exactly in
the crosshairs
of what somebody would want to spy on
because i have an influence and i talk
about the topic that people spy on
so when the list comes out
i have to check the list to see
if i'm on it
like really i have to check the list now
i bet i'm not
you know if i have to take a guess the
odds are low
but i have to check now i suppose
somebody might have told me by them
i i probably would have been informed by
now if i were on it
anyway uh we also
have news that china has apparently been
doing the russia trick
of hiring a criminal contract hackers
so things can't be tied as easily back
to the government
they just hire criminals to do the
hacking and apparently they've been
hacking and blackmailing american
companies
and i don't know what to say about china
anymore
china's brand is fentanyl mass murder
cyber crimes ethnic genocide ip theft
climate destruction illegal trade
practices
selling the organs of living dissidents
and unleashing the coronavirus on the
world
that's their brand like when you think
about them
you think of just all that
and apparently they can just hack on us
too
because there's no penalty
i think we have to expel all of their
diplomats
don't you i feel as if the fentanyl
issue alone
should cause us to just expel all of
their diplomats
and treat them as if they're a pariah
country until they at least fix
that i mean with the cyber stuff i could
sort of imagine that maybe we're doing
it back to them
you know so maybe we're a bunch of
hypocrites and you know may
i would imagine the united states is
hacking china i doubt we're blackmailing
them
and doing ransomware i doubt we're doing
that maybe
who knows but fentanyl i don't think
we're sending him fentanyl
so we should just just say look you know
we're closing business with you guys
trade with anybody you want but not us
because you got to stop the fentanyl
that's
that's the ticket to get into the
conversation
you know you don't negotiate fentanyl
that's what trump did wrong trump
negotiated
fentanyl you don't negotiate with a mass
murderer who's literally
murdering you because whatever reason
they're doing it they wanted to keep
doing it you don't negotiate that
you just tell them what the penalty is
and then you apply it
that's it you don't negotiate
fentanyl
so yeah trump got that completely wrong
at least he tried
um here's some more semi
fake news so there's i saw an
article i and i made the mistake of
tweeting it myself so i added to the
fake newsness
which is that there is a northern
california county
i think it might be my county or the one
next to me i'm not sure which one
but uh that
changed the way it counts uh coronavirus
deaths and decreased their number of
fatalities by 25
what they decreased the number of past
fatalities by 25 percent and here's what
they did
they stopped counting people who died in
for example
car crashes who might have also had
covet
wait what they were counting people who
died
in violent car crashes as cova deaths
if they had coveted two first question
why did they even test them is it a
standard now if anybody is in the
hospital did they all get tested which
would make sense i suppose
but
really now do you believe this news
okay how many believe the news this is
reported by
a local news entity um i tweeted it
around
it says my county has changed their
methodology and it increased the deaths
by 25
real news or fake news real news or fake
news
the answer is semi-fake
because the state didn't count it this
way
so when you were looking at the state's
results they were always accurate
so the state was not including somebody
who died in a car accident
who also had covet the county was
but when they reported to the state the
state would subtract those out i guess
so apparently the state number was not
distorted in this way
but the county was does that matter
because that means that our
our overall numbers are still correct so
i'm going to call this
semi-fake news but very persuasive
and here's the persuasion tip the thing
that made this fake news sell
is that the part about the state
correcting for this
this um was way toward the end of the
article
and if i've taught you anything we pay
attention to things that happen first
that's it that's a really important rule
whatever gets our attention first sticks
in our minds and everything after that
is lessened
that's why first impressions are so
important so if you write an article
that says
hey past deaths are reduced 25
because we changed how we do it in the
county most people
including me the first time i read it
quickly
completely miss the fact that the state
doesn't make that
mistake so there you go
semi fake news
that is your live stream for today was
it one of the best you've ever seen
well i don't know i don't know but it's
up there
and um i have a question and a request
the youtube traffic for this live stream
is down about one-third
since i started live streaming on locals
is that because a third of you went to
locals
because you you preferred something
about it maybe there's no commercials
that's why you like
it but anyway um if you're going to stay
on youtube
could you do me a big favor and hit the
subscribe button that is let's see
to my side it would be be
here is it is it down here or is it down
over there
it's on one of those sides but anyway if
you're subscribed if you subscribe to
things anyway
hitting that button will give you a
notice that i'm going live
um so do that if you feel inclined
otherwise go to locals it's a
subscription service
and you won't get commercials there um
it says you lied still have ads when
subscribed
no the subscription is not what um
let me clarify there wasn't a lie but it
was a good question
somebody's saying that if you subscribe
to the youtube channel that i said you
won't see
uh commercials if i said that then i
misspoke
what i meant was if you subscribe to
youtube
which is paying a fee to youtube in
general
then you don't get ads for any content
you watch
so i probably messed up the description
of that that might be on me
but what i meant to say is the
subscription does nothing but give you a
notice
i think it does nothing but give you a
notice
that uh that the content is there but to
not see the commercials you would have
to subscribe
not by pushing the button but by paying
a fee every month to youtube
so if i said that wrong i apologize i
think i said it right now
all right that's all for today and i'll
talk to you on youtube
