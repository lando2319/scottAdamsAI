there you
are good morning everybody stream on in
here I see some people from Rumble I see
some people from
locals I'll bet that the oh YouTube's in
the house good we're all
[Music]
here people on X you're here too good to
see you
well welcome to coffee with Scott Adams
it's the best thing that's ever happened
to you and we're going to take it up to
a level that you can't even understand
with your smooth tiny human brain all
you need for this is a cuper Mugger a
glass a tanker Chalice of Stein a
canteen Jugger flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure of the dopamine the
day thing it makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous Sip and it
happens now go
a reminder I was just talking about this
in the pre-show with the locals people
if you can find the old dilbur animated
show um sometimes it's on YouTube
illegally uh play it at 1.5 or 1.25
speed and it becomes
hilarious it was it was not bad at
regular speed but it's way funnier if
you speed it up a little bit because
your attention span isn't really isn't
really set for slow
speed that's your tip for the
day well CBS News is reporting that the
Mexican Government they were trying to
uh move a uh a mummified body as part of
a museum piece it's a 19th century
mummified body and uh one of its arms
fell off wow that's a bummer they got a
mummy with the an arm fell off well one
of the things you can know from this
story is that the mummy uh did not come
from one of the
cartels do you know why you know that
the mummy is not a cartel
member how do you know because Mexico's
never disarmed anybody in the
cartel yeah I'm starting right off on
the dad jokes about disarmed
mummies and the rest of the show it's
just going to get better
from there I know it's hard to believe I
I may have Peak Peak too soon but yeah
nobody in the cartel's ever been
disarmed in
Mexico well you may have missed uh
Trump's um inspirational Memorial Day
message I'll give you just the first
sentence happy Memorial Day to all
including the human scum that is working
so hard to destroy our once great
country I am never going to be satisfied
with a normal
president how can I have this
forever I I just like this so much I
can't even express how much I like this
now what's interesting about this is
that Trump is still disciplined enough
that he doesn't make sweeping
generalizations about groups of people
when he's talking about the human scum
he means
individuals he's not saying oh all you
Democrats are bad that would be dumb
he's not saying everybody in Maggie is
bad like Joe Biden because that would be
really dumb that would be what a
dementia patient would say no Trump says
some individuals are a human scum and uh
no no need to hide that might as well
put it right out there now if you were
in a law fair trial it was you know
there were 91 in fake indictments
against you fake meaning it wouldn't
have happened anybody else um yeah you
are dealing with human scum and if you
want to call them that I just say well
that seems like an accurate impression
of the world so yes please more of
that uh meanwhile today's I guess the
closing closing case and everything in
his stormmy Daniel's trial I don't know
when we're going to see a result of this
maybe somebody smarter can tell me is it
possible it would be tonight
is
anybody uh it's possible it's tonight
right that we'd learn but maybe
not all right so here's what we know so
far the uh the amuse account on X is
live tweeting it and uh he this is how
he describes it it's a great tweet Trump
trial I'll be live tweeting the
Democrats sopia stylist show trial here
now would you normally think that that
would be hyper
if somebody says that in America we're
having a Soviet Style Show
trial it really isn't
hyperbole it's almost like you can't
there's not enough hyperbole in the
world it's exactly what's happening it's
a fake trial and everybody knows
it it's the weirdest situation if
everybody knows it's fake and we still
can't stop it if we all know it's fake
and we do I mean people argue that they
don't but they
do so here's the rest of the Tweet he
says to start acting justi as Muran is
requiring Trump to present his closing
argument before he hears the
prosecutions claim against them we still
aren't sure what they're claiming Trump
did so Trump's defense will have to rest
before they've heard what crime he's
accused of committing that would form
the basis for the the
charges now is that
hyperbole does it sound real to you that
the the trial could be over before you
hear what the charges are and that's the
last thing that the jury will hear it
doesn't seem possible does it like your
your brain says well okay there's
something left out of this you know
that's not exactly what happened right
it's some kind of exaggeration isn't it
I don't know I don't know it might be
but the amuse account is usually pretty
straightforward it's not known for
making stuff up U whoever is behind it
um and and there were a lot of experts
who said the same thing I think dersu
had said nobody's described a crime yet
uh Jonathan Turley same thing where's
the crime you have you have to at least
tell us what the crime was and then
others who tried to explain it but in
trying to explain it is so weird that
you you hear the explanation you're like
I still don't know what you just
said like are you saying there's a
predicate of a some kind of a double
misdemeanor that if you combine them and
like what like normal people can't even
hold this in their head so yeah it's a
big fake whole trial uh I the MS Dei
people on the MS Dei Network you call
them MSNBC but I think I'm going to call
them
msde because here's the thing I noticed
about
uh about the difference between msdi and
CNN CNN looks like people who know
exactly what they're doing so if they
spin something I feel like they know
exactly what they're doing on Ms Dei I
don't even know if they know that
they're
spinning I don't get a sense that
there's even a capability under
underneath them just seem
incompetent now both networks have
plenty of diversity so it's not it's not
diversity per se that's the problem but
it could be that there may have been a
looser hiring standard at
msdi that's possible it acts like it it
looks like maybe they you were a little
more interested in the diversity than
the
quality maybe CNN was a little more
interested in the quality over the
diversity that's what that's what it
looks like in in outcome
anyway so they the msdi people say oh
he's totally getting prosecuted because
the uh the prosecution did such a good
job proving the
case and then DT says what case you
didn't even describe the the
theory so how can it be simultaneously
true that oh yeah he's getting convicted
because they totally made that case but
also they haven't even described exactly
the charges
can they both be true
no
no somebody's lying who do you think it
is dtz who gave away his entire
reputation so he could tell the truth do
you think he's the one
lying probably not probably not I'd
listen to him on
this there's a robot seeing ey dog now
Fox News is reporting uh so you get this
little robotic dog that'll be your
seeing eye dog now there's literally
nothing about this is that's interesting
because I don't think it's real you know
I've been using AI for a while now and
if AI is driving the dog it's like
everything else with AI it looks like it
might work someday but it doesn't work
now you're not sure really if it will
yeah I got a feeling that the dog will
walk you into traffic every now and then
because AI still
hallucinates how how do you keep your
physical objects from huc fting too if
you know if you talk to AI it will
sometimes just make up a like a whole
answer at the end of nothing how in the
world do you train the AI That's doing
your self-driving car not to hallucinate
another car how do you do that now it
may be that the the visual training gets
you a much better result than the
language models then it might be that's
the whole answer but uh the only reason
I'm bringing this up because I'm
skeptical that that seeing ey robot dog
is ever going to be real and practical
is that Fox News when they tweeted it
they had a really good uh
pun it says the ai ai powered seeing
robot dog guide provides a new Leash On
Life For the Blind a new Leash On
Life dad joke
approved uh this
next this next article I'm just going to
put this under the category of fouchy
bad have you had the experience that I
have that you're trying to follow this
Eco Health Wuhan lab fouchy
NIH what exactly happened during the
pandemic it's all so confusing and
boring you can't really hold it in your
head so I've decided to summarize
it fouchy
bad fouchy
bad here's another evidence from an
account called Chief
nerd uh I followed today on
X um did you know that in their their
documentation and their emails during
the pandemic that they used intentional
misspellings for reasons that are not
real obvious so in other words when I
say misspelling I don't mean a typo I
mean when they said uh Ecco Health
Alliance they spelled it EC
little uh what do you call a little what
what is the wavy Dash as a name and then
health and then Anderson was spelled
with a dollar sign where the O is why
does anybody put special characters in
common words that the people they're
writing to know what the word is even
with a special
character it's to hide it from Discovery
when somebody does a keyword search and
they say can you tell us all the memos
about Eco health and then the search
can't find it can you tell us all the
all the stories about whoever Anderson
is nope don't find any Anderson mentions
in the
memos so why would anybody do this well
it's because whatever they're doing they
don't want people to know about then or
later it's one thing to hide it in the
moment because let's let's say you're
you think you're doing the right thing
and it involves fooling the
public but I think they were doing it
for the long run too where even if they'
done it something that turned out
well they still were afraid that it
wouldn't come out well and they weren't
telling you so whatever I don't know
what the thinking was or what the
rationale was but when you see somebody
intentionally hiding the names of the
key players and the key elements of the
pandemic in their
memos yeah it means that your foyer
request isn't going to find them and
they can get away with stuff so let me
summarize this fouchy
bad fouchy
bad all right um the FBI's Behavioral
Unit and other scientific people have
decided that that whole Havana secret
Sonic weapon was definitely a mass
Hysteria
now I've already taken some victory Laps
on this I believe I'm the only person in
the
world that at least is a public figure
who said on day one of the secret Sonic
weapon against the EMES oh no that's a
classic Mass
hysteria now why did I know on day one
it was a mass hysteria and even today
years later we're just getting well now
we kind of think it must have been a
mass Hysteria
what's the difference between me getting
it on day one and the FBI waiting years
to figure it out do you know why simple
it's it's a talent stack thing I I have
spent time learning what um causes of
mass hysteria reading about them
historically and then recognizing the
pattern so the moment I saw it was like
oh yeah this is just like all the ones
in the book I read it's exactly like
them and so on day one I called it
correctly now is it because I'm magic no
I just had a very specific skill that I
had spent some time in the past to
develop I I developed the ability to
spot a mass hysteria and it worked so
books hey
books I don't know if anybody's ever
recommended this but it turns out
there's a lot of knowledge you can get
out of books so there's a little trick
for you read some
books uh there's another report that uh
psychedelic mushrooms could cure
alcoholism uh we've been hearing this
forever that it can help you with
addiction but apparently they've got a
little better read on what the mechanism
is and it does seem to confirm that it
should have that effect it it in other
words it blocks some serotonin receptors
that regulate your drinking uh which
means that your drinking wouldn't be as
fun after you had the mushrooms which is
kind of a weird specific effect doesn't
it it really makes you wonder what's up
with the with the mushrooms that they
can make such a specific change to
you that is exactly the one you needed
it's kind of weird I don't know uh I
think it's true because I've heard too
many reports of people getting uh
unaddicted after mushrooms but there's
something mysterious about it still
uh there was a funny post today on X
from a user called bark bark
meta and he said uh quote I've never met
I've never met a rich and successful
person who smokes weed not even
once well you can imagine how that post
went uh I introduced myself um as did
others but uh let me give you my take on
this
it's rare to meet a successful people
what because I'm you know in a uh let's
say a privileged situation where having
had some success in my own career it
makes you easily meet people who had
success in their career sort of
automatic so I've probably met more
successful people than people who are
not also somewhat in the public eye if
you're in the public eye you meet lots
of successful
people but uh here's my take
um whoever bark
is your friends either you haven't met
many successful people or they don't
trust you because they're not telling
you the
truth the here's my
take pretty much all successful people
are using
drugs it it's hard to you don't really
run into too many exceptions they're not
all using marijuana but many of them are
some are using a variety of uh
performance-enhancing drugs you know
some are micro doing on this or that
very common some are using stimulants
you know they're um could be meth could
be uh Aderall but my take is that rich
and successful people have found out how
to use drugs to help their career and
people who have not done it let's say
methodically are on the wrong drugs if
you are a uh this will this will sound
terrible but could you all agree with me
that if you're a functional alcoholic
meaning that you can somehow stay out of
trouble you're probably a good
salesperson because because sales is a
lot about inviting people out to drinks
and being social so if you canot turn
into a monster when you drink it's just
something you like to do and I'll tell
you one of the
one of the people who drinks the most
that I know is also one of the
richest and he he uses his drinking as
marketing like he drinks when he goes on
you know marketing and uh sales trips he
goes out with for drinks and when
they're done everybody loves them and
they're they stay in touch and they
become friends because it's a bonding
experience and uh so yes I would say
that it's very individual if if I drank
it would just be nothing but bad
Health um I wouldn't be able to function
and I'm not sure I recommend it I mean I
don't think that you know his health is
necessarily going to be the best
but it's very consistent that the people
who have uh made Financial breakthroughs
have usually figured out how to use
drugs as an
advantage even if it had some bad effect
later they they figured out how to
weaponize it in their favor that's the
difference between the
atcts all right um there's a report that
a lot of the people taking that OIC
weight loss drug are getting pregnant at
higher rates it's not confirmed but I
guess there's a big Facebook page of
people saying hey I went on the zumic
and now I'm pregnant and I guess it's a
big thing and so there's a lot of
scientific talk about huh what what
scientifically is happening with zic
that's making people get pregnant I
wonder how the chemistry Works what
exactly is the
biomechanism that might be causing more
pregnancy from weight
loss um maybe you should have checked in
with me before you spend any money
researching
this um I'm no medical
scientist but I'm just going to put on a
speculative guess call it a hypothesis
that people who lose weight are more
attractive to their
mates and that people who lose weight
feel more confident and feel more
comfortable taking their clothes
off so given that we know obesity will
lower your
libido and losing weight makes you more
bangable what would you
expect what would you
expect are you telling me you didn't
expect more
pregnancies from people losing weight
how how can it really go the other way
it's hard to imagine it would have gone
any other
way so wouldn't it be interesting if our
uh birth our birth rates are plunging
but what ends up fixing it would be
OIC now I've told you before that um I I
do think one of the biggest reasons our
birth rate is going down is that we
become less attractive to each other
weight is just part of it
but we're also imagine if you will that
Democrats made 50% of the country
unfuckable that
happened right when I was a kid if I saw
a marriage where there was like one
Democrat and one Republican I would say
oh that's fun I wouldn't even think much
of it it would be so normal but today
it's the first
filter so you tell
me you tell me how America can
survive when you divide by political
parties that are roughly you know 40% of
the public each you can't survive if you
take 40% of the potential bangable
people and of the
equation you get way fewer kids there's
no way around that and I would argue
that Democrats have doomed the United
States to failure by making it so
unpleasant to get along with each other
by you know demonizing the right and by
the way it doesn't really work the other
way you know people on the right if they
met a normal Democrat you know wasn't a
crazy Progressive pramas Democrat they'd
be fine with it they just say oh we
disagree about these things so we'll
just talk about something
else uh but Democrats have quite
pointedly and directly and with great
effort made made all Republicans
unfuckable to them and at the same time
the progressives seem unfuckable to most
Republicans how in the world do you
survive
that that's an existential event I mean
that there there is no obvious way you
could ever survive as a country under
the current situation now I think we'll
solve it with
robots we're going to solve it with
robots I don't know if that's good I
don't know if that's healthy but I think
people are going to say if I can't have
access to half of the world and the ones
that I do have access only the top 5%
look good and they're all either run
through or they're because they
have all the options in the world both
both the men and the women that's not a
sexist statement I'm calling the men
hores as well
uh how do you survive that I have no
idea so I don't think that we've Tough
Enough on what Biden has done to the
country right I'll use him as the leader
of the Democrats the Democrats have made
us a country that can't reproduce at a
replacement level they have to bring in
extra people they they broke
reproduction in this country they broke
it yeah you can't take away half the
options that expect you'll get the same
outcome of babies it's not
possible anyway
uh V ramaswami you may have heard bought
a uh what seven or 8% interest in
BuzzFeed because it its value decreased
so much that a few million dollars gets
you a few percentage of it so he's
pushing for some board seats once three
board seats that he would be happy with
because he's an important shareholder
now and he says that uh uh let's see
their value plummeted from about 1.5
billion to just under 100 million and he
sent this long letter to the board of
directors um and uh he was urging
buzzfee to add more directors that he
vetted and changed their business model
so because they're hemorrhaging
money now I just love
this I love this you know
I I think you would agree with me at
least my audience would that elen must
save free speech is that a fair
statement you know I said that
yesterday and then I thought to myself
was that is that hyperbole you know my
kind
of going out on a you know Republican
spin or is that close to reality and I
decided it's reality I think he
legitimately
literally right in front of
us saved free speech in America now it's
not where we want it because you know
right now is still a little island you
know some of it gets reported to other
places but it is one place I can say
whatever is true without worrying about
getting
canceled as long as it's true you know
if I said a bunch of then I
would expect some consequences but as
long as I think it's true and I'm doing
you know my best effort to you know
correct things and and be honest I'm
fine and that didn't exist
before now V taking it to the next level
uh BuzzFeed is still important enough at
least in our Consciousness that if he
Could reconstruct it into something
useful uh that was not just a total
horrible hit piece spin machine piece of
 uh that would be a huge service to
the country so if we could get two
little
islands of uh you know nons
spin well everything is spin but two
little islands of at least Free Speech
that'd be amazing so good job of F on
that uh I was tempted to volunteer to be
one of the board of
directors only because BuzzFeed has been
issuing head pieces on me for years and
I thought well wouldn't that be sweet to
be on the board of directors after
they've been with me for
years that would be delicious but it
sound that sounds like real work and I
have no interest in sitting on a board
you know why they call it a board
are all
bored dad joke number three if you keep
in
count uh another favorite story all the
news is funny
today apparently unusual Wales is
reporting this I don't know where the
original story came from but thousands
of North Koreans stole American
identities and took remote work tech
jobs at Fortune 500 companies the
Department of Justice says so during the
pandemic especially I think North
Koreans pretended to be Americans and
stole their tech jobs are you ready for
the funny part I mean it's starting
funny already right like the the setup
gets you halfway
there can I can I give you the punchline
now how exactly did they get those jobs
you know they pretended to be
Americans did they did they pretend to
be
me no no they didn't pretend to be me
what what Americans do you think they
pretended to be because they got jobs
remotely without even showing up for ano
without they didn't show up for any kind
of
interview
oh I'm thinking they may have claimed
that they
were members of a uh disadvantaged
community did they pretend to be black
so they could get jobs at any Fortune 00
company and work
remot did that happen because it seems
like it's mysteriously missing from the
story let me give you uh a second
story that's
unrelated or is it so this will be your
test here's an unrelated
story or is
it so I forgot the name but there was a
a little uh fun on the xplatform there
was a a gentleman who is a 35-year-old
historian and his special Focus had been
you know white supremacy
and discrimination in
history so you'd think that this is a
he's a very woke guy Democrat super woke
totally on the side of the
disadvantaged and then he applied for a
job he's a uh very credential historian
he's
published but he's very white and
male sent out about 40 resumés got zero
uh
interviews and uh he red pilled himself
so
hard I I don't even think he swallowed
the red pill I think somebody shoved it
up his
ass he still took the red pill it just
wasn't as voluntarily as you might have
imagined yeah he found out and by the
way he's saying it out loud that a white
man can't get a job in America do you
know why because of people like him he's
been writing about how bad it is to be
you know anything but a white man in
America and the whole time he was doing
it he didn't realize he'd lost all of
his economic
rights he's basically a useless piece of
 in the American economy because
nobody wants a 35y old white guy it
doesn't matter if he's been an ally to
Black Americans and writing about racism
and white supremacy nobody gives this
 that doesn't show up on anybody's
diversity numbers the only thing that
would have mattered is could the
companies that he applied to claim him
as a victory in their March toward
diversity and the answer is no it
doesn't matter what he said or thought
or contributed none of it
mattered none of it mattered all right
so now that now that you know that a
35-year-old white guy with good
credentials can't even get an interview
for a job how did thousands of North
Koreans get jobs without even showing up
in person to
interview how do you do
that well I can only think of one way I
think they probably claimed that they
were minorities in America probably and
do you think that the Department of
Justice would mention that
no no I'd like to know about the stolen
identities how many of them were older
white
men did did they get a lot of get a lot
of fake jobs pretending to be older
white men did the tech company say oh
50-year-old white man
yeah I do think Tech is the one place
where you might be able to use your
credentials instead of your identity
because you know maybe they give you a
test and say can you solve this and if
you can solve it they say all right
you're hired so there there is more
capability to pick people who have Merit
in the tech industry than other places
but just the way the country is I
suspect that the reason they got those
jobs without
interviewing is they might have sent a
picture in that's my
guess how did they not at least have a
zoom
call who who hires person who hires a
person without at least a zoom call
where you can see their
face oh here we go there's the
post from David Austin Walsh uh but I'm
35 years old I'm four plus years post
PhD and quite frankly I'm also a white
dude combine those factors together and
I'm for all intents and purposes
unemployable as a 20th century American
historian
I shouldn't laugh at his plight but yeah
he is
unemployable oh that's a tough way to
find it
out so
anyway um Thomas Massie warns us that
the usmca is just NAA two now I'm not
going to make an argument for or against
NAFTA and I'm not going to make an
argument for or against USM
because I don't know enough about him
but I'll tell you what Thomas Massie
told me he told me that uh in his post
he told us all that uh both were written
behind closed doors without involvement
from
Congress
wait
what without
involvement from
Congress isn't this entirely congress's
decision and they weren't involved in
their own
decision does that even sound possible I
read on without involvement from
Congress by the cronies who benefit from
them meaning the that legislation and
both forfeit our sovereignty to
authorities outside of our
constitution okay I'm with you Thomas
Massie uh I'm I'm going to say that the
process is broken and therefore I don't
trust the result what do you think about
the
usmca I don't care what do I think about
I don't care let me tell you what I care
about the way it was created is
completely unacceptable so whether it's
good or bad it no no no no no no no
no no you don't do it in closed doors
without the involvement of Congress you
let Thomas Massie in there right you let
Thomas Massie in there and let him tell
us what happened right how about a
little
transparency no no no I don't care how
good it is I don't care if it's good for
America good for Mexico no no no no
squared th this is the easiest no you'll
ever have in your life if you were a
leader and and Massie is if you a leader
this is unambiguously clearly
no this is so no that you can't even
think of a harder no than we did it
behind closed doors we're not going to
tell you what it is the people who are
in charge of it are unaware of what's in
it it's too complicated
vote for it no no no
no this this is not like some kind of
gray area there's no gray
area no and I don't care how good it is
I do not care how good it is for the
country
no that that's just such a hard
now here's a little related news I saw
from somebody else a while ago so I
don't remember who was saying it but
there is a thought that Mexico's economy
is about to just boom like
crazy and I felt I actually believe that
here's the argument so apparently um
Mexico is involved with some major
infrastructure changes such as a
railroad across the country to compete
with the Panama Canal and then there are
some other I think there's a a major
highway or something that will connect
the resorts and there's some other stuff
like that then then you add to that that
manufacturing from China is starting to
move toward closer Andor friendlier
countries with the United States and a
lot of that's going to end up in Mexico
so Mexico is about to have a
tourism um explosion because they're
connecting the resorts and making it
safe to go there just for the resorts
they're uh going to put a you know a way
to move Goods across their country that
competes with the most one of the most
important trade routes in the world
and and Manufacturing is going to
explode
so you know you've heard the reports
that the uh people coming across the
border are mostly
non-mexican how how do you interpret
that you know what's
weird Mexico is largely
solved that the Mexicans who would come
across the border now probably just want
to be with the relatives
you know or or they have some legal
problem they're getting away with but it
can't be an accident that Mexico's
economy is is looking like it's you know
doing well relatively speaking and that
the immigrants from Mexico have dropped
off so it does tell you that you can
stop immigration by improving the
economies South of the Border so in
concept looks like it could work and but
I don't think we did anything I think
Mexico just figured out a way to make
more money and they're going to do it
now why does it look like Mexico is
suddenly running more efficiently than
you could imagine in the past what do
you think
changed if these three things are true
that that now Mexico looks like a good
place to
manufacture and they're doing all these
big projects that look like they will
succeed why do you think they're
suddenly so
capable well I have a theory
the cartels are in charge and they're
really good at what they do that's what
I
think I think maybe the cartels added
some competence to the government that
wouldn't have been there otherwise just
a
gas but it does seem like Mexico you
know up their game somehow we we don't
know if that's true yet we'll keep
watching the world economic forum is
reporting that Finland is starting its
education against fake news early so
even in daycare they're teaching the
smallest of kids how to interpret means
and spot manipulative images and so
Finland is teaching their kids to detect
disinformation isn't that good that's
good news isn't it aren't we all happy
let's let's give a standing ovation for
Finland because they're training their
kids to spot fake news do you see any
problem with
that if you don't see the problem right
away let me explain
it how do the teacher spot face fake
news there are no adults who can do that
have you ever met
one there are no teachers who could spot
fake
news when did that happen if adults of
any kind could spot fake news with any
regularity it wouldn't
exist that the whole reason there is
fake news and manipulation and and
brainwashing and and gaslighting is
because a normal educated adult can't
tell the difference between real news
and fake news there wouldn't be two
sides to every
story if adults with a normal education
could tell the difference between what's
true and what isn't there isn't any
possible way logically that they could
be training these kids with something
useful because there's no way that they
know that these tools
either right let me ask you this do you
think they're training the kids that if
there's one anonymous source from inside
the White House it's always
I taught you that and you can observe it
yourself you think they're teaching the
kids that no let me tell you what
they're teaching the kids without even
knowing okay kids if somebody tells you
climate change isn't real that's
fake I'm just guessing but that would be
the level that most of the world is
operating at so I assume most teachers
how how many of the teachers could have
told you one anonymous source about a
White House Insider that comes out of
axios is guaranteed to be
 I can tell you that and then
you can watch it for yourself but
there's no teachers that are teaching
that it's
ridiculous all right uh let's see the
mullo foundation I assume that's Dr
mulla's
Foundation um and Dr mullo is one of the
early uh doctors who are against the
shots and so he's got some his
foundation has some information here it
shows that in King County in Washington
there was a just gigantic spike in uh
the the uh vaccinated people dying above
Baseline
expectations so there's your proof
right so King County huge difference in
your life expectancy whether you're
vaccinated or not and the vaccinated
were getting and by the way compared to
the historical Trend so the trend was
going one way and then as soon as the
pandemic hit and the shots came out
everything went to hell very very
clearly at the same
time
okay so therefore this this is really
strong evidence that the the shots are
bad for you right what what would the
Finland teach their kids about this
would Finland say yes uh Dr MCA and his
foundation have now
proven that the shots are harmful do you
think Finland is learning
that do you think this data from the
Mulla Foundation is believable and does
does it really just put a bow on it and
now you're now you're certain you know
what's going
on well let me give you some
perspective number one uh I don't trust
anything that comes out of Peter McCulla
because I believe he got the uh athle
sudden death thing wrong and it's a
little like the where they teach you at
a
trial where they say if you get one
thing wrong you know if the witness says
one thing that's wrong you can meaning
lie uh then you can disbelieve the rest
he might be right on all the rest he
might
be but that one claim was so easily
debunked if you're not aware of how
easily debunked that was yeah was very
easily
debunked uh so if he believed the most
easily debunked thing in all the
pandemic then I don't listen to them for
anything else however the data is the
data right they didn't make up the data
this came from somewhere else they're
just reporting it so the data is a real
strong indication wouldn't you say if
you looked at a population and you saw
that as soon as the shots came out that
the people who got the shots far more
than the other people had this huge
death rate that
zoomed well um I don't believe any of
the data from the pandemic so all data
is unreliable and in general but the
pandemic seems to be worse but let me
give you another
hypothesis that I'm not saying this
hypothesis is true that's what makes it
a hypothesis I'm going to tell you that
there's at least one other explanation
that would chart exactly to the chart or
that would match the chart right it's an
obvious one it's one that's proven
Beyond any doubt and it's an alternate
explanation for the excess death at
exactly the same time do you know what
it is how many of you know what I'm
going to
say now I did have for a while a
suspicion that our food supply changed
in a bad way maybe because we did
something differently with fertilizer or
preservatives because we were trying to
protect the food supply when we worried
that the wouldn't be enough maybe but
there's a cleaner better hypothesis that
maps to this completely and it's
loneliness the pandemic created a
massive
loneliness Spike which persists after
the pandemic I can tell you that the
number of people I see per day on
average is nowhere near it was during
the pandemic I just have way less human
contact maybe two days a week I don't
see
anybody did you know that I don't see
anybody I like my house so I maybe I see
my
dog but if I don't have plans I just
don't run into anybody because I work
alone and then do my thing and go to bed
so uh in my case I'm not suffering from
loneliness you know I I like a lot of
the alone time so it's not bad but I can
feel it and the pandemic definitely
changed me now um did you know
that uh if you if you Google it you're
going to find out that loneliness is
really
deadly and here's the second correlation
but you say to me but Scott everybody
got lonely during the pandemic so why is
it only the people who got shots who are
dying because they would be the
loneliest if you if you got massively um
you know boosted it's because you were
already in that old situation where
there's loneliness and you probably
increase your loneliness even more
because now you're like oh I can't can't
be around people I got to get boosted so
I would think that the people who who
were likely to get the most
shots would also be the loneliest
because they would socially distance the
most
aggressively now given that we know
loneliness causes uh cardio problems
mental health and all of those issues
and that's exactly what the graph shows
why would you say it's the
shot if you have a known cause that maps
to it
perfectly why why would you say it's the
shot here's my
hypothesis even though we all know that
loneliness kills I don't think we know
how quickly or how decisively it kills
so my suspicion is that we have a
collective blind spot because even if
you know on a let's say scientific level
yeah I know loneliness will kill people
I don't think you know how
quickly so I'm I'm just going to put it
at the end there you don't know how
quickly it kills you unless you've
experienced it let's do a little
test those of you who have
experienced profound loneliness if
you've ever had it in your life didn't
you want to be
dead you tell me didn't you want to be
dead
when you were profoundly
lonely and didn't you feel less
healthy of course she did yeah now why
would we ignore
that now and and let me say as as
clearly as I
can I don't have any reason to believe
the shots were
healthy I'm not defending the
shots I'm saying the data is
unreliable and I don't trust anybody who
who's overlooking the most obvious and
proven
connection with excess mortality which
is if you spike people's loneliness
there's going to be more deaths in every
domain from heart attacks to self harm
to overdoses every domain should go up
from loneliness I don't know if every
category goes up from
shots is there more suicide because
people got shots because there's more
suicide so anyway so again um it could
be right and I think that we have every
reason to suspect the uh shots
have potentially catastrophic effects
potentially I'm not the expert so I'm
not not uh I don't want to diminish the
risk I'm just saying that we have to be
really careful looking at this kind of
data that's
all um here's another one they should
have asked me there's another study that
says when you brag about busy you are
people think you're an idiot in other
words if when you're talking to people
you keep talking about how busy you are
it makes them think you're
incompetent so what does that remind you
of so now we know that when people
complain about being victims of all the
work they're judged as
incompetent not as awesome Heroes with a
lot of work
that's
Dei now Dei is of course nothing about
being overworked but it's a victim
mentality what do uh what do what do uh
non-minorities think about people who
complain about the need for
Dei it makes you look
incompetent makes you look incompetent
now that has to be factored in we we now
have a science that says the the whiners
look
incompetent did you have to do that
science could you not have just asked me
hey Scott what do you think of people
always complaining about having too much
work or really complaining about
anything all the time I would say well
wouldn't want to work with them wouldn't
want to hire them that's for sure so
yeah I think that Dei um should make
people think that the people who are
concerned about it are incompetent and
that's what I I observe that to be true
meanwhile in New York city mayor Adams
is working with
ice to uh try to figure out how to get
rid of their migrants that they think
are too many while at the same time
they're a sanctuary City so not only do
the Democrats create Sanctuary cities
but now they're trying to figure out a
way to thwart the sanctuary City because
the sanctuary city is destroying the
City don't you think it would be smarter
to say
hey why don't we uh why don't we just
change our
policy why don't we not be a sanctuary
City if this is a
problem nope turns out you're getting
just what you ask for so I say get out
of the
Cities I think Jack bobic has been
saying that longer just get away you
can't save the
cities that I I feel quite confident
that the major cities are gone and you
should get away from the as as you can
we'll build new cities where you have a
chance of succeeding but the current
cities I don't think there's any chance
of saving them and I don't think it
should be I mean I don't think City
living was ever what we were meant to
experience have you ever lived in a like
a high trffic city it's definitely
exciting you lots of stuff to do but my
god the traffic will kill you yeah if
you could do one thing to make yourself
happier it reduce that two hours a day
you're sitting in traffic that'll really
help
you all
right well Dei is dying in some places
but I think it's only going to be the
red States so this week the uh
University of North
Carolina they voted to get rid of their
Dei policies
and that will affect 17 public
universities across the
state so why exactly would they cancel
Dei did they give
reasons I would assume that it's because
it's considered uh
racist and that uh they're trying to get
rid of
racism so the the blue states are
instituting Dei to get rid of racism and
the red states are getting rid of Dei
to get rid of
racism maybe we should get together and
decide what is it that gets rid of
racism or do they just like racism
against certain classes of
people I would argue that I got
cancelled for basically doing what the
University of North Carolina just did
right in front of you which is uh to
say if Dei is someplace you should not
be
there now their version is oh we're
going to get rid of the
Dei my version is if you don't get rid
of the Dei I'm not going to your
school is that the same aren't we on the
same page I'll say it again University
of North Carolina says we want to get
rid of
Dei to improve the school make it a
better place to go for at least white
people and I say yes yes I will go there
because you got rid of Dei now how's
that different from me advising people
if you're white stay away from Dei
environments that's bad for you but
likewise and on the other side of the
coin if you're a black American or lgbtq
or one of the uh one of the groups that
can be favored by Dei you should run
toward it as hard as you can that your
best career option is to go where people
favor you not where people are overtly
discriminating against you so when I say
get the out
that's what I mean same thing that uh
that the University of North Carolina
just said no you can't be in the same
environment with this Dei stuff it
doesn't work so in their case they got
rid of the Dei I didn't have power to
get rid of Dei so I say if you don't
have the power
to leave so now you've got 17 public
universities in North Carolina that
would be an option for you if you were a
uh White can
I'd love to know where all the options
are that a white candidate can apply
wouldn't
you and I'll add to asian-americans I
assume it's the same issue
so where where's my list of sanctuary
colleges where's my issue where's my
list of sanctuary and by the way you
need to call them Sanctuary Where's My
Sanctuary
corporations I'll bet there's not one in
the Fortune 500
I bet there's not
one um well maybe there is yeah maybe
Tesla or something but even Tesla has a
Dei group don't they yeah maybe there's
none don't know about that for
sure all right um apparently the uh our
government hid from us that a few weeks
ago there was uh some jordanians in a
box truck who tried to get access to
Quantico Marine Corps Base in Virginia
and arm guard arm guard stopped
them but
[Music]
uh really a box truck I assume a box
truck is something that carries a big
load and if they didn't belong there why
did they need a big
truck uh this I saw the story
characterized as a dry run were they
trying to see if they could get a big
truck through the gates of a highly
secured place just so next time it'll be
filled filled with explosives and they
know how to do
it did that just happen to how in the
world are we not going to have a major
event before the
election you know the the only thing
keeping us safe at the moment is
mutually assured
destruction because if there is a major
event America has created one pattern
which I think nobody's
missed if you send some people to our
country to break some in our
country we will destroy your entire
nation I I think we've made that very
clear have we not I think Israel is
doing a good job of sending that message
to Hamas if you attack us we'll destroy
your whole
country which looks like what's
happening all right uh rason did a poll
about uh replacing Biden and apparently
uh 48% of democratic voters say they
would approve of replacing them uh wait
that was in February but now the number
is 54 more than half of democratic
voters would be okay with replacing
Biden months before the
election has that ever been asked before
has there ever been a need for pollsters
to even ask the question
I'm seeing a message that Ukraine is
attacking Russian early warning radar
with American weapons now meaning that
they're attacking them in Russian
territory so is Ukraine intentionally
using American
weapons in Russian territory to
guarantee that the UK and France and the
United States put boots on the ground
that's what it looks like doesn't it
doesn't it look like Ukraine is trying
to cause a bigger war with Russia
because if they don't it's going to get
settled so they need to make it
bigger which means they need Russia to
go
bigger this is all
pretend it it it's like this pretend
War everything about this war
looks wrong to me you know I suppose you
can say that about all wars but
sometimes they look like they have a
reason not this
time I mean the reason looks like it's
profit all right um you know the movie
The Apprentice there was a hit piece on
Trump and the movie's been made but they
went to the can film festival and nobody
wanted to distribute it and the thinking
is that uh it won't be distributed
because Trump already said he would sue
the out of him one of the claims is
that he violent L raped his ex-wife Iana
and Iana says it never
happened so I think Trump has a pretty
good lawsuit there don't you there were
only two people in the room and they
both say it didn't happen and then it's
in the
movie that's a pretty good case I would
think seems like a good it looks like
election interference as well so I think
it's smart that no distri wants to touch
it but I also think it's probably a
terrible
movie I mean I saw a clip I was like
that doesn't look like
him um there's a uh there's a concern
now that uh Hollywood movies are not
mentioning uh climate change enough so
there's some group of authors who
surveyed 250 movies from 2013 to 2022
and they found out that only some of
them mentioned the risk of climate
change and they'd like to change that
they'd like your movies to reflect what
they call a
reality now who could we talk
to to determine if they're trying to
Gaslight us on climate change or if
they're trying to save the
world who could sort this out for us
okay I have an
idea there are some uh preschool SCH
children in Finland who have been
trained to spot
propaganda could we maybe offer them to
come over here and sort this out for us
because they've been taught by their
teachers who know how to tell fake news
from Real News yeah they can
tell so let's bring those uh
well-trained preschool kids
here and see what they say about the
movies not having enough climate change
in them now you're all aware that the
CIA famous ly and well documented and
this is not a conspiracy theory it's all
well understood um did try to influence
successfully American movies to make us
more patriotic and you know live a
certain lifestyle because they thought
it was good for the country and it
worked you know all the John Wayne
movies probably were primarily to make
you join the military or at least think
the military is
awesome so um yes this looks like a huge
propaganda brainwashing kind of
thing um I don't know if I mentioned
this but I was watching a uh there a
bunch of clips of John Eastman he's the
now disbar attorney that worked with
Trump on the 20120 stuff and he was
taken down
for by the bar for helping Trump
basically he's got some videos in which
he's giving a speech at the Michigan
Fair elections meeting and and his
stories about election
irregularities I listened only for the
first 10 minutes and I had to walk
away because my head was
exploding now I believe that his claims
the ones I'm going to tell you about are
are not questioned I think these are
things that are a matter of record it's
just that we don't talk about it give me
some examples one example he gave is
that uh there was some people who said
they Dropbox was really a bunch of
people who were um harvesting ballots
from the nearby college so they were
stopping people as they walked by and
getting them to vote and they called it
a Dropbox but it was just a ballot I
don't know if there was a box there or
not it was just a balloting ballot
harvesting operation was that legal no
no but it wasn't you know maybe a big
enough thing to change things how about
the uh who who approved the dropboxes
apparently they were approved not by the
legislators in their states which is
illegal but all those votes were counted
because hey it's a pandemic so these are
all things which are sort of in this
gray area of clearly being illegal but
we were bending the rules a little bit
because the pandemic so is it really
illegal if it if it was an
emergency yes yes from a legal
standpoint it's illegal
uh how about one story that that finally
just ended
me is that uh there was a law that said
you can't collect votes from nursing
homes I forget which state might have
been Wisconsin you can't get votes from
nursing homes because you would
basically be manipulating the votes
because they don't know what they're
doing in
there uh and that rule was dropped
during the pandemic because of
Co and when they dropped the rule they
knew exactly what would happen
and the voting rate for nursing homes
went from normally maybe 20% to
100% including the memory care
unit that's right the dementia
Alzheimer's unit where the people don't
even know their own names recorded a
100% voting
rate so was that legal
well probably
not what were there enough people
involved in just the nursing home thing
to have changed the result in the
state
yes and these are just a few examples
how many examples do you think he
has yeah you've heard lots more right so
you've got you know Zuckerberg spending
400 million on things yeah this is the
most rigged election in the history of
rigged elections it's just that you know
the Democrats can still fall back to the
courts which are
also handcuffed didn't do anything about
it so therefore there was no fraud this
is the most massively fraudulent
situation you've ever seen in your life
and they did it right in front of you
and probably we'll do it again that
would be my
guess so um did I hear that uh Sydney
Powell
um has been cleared of all all Texas
allegations by the Texas bar and she's
rebar is that a word do you get
disbarred and then
rebar so we're slowly finding out that
everything we were told for the last
several years was a lie just everything
everything about the pandemic everything
about the
election everything about
immigration everything about
Ukraine it was all a lie everything all
the important things were just just a
bunch of
Lies John Eastman and Sydney pow got
taken down with that I think they will
be I accept expect both of them to be uh
reconstituted
eventually uh Senator Tim Scott had a
provocative statement he said that uh
President Biden has resegregated schools
under his administration now what he
meant was that by putting the you know
putting pressure against um the
alternative schools he made it harder
for a black person to go to a good
school so if they ended up staying in
their bad School uh it was highly black
so de facto segregation even though
that's not the
intention uh when I first heard this I
thought oh that's provocative that'll
leave a mark but the more I thought
about it it's too
conceptual too
conceptual it's not really the kind of
thing you hold in your mind and then act
on you get it oh I get it he was against
um you know the the charter schools so
if you're against Charter Schools the
effect is more segregation that happens
somewhat organically so therefore now
that's too many
leaps here's what it works people coming
across the border are going to kill you
well now I know what to
do that's pretty clear
right so so uh I I'll say again that
Senator Scott solid solid uh
Senator uh I'm glad he's in office but
man he can't campaign he's just not he's
not Trump level campaigner and I think
Trump needs
that um I saw Howard Curts he was on Fox
saying that uh Trump is showing that he
cares about the concerns of people and
his visits the Bronx being evidence that
he's you know willing to go where the
people have the greatest needs and and
at least speak to them uh at least
that's how it looks and then uh Biden
was at morouse College at about the same
time talking about victimhood so one is
Trump I'm here to help if I can here's
what I've done and the other is oh you
can never succeed because you all the
victimhood you know if you're black in
America you'll be discriminated against
so what what could be more damaging to
Black Americans than telling them they
can't succeed because of
discrimination I can't even think of
anything that would be a worse crime
against black Americans since what Jim
Crow and um slavery
itself so this is the reason I was
talking about uh King Randall's program
where he teaches young black
kids um how to shake hands and how to
change their oil and change attire and
how to how to do a job interview and how
to talk to adults and all these things
just super super good qualities to learn
when you're young and I'll say it again
he if you focus on individual
accomplishments none of this other stuff
matters if you're you know in any of the
disadvantaged groups just make yourself
valuable it's what everybody does now
you might you might in fact be starting
a little bit behind because of systemic
racism but it's so easily defeatable by
simply adding talents to your existing
talents until you're
irresistible right yeah you you could
very clearly in say five years uh
assemble a set of talents that no white
person can match it's just your your
unique set of things and if somebody
needs that well you're the one so
everything is about individual success
and everything bad is about oh this
group is having some
discrimination what does nope mean I I
get the worst trolls
nope all right
um so Iran's building some more nuclear
missiles I don't know what makes them
nuclear missiles they don't have nukes
yet but they're getting close to that as
well and the story is I guess Steve Gest
was reporting on that
um that uh Biden is urging Britain and
fance to let France to let Iran ramp up
its production of nuclear
missiles now do you think that's true
the Biden Administration is going easy
on Iran and their nuclear program it
does look like that true yeah
so here are the things that uh that
Biden has done for the Middle
East um he's he spent half a billion
dollars building a pier to deliver Aid
to Gaza but it turns out it only
delivered Aid to the Hamas Fighters
because they stole it
all um and then we finding out that it
was built in a place that you should not
use that pure technology because it's
not designed to survive the waves that
are normal in that beach that's right
the solution they used is known not to
be useful and it's already broken and
sinking and we wasted a half a billion
dollars and I think there were some
casualties
involved probably I saw somebody else
make this speculation probably at some
point there was an engineer who said the
following oh this technology is meant
for more of a protected um Beach head
without big waves it will not work with
the normal waves here this is a surfing
Beach they built an artificial Pier on a
surfing
Beach it's a surfing Beach because the
waves are so big and then the waves
broke it like like the engineers didn't
know that of course they did which means
the engineers were over overrode in
other words the engineers I'm sure said
don't do this it won't work and I'm
sure that the leaders said do it anyway
because we have to look like we're doing
something if it doesn't work it doesn't
work but at least we
tried I think that's what happened
speculating so let's see he
failed he is aiding Iran's nuclear
program he built a uh he built a
facility for half a billion dollars
whose only
functional outcome is feeding the enemy
and he's downplaying the attacks of the
terrorists at are us
bases uh and he also denied some smart
bombs to
Israel so he fed Hamas denied bombs to
Israel and gave Iran comfort in building
nukes you know it would be hard to
imagine anybody failing harder at that
but uh here's some other
failures uh the amuse account had this
list so think of Biden's Legacy so he's
got the the Gaza Pier thing he's got at
the Afghanistan withdrawal everything
with Iran is wrong you know giving them
their money back Etc and then October
7th happens everything about Ukraine is
wrong the hoodies we didn't handle well
Syria not so
good um
let me ask you this you know I know
you're all partisans and you've already
chosen your favorite potential
president and I think you could argue
forever who was like the best president
in history and I would say Trump needs
to be on the list at least in the
conversation but you could argue who's
the best like that's easy you know you
could always say well no you know it was
George Washington or is Jefferson or or
you could go down the list but here's
what would be hard to
argue Biden is the worst president we've
ever
had am I
wrong I mean Jimmy carer used to be our
standard for that but Biden has
surpassed him by a mile it's not even
close not even close yeah so I feel like
we could say with some confidence he are
worst
president well over in uh the Middle
East the Battle of Rafa is happening
southern part of Gaza and Israel is now
going in apparently there's a report
about 45 Palestinians were killed in a
quote tragic mistake says Netanyahu he
called into called for an investigation
into the
deaths okay
um yeah I I I think the big story out of
Rafa is going to be the um news
blackout so if Israel doesn't get rid of
all the news they're not doing it right
and I'm sure they have and the danger
itself would get rid of the news so if
nobody knows what they're doing they can
get their job done even though we all
know there are going to be civilian
casualties because that's how War
works so that's
happening uh did you know that the one
of the guys running for office in the UK
Rishi sunk I guess he's running for
prime minister he's a vowed to introduce
mandatory uh national service for
18-year olds now national service I
think he
means in the
military why would they do that
now and didn't France Make Some Noise
about the U maybe boots on the ground
you know they might send some advisors
or something there are are we moving
like inch at a time toward American
boots on the
ground it feels like there's some entity
or power or Powers who is pushing this
toward more of a land War now I'd love
to think that we're so clever that we're
using the threat of activating a land
War involving you know France UK and the
United States that that would be maybe
to scare
Putin and that they don't really plan to
do that but if Putin thinks we are he'll
he'll take the situation more
seriously all
right
so um that's a little worrisome I
certainly don't want any wars with
Ukraine I saw um I wish I could remember
his name uh it's like Yuri
Yuri
somebody um he says all wars are based
on
imagination that we have enough food
enough land for everybody so we're not
we're not fighting for resources like we
did in the old days we're fighting over
our
imaginations so Ukraine is the
imagination of who should own
it I they're real things like National
Defense and resources and stuff like
that but at the public level what we're
talking about and of course the public
has to support a war or it doesn't
happen the public is being told that
it's about who who rightly should own
Ukraine and democracy and Putin bad and
all that that's all
imaginary this is a completely optional
War it's optional because somebody's
making money you're getting an advantage
or we want to get the get the jump on
Putin and he doesn't want us to and but
it's all because we imagine stuff and
then we go to
war all
right yeah that's a different Yuri Yuri
Geller is a different Yuri that's not
who I was talking
about
um the only
surv okay
all right ladies and
gentlemen uh UK here Rishi is all
perception narrative creation yeah so
it's probably not
real all right what is this I'm seeing a
message somebody wants me to
read
uh oh somebody's doing the math about
homos fighters versus civilians and the
claim is that it's the that the IDF is
doing a good job of protecting
civilians as as best you can in a war
zone now I don't believe any statistics
that come out of a war zone so um I
wouldn't take that too
seriously but it's not impossible I mean
it's it's within the realm
of you know easy to imagine that they're
doing a good job in Saving civilians
it's easy to imagine because it would be
in their best interest and they do have
the ability to minimize
them so all
right um I saw the name
there maybe is it oh maybe it's
Hari I I have this like partial memory
whose name is h a r
i and did he
write did he write us sapiens
was it the author of sap
sapiens there we
go uh yes you youi Harari there we go
uvi
Harari so he's been getting a lot of
attention saying stuff about you know
the
future uh but but I loved his take that
all wars are imaginary now they really
are I I've been on that page for a long
time but I've never heard anybody say it
quite as sucin that all wars are
imaginary because we don't have a uh
there's no shortage of stuff for all of
us all
right let me read this uh a YouTuber he
says lock dirty dawn up already for
January 6 Insurrection if we don't want
to see worse in the future all right JK
J live uh I'm sorry that your new
sources did this to you but I'll just
keep this simple Republicans don't stage
insurrections without
guns that doesn't happen now you were
told there was an Insurrection because
they were trying to
essentially rig the election and get
away with it which they
did they did they rigged it and got away
with it now that's that's pretty well
understood at this point so I can't tell
if you're a total troll or you just have
a a news problem I hear there's some
finished children who could clear that
up for you they're really good at
spotting fake news they've been taught
by their teachers who totally know how
to do it all right I'm going to say uh
bye now to the uh YouTube and Rumble and
X people I'm going to talk to my special
subscribers on locals thanks for joining
I'll see you the same time tomorrow but
stick with me locals people if you want
to hang out a little bit more so goodbye
