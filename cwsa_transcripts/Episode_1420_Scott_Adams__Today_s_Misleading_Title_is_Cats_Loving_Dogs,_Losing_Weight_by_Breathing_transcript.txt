hey everybody
it's time it's time for coffee with
scott adams the best
time of the entire year not to mention
the month the week and the day today i
am streaming to you from two platforms
the locals platform subscribers only
who have been talking to me for about
five minutes so far
probably in the future i'm going to be
looking to the locals people to give me
ideas
for the for the live stream i don't have
a plan yet about where i'm going to be
streaming in the future but i'll
continue on youtube and may add some
options including locals all right
if you're watching it on the uh
on the locals platform and you're a
subscriber
you would not see any commercials but
you also have the youtube option if you
prefer it
so how would you like to enjoy the
simultaneous up yeah i know you would
all you need is a cup of margarine glass
of tanker chelsea steiner canteen jugger
flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i know
you like coffee
some of you do and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dope meaning
of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip
it's gonna happen now
kevin asks how have i not spilled coffee
on a live stream yet
well it's time isn't it it's about time
all right let's talk about all the
stories uh there's a recent report
that space force is looking to
militarize the moon
now of course it's space force so it's a
military entity so of course they're
militarizing space
but when you hear those words it's
pretty scary isn't it
it's pretty scary and apparently we've
now
uh made claim to space around
you know the lunar situation the moon
it looks like it's inevitable that we'll
try to put military assets on the moon
because i think whoever controls the
moon controls everything right
so i would think that there's going to
be a massive space
race between the the major powers
to get control of the moon and pretty
much
guaranteed we're going to have a war
on the moon so that's something to look
forward
to war on the moon pretty much
guaranteed
and so we got that going on
um rasmussen reports in their polling
that 69 of conservatives say
stricter enforcement of existing gun
laws
would do more than creating new laws all
right so conservatives
almost 70 percent say all we need is the
current laws
but just enforce them better
31 percent of liberals think the current
laws are sufficient
and they would prefer new laws now let
me ask you this
how many of the people who answered the
poll conservative
and liberal how many of them even know
what the gun laws are
how many liberals could tell you what
the gun laws are
i think the conservatives probably could
come closer
because they have to navigate the gun
laws to own a gun
but if the liberals don't own guns you
probably don't even know what the laws
are
so how could they think that the laws
are sufficient or insufficient
if they don't know what they are so
any kind of poll on gun ownership
runs into this wall if people don't know
what the laws are or what they could be
or what difference it would make
so so these are kind of silly opinions
speaking of silly opinions
rasmussen also finds in a telephone
and online survey that
just 29 of likely voters
say laws including that require photo
identification at the polls
discriminate 62 percent
say voter ideas laws don't discriminate
what was that all about um
oh it looks like some people are having
problems with the stream but that'll
work itself
out all right um
so what do you think of that 29
of likely voters say requiring photo id
discriminates against voters remember i
told you that you can get a quarter of
the public
roughly you know give give or take a few
percentages
you can get a quarter of the public to
agree to
any bad idea any bad idea
a quarter of the public is going to say
yeah
if you did a poll that says how many of
you would like us to hit you in the head
with a with a pipe well you get 75
percent of people say
hit me in the head with a pipe for no
reason i
i don't like that at all 25 percent of
the public would say
give it a chance you know might work
might work out
so here we are 29 don't think
uh don't think that you need photo id
and it won't help
and the only reason is to make it hard
for people to vote
here's another one 27 of oregonians
support abolishing the police
you see this this 25 thing you know give
or take
you can get a quarter of the country up
to almost a third
to agree to anything just anything
you know i feel as if there used to be a
time when you could get 80 percent of
people to agree on something
but maybe those things don't get pulled
i suppose if 80
of the country agrees on something you
don't even bother doing the poll
because you would know it all right so
look look for this
recurring pattern that a quarter of the
public roughly
we'll have any wacked opinion just crazy
opinions
all right david boxenhorn on twitter
alerts us to a npr article about a gene
editing therapy
so apparently there's a new success
there's a gentleman who had a rare
disorder
and they did some genes editing and
apparently they edit the genes and they
insert the genes into the body or the
the edited parts
and the edited parts swim around in your
body and take hold in exactly the right
places
uh yeah it's crispr technology and
it's a it's a big story
that an incurable disease was just cured
it was somewhat rare disease but
incurable
and now cured um
but that's not the whole story the whole
story
is that this is now doable and it's
doable
on a whole other level than what we've
seen before
so probably in the next i don't know
five years it's not very far away i'd
say in the next five years we will be
editing genes
like crazy because we can do it now
yeah we should be taking on you know
various kinds of cancers and all kinds
of
blood problems and what else can you do
with this can you fix that
fix eyesight what do you think
but apparently there is some kind of
specific kind of blindness that can be
fixed with this technology or
potentially but what about just being
nearsighted
i don't know is that is that genetic or
is that just
age so there's nothing you can do about
it or can you reverse aging
can you do some gene splicing and make
somebody live longer
so i told you that uh people like me
probably according to the science have a
special gene situation
that allows me to sleep far less than
other people and still
still function yeah baldness baldness
will probably get fixed
if you have the option let's say you're
a normal sleeper
if you have the option to do some gene
therapy
so that five hours of sleep would just
be great for you
as it is for me i was just born that way
um would you do it would you enhance
your body without super power
just because you could if if you knew it
was safe enough
and you could just get a little gene
therapy and it would take
three hours of sleep off your day would
you do it
i'm looking at your comments mostly
knows because people say they like sleep
i think i think that makes sense but a
number of you would do it
because you would i don't know how to
tell you this but i have two lifetimes
for year one because those morning hours
that i'm awake that most of you are
asleep
i do the equivalent of a full day's work
play entertainment i mean i i stuff 24
hours into like three or four hours
because they're such good hours you know
brain is maximum
i'm not tired i'm happy to be alive
so i literally lead the equivalent of
two lifetimes and i like being alive
it's kind of cool so having two
lifetimes during year one
is really good stuff if you could get
gene therapy and have two lifetimes
instead of one
and trust me that second lifetime the
one when you're sleeping
is great it's way better than the other
one
the other life where you know
everybody's awake and i'm just
interacting with the world is good
it's a perfectly fine life but the one
when you guys are asleep
most of you is really good
that part of the day is really good
that's why i enjoy it so much
all right um so that's part of the
golden age that's coming
i am still fascinated by the following
question
that i know many of you feel that you
have a solid answer to
i'm not going to talk about the question
of whether masks work i know i know you
don't hear that anymore
but i'm still fascinated by the
solidarity of the experts
and and why that is now the speculation
that people have given me
is that the reason that the top experts
for every country
and every state in the union the united
states every one of them
say that masks work while the science
according to many of you is less clear
why is it that there would be so much
agreement
at the top political level of the
medical world
now many of you have said quite
reasonably you've said
scott it's not about medicine it's not
about the data
it's about people who don't want to lose
their jobs so as soon as they're told
what the
what the answer is that will be allowed
by the cdc
and the you know the fouches and the who
then all the medical experts who are the
sort of the political medical experts
you know the ones who
are helping the government make
decisions that
all of them don't want to get fired they
don't want to be embarrassed
they don't want to take a risk so they
just conform to whatever the
the consensus is and then stick to it
like they really believe it
does that explain it do you feel that
that would explain
a complete i'm really i think it's a
hundred percent
of industrialized countries main experts
say
that masks do work in specific
situations let's say
in retirement homes and stuff like that
not necessarily outside
i don't think anybody thinks they work
outdoors
but do you think that that explains it
all that you can explain the entire
situation
by the fact that the experts are lying
to you
and that they're just agreeing with with
a dogma
and that they're literally just lying to
you that it's their own opinion
do you buy that do you buy
that they would so quickly form around
that opinion
well here's the the wrinkle
didn't the medical community completely
form around the opinion
the masks don't work before they
completely
surrounded the opinion that they do do a
fact check on me
when fauci and the who and the surgeon
general etc in the united states
we're saying masks definitely won't help
because that's what they said at first
what was the consensus of the entire
medical community
didn't they agree do a fact check on me
because i don't remember exactly
but i feel as if i didn't see any
major medical expert let's say the head
of an organization or something
disagree with that right and did any
data change
was there any change in data from the
time that fauci
said no mess don't work don't do it
to the time you said they totally work
and you should do it all the time
did any data change i don't think so
because it wasn't enough time right
nobody did a study or anything like that
so if it's true that the experts went
from
completely saying x is true
to completely saying x is untrue
or the reverse with no change in the
data
then i believe that your opinions would
be
fair to say that there's nothing the
experts are saying
which should be taken as credible
is that amazing how amazing is it that
we can say that
statement and you don't you're probably
all saying
you get a point there's probably nobody
here who is listening to this or almost
nobody
who says yes scott that's crazy that
you're not listening to the experts
because the experts are completely
divorced from the data
if they can have two separate opinions
completely reversed
with no change in data we just watched
it
so i would have said not long ago that
it's a crazy opinion
that the entire medical community could
be just following the leader
like that's it you can't find an honest
broker
among the entire senior echelon of
medical
experts working for the governments
nobody
but maybe we just saw a public
demonstration of exactly that
we may have just watched it right in
front of our eyes and that's
really amazing you know independent of
whether masks work or not
the the psychology of this just is
amazing
all right um but i would add this little
caveat which is
in the rare situation where experts were
told masks
don't work and then told that they do
that would seem to me my common sense
would tell me
which of course is a real problem we
don't really have common sense
we have the illusion of common sense but
my illusion of common sense
is that when you have a situation where
it rapidly goes from
don't use them to yeah you'd better use
them everywhere that you would have
plenty of doctors
in that situation who would not feel at
risk
for a while right so the moment when the
opinion changed
from definitely don't do it to
definitely do it
that was the time everybody was free if
you were a medical expert during the
transition
of don't do it to do it
how could you be fired for your opinion
because for a while both opinions were
out there
you know with equal strength so that was
a point
where you should have seen a lot of
disagreement
do you remember eddie i don't remember
any
i feel as if it was just a switch and
what does that tell you you can't even
get disagreement during a time when
you're switching from yes to now
even if it's just briefly like a few
weeks maybe we should have seen
all kinds of experts saying whoa we
think yes and other experts saying whoa
we say no something is very wrong here
yeah and i i see you're mentioning
ivormectin every
every few minutes and so the question is
could the medical community be
as wrong about a therapeutic
yes yes the the old thinking that
the medical community could not be so um
so group thinky and so afraid and so
disreputable that they could just go
with
go with a lie because it's easier for
their career there was there was a time
i wanted to believe that could happen
i believe it now i do believe now
that the medical community is divorced
from the data
on a lot of big questions not all of
them
but any question that has a political
dimension
the data doesn't matter at all it just
seems to make no difference
we get opposite decisions with the same
data
so there you go on that
there's a little fake news i think
coming
about nike so nike's president
recently said this nike is a brand that
is of
china and for china how do you interpret
that
that the president of nike said nike is
a brand that is of china and for china
well i think the way it's being
interpreted is that
therefore nike has to do whatever china
wants them to do
which is fair i think that's a fair
statement
but what do they mean by it are they
throwing their allegiance behind china
versus some other country
here's what i think it means i think the
context was
probably when they say nike is a brand
that is of china
i think they mean that their their stuff
is made in china
now that would just be a fact right to
say that nike is of china meaning that
china makes their products that would
just be a fact
and then they say for china does that
just mean they sell
they sell their products into china so
there's nothing really being said here
which is
china makes our products we already knew
that and china buys our products
which we already knew so i don't think
there's anything new here
but the way it's stated especially out
of context makes it look
a little extra bad
and it is bad it's bad because there's a
major company
about as major as you can get that
really just has to do what
our uh our adversary wants them to do
so that's not cool
um adam on uh on twitter
adam dopamine is his handle
uh he tweeted this he says scott adams
predicted the country would believe
we had elected two presidents after the
2020 vote
true i predicted that we would elect
two presidents not one or at least in
our minds
legally there would be one but that in
our minds there would be two presidents
that was my actual prediction and adam
points out when presented with a coin to
us
who else called side how many people
predicted
that when you flip the coin it would
land on its side and stay there
just me i didn't hear anybody else knew
it did you
i believe i'm the only person who said
that we won't have a result in the
election
we'll have two presidents sure enough
the loudest cheer of the night
in trump's rally was trump won and i
guess the crowd
went wild and i think
you know half of the people in this
country or more are concerned about the
integrity of the election
the last election so what do you say
was my production correct that we got
two presidents
kinda it was so that's one of my weirder
predictions
here's another prediction that we don't
know if it's right yet
but it's weird all right so remember
when
biden said he would sign the
infrastructure bill that a bipartisan
commission came up with
and i said not so soon
just because sorry just because the news
is reporting
that we have a deal democrat
uh participants said yes republican
participants in the little working group
said yes and biden said yes so the news
news said we got a deal and i told you
no we don't we don't have a deal
they're just completely wrong about that
well it only took a few hours for biden
to say
when i said i was going to sign it i
didn't mean i'd sign it
what i meant was if an entirely an
entirely
different bill full of stuff that i
wanted that i didn't get
if that is given to me at the same time
i'll
sign the bill but not unless i get this
other bill
which is unlikely to be happening
so basically he said he wasn't going to
sign it after he said he signed it
but then there was some pushback and the
democrats got embarrassed
because biden was confused again
am i signing it am i not signing it kind
of pathetic
it kind of makes them even more
obviously not capable so they tried to
clean it up by saying no no no
we didn't mean that what we meant was he
totally signed that one bill
now you still need congress
right congress still has to sign the
thing
do you think they will why would they
why would congress agree just because
the committee came up with a bipartisan
agreement and biden said he'd sign it
why would that make the rest of the
congress agree
it wouldn't in all likelihood it would
just be defeated
so my prediction is that everybody who
says yes looks like a done deal
everybody's agreed
i don't think so i think we live in a
world where everything gets stopped
just because they can so one side will
stop it
now hold hold that prediction because it
is possible that it'll get signed
i'm not going to say it's impossible but
i'm going to say the odds are
that we're not that close to getting
this signed so i'm going to put a
i'll put a let's say a limiter on it
i'll say before the end of the year they
won't get anything
signed eventually someday maybe
something gets signed
but i'm going to say before the end of
the year no infrastructure deal
that'll be my prediction going against
the grain
apparently biden's popularity is doing
pretty well in some categories
for example he's getting uh good marks
and yeah he's getting good marks for
uh handling the coronavirus pandemic
and by the way would you agree would
would most of you agree that biden does
get high marks
for handling the pandemic i feel like
that would be a fair statement
i also feel that he inherited a really
good situation
i'm seeing a bunch of no's because it's
a political question
but um i think biden is doing well on
vaccinations because
trump set him up to do well whoever was
president was going to do well
because of what trump did to prepare
right if trump had not done what he did
project warp speed get the vaccinations
up you know kick some ass
knock down some walls the things that
trump is the best at
if he had not done that would biden be
so popular
for doing a good job i don't think so
look at
australia australia has about four
percent vaccination rate and they're
just closed down sydney again
think about it the united states is
opening up
i think for good australia has
four percent vaccination rate and they
just
locked down sydney imagine if a major
city in the
united states got locked down this week
we'd be going nuts about that remember i
told you that
you can't judge how well any country
does in the pandemic
until it's over because i predicted that
some countries would start well
maybe for reasons that we don't even
understand other countries would not do
so well
also for reasons we don't understand but
that by the time you got to the end
we'd be smarter about what works and
that the united states
because of its capability you know it's
its wealth its capability we do
there are a lot of things we do well
compared to other countries
and i predicted that we would come out
towards the
the top end of good good outcomes
but it would take until the end right
here we are australia was a model of
good behavior
and keeping the the virus out in the
beginning right
if you looked in the first months of the
pandemic australia
a plus united states marant
d minus how about now
how would you score it now right now you
would give australia an
f you would give australia a failing
grade
as of today and you would give the
united states
maybe an a right because we're going to
get to the end of this
in really solid situation
on top of that there's news today that
the
at least the mrna vaccinations the ones
where you need two of them
appear to have permanent benefit
so the indication from a new study
is that their benefit is lasting and
permanent maybe not the j and j shot
but the mrna ones might be permanent
permanent protection and at the same
time they protect against the variants
that's trump now maybe he got lucky
right because
i don't know that anybody knew the
vaccinations would be this
powerful and i know you're worried about
them and i know that there's concern
about side effects and i'm not
minimizing that
but i'm just saying at this point it
looks like
the united states thanks mostly to trump
is going to kick the ass of almost every
country
when it comes to the coronavirus it
looks like that's going to happen
so that was one of my predictions as
well that we would come from behind
all right so i was talking about biden's
popularity so biden is popularity
because of handling
the coronavirus but mostly that was
trump
trump gave him a situation that pretty
much guaranteed
that whoever took over was going to
succeed because it's not like biden
was sitting in on the meetings on the
rollout it's like
okay you know you're going to get three
trucks you're going to drive that
vaccine down to florida it's not like
any of the presidents are going to be
involved in the
logistics that was going to happen the
way it was going to happen no matter who
was in charge
right because it was going to be top
priority there would be money
plenty of people to work on and plenty
of assets it was going to work
we had everything we needed to make the
rollout work you would have had to try
hard to screw it up
and apparently we didn't so he's got
that going for him the other thing that
biden is doing well on
is the economy biden
is doing well on the economy
why why is biden getting high marks on
the economy
is it because of how he's changed the
tax plan
well he hasn't changed it right he's
proposed things
but nothing's changed the economy that
we have now
is trump's economy now you could say you
know give or take the
stimulus and packages and stuff that
maybe that was important
but it looks like the two things that
make biden popular
the economy and the coronavirus handling
were both trump trump put the economy in
the strongest position it ever was
so that after the pandemic was over it
would just
explode again exactly what we saw
but if the economy had been weak before
the pandemic
why would you expect it to be strong now
obviously you wouldn't
so um the things that
biden is not doing well on are
immigration
which trump did better trump did that
better
i think you could just say that
objectively that in terms of at least
restricting it he did better you could
argue about the humanity of it that's a
different
argument um and biden is doing
poorly in his relationship with russia
and china
some of our biggest challenges how to
handle russia how to handle china
biden's doing better and what about
north korea well north korea isn't
terribly important at the moment
because trump fixed it
trump fixed it the you know the wars in
the middle east i guess biden is bombing
some iranian assets
in syria because they had some drone
attacks come out of there
but basically even the middle east is
kind of in the best shape it's been in a
long time
because of trump right so
everything about biden can be seen
through a filter of what trump did
so far it's not even about biden if
biden does anything to the economy is it
going to make it better
probably not because it doesn't seem to
need anything right now
except maybe some debt relief we'll see
if you can do anything about that
all right i got a question for you the
the people on
the political right are quite obsessed
about the uh source of the coronavirus
did it come out of the wuhan lab and
importantly are obsessed by
whether anthony fauci was part of any
recommending or
funding that went into the wuhan lab and
specifically that
you know coronavirus part and then ended
up with a
worldwide pandemic and the question i
ask you is
why do you care about that you assume
you care
and i sort i also care but why
why suppose you found out
that anthony fauci was behind the
recommending or the funding of the wuhan
lab
what difference would that make because
he's clearly not
he wasn't funding military military
um gain of function
does anybody think that if what he was
doing was funding things that
scientists working in that field
believed should have been funded which
just sounds like that was that's what it
was
then all he did was fund the thing that
people thought should get funded
because we need to be able to protect
against the gain of function we need to
understand it etc
now if that funding went somewhere that
produced something bad
is that fauci's problem even if he did
and i think
i think he's denying that he necessarily
did anything that would fund it so i
think there's some
question about the fact pattern here too
but what if it is true
why is that a problem because that
sounds like his job
wouldn't his job be to make sure that
money got to the places that were
researching the things that
we thought should be researched i don't
even understand the
the issue now i i see the issue of he
may have lied about his involvement
but in the political world that's sort
of a political lie isn't it
suppose what he did was he was involved
in some way with some funding
that did in fact make its way over to
the lab
but if you ask him he says no i i funded
this entity but then this entity funded
them
so it wasn't me it was the other entity
those are just sort of political
differences right
it's not a lie and it's not true it's
just a way of looking at it
well in one point of view i didn't fund
them
but from another point of view you could
say i did it's just like every science
not every science but every political
question you look at the same facts and
just interpret them differently
so my question is this i'm not
doubting whether he funded them i don't
know
but i don't know what difference it
makes other than the fact that he may
have lied about it
but probably not a science lie
probably a political lie as in well i
funded people who funded it
but that doesn't mean i funded it or
something like that you know where it's
where it's a little gray area i think
that's where that's gonna end up
um i don't buy into the fact or the
allegation that fauci
is attempting to do something bad
or did attempt to do something bad for
the country
why would he i you know
if he was doing something that had a
personal financial
interest i'd want to know more about
that
yeah so don is saying he is evil i would
say that
if that's your interpretation the fouchy
is
evil then you are brainwashed
because that's that's the brainwashing
take
he could be somebody who did something
that
was good for his financial interests
that
that's possible also thinking it was
good for the country perhaps
but evil really
if you're if your opinion of him is that
he's evil
you mean that he intentionally set out
to do something bad to the world
i don't think there's evidence of that
so
if you say to yourself he may have
misled congress
by shading the truth about how things
got funded or his involvement i'd say
yeah
probably that would be just a typical
political thing to
to shade your involvement and frame it
the way this makes you sound good
but that's not evil that's just a
tuesday
now i don't want to be the one to defend
him so don't get me wrong
if there's something he did that's bad
let's
let's know about it but i'm not aware of
anything and i've been watching the news
pretty carefully
and everything i see might be true
in terms of his his funding influence
i don't know how it makes any difference
so rachel says the argument is that
there is no good
game of function uh
i don't i've not seen that argument i
don't believe
that that's true that there's no such
thing as good
game the function research because at
the very least
you would want to know how the bad guys
were doing it
so you'd have to do it to see if it
works and then you'd have something to
make a vaccine against
or at least find out what's possible and
what's not i feel like you'd have to do
the gate of function
stuff just to know how to defend against
it
i think all right
um so we're still hearing from cnn
about the big lie and they've done a
good job of branding this by the way
so their branding is very consistent
talking about trump's claim that the
election was not
uh not valid uh in terms of the
the vote counting and
according to cnn
it looks like that argument is getting
smaller and smaller meaning that
all of the possible ways that any fraud
could be discovered seemed to be
not happening so the it looks like the
last
thing that might produce
some kind of surprise would be the
arizona maricopa audit
which is apparently done they've
completed it but we don't know the
outcome
and it's already being criticized for
being sloppy
meaning that they've sort of vaccinated
the public into thinking
oh yeah there's an audit happening but
let us tell you all the ways they're
doing it wrong
so that if something comes out of it we
can just say well we told you it wasn't
done right
so there's your result wasn't done right
doesn't mean anything
so we're being set up brainwashed really
we're being into
believing that even if something comes
out of that audit
it won't mean anything
um how does it make sense to have the
research done in china
and banned in the u.s the the reason it
makes sense is that they're willing to
do it there
that's it they were willing to do it
there
that's all you need all right um
so what do you believe at this point
it's been a while right if there were
irregularities
wouldn't you know about them by now i
mean proven irregularities wouldn't that
be in the news by now
do you really believe that all of the
people involved in the arizona maricopa
audit
that if they had the goods you wouldn't
know about that by now
do you think do you think that they
would be able to sit on that
for days if not weeks if they had the
goods in maricopa
not a chance not a chance so here's
here's another lesson in prediction
nobody can keep that secret there are
definitely kinds of secrets you could
keep
here's a secret you could keep we didn't
find anything
right remember how impressed we were
that um
the the russia collusion project with
mueller
weren't you impressed that we didn't
hear leaks
well maybe there's a reason maybe when
the leak
is we didn't find anything people can
keep that secret
because the people who are keeping that
secret wanted you think maybe they did
find something
because the longer you thought maybe
there is something the better it was for
the individuals doing it in other words
if they were anti-trump
they didn't want to give you the result
too fast
this showed there wasn't anything there
so i think maybe
people can keep a secret when there's
nothing there
do you know when people can't ever keep
a secret ever
when there's lots of people involved
right the maricopa audit would have lots
of people involved
family members would be hearing it etc
people don't keep secrets that well
if they found a big old smoking gun
you would know it by now you wouldn't
know the details necessarily
but people would be saying wait till
tuesday
wink wink wink we've got it
we've got you now hold on the details
but we got you and you know you would
have heard that by now
right so if you have optimism that the
maricopa
audit is going to be the one that brings
it home
you should probably release on that
now it might be that they have some
allegations that are interesting
and then they'll be doubted of course
because the the
alleged sloppiness of it all so whatever
they come up with will be doubted
but i'll tell you what's not going to
happen a big
shocking provable error
deliberate or otherwise that would
change the results
you would know that by now guaranteed
all right so that's how to predict the
future if
they found nothing they might be able to
keep the secret and that looks like what
they're doing
but if they found something nobody's
going to keep that secret
they don't have any reason to keep it
they would at least tell you a bombshell
is coming
right can you imagine that they did this
whole audit
and nobody involved has told you might
be a bombshell coming
of course they would tell you that of
course they would if they had one
all right um we have a continuing
oh and here's my question about the
audits can these audits let's say the
maricopa audit
could it tell us if there was any um
let's say any bad behavior involving
software or databases
or hardware would their audit pick that
up
in other words are they counting and
looking at the right things
that they could eliminate the
possibility that the machines had any
any issues with them i think not
but i need a fact check on that because
it would seem that the most likely
place that somebody would hide a major
fraud
would be in the software i'm not making
any allegations that that happened i'm
just asking the question how easily
could it be discovered
if it did and would this particular
audit even have the tools
to look into it if they could so i don't
know that we'll know anything uh
conclusive that's the way the world we
live in
um oh
sparky says the main problem with
atheists is that not that they don't
believe in
the supernatural but that they don't
believe that evil
exists well i don't call myself an
atheist
but i do not believe that evil exists
except
as a frame for people
there are definitely people who like to
hurt other people
and enjoy it and go out of their way to
do it that's real
if you want to call that evil that's
just a labeling thing
so more and more small businesses are
finding they can't hire people
because people will take a very small
amount of free money
and prefer it over a larger amount of
money they have to work for
not too surprising now it seems to me
that most of these unemployed people are
living with somebody who is feeding them
meaning parents or
or a spouse or something and
it is kind of shocking how many people
are not willing to go back to work
it's really quite shocking but it
certainly says that our economy is
healthy
it also says that unemployment might
might not matter that much
because the people who are unemployed
seem to be doing okay
they're not trying too hard to get back
to work at least in this environment
where they're getting free checks
and that is almost what i wanted to talk
about
the the daily mail which i
i enjoy watching because it's fun to see
how great britain is handling you know
let's say the wokeness stuff
so if you're not familiar with the daily
mail that handles you know the news of
the day
but they also in a very uh british way i
guess
have lots of tabloid things along the
the side of the
the page um
yeah i can give a shout out to meek
comic on locals
uh so meet comic came to locals huh
good to have you so if you want to
subscribe to meet comics that would be
on the local
subscription platform
anyway the daily mail is trying to deal
with the fact that one of their the
biggest parts of their
business model is showing
attractive women sometimes men but it's
usually women
and then making comments about their
appearance
and i've been amused at the trouble that
they're having because they're trying to
keep this business model
of sort of making a big deal about
women's bodies
but they're in an era where it's
more acceptable to say that anybody
looks beautiful
no matter let's say their weight or what
they were born with
right so the old standard the old
sexist standard that we're releasing on
is that
you could open a publication and it
would say look at this
hot 25 year old in a bikini and
everybody was good with that or at least
everybody in in great britain was good
enough with it that
it allowed they allowed that to go on
but now they can't do that
so they have to come up with new ways to
complement
the appearance of people who are let's
say
less than perfect looking because that's
the new standard
you're beautiful at any weight you're
beautiful at any age
you're just beautiful the way you are so
here are some of the
words that they're using this is just
from today
uh i won't even tell you who they're
talking about but somebody had a very
eye-popping display
so if somebody says to you
that you're you're putting on an
eye-popping display
are they saying that you're beautiful or
sexy
no not exactly but you put on an
eye-popping display
here's another one this quote
leaves would leave little to the
imagination
in billowing gowns while some other
person i won't mention
works a bedazzled jumpsuit
so the best they can say about the
beauty of this particular celebrity
is that she's working a bedazzled
jumpsuit
let me tell you if the news ever says
about you the best thing they can say
about you is that you're working a
bedazzled jumpsuit
maybe you should go to the gym that's
all i'm saying and if the best you can
do
is leave a little to the imagination in
a billowing gown
well maybe maybe you could
you know work on your diet a little bit
here's another one somebody sizzles in a
tiny metallic bikini
they sizzled were they attractive
were they great looking were they sexy i
don't know but they sizzled
they were sizzling here's another one
somebody flashed a major sideboob
in a plunging halter top but did it look
good
was it attractive was it hot
does it make you excited well we don't
know but we know that that
that side boop got flashed in a plunging
halter top
and then there's somebody else who has a
jaw-dropping figure
a jaw-dropping figure is a jaw-dropping
figure
a good one one that looks like
a fitness model or is it somebody who's
more subjectively beautiful but not
according to the classic model shall we
say
so watching the daily mail struggle with
how to complement people
who do not look like the classic you
know
perfect sculpture kind of people that
got complimented in the
70s through 90s is kind of funny
kind of funny
uh and what's robot reason news gonna
say well i will tell you this
for those of you who are not on my
local's channel
that the most recent robots read news my
alternative comic that i run
mostly on locals use the naughtiest word
i've ever used in the comic that's right
the worst word you can ever use in
public
is now the subject of a comic but you
won't be able to see it here
because i would get cancelled for it yes
it's naughty
it's terribly naughty all right uh
i see there's somebody here who reads
reads me on locals
all right i'm gonna go for now i'm gonna
turn off uh
youtube i'll see you youtubers tomorrow
i'm going to
say a little bit more to the locals
people who will stay signed on
and i will see you tomorrow
