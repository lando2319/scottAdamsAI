you're probably wondering where I was
did you miss me
a little technical difficulty here
technical difficulties almost solved
hold on
well you probably asking yourself Scott
why did it take so damn long to sign on
and you've never been late before
what happened
well
turns out that the news was too
interesting today
yeah I was up at four
and uh I had no idea what time it was
and imagine my surprise when I looked at
the clock
so here we are
anybody want a show
oh yeah oh yeah you do
oh yeah you do
do do do do do
and if you like this show to be the best
thing you've ever seen in your life all
you need is a couple of my girl glass
attack your chalices Diana canteen
Chocolate flaska Festival of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee enjoy me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine it the other
day the thing makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous stuff it
happens now
foreign
about damn time is correct
all right we're going to start with the
biggest stories of the day and then
we'll we'll work down to the smaller
stories
biggest story of the day is comedian
Wayne Brady has come out as pansexual
pansexual
it has nothing to do with cooking
utensils
I'm told that pansexual means that he's
attracted to uh
penises for men but also penises on
women
and vaginas of all types
be they on men or women
and
I'm so jealous
that I did not think of this first
yeah does it doesn't it seem uh
it seems a little bit underwhelming to
command as gay in 2023 doesn't it
can you imagine somebody who let's say
some celebrity who comes out as gay it's
like hey everybody I'm gay and the old
country goes
yeah yeah I don't care no seriously
everybody I'm gay I'm gay yeah whatever
no seriously I'm super gay yeah whatever
whatever
nobody cares
I'm bisexual
seriously you can't even go full gay no
I'm coming out I'm coming out as
bisexual
not really very interesting
not interesting
I'm pansexual hello
you have my interest now
pansexual you say
do you like
Leah Thomas's penis
perhaps it's more about the individual
but yes that would be perfectly
acceptable to me
I like everything in the band
so anyway Wayne Brady uh has owned the
news cycle pansexual if you if you were
thinking of coming out as simply gay
save it nobody cares just save it
nobody's going to be excited about that
you better go all the way to pan
uh Dr Jordan Peterson had an interesting
tweet today about politically correct
authoritarianism
I guess that's where the government
tells you you got to be using certain
languages and doing certain things to be
politically correct and he says that our
reasons
the the news is wonderfully subversive
today
uh mostly people's commentary on the
news but it's like a weirdly
it's just a weird day but I'll give you
the news and you'll see it for yourself
so Dr Peterson says our research
indicated that the strongest predictor
of politically correct authoritarianism
was in fact lower verbal intelligence
then after being dumb
you know lower verbal intelligence so
after being after having a low IQ the
next most important factor was being a
female
I'm not saying it
I'm not saying it this is Jordan
Peterson's tweet this is not me
or having a feminine temperament so you
could be female or you could
be female-ish I guess whatever feminine
temperament is
and uh and whether or not you've ever
taken a politically correct course in
college or or School in that order but
the intelligence effects was was the
strongest one
now I always say
wouldn't you want to see
uh opinion polls that are separated by
how smart people are
and ideally how well informed they are
in the topic that's being pulled
what does it tell us when you when you
do a poll of the average person
well the average person
thinks that snow and ice cream are the
same thing
what does that tell you
well the average person
you know you know it's the least useful
information in the world
what the average person wants or things
or believes or prefers the average
person is the least important thing
I really really want to know what the
smart people think
and it would be really helpful to know
what the dumb people think
so you can know what to avoid
but anyway so I think it's diabolical
that Jordan Peterson actually had to
research
showing that if your Dogma or a woman or
you act like a woman
this is not me this is not me this is
his research I'm just telling you what
he's saying so don't blame me
all right uh I I just like that because
it's so provocative it's just going to
make people's heads explode so it's fun
um all right as you know I put together
a long list
of what types of things to look for to
tell us the news is credible
or not credible but likewise with
arguments
wouldn't you like to know a tell
for when somebody is brainwashed
versus someone who's just trying to
argue with the data and that is actually
trying to figure out what's going on
and I saw an example of that in the wild
I saw somebody give some data climate
change was the topic but it doesn't
matter what topic it is
the
so here's here's the setup
one person on Twitter said uh 98 of this
or whatever so there was some statistics
but no source
the other person uh debated it with an
analogy
which one of them was brainwashed
the person who had data but no Source at
least it wasn't mentioned or the person
with the analogy
who answered a data argument with an
analogy
at the very least the analogy person
at the very least the the analogy is
just such a tip-off for brainwashing it
really is
because
if you need an analogy
that's basically signaling I don't have
any facts or logic
or causation
I've got nothing I'm going to tell you a
story with some words and I'm going to
make you think that the words I'm using
about a totally different topic are
going to persuade you on this unrelated
topic because the words over here sound
a little like words that could be over
here
yeah this is brainwashing so if somebody
tells you their analogy is working
brainwashing I got into that argument
and somebody went all Aristotle on me
apparently Aristotle's got some quote
where the metaphor is a sign of Genius
okay
okay
um
so so that's it uh and Joe Moore had a
good quote today he said analogy is the
poor man's thinking which is funny
because that's an analogy
um all right is it an algae Poor Man's
thinking
is it
sort of like that all right
here's my question to you do you think
that corruption in the U.S government
has reached an all-time high
God like everything's wrong today I had
lots of technical difficulties today so
bear with me
as I improve the quality there we go
hello
much better
um do you think that the that the
country is more corrupt or that we just
know it
because of X slash Twitter being
uncensored now
because I'm looking at the news today
and everything in my feed was about the
government being corrupt
it felt like all the stories have some
angle of government corruption or
or media corruption
which I would consider the government at
this point I don't think the government
and the media are that separate entities
as they should be
well
well so I don't know the answer to the
question
it is entirely possible that governments
have always been about the same amount
of corruption since the beginning of
time you know it could be I don't know
just whatever anytime you have a
government maybe it's 60 corrupt or
something
so I don't know if it's different but I
do know I'm seeing a lot more of it
I do know that my visibility to the
corruption seems to be at an all-time
high
and I'll talk about some of the stories
but you can sort of see it everywhere
and I feel that that's the X effect you
know the Twitter X
is anybody feeling the same thing that
you're seeing more stories of government
corruption than you've ever seen
and it's only because of Twitter
this is like a really really big effect
in the United States that I don't think
has been completely
you know sussed out for what this means
for us
now I would imagine that everybody who
doesn't like what's on Twitter is saying
oh it's a bunch of right-wing stuff
because suddenly Elon Musk decided he's
a right-winger
which again is propaganda he's the least
right-winger you know of any right
winger
but uh just because he's interested in
what's true that makes him a right
winger
that is kind of what's Happening you
know is basically he's interested in
what's actually true and that looks
right wing
which is weird
it um
uh Derek Chauvin is one of his police
Partners Tao Tao or tutao I don't know
how to pronounce his name was pronounced
was sentenced to 57 months for his
participation in the death of
George Floyd
I'll read you uh Mike cernovich's tweet
that I agree with he said as these
legalized lynchings continue meaning the
lynching of the police officer cities
become houses of Horror
true does anyone believe the world would
have been better off with this man in
prison meaning the police officer and
George Floyd Running Free
and
I look on Twitter and I see somebody
that I follow and I'm not going to name
names
but somebody I follow actually
bought completely into the I guess the
government narrative about what was
going on there
and
here's my take
intentional murder is the least likely
explanation of what happened to George
Floyd
it's the least likely explanation
because we're asked to believe see if
this is wrong just check me on this have
we not been asked to believe that these
police officers
casually
casually
intentionally murdered somebody or even
casually put somebody in a situation
where they were likely to die casually
without any real worry about it in front
of a group of witnesses
who were obviously filming them
and the public of the United States was
asked to believe that these people the
police officers casually either
intentionally or through horrific bad
judgment that was common to all of them
at the same time it was common to all of
them and that that's what actually
happened in that situation
obviously that's not what happened
obviously obviously these are police
officers who are lynched by the system
obviously the jurors had no choice
because they didn't want to go into
public having not lynched these guys
now we can say it today because I'm
canceled you know I'm canceled and
certavich is basically has no fear
apparently so we can say it because some
time has gone by but that is the reality
the reality is that we were asked as a
public to accept something that was
plainly not true we can see it for
ourselves right now
has anything else like that happened
yes what about the January 6th story
January 6 we are asked to believe that
people who are trespassing
without weapons
had a plan to conquer the United States
and we were asked to believe that like
well it's just obvious it's obvious that
when people trespass and saunter around
and steal lecterns
that that must be part of a plot for an
Insurrection to conquer the United
States because there's nothing that will
conquer a country faster
than sauntering around in their Capitol
building for a few hours oh yeah that's
how you conquer a country right
there
you know it makes you wonder why we
didn't do it to Russia send in a few
saunterers
until the country is completely
conquered
that works right the the the public has
been asked to believe
that that was actually an insurrection
that our government is asking you know
at least part of the government is
asking us to believe that
is that more or less ridiculous than
believing that the police officers
casually and in front of filming
citizens with cameras murdered a guy or
you know allowed something terrible to
happen that they knew was going to
happen or should have known
these are ridiculous things to ask the
public to believe ridiculous
how about uh the current news
that the big guy who is referenced in
documents about the Ukraine and Hunter
Biden and all that that the big guy
didn't know about anything and didn't
get any money
there's not anybody who thinks that's
true
anybody
and we're acting like maybe it's not
true we're like just going on with our
day like oh well maybe he didn't know
about it and
possibly the big guy could be anybody
really the big guy I don't even know
what you're talking about and yes maybe
maybe Hunter was verified to have been
paying Joe Biden's bills
but
there's no evidence that money went into
his bank account people people there's
only evidence that he financially
benefited in a major way but yet there
wasn't an actual bank account you see
see so for the lack of the actual bank
account even though we know for sure
that the money was flowing in a big way
to his benefit through the paying of his
bills and the living in the big house he
couldn't afford but no there's nothing
to see here there's nothing proven I I
don't even know what you're talking
about
after they got us to believe the George
Floyd narrative after they got us to
believe the January 6th narrative
uh two fake impeachments so far
uh what else do they believe
today again we're seeing the story about
Trump mocked a disabled person when he
ran for office the first time
now I believe a hundred percent of
people on the right
have seen the compilation video where
Trump uses the same motions against you
know Ted Cruz and other people
so we know for sure that this is a
standard thing he did
and all Republicans seem to have seen
that I don't talk to anybody who is not
aware of it but how about the people on
the right on the left do you think
they've ever seen the compilation video
oh of course not and if they did what
would they think
they'd probably think oh yeah he does
use this all the time but this time he
knew this time it was different I don't
know what would they say
and
it it occurs to me
that
it would be fascinating I've said this
before it'd be fascinating to have some
kind of a show
where a typical Democrat is brought in
and is simply exposed to real
information from the first time
let's just just sit him in front of the
compilation video
or have somebody explain to them what I
just explained on any of these topics
just watch what happens just to see the
reaction
I would love to watch that because you
don't realize how how Brainwashed the
public is which includes all of us right
if you ever hear me say everybody's
brainwashed except me
you should ignore everything I say for
the rest of my life because you can't
tell if you're brainwashed you just have
to assume you are you just don't know in
what way is and you know you do the best
you can but nobody's immune from it
it's not like it's something that
happens on one side
all right
um
so uh Vivek continues to make news so
the two most interesting things in
politics well RFK Jr was interesting
today too but Vivek had two completely
interesting moments in the news he's
just the king of earned media right now
I mean Trump of course is Trump you
can't really ever I don't think anybody
will ever match Trump for being what he
is you know just a just a energy monster
but man is very good every day I've got
a new one where I shake my head all
right this one I'm not sure this helped
him
all right this may not have helped him
politically but as sure got attention
and in the context of a primary it's
pretty strong it wouldn't be so good in
the general election
but in the primary it's strong here's
what he said
and see see if you can detect any Trump
energy or influence in this
and what I mean by that is is he
treating it like it's funny
because he's talking about it a little
like Trump talks about things not not
this exact topic but just listen to this
and see if you can just feel any Trump
influence on this
uh
uh see so there's a story he calls for a
range of proposals about stuff and one
of them is having election day be a
national holiday
so far so good
does everybody like election day to be a
national holiday
make sure everybody votes
I I think it's pretty basic
I would be totally on board with that
right but here's where he gets uh
controversial
but we'll cancel one of the other ones
and make Election Day a holiday
wait what we're going to cancel one of
the other holidays
wait what what are you talking about if
you fake why could I not look away why
can't I Look Away what the hell are you
talking about everything my hair is on
fire what Are You Gonna Cancel
quote canceled Juneteenth it's
Juneteenth or one of the other useless
ones we made up
what what
are the useless ones we made up what
and then he goes on
uh you see so here's his argument he
stands with a quote presumption of
time-tested traditions
which is a hell of a good way to say
that
you you could you could spend your whole
day trying to think of you know five
words that
will you know back this uh point of view
the presumption of time tested
Traditions now I'm not saying I agree
with that point or don't
I'm saying it's masterful it's just
masterful the way he words it
but he says the quote Spirit of
Juneteenth is already represented with
holidays such as Martin Luther King Jr
day and President's Day
he says we shouldn't have redundant
holidays that celebrate overlapping
purposes you should have a distinct
purpose
he says that June teeth was a made-up
holiday under quote political duress
following the uh well they call it the
murder of George Floyd because
it's the news so they call it a murder
which he said is not how we should
create holidays
all right
I I love I love the trump-like energy in
this you know he might not like that
characterization but this is total Trump
energy
he's taken a topic that probably nobody
really thinks about or cares about and
he's made your hair catch on fire until
you want to debate this thing which has
no no importance to anybody whatsoever
now I actually disagree with his point I
think Juneteenth is a is a
perfectly acceptable holiday
I'm totally uh I'm totally a convert why
because it was literally the day that
the that every American was free
how is that not worth the holiday
the first day the first day in the
history of the country that every
American was a racism am I wrong that's
what it was
I'm not wrong about what it is right
no somebody says no I thought it was the
day that the last state got rid of
slavery
am I wrong about the history
oh somebody says you're wrong
I thought it was Texas right Texas was
the last state
oh hold on hold on
so we need we have to do a fact check
there's a lot of people were saying that
the holiday or at least what I thought
was the point of the holiday was uh
historically incorrect
that's when they found out
or somebody saying it's not when it
ended it's when somebody found out it
was that it ended
why is there any question about this
this is kind of mind-blowing
so are you telling me that if I look
into this which I haven't done so if I
were to Google this I would find that
Juneteenth is not based on a historical
truth
okay give me give me a little context
here are you saying that the story that
that was sort of a day when the last
Americans were free
that's historically incorrect
I don't know what your argument is I see
a lot of people got all upset about this
but I actually I don't have any idea
what your disagreement is I can't tell
in the comments
huh
so there's there's a narrative that
Juneteenth
or at least the the essence of it is not
true in any sense
in no sense it's true you're not talking
about like technically maybe the date is
off or something you're talking about
even in concept nothing like that
happened that's what some of you believe
oh this is really interesting
so you're saying this the day they found
out but what's wrong with that
it's they they they found out they were
free
because Texas didn't tell them is that
what you're saying
but what what's wrong with that is the
holiday the day they found out would be
the day they were free
isn't it right in Texas I get it
so let's see which which parts you agree
with this is actually fascinating to me
because you know my uh my major theme
Here is the left not knowing the news
and you're telling me that I don't know
the news and you might be right because
like I said I haven't looked into it
ah so now well let's let's do this in
real time
let us
Google it I know I know you're going to
say Google's biased but I want to see
what it says
so if I say Juneteenth in Google we'll
do Bing 2.
and I know you're screaming at me I'm
not looking up and you're screaming at
me you're saying but it's all fake on
Google I know just just stay with me for
a minute we're just gonna see what it
says okay
and why do we honor it
all right so this would be the first
thing that comes up
a key historical event
the day all people living in the United
States including the formerly enslaved
were officially granted freedom
so that's just not a fact some of you
think
it's just it didn't happen
what what the hell are you saying this
is the LIE what is the LIE and by the
way I'm not debating you so this is not
a debate this is me genuinely being
wowed by how wrong I could be or how
wrong you could be I don't know what the
answer is yet
but what what give me anything that's a
counter argument
all right I think I gotta count on him
uh
uh marks a day with federal troops
arrived in Galveston Texas to take
control of the state and ensure that all
enslaved people are afraid
so
so here all right here's what I'm saying
here's what I'm saying in the comments
uh and this will be a good test of the
 filter you ready
um
tries refused releases until they were
paid for them
they released later
Candace Owens says no all right so
you've you've you've presented me with
no argument
do you know that right
so I'm going to watch a little bit just
on on YouTube
you've told me I'm wrong but you've
presented no argument
it looks like you're arguing about the
about the technicality of the date
I don't have any argument about the
technicality of the date
so your argument is that it was official
in the Emancipation Proclamation I'm
seeing somebody's argument here since
the Emancipation Proclamation was
complete
you didn't need to go into the details
of how long it took somebody to find out
is that your argument
you're saying you oh I totally disagree
then okay all right if your argument is
that freedom happened with the
Emancipation Proclamation
but that the the details of making
people free and knowing they were free
took a while
is that your argument so that you should
only celebrate the Emancipation
Proclamation well we don't have a
holiday for the Emancipation well I get
I guess July 4th uh
now so is your problem that is an extra
holiday
and you don't like holidays
I I'm totally with black America on this
I hate to tell you if you were black you
wouldn't celebrate the the day that see
more meaningfully
to be about freedom
I would if I were black
and I and I would say I'm not black and
I still think it's a good call
all right well could we agree to
disagree on this one
because this is really entirely bad you
feel
right yeah if you arguing the details
that I'm not having any argument about
the details I'll give you Emancipation
Proclamation I'll give you that maybe
some of the Native Americans didn't do
some freeing of slaves until later so
I'll give you that there was lots of
stuff to work out
and that the Emancipation Proclamation
caused all the other things to get
worked out so it would be the dominant
date I'll give you that but
our holiday is about how you feel
wouldn't you say you know what Memorial
Day is about how you feel
and and hoping that you continue feel to
feel a certain way
Christmas is about how you feel I guess
I guess Halloween isn't so much about
how you feel
yeah I know the the only reason for a
holiday is that the country needs a day
off and they feel something about the
purpose of the holiday I feel something
about that I feel Juneteenth
if a bunch of other people do
I'm fine with that being a holiday
I think we needed we needed another June
holiday anyway all right I think we
settled that
is the bottom line that if you like the
Emancipation Proclamation as you're you
know your one Freedom Day that did cause
a ripple effect which caused all the
freedom with a little bit of you know
hiccups over time I'll give you that
but if people really like their
Juneteenth and it does speak to them
and June's a good time for holiday
I I see everything about that that's
good
I don't have a problem with it all
Rando says well I hope your moral
superiority is worth it
what what else is at stake was there was
there something else at stake that I
don't know about
was I going to lose money
would it cost me money
I don't I mean I don't take that day off
I don't take any day off so they're all
the same today
anyway
um are is your problem that there are
just too many black holidays now some of
you being over over black holiday you
got your
MLK and you got your Kwanzaa and you
think that Juneteenth is just too far
just too far I don't know I I think
celebrating American freedom in all its
forms can't get enough of it I can't get
enough of it
but I'll acknowledge that
you might feel that it's a little bit
too woke or something
I get that
all right so we don't need to argue
about that because would you agree with
my my bottom line feeling that whether
there is a national holiday or not
really depends how you feel
would you would you would you agree with
me on that
it's not a law it's not about money
it's just how do you feel
so if you feel different there's not
really an argument is there
you you would just acknowledge I feel
this way I acknowledge you feel that way
whoever feels the most wins I guess
all right
um
Michael schellenberger is tweeting and
writing about how the Biden White House
we know they were
trying to influence Facebook to censor
some content but what we didn't know is
how hard they strong-armed them which I
guess pushes into illegal territory not
a guess if the government is telling
somebody to censor
that feels pretty illegal to me
uh given all our freedoms and whatnot
but anyway apparently the White House
threatened
or did a let's say I don't know threats
right word but a quid pro quo with
Facebook because Facebook needed Biden
to force Europe to allow data flows into
the U.S so there was some issue that
Facebook needed solved politically and
in return for that they may have done
some extra censoring
that's really bad
that's super corrupt I don't know if
it's illegal I mean it looks like it is
but I'm no lawyer
but it's super corrupt
yeah oh and it's super corrupt not to at
least be transparent about it
you know I'm not even sure if this would
have bothered me
if it was transparent
let me think about that suppose you knew
from the start
that the U.S had agreed with Facebook
to help them but it was good for a U.S
company
would you have problems with the
government helping the U.S company
I don't think that probably that's not a
problem but we don't know for sure that
it wouldn't have happened
but the reporting is that it was used as
a specific threat
so I guess I guess you don't need to
know if they would have carried out the
threat the threat itself is suppression
and Free Speech
yeah all right so that's as bad as it
looks
um
I guess the Biden laptop and all the
Devon Archer Revelations about the big
guy
is it my imagination that except for the
very right leading media the entire
media is ignoring the story
and the latest is JB Raskin
um you said a news Nation I'm with Cuomo
and you said that uh
um Hunter Biden was obviously trying to
divert the different kinds of money into
bank accounts you know for the family
but uh Raskin says that uh he's never
but none of that involved President Joe
Biden
right so the money that went into bank
accounts went into family bank accounts
that did not include Joe Biden who may
or may not be the big guy
I wonder who is
um
and that the president quote has never
been accused meaningfully of any
corruption in his life
what
are there actually Democrats
who had listened to JB Rask and say that
Biden has never been accused of any
corruption
I thought he was famously the most
corrupt politician we've ever known and
that everybody's known it forever
he's always lived in a house that's too
big for what his income was
everybody knows it
everybody knows it and now that we've
seen the entire you know the the hunter
money making schemes and how it works in
China
Etc
everybody's accused of meaningful I mean
everybody who's seen those stories has
accused him of corruption
um
and certainly the Biden laptop thing was
corruption
I think Biden was behind the Russia
collusion hoax or at least was you know
aware of it
it's amazing that somebody could say
he's never been meaningfully accused
what but here's what's the funny thing
so we started out with Joe Biden doesn't
know anything
about hunter's business it doesn't know
anything about it
okay well there's some memos that show
maybe he knew something about it so well
you could say the cats in the tree and
you can't get them down
but no big deal you'll get the countdown
and then we find out oh you know Devin
Archer and all these other documents and
the big guy and we got the bank accounts
and the money and we know that his bills
were being played paid by Hunter and
Hunter was mad that he's been paying his
father's bills for so many years and all
that
and now now the cats
you know on the roof or not in the tree
but he's followed off the roof
and he's injured it's going to the vets
but we'll give you an update tomorrow
because now oh yeah yeah Hunter was
making a lot of money and it went to
everybody and he certainly paid the
bills for the big guy whoever the big
guy was we're not quite sure
oh my God the the fact that Rask of his
has ridden this Scandal all the way down
to he didn't have a specific bank
account for his corruption
that's what they're down to
oh yeah all of the things that looked
like they happened happened but did he
have a bank account huh
sure sure he may have been doing things
with other countries that influence
policy we might actually be involved in
a major war in Ukraine
in part because of
uh Biden's actions but here's what's
important
we haven't found a specific bank account
that's what he's relying on that's all
he has left
laughably
pathetic
all right
and then I was watching uh Ellen
dershowitz talk about Jack Smith the
prosecutor the Trump prosecutor and I
didn't know this but oh my God
oh my god do I hate my country right now
the government not the country
according to dershowitz the Jack Smith
indictment against Trump
for uh inciting inciting the violence on
January 6. the indictment included his
speech
that is being used as evidence of
incitement
and omitted the part of the speech where
he told people to be peaceful and
patriotic
he actually omitted from the indictment
the most important part
the most important part
the part where he said publicly directly
and at the moment that it mattered
peacefully and patriotically the Very
opposite of an insurrection
he left it out
and as dershowitz points out more for
cleverness than for reality that if Jack
Smith's theory that Trump's lying
cause something to happen in the real
world
and that that was bad
that the same Theory would put Jack
Smith in jail
in other words Trump is being tried
or you know be uh yeah I guess right for
uh at least indicted for exactly the
same crime in in type anyway the same
crime that the prosecutor is doing by
indicting him
and we're watching this in real time
and this guy's still on the job
he's still employed
why wouldn't you just stop everything
if I found out that the prosecutor had
worked all this time
and then had an indictment and left out
the most important piece of evidence the
most important part the exculpatory part
you should fire him and put him in jail
you should be jailed
absolutely you should be in jail
based on what we've heard now of course
everybody gets you know innocent until
proven guilty he gets a trial blah blah
blah blah but to me this looks jailable
I mean look it to me it looks like
absolute corruption
and I can't believe that Jack Smith
would do this without the Biden
Administration
either making sure in advance he would
do it or pressuring him to do it and so
to me this looks like immense government
corruption maybe the worst thing I've
ever seen possibly I mean the Russian
collusion hoax and the Biden laptop hoax
were insane insane corruption
but this might be a new level maybe
taking it to a new level and why did I
have to hear that from dershowitz
I didn't hear that on the news
I had to hear from dershowitz
who does his own little video so I can
see it if I didn't have if I didn't have
a Twitter slash X account would I know
that Jack Smith left
out of the indictment the most important
part of the information the most
important part
how would I know that
I would not know that do you think any
Democrats at all are aware that the
indictment left out the most important
part
I'll bet not I didn't know until this
morning and if I didn't know it I'm
pretty sure the left doesn't know it
it's just
everything in the news is just making
you shake your head
let's talk about that Barbie movie
Bill Marshall of the Barbie movie and uh
he wasn't loving the awokeness of it
apparently I haven't seen it but
apparently Barbie fights the patriarchy
including the board of her own Mattel
company which in the real world has
seven men and five women but in the
Barbie movie which is supposedly said in
2023 the patriarchy is in charge and
their own board is all men
and Mattel allowed that to be made
and apparently boards across the country
are you know way closer to being
Diversified with at least male and
female than ever before and so Bill
Maher is calling it a zombie lie you
know the lie that the patriarchy is
running everything and that this movie
is based on that imagine a generation of
young girls
who go to the Barbie movie
and learn that they live in a patriarchy
when actually the opposite is true at
the moment that you know the patriarchy
is pretty weak
all right
um speaking of Vivek he also did a news
interview and one of the topics was
climate change and oh my God you have to
see it it's the best I've never seen a
political figure
handle a climate change discussion
at this level
I'm going to tell you
unequivocally
unequivocably the Vivek is operating at
a level that is entirely Above the Rest
of the field
on climate change some other things as
well but but let me just give you a
sense of what he did on climate change
so the interviewer let's say is a a
believer that climate change is a big
problem
and said how do you explain to Vivek how
do you explain that Florida
won't even offer insurance for
homeowners for certain kinds of
insurance I guess because of climate
change
now what would a normal politician do
with that question
change the subject I don't know
Vivek actually showed that he knew more
about the topic than she did by far
went into the details of the insurance
business
and why she's wrong that this is about
climate change
told her what it was really about and
absolutely eviscerated her point and
that was just the first point
so the first thing she says the blah
blah Florida insurance he destroyed it
by showing that he knew more about the
topic than any politician I've ever seen
I mean he actually had a Mastery of all
the parts and he very quickly showed you
he had a Mastery of it and he even
understood all the insurance business
and all the parts and I I just my jaw
dropped I was like
did I I just watched a presidential
candidate
describe details of insurance
which was a very important question I
thought it was a good question
and he did it perfectly like when he's
done you say to yourself okay issue off
the table
that's what I thought it was like oh I
had never heard those things that's
that's a good argument and now I'm I'm
moving on
then uh
then she pointed out some you know
specific situation of places that are
hotter than ever
and then
Vivek who I remind you is running as a
republican this is important to the
story he's running as a Republican and
he says with a twinkle in his eye as
somebody's saying in the comments he
says with a twinkle in his eye
if anybody from the right
had used an anecdote to back their
scientific claims they would be mocked
oh my God
because it's even what Trump does I mean
Trump does the thing where you know if
his nose he says climate change isn't
real and you and I just groan when I
hear that like oh I know it's popular I
know it's funny
but oh I just groan
and then I see Vivek give exactly the
right answer exactly the right answer is
you're a if you're giving
me anecdotes in a science conversation
and he didn't say that
but it was so clear from the twinkle in
his eye that he just owned her just
freaking owned her on live TV it was it
was just a joy to watch to watch the
Republican so then she started
challenging him on what I imagine she
thinks I imagine
she thought would be his Conservative
Republican backwards anti-scientific
opinion of climate change
and he said he says let me explain My
Views give you some context
he says now this is Vivek don't argue
with me
I agree with him but don't argue with me
he said yes the plan is warming yes
humans are part of it
and then that's pacing pacing is the
part where you you agree with the big
part of the argument it's which he did
and then he said here's where we're
different and they said that the deaths
from temperature are down 98 percent
and then she said blah blah blah more
people dying of heat yes
but the net
because more people way more people die
of cold so the net is at a warmer Planet
saves way more lives and the thing that
saves even more lives is having access
to
fossil fuel energy
that's how you save a lot of lives
just destroyed her argument
now
to be fair she did have one argument
left that she didn't use because she
wasn't up up on the topic right so what
is what would be her best reply
to somebody saying that the warming so
far has been all positive meaning that
the net is more people alive and we're
really good at you know mitigating
temperature problems now
so that warmer means probably more uh
more foliage
so if a fake said there's actually more
trees and bushes than there were I don't
know when when climate change was
allegedly not so bad
is it the topic
is YouTube just going to turn me off or
is that just a coincidence
because I'm not having a problem on the
other platform I don't think is locals
having any problem
all right no problem on one platform all
right well that's a big coincidence
isn't it so here's so let me get back to
that so Vivek says that so far the
warming has been positive the more
people are alive less fewer people dying
of the cold we're mitigating what is the
counter argument to that because
remember the fake has already agreed
the humans are causing the warming and
it is getting warmer
what's the counter argument
there there we go yes the counter
argument is that it's a there's a limit
problem
the the counter argument is you reach a
point where you fall off a shelf
so that you reach a point where there's
something unsustainable maybe the Coral
in the ocean dies and causes a Cascade
of something something I don't know so
the argument is that it's not a uh sort
of a gradual warming and we just sort of
keep adjusting to it but rather it's
gradual until it's not
all right so that's the argument from
the climate alarm people it's going to
be okay until it's not and when it's not
it's going to be really bad bad and
Country falls apart and the World falls
apart
now I don't know that that's true
and I think Vivek would have a counter
to that which is it's been wrong every
day so far
why would it suddenly become true and
the answer is you can't get warmer
forever you know at some point
at some point isn't it disruptive
right now I do like the argument that
even though there are lots of ecosystems
that would be destroyed
I think that's a given
um wouldn't there be other ecosystems
that would be enhanced
and who's to say that the enhancing
doesn't help the poor people there
more than the degradation in this
ecosystem helps the rich people that
might be living at on the beach house
so there's nobody who's really really
done the math to find out if the warming
over here is helping the poor more than
the the warming over here you know so
nobody really knows that's an unknowable
thing
but I think uh
um I just loved the quality of this
discussion but you could see you could
see the problem here here you had one
person who knew so much more than the
host the host
didn't really have the the pushback
because there is pushback there is
uh but he didn't get it
all right
um
there's a FBI agent who's pleading
guilty
to uh colluding with Russia
well that's no big deal right I mean you
got a dirty FBI agent maybe did a little
took some money from a Russian oligarch
that's no problem let's see who is this
guy
um well he's worked on other things
before let's see
uh oh it's the same agent who started
the entire Crossfire hurricane
investigation
so he was a pivotal player in the Russia
collusion hoax
while taking money from Russia
that's I use xfbi yeah xfvi let's call
him that's uh
um yep that's just what you thought it
was
let's talk about fauci in the lab League
Barry Weiss
has more more information on this
there's a trove of emails and slide
messages and other documents revealing
the fauces behind the scenes involvement
with journalists and scientists in the
lab League Theory
and apparently there's a quote from
somebody saying Tony doesn't want his
fingerprints on the origin story
so just like you thought
the government or at least fauci as a
representative of the government was in
fact managing the media reporting
not to make it more accurate
not to make it more accurate
it was just what you thought it was if
you had bad suspicions about fauci
managing information yep it was exactly
what he thought it was
um
what else we got here all right here's
the political mistake of the day I think
from RFK Jr
so he tweeted today that he's got a
economic plan he said it's going to help
the middle class he said the average
income in our country is five thousand
dollars less than the basic cost of
living
uh the issue very good he'd like to
revive the middle class so far I like it
he says I'm going to change that over
the course of the next few weeks I'll be
releasing an economic plan that focus is
on ending the corrupt merger of state
and corporate power to make sure
Americans can you know pay their bills
basically
now he doesn't give any details of his
economic plan to come but the one thing
we know about it is that it will result
in the middle class having a lot more
cash
how do you do that
here's why I call this a political
mistake as I
tweeted in response it sounds like a
forced transfer of wealth
and if that's not the plan
I would throw in a few words like free
market
right if you don't see free market
as part of how somebody else is going to
make money
how are they going to make money
without the economy being better for
everybody
how are they going to make money
they're going to have more money when
his economic plan is it's got to be a
force transfer as in somebody gets taxed
or something like that
so
have you ever had this situation
well let me tell you a story that
happened to me I've told this story but
it fits perfectly in this case again so
many years ago I had a suspicious lump
on my throat that could have been
canceled
and I got it x-rated and I go I go to
the doctor who is going to finally tell
people what the X-ray said so the X-ray
is one process but then you have a
doctor's appointment later
to discuss it
so I'm sitting in the in the waiting
room with the other people who are in my
situation they're all waiting for the
same Doctor Who has read their x-rays to
tell them if they have cancer
so the doctor opens the door and I'm
like oh shoot don't shoot out you know
is this me or is this for somebody else
he goes uh Mrs Garcia and Mrs Garcia
raises his name he goes uh good news uh
x-rays are fine you you know you're all
good come on in I'll tell you about it
I'm like Mrs Garcia got good news it
comes out again and goes uh Mr Smith Mr
Smith everything's good come on in we'll
talk about it all clear
I'm like ah Garcia and Smith I'm next he
comes out and he goes uh Mr Adams and
I'm like yes
and he says
could you come in my office for a minute
that's why RFK Juniors to weed sounds
like to me
hey I got some news
can we talk about this privately
do you ever get good news when somebody
wants to talk to you privately
no no and when I went in and talked to
the doctor he said well it's a little
ambiguous but
probably cancer
probably
right it was exactly what you thought
if somebody doesn't give you the good
news right up front or leaves out an
important point that you know should be
there I know you should be telling me
right now do I or do not not have cancer
so I have to have another procedure
where they you know did a biopsy and
there was just nothing it was literally
nothing they just pulled some fluid out
and put a Band-Aid on it I I was as far
from having cancer as you could possibly
be it was more like a scratch
I'm either dying of cancer or possibly I
got a scratch that got infected
something like that
so uh RFK Jr I give you this advice if
this is not a forced transfer of wealth
you really need to say that right up
front
that's got to be right up front and if
it is
I'm out
because this is I gotta talk to you I'm
going to take your money situation
now
maybe it's the best way to fix things
yeah I'm always going to listen to the
argument
but if you hide that information like
what what's the core of your idea he
doesn't have to give us all the details
but he could say for example I found a
way to unleash the economic engine that
will give everybody better incomes or
uh I believe the solution is better
training and I am going to spend a whole
bunch of money on training but very
quickly that will translate into higher
incomes
I listen to that
I would say that's there's still going
to be some taxes involved but if you
tell me you're taxing me to give direct
occupational Training to people who
would benefit right away
you have my attention
I hate the fact that you might tax me
more
for the benefit of other people but if
that benefit is you know clear and
obvious and smart and would work its way
into the economy which benefits people
who already have money like me
I could be sold on that I could actually
be convinced
but if you don't start out and say you
know trading will be my focus or free
markets or I'm getting rid of some or or
even if he said I'm gonna I'm gonna
bring more manufacturing back and here's
my specific way I'm going to do it all
good all good but don't tell me you're
going to make somebody else have more
money
because that just feels like your hand
is in my pocket so since I don't know
what his plan is this is not a criticism
of the plan it's the criticism of the
communication of the plan
later I might have something to say
about the plan
and by the way this seems out of
character because this feels like just a
mistake
and I haven't seen him make anything
that look like just a mistake
yeah so we'll see
uh Rasmussen did some polling on the
Trump indictment you will not be
surprised uh the 51 percent of likely
U.S voters uh approve of the latest
Trump indictment
but of course it's separated by voter
types
so you got uh let's see 69 of percent of
Republicans disapprove
but 77 percent of Democrats approve of
course of the Trump indictments
what is this
polling telling us
you know I used to think that a poll
told you people's opinions
does it feel like that's what's
happening
do you think you saw people's opinions
it doesn't feel like an opinion to me it
feels entirely like team play plus
brainwashing
like nothing like an opinion
you know opinions suggest somebody
looked at the situation and you know put
their priorities on it and then came up
with their best case scenario as an
opinion nothing like that's happening
this is pure assigned opinions
so that you know which team is winning
or would win if their argument wins
it it just strikes me as ridiculous to
ask opinions of brainwashed people
unless you're the brainwasher and you
want to find out how well you're doing
all right
and that ladies and gentlemen
is what passes as the news
um
is it my imagination that everything
looks more corrupt than ever and only
because
Twitter slash X is not censoring this
is that what's happening
you're waking up
I'm waking up
um which team has the viral YouTuber
type of controller
huh
it's a good question has anybody ever
studied what goes viral more often on
YouTube
because you know Joe Rogan goes viral
all the time
and he's not being awoke
uh
but
but it does seem like is it true that
the most viral stuff is either left or
right leaning
um
you only look at your subscribers okay
yeah I guess I guess the question is how
can we get in on some of this corruption
all right
YouTube come back online yeah YouTube's
back online
so I thought I saw a Ukraine story
and I thought to myself have we
forgotten about Ukraine
check the news on Ukraine so now the the
news on Ukraine is always limited to
like one sentence you know or one
headline with a little story and the
story is always the same
have you noticed that all the Ukraine
stories are the same
somebody sent some weapons in One
Direction
and some people got killed
and nothing changed
there were some things there were
explodey things in the sky
that came down on the public or the
fighters
and people died there's no sense that
anything is changing in the Ukraine
right there's no sense that anything
could change
we've now completely given up on the
so-called
uh counter offensive right is there
anybody thinks that there's really a
Ukrainian counter offensive
here's what I think is happening I think
that the news went quiet on Ukraine
because fill in the blanks the news went
quiet on Ukraine because
go
um because of Hunter
and because the counter-offensive is not
working
the two things that the Biden
Administration doesn't want you to hear
that the
counter-offensive isn't working not even
close
and Hunter may have been the reason that
the war happened in the first place
so Biden can win
two ways one is if
miraculously somehow Ukraine won one and
got all his territory back
so that would be one way that Biden
could win he could make Ukraine look
like he was Victorious
that doesn't look like it's going to
happen
the other way he could win ish
is to just hold off the Russians so they
don't get any more
so they don't get any more but also to
keep himself out of the story
to make sure that the hunter part of the
story doesn't tank him
but he can't get either one
so at the moment it looks like Ukraine
there's really no chance of a counter
offensive that works I would say by now
we would know
and
the hunter part because Vivek is
bringing it up
the hunter part is really kind of
awkward now isn't it
because now you can see the intersection
or the Venn diagrams between well Hunter
was doing and what one could easily
imagine would be too much influence on
Biden the president
so there's a reason that Ukraine
disappeared in the news
am I right
tell me I'm wrong that at the very time
that everything about Ukraine is bad for
Biden it just disappeared it's not even
a news story
there's a literal War
in which we're you know primary
participants at least financially and
weapon wise and strategically
but just think about the fact that the
news went radio asylum on a war
a war
and they're not telling you anything
that's true about this at this point
all right
uh
so there's a story about the country of
Niger some Revolution happened and I saw
a tweet that I don't believe is true
but it was hilarious did you see the
Victoria Newland
story about Niger
so that the reported story which I don't
believe because it's a little it's a
little too funny it's too funny to be
true
is that Victoria Newland wanted to meet
with the revolutionaries and talk to
them
uh maybe give them some Aid and the
alleged story that I don't believe I
don't believe this is that the
Revolutionary said that we should spend
the money on a weight loss program for
Victoria Newland
do you believe that
I don't believe that I started a tweet
but I don't believe it
it's too funny
yeah it's too funny I'm going to go with
fake news on that one
let's call that one fake news okay
um but if I'm wrong
if I'm wrong I'd love to believe it
I'd love to believe it
but so yeah it's a little too perfect
all right that's all I got for you
YouTube so thanks for joining sorry I
was late I'll start looking at my clocks
in the future and I will talk to you
tomorrow
