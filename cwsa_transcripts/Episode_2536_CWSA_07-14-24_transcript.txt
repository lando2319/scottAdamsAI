[Music]
well good morning everybody and welcome
to coffee with Scott
Adams normally the most exciting
experience you'll ever have in your life
unless you were watching
television or social media
yesterday and uh you know what we're
going to be talking about today I don't
have to tell you now normally I would do
the simultaneous sip now that you would
all expect but since today we're going
to be talking about things which are
tragic things that are interesting and
even some things that seem funny but we
got to do them in the right order people
so I'd like to start with showing some
respect to the Fallen the uh one one
individual died at the Trump rally two
seriously wounded may never be the same
don't know the details yet and uh I'd
like to just do a sip to them
simultaneous though it may be so with
one exception first time ever I'd like
to just take a moment to remember
that one person died and two were
terribly injured and let's think about
them first first we'll talk about the
rest of it
after all
right are you ready for
this you ready for
this I got to change the
tone I'm going to change it right so
we're going to change on a dime I've
been working on my new Trump
impression goes like
this
fight or I have a modified version of it
that goes like
this
ow
ow
okay now You' SE the full
range I don't know about you
but I felt everything you can feel
yesterday I felt tragedy sadness when
Trump was going to live I felt happiness
but then I felt creepy because somebody
had died and how can you be
happy and I felt everything at the same
time it's probably the most feelings you
can feel in one one time so let's sort
our way through
it uh might be a little extra hard today
so I'm going to need maybe a little
extra today if you don't
mind if you know you
know well if you're the last person in
the world to hear about it Trump was out
a rally in Pennsylvania a SHO tried to
take him out and put a bullet through
his ear the Secret Service uh protected
him from that point on there are many
questions we'll talk about all them
there are political
implications and
uh in no particular order let's just
talk about it
all number one how in the world did
Trump manage to keep his wits and get
the photo of the
history I was going to say photo of the
year but it's maybe the photo of all
politics ever and it's the most iconic
thing you'll ever see in your life um he
put his fist in the air he held
fight and the the apparently the
audience was
chanting
USA and somehow the American flag was
perfectly situated in the background
it's basically an EO oima quality
photo I think the only photograph that
will be more famous than this one is
literally the raising of the flag on
uima uh and the fact that Trump had the
political instinct to know how important
that was and he fought for it like he
fought he fought the the the Secret
Service to say that and it was right it
was
perfect and there's not much else to say
about it it was
perfect
um let's talk about
uh all the bad
people but first here's a brief list of
people who predicted this
day here are the people who said
explicitly the rhetoric from the left is
going to inspire the
you got your Mike cernovich your Alex
Jones Tucker Carlson Steve Bannon Greg
guffi Jesse Waters Jack babic John Niti
Breitbart and me now that's a very
partial list do you know why the list is
partial cuz I don't have time to list
all the people who saw this coming we
all saw it coming it was clear as
day and anybody who says
well I can't imagine that the rhetoric
from the left calling one of the people
Hiller for seven years could cause
somebody to want to kill Hitler well
surprise surprise surprise by the way if
I left anybody off that list uh it's
only because there's there are another
100 people like it at the list right so
I left a lot of people off the list and
many of
you if you had been public figures would
have been saying it in public as well so
it was
obvious uh we won't let that
go I'm not going to let that
go that's the only story I want to talk
about is how you could see it
coming and we all called it out and it
happened just like you thought it
would
um here's my narrative you know in the
end the law enforcement people the
Secret Service they're going to have a
narrative they're going to tell you
here's the official story uh this lone
gunman did this or that and something
happened but here's the hypnotist take
on
it um from a perspective of a
hypnotist back in 2020 I got mocked I
think all of you remember for posting
that in 20120 before the election I said
that if Biden
wins Republicans will be
hunted and then we watched as one
Republican after another went to
jail um and now
this now you can't say that nobody saw
it coming because it was obvious in
2020 and you can see it from there that
it was heading in this
inexorable you know Direction it was
nothing to stop it and the recklessness
with which
the Democrats use that rhetoric indeed
Biden actually ran on the fine people
hoax now the reason I spent about seven
years trying to debunk the fine people
hoax is this this is the reason because
that hoax
weaponized people's minds because if the
person running for president says hey
the other guy's a Nazi and here's the
proof and then he mentions the final
people hoax as the
proof what are you going to do if you're
a 20-year-old allegedly the shooter was
20 years old do you think a 20-year-old
can resist that level of
brainwashing because it's on every
channel except the one he wasn't
watching probably and it was consistent
and it was all Hitler Hitler Hitler what
did they think was going to happen now
I've said a number of times that
Democrats have this consistent problem
where where they can't see
systems they operate on a goal basis get
rid of trump that's the goal but they
couldn't see the
system the system was that they were
creating a situation that guaranteed
violence largely guaranteed it it was
just a matter of time how could they not
see that and today will they pretend
they couldn't see it will they pretend
that they're not part of the problem
will the will the opinion people on
MSNBC come on the air today
I dare them I dare
them I dare you to come on the air today
Joy
Reed Rachel madow I dare you show your
face today because I watched yesterday
and I noticed the opinion people were
kind of missing they went with the more
newsy people on
MSNBC that was the right
call we don't want to see their faces
today we don't want to hear from Joy
Reed we don't want to hear from Rachel
matow they are part of the problem I
blame them
directly by name I believe they are
culpable along with Biden and along with
anybody use that kind of
rhetoric and meant it Joy Reed as you
know just did a big video calling uh
Trump Hitler and she wasn't joking and
she wasn't using
hyperbole what are you going to do as
we've been saying forever
if you think somebody's
actually going to be Hiller well you do
what a 20-year-old did it's what 20-y
olds are designed to do they're designed
to get violent when it's necessary
unfortunately and some poor bastard was
convinced it was
necessary so the fine people hoax killed
people it almost took an a president but
it killed somebody in the stands and got
two people seriously wounded
so if you don't think that the hoaxes
matter oh they matter oh they
matter of course the uh Democrats and
the trolls are already trying to spin
this
thing um I had one troll come to me and
say you're crazy for saying that the
Biden rhetoric caused this it's Trump's
rhetoric that caused
it yes that actually happened to me
today somebody said to me on X are you
kidding it's Trump's rhetoric that
caused all of
this now I don't think I have to defend
that to you I think you know that Trump
never called anybody Hitler which would
be a call to kill them
basically so um reject that I saw Bill
Maher tried to handle this he was giving
a standup right after it happened and he
of course had to talk about it but he
said some of the right things about you
know were too fired up for
violence but uh then he went and blamed
project
2025 he actually blamed
Republicans for raising the
rhetoric in the in that project 2025
thing
unbelievable now I don't think by the
way I don't think that bill marah
specifically contributed with his
rhetoric I just think that he needs to
be a little bit more honest about where
the cause was cuz this one's a little
more obvious than most
things let's uh let's talk about some of
the things people have been saying do
you remember in March when James
Carville said uh it's time to do the wet
work and uh Anderson Cooper said um you
know that term sort of sounds like a
mafia hit
term and Carville laughed go oh no I'm
just referring to the you know the
advertising
and but why would you use that term I've
never heard that term wet workor used in
any other context other than killing so
he's one of the notable people in the
party and he uses an assassination term
in casual language about
Trump that's not normal now I'm not
going to say that he was you know
running a plan to get Trump killed but I
think there's a
recklessness that gets into the gets
into the category of you should have
known what would
happen right isn't there a there's a
form of murder where it's not good
enough to say you weren't intending it
all you have to do is say you should
have known what you were doing was going
to cause this or be contributing to it
how how would you not know that that
would contribute to it here's what would
have not contributed if he had said W
wet work and it was an accident he
should have said oh I'm referring to the
advertisement
you know for sure I don't want any
violence I better correct that I used
the wrong term I'm not advocating any
violence I just mean the advertising
needs to be tougher and
Tighter would have been easy to say
that Biden on H July 8th said uh we're
done talking about the debate it's time
to put Trump in a bullseye why would you
say that what kind of language is that
is that normal does Trump use language
like that we're going to put him in a
bullseye remember yeah Kathy Griffin and
the S head got lots more of that do you
remember uh Owen Gregorian was reminding
us today that Alex Soros posted a
picture of a bullet hole next to
$47 back in
January
47 and a and a bullet hole
so kind of suggested as some said that
uh it was some intentional int and I
said I said back at the time in my
opinion our intelligence servic has just
solicited a hit on our next president
and offered a free pass to the
purp to me it looked like a
signal because I associate Soros with
our intelligence people it seems like
that's a clear
Association and
to me somebody who would post something
so
dramatically
inappropriate and having an association
with our intelligence people it's really
sketchy I think Victor David Hansen had
the best take on this if I can find his
notes talking about some of the people
who uh have been calling for violence
for so long
here's something Victor David Hansen
said in his uh post today it's a longer
post but I'll just like this part of it
and he he says that the left has been
engaged in sort of a parlor game of
imagining murder against Trump so here's
some examples by slugging his face
Robert daero by decapitation Kathy
Griffin Marilyn Manson by stabbing that
Shakespeare in the park play by clubbing
Mickey roor by shooting Snoop Dogg by
poisoning Anthony Bourdain by Bounty
killing George Lopez by carry and eating
his corpse Pearl Jam by suffocating
Larry Whitmore by blowing him up Madonna
and Mobi by throwing him over a cliff
Rosie odonnell just by generic killing
him Johnny Depp and big sea or boy
martyring him Reed Hoffman who recently
said yeah I wish I had made him an
actual
martyr they didn't see it
coming didn't see it
coming yeah you might have seen it
coming so here's my hypnotist
take to
me to me it looks like a uh slow motion
assassination that was based on
statistics
in other
words the people who wanted Trump
literally dead knew that if they kept
acting a certain way the odds of
somebody acting on it was pretty good at
what
point at what
point does doing something that has a
high statistical chance of killing
somebody become actual murder it's kind
of the Perfect Crime isn't it you you
get somebody to do it but you have
deniability no I was just talking I was
just using my free
speech it's kind of the Perfect
Crime all right so I would call it
uh a a probability based uh murder
attempt probability based murder attempt
you and by the way this is something in
the dilbur comic strip so in the dilber
comic strip the poier bosses uh
secretary uh wants him
dead but she doesn't want to be accused
of murder so instead she just books him
to have stopover uh stopover uh let's
say destinations that are in dangerous
places so the poiner boss will uh book a
trip for her uh the secretary will book
a trip for her boss and put it through
North Korea so yeah you just got one
stop over in North Korea so she's not
killing him
she's simply creating a statistical
probability that somebody else will kill
him is that
legal probably you couldn't prosecute
because there'd be too many people that
you would have to say were also guilty
because you'd have something like a
million people contributing to it to the
to the rhetoric so I don't think you
could actually do anything legally or
with any kind of a class action but you
can still see it just because the courts
would be helpless doesn't mean you can't
see it
clearly all
right
um the big question that uh we all have
is why did the shooter get that close
why did the shooter get The High Ground
why didn't the Secret Service do a
better
job
and these are some of the things that
people are saying uh apparently the head
of the Secret Service is a woman who
used to work for some snack company I
think Pepsi or something and Elon mus
quipped that uh she was guarding Cheetos
before she was guarding Trump which is
kind of funny because people call Trump
Cheetos
Cheeto and musk also called for the head
of Secret Service to
resign I don't think that's too far I I
think that the entire country watched a
major failure or worse of the Secret
Service
and somebody needs to resign absolutely
somebody needs to
resign
um but here's a little side note the
Elon Musk dropped yesterday he said that
two people had tried to assassinate him
Elon Musk so two people on separate
occasions have already tried to kill me
he said in the past eight months they
were arrested with guns about 20- minute
drive from Tesla headquarters in Texas
do you do you see what kind of game
we're in
now yeah the the Democrats have whipped
people into a murderous frenzy with
their rhetoric now it probably doesn't
help that their base has more mental
illness than Republicans so when you add
Hitler rhetoric to a base which does
have an unusually high mental illness
issue you're really you're really
pushing the the envelope of what should
be legal and what shouldn't
be um General Flynn said about the uh
Secret Service he said Trump may require
exceptional private security at least
until he gets into the Oval Office
because you can't trust the Secret
Service I
agree I would say Trump should offer to
change his security Secret Service or
Biden's one: one hey President Biden
I'll trade you all of my secret service
protection for all of
yours now obviously that's not going to
happen but I would get rid of 100% of
the people in the security detail I
would not be taking oh this one did a
good job that night no you have to get
rid of all of them not on day one
because that would leave him unprotected
but he needs to get rid of all of them
and he probably needs to have private
security there is reporting that says
that Biden or the administration turned
down requests for additional Secret
Service protection or resources do that
make a
difference well was it Benny Thompson uh
the Democrat who was trying to push a
bill that would remove the Secret
Service from Trump because he was
convicted of a felony
yes the Democrats were calling Trump
Hiller trying to remove his secret
service
entirely denying him extra Secret
Service that probably came from the
Secret Service right I don't think it
was necessarily Trump himself who asked
for more probably the Secret Service
themselves said we need more didn't get
it and we know that uh Biden is refusing
Secret Service protection for RFK Jr why
you think that
is yeah why do you think that is so all
indications are there's something
sketchy here we'll talk more about
that
um so I don't know if you saw the
coverage but it was immediately
despicable let me give you some of the
uh
coverage
um this is CNN's first headline when it
was very very clear that there was an
assassination attempt very clear
everybody knew it was an assassination
attempt from the first
second and knowing it was an
assassination attempt no doubt about it
CNN's first headline was and I swear to
God this is true I think it is Secret
Service rushes Trump off stage after he
falls at
rally now I saw that on social media but
as I'm reading it I'm thinking it's a
little too far in the nose now I'm not
positive that's true so I'm going to put
a little pin in that because my own rule
of is that if something's a
little too perfect it might not be true
is that one
fake that one might be
fake but they did there was a little
soft pedaling for sure there was a
little soft pedaling for you know at
least uh maybe an hour I was waiting for
MSNBC to say Trump got his ear pierced
in Pennsylvania
that didn't happen but I thought it was
going to happen or
uh
anyway we'll talk more about the Secret
Service and whether they did a good job
um but my big question today is how do
the Democrats talk about this how do the
how do the hosts of
MSNBC talk about this without saying
that they are the cause of it how how do
you report on it when you're one of the
perpet perpetrators in my mind they're
perpetrators in the sense that their
rhetoric created this situation and they
must have known it would they must have
known it would that's the important part
so they've got a problem if they double
down on the Trump as Hitler stuff it
will prove their complicit if they don't
double down on it it will prove their
complicit because they made up a hoax
that got him
shot do you see that they lose both ways
if they double down on Heath Hitler
they're proving that they're complicit
if they stop doubling down on Hiller
they are confessing that doubling down
on Hiller is what got him
shot so you see that they prove their
guilt if they double down and they prove
that they know they're guilty if they
stop doubling down did you see
that that's where you're heading into
today that they're going to confirm the
guilt by confirming it or not confirming
it they're both
confirmation there is no way that you
get out of they painted themselves in a
corner it's a corner that you can't get
out of there is no Escape now the level
of gaslighting that they're going to
employ is going to be UNF freaking
believable you're going to see
compilations of trump people saying
dangerous stuff and they go say see it
happened on both sides so you can't say
the one side was bad oh you're going to
see that now do you think that both
sides had the same kind of
persuasion no no you cannot turn on Fox
news for example and see anything that
would look anything like you know Biden
is Hitler so you got to take him out you
whenever references are
made when you know and
certainly certainly everybody in the
right has made a Hitler reference once
or twice but not like they do it when
when you see the pre the you know the
candidate for President Biden uh give
you his veins sticking out in their neck
that's not just fun in politics he's
literally trying to convince you that
pres that uh Trump was a Nazi because he
said he was a Nazi supporter which
didn't happen it was a
hoax so Biden does
presser and uh I have to say he looked
presidential so he did pull it together
and it wasn't early in the day so it
needs to be said politically that Biden
showed up he acted responsibly at the
moment and he acted you know in a way
you'd want a president to
act but he is also said that Trump is a
genuine threat to the nation he said
he's a threat to our freedom he's a
threat to our democracy
he's literally a threat to everything
America stands for he didn't say that at
the
presser but he didn't apologize for it
either he should have resigned or at
least taken himself out of the race
here's the other thing you might not
realize
politically Biden can't be replaced
now did did you see that
yet the whole the whole effort to
replace Biden that's done I mean they
might go through some emotions but
here's why they can't replace
them there was some chance that a
replacement might be able to
win there's no chance the replacement
can win now and and even if you imagine
anything's possible nobody's going to
think if there's a chance so if you're
Nome do you walk into a buzs saw when
you know there's just a buzs saww
there's not winning or a buzs saww
there's just a buzs saww who are you
going to put in buz saww if you're
Democrats who are you going to sacrifice
to the wood chipper Biden because
Biden's value is already been
extinguished he doesn't have value to
them anymore in fact he's a liability so
they're going to keep Biden in and
they're going to take the loss and
they're going to try to recover after
this election you know they'll they'll
make Motions like they're still trying
but I think the effort to replace Biden
is done it wouldn't make sense I mean
they've done Dumber things than that but
it wouldn't make sense strategically
logically they you would just be wasting
your best player who whoever they would
hypothetically replace Biden with would
have to be who they think is their
strongest player you don't throw your
strongest play player into a guaranteed
losing situation you're going to hold
that one
back so I could be
wrong but I don't think there's a chance
Biden will be
replaced um and I'm going to ask you
this question that I don't think
anybody's heard or said
yet if Biden had been a stronger
candidate would this have
happened yeah I bet you didn't think
about that yet did you if Biden had been
a strong candidate he's an
incumbent he should have won
easily if the polls had said that Biden
is going to cruise to reelection would
anybody need to shoot
Trump
no this is on
Biden if Biden had been a real candidate
the shooter probably we can't read mins
but it's a reasonable it's a reasonable
connection that if you thought well
Trump's not going to win anyway would
you risk your life to kill him if he
wasn't going to win
anyway no no you wouldn't so not only
does running Biden give the Democrats
you know the worst chance not only does
it look make them look incompetent and
de constipated because they can't make a
move you know because of
kamla
um the fact that they ran him at
all put the entire Republic in
Jeopardy they ran such a weak player
that in invited a citizen to try to take
a Ms into his own hands literally
murder now if your candidate is so bad
that it makes somebody on your own side
think they need to murder
people you can't get worse than that
right I don't want to say no joke
because that'll sound like Biden but if
it sounded like I was trying to be
humorous I'm not the weakness of their
candidate invited this because they
didn't offer a legitimate path that
would have been acceptable to the
shooter obviously the shooter didn't see
a second path because you don't you
don't kill
somebody if there's some obvious easy
path when it's all going to take care of
itself as in the election will take care
of it so running a bad
candidate who also ran on the fine
people hoax remember Biden ran on the
fine people hoax the first election and
he still hasn't given up on
it
yeah all right
so Biden um and the campaign stopped
their ads Biden announced or did he
announce or we just know it but they
stopped all their advertisements now
there's two ways to look at that number
one it's just good form all right so the
the most obvious interpretation is
somewhat innocent in the sense that you
don't want to be dumping on the guy who
just got shot it just doesn't look good
nobody's going to like it it's it would
be toned deaf so that was the right
move but is that why they did
it that's what I have to wonder because
you know what I think I think some of
those ads were going to accuse Trump of
being Hitler what do you think do you
think any of those ads they paused were
going to paint Trump as an existential
danger to the country I think so because
that was their entire campaign I think
the ads got pulled because they knew
they were complicit in this murder
attempt
I think they knew and said we can't have
these ads up there because it makes us
look obviously like we're part of the
murder plot so you can't know for sure
and you can't read minds I'd love to say
that the Biden campaign is just thinking
what's good for people and what makes
sense and they would know that running
ads in this context would be a bad idea
politically but also as a human being it
would be a bad
idea but I suspect had more to do with
not looking guilty for something they
are guilty for let me say it directly
they are guilty they caused it I don't
believe that you get this without the
exact kind of rhetoric that they've been
pushing for months years
actually well apparently mayorcas was
the one who denied the uh alleged
repeated request for more Secret Service
protection for Trump
if that's true mayorcas has to be
impeached
immediately and certainly the head of
the Secret Service unless she's got a
hell of a good excuse needs to be
impeached or whatever they do fired quit
whatever it takes
but but
definitely some heads have to roll in
the you figurative
sense um
Trump uh well let's talk about the uh I
know you want me to talk about the uh
secret Services
quality so let me just skip to that
because I was going to talk about
it
so we we saw that uh the site was not
secured the shooter managed to find a a
high place with a line of sight now that
would be literally the first thing that
you take care of if you're the Secret
Service and yet it wasn't so we have
questions as why the most obvious risk
was left
unguarded could it be that they didn't
have enough
resources maybe they thought what they
where they put the resources was most
important but they could have used more
to extend the perimeter doesn't seem
good enough to me that doesn't seem good
enough to me it looks like the people
who were there should have done more we
SE some video of what looked like one of
the um snipers that work for Secret
Service it looked like they had a bead
on the shooter and there was some delay
way too long seconds but way too long um
between noticing the risk and taking the
shot we don't know the details yet
people are saying wait he must be in on
it because he didn't take the shot I
doubt that's
true something makes me wonder if he
thought it was one of their guys maybe
or didn't know what he was seeing or
didn't believe it so we don't know what
the Sharpshooter sniper was
thinking but we do know that he didn't
do what we wanted him to do so he's got
some explaining to
do but it's way
worse um I saw a uh US Marine Corp guy
uh Brian bertic on Act
he was an ex marine and he noted this
you know that huge American flag that
was behind Trump that got captured in
the iconic
photo did you know I didn't know until
today that if you're a
sniper one of the most helpful things
you can have is a flag that happens to
be near your Target because if there's a
flag or anything that can show the wind
speed you can adjust your shot for the
wind speed so in other words the secret
service allowed a sharpshooter indicator
right next to
Trump that should not have happened
somebody especially the snipers that
because he had a sniper well what three
I think there were at least three
professional snipers who were on the
Secret Service detail are you telling me
there were no secret service snipers who
who said you know you want to get rid of
the wind
indicator or maybe they did and somebody
said no so we have we have questions I
don't want to I don't want to cach this
as accusations way too early fog of War
I'm not entirely sure we know who the
shooter was there some you know uh
preliminary identifications but it's a
little early for that um so likewise
when we jump to blaming the Secret
Service I think he got a wait on
that uh my my opinion is the same as
yours it looks like a massive failure in
the Secret Service it looks like it but
wait I I I think they need they need
their day in court if you know what I
mean let let them tell you their side if
it ever happens and listen to it right
because you know you don't want to throw
under the bus people who literally put
their bodies in front of a shooter all
right so even if even if it turns out
one or two people weren't doing what
they should have been the rest of them
were risking lives to protect the
president so it's hard to wrap our head
around the fact that there could have
been something that wasn't right at the
same time that the people who were right
were not just right but they're Heroes
they're Heroes at the highest
level but we'll find out let just just
hold your hold your fire right be be be
skeptical ask
questions demand answers
but be open-minded there may it may be
that there's one or two Bad Bad actors
maybe more but don't assume it we're
we're not smart enough to know what
happened it's still the fog of war and
I'm guilty of this too by the way so
Michael Ian Black gave me a useful uh a
useful advice yesterday which is go
slow I didn't I didn't go
slow um I don't I know if I'm wrong
about anything yet but it was the right
advice go slow you know make sure you
know what you're saying make sure you
know what the facts are so I give you
the same advice good
advice all
right the political Fallout to this uh
well let's talk about a little bit more
so so the questions about the Secret
Service are how do you let somebody get
the high ground and you and I are not in
the Secret Service but let me ask you
wouldn't every single one of you have
known not to give up a high ground with
a line of sight you would all have known
that right and even if you had to give
it up because you you were under underst
staffed you'd have somebody looking at
it all the
time now we also heard um reliably that
a number of the Trump supporters who
were outside the venue but within
listening distance and they were sort of
partying Within listening distance they
saw the shooter minutes before the
shooting they got the attention of law
enforcement good work Trump supporters
good work so how much do you love the
Trump supporters who saw trouble
immediately acted immediately went to
the
police that's that's some good
citizenship got involved
immediately to to fix
it the police we don't know the details
again so don't don't jump to the
conclusion that the police didn't do
their job what they should have done we
assume is they must have been in radio
contact uh radio contact the the bad
guys and say hey look in this roof over
here right away did they do
that it's not clear and now the the
other possibility that the um that the
sniper didn't take the shot when you
think so is that it was in an area where
a lot of people were were trying to get
a view of trump so the people who were
outside the venue couldn't see him but
you could see him if you got on a roof
so if you're the sniper the question you
have to ask yourself is am I going to
kill an innocent U magga fan who just
wanted a better view so the question is
how well could you see the
gun from the sniper's Viewpoint if he
saw the rifle and he delayed them
there's a really big problem if he
couldn't clearly see a
weapon it wouldn't have been clear that
it was anything but a
fan so you can imagine why there might
have been some delay but again can't
read minds way too early to know what
anybody was thinking I just want to put
in your mind that this is more
complicated than the first look you're
going to hear a second version of
everything maybe a third version too so
just don't solidify in an opinion until
you have a little bit more but keep your
questions all right so here's what the
political Fallout is going to be there
are three potential explanations for
what we saw in terms of the Secret
Service not doing their job
one it's a Dei secret service now I
don't say that is a joke and don't say
it just as political
fod they brought in a woman to be the
head of the Secret Service she said
publicly that bringing in diversity is
her one of her top priorities now she
doesn't say it's more important than
protecting the president or the
candidates but she seemed to think it
was important enough to talk about now
uh if you're new to my live stream and I
imagine we got some people who were not
the normals coming in we got a pretty
big audience today let me remind you
when I talk about the problems of Dei
I'm not talking about anybody's genes
nobody's DNA nobody's culture none of
that is in the conversation it's a
system observation if you have a system
that says we need to favor hiring a
certain group of people and the demand
for that group of people far exceeds the
supply but but humans are humans so
they're not going to take no for an
answer and they're going to just hire
whoever they
can the inevitable guaranteed outcome of
a system with that design is that you
lower the quality of your
hires again has nothing to do with being
men or women has nothing to do with
being
lgbtq has nothing to do with genes has
nothing to do with culture has nothing
to do with any of that it's a system
problem and Democrats consistently get
the system problem wrong because they're
going for the goal what's the goal
diversity not a bad goal I'm all for it
actually I like diversity I live in a
very diverse place and I would say that
it makes it better in in all kinds of
ways yeah I am a direct beneficiary of
diversity my neighborhood's quite
diverse and it's awesome so
just be you know you have to be clear
that when you're making a Dei
observation you're not talking about the
people they hired you're talking about
the system that may have hired
inefficiently almost certainly we can't
say for sure that any of the people were
hired who shouldn't have been but I'm
going to ask you this
question there's a dog not barking but
there's lots of dogs not barking it's
still fog of War but if we go a month
and you haven't heard the following
statistic I got a problem here's the
number I want to hear I want to know the
average length of service of Trump's
detail versus the average length of
service of you know let's say whatever
is the average or maybe Biden's
detail if the people working for uh
Trump were unusually
inexperienced and and it was because
because diversity had created a lot of
new hires I think there were several
women on the team and again I'm not
saying there's anything wrong with women
in so in working in these jobs that's
not the point it's not my opinion I'm
simply saying that if you work too hard
to hire people fast so you can hit your
diversity goals you might lower your
standards that would be the most
reasonable thing you would do not
reasonable most most predictable thing
not the most
reasonable so we got questions so can we
say that the problem with the Secret
Service not operating the way the
spectators believe they should is it a
Dei problem too soon to
know but is it a big candidate
absolutely yeah if I if I were going to
guess and you put a gun to my head well
I'm not going to say that
um if you made me bet I would say it's
probably fact Factor not the only factor
and it doesn't mean you shouldn't have
diversity in your secret service it
simply means we may have a system
problem that had a predictable
outcome have I ever predicted um bad
outcomes from this before yes the Biden
campaign itself widely considered the
worst political campaign of all time is
entirely a Dei
operation I predicted again not because
anybody's genes nobody's race nobody's
sexual preference nobody's gender
nothing to do with that that the system
would would end up with a Biden campaign
that was unusually inexperienced and
incompetent and that's what we see this
would be the second example in your
government where Dei has to be a suspect
doesn't mean it's
true but it has to be in the top three
and if you if you don't believe that
you're you're not a serious person you
know I can't take you seriously the
other possibility people are saying it
was an inside job because it seems like
the it seems like the opportunity was
curiously too
good now if it were that um The
Conspiracy Theory goes that that's why
he was killed you know they waited for
him to take the shot after the shots
were taken they killed him to get rid of
the evidence much like You Know Jack
Ruby situation
um but in my mind there are too many
variables for this to be an inside
job meaning if it was an inside job of
just intentionally doing bad
security maybe but I don't think it was
an inside job all the way to having a
connection to the shooter so I would
think it would be wildly unlikely but
not impossible we live in a world where
this is possible it's possible and it's
not even wildly impossible it's
completely possible it was an inside job
or a partial inside job totally possible
I would bet against it because the odds
that they could you know weaponize this
one 12y old and keep it all into wraps
and everything this it wouldn't be the
best
plan um but then there like I said
there's a there's a weak version of that
where they don't have a specific idea
that this specific person will be there
doing a specific shooting but they know
if they don't guard him well somebody
will probably take a shot so that would
be an inside inside game too it's enough
of an inside game if you just decide
you're not going to do a good job
protecting them it's just you know more
legal if you do it that way I
guess and then of course the uh as I
said The more likely scenario is that a
young man
who did not have a a good uh
understanding of the world was
brainwashed by the rhetoric and he
simply believed what he had been told on
social media and MSNBC probably now what
do you think the shooter watched or
where do you think the shooter got his
news does anybody think that the shooter
watched Fox News all
day does anybody think the shooter was
uh reading
Breitbart did does anybody think the
shooter was following Tucker
Carlson I don't think they
do I think almost certainly if you found
out his sources of news they would be
exactly what you think plus Tik Tock
plus Tik Tock do you think Tik Tock
could have weaponized
him I don't know but he's 20 years old
and he did something that looks like it
came from being brainwashed by Tik Tok
so I would say that the the brain
washing and the rhetoric are
100%
culpable mean well they're not the only
variable that caused it but they're a
contributing factor
unambiguously so I'm going to say that
even I I guess I'm violating the good
advice from Michael Lee and black that I
should wait because we don't know
enough we we don't know enough about the
shooter but it's looking seriously like
it's exactly what it looks like a
20-year-old who got brainwashed by the
Democrats into thinking he was saving
the world from
Hiller um so the early reporting from
CNN is that the shooter was a registered
Republican who may have Dem donated to a
left-wing Democrat
Party now there's some people saying
that maybe it was because he there was
an Open Primary you you know there may
have been somebody who registered the
opposite of their beliefs which is
common um the the first thing that
happened to me yesterday is I heard from
a friend who said this is why he
registered as a
Democrat that's right one one of my
friends called and said he registered as
a Democrat because being a republican
looked too
dangerous and he was right it's one of
the reasons I did it I'm a register I'm
a registered Democrat because I thought
it would be dangerous to be on a list of
Republicans literally that's not a joke
that's literally
true all
right
so will the Republicans go on to win it
all because this changes everything well
this changes everything but I'd like to
caution you from any political optimism
number one is
Icky because somebody died two people
terribly injured
so even just talking about the political
outcome or how awesome Trump's picture
is it's icky we're going to do it anyway
because it's the news and it's important
and we're going to talk about
it but but don't feel too good about it
right just keep part of your your mind
on the gravity of the
situation um and the
tragedy
but I think that there's going to be a
comeback by Biden's team that will
surprise you they are going to twist and
contort and spin this until it's Trump's
Fault by election day they will have
done a full turn you know they're going
to lay low a little bit they they got to
take a couple weeks off probably let the
Republicans do their convention and just
lay low but they're coming back because
the last thing they want is to lose
everything and people are already
talking about either going to lose the
house the Senate the presidency the
Supreme Court they've already got it's
going to be a generation that the
Democrats are gone there that's a
possibility I don't think it's the
highest possibility but I think there's
a 10% chance that the Democrat party
will be out of power for a generation
it's possible it's not
likely because they're they're really
brainwashed you know everybody's
brainwashed in politics but the
brainwashing is so strong
that even an attempted assassination is
only going to pick off some Independence
it probably won't change a single vote
of somebody who is a you know a
DieHard uh anti-
Trumper so don't
assume
Victory don't assume that they're not
going to cheat in the
election if if they did this they
meaning the Democrats if they were
willing to do the Hitler persuasion for
years knowing that it was going to get
people killed or they should have
known would they stop at that do you
think that the people who would do that
would not rig an election of course they
would so whether or not you think it's
ever happened in the past and I have no
no proof that it did uh lots of evidence
but no proof
uh at least in a sense of
Accord do you think that they would
hesitate to rig an
election well here's what here's the
best case the best case
scenario yeah exactly they're in too
deep they're in too deep they they would
assume that uh Republicans are coming
for them in other words if you had
anything to do with anything sketchy and
you were a Democrat you would think oh
my God they're going to be so mad we
tried to kill their
leader or that's what they're going to
think they're going to come for us
hard and they're going to fight they're
going to fight like their life depends
on
it here's what you need to
do don't be like
them if you've got some feelings of
Revenge keep them to
yourself if you've got some anger that
needs to come
out go for a walk
don't give away your
advantage because they're waiting for
you to do that the this does create a
political advantage and again I feel
icky like I I just feel icky talking
about
it given the tragedy but it's a true
it's true don't give it up if you start
talking like they talk you're giving up
your
advantage listen to
Trump do what Trump tells you right th
this is the time to Rally around your
leader he's going to tell you to be
cool because he's smart and he knows
that he's gained a accidental Advantage
nobody would want it but he got it
and he put out a statement that I
thought uh if I were smart enough to
write it down I would be reading it to
you
now uh let's see
oh I was sure I wrote that down
somewhere but maybe
not anyway he basically said to you know
stay strong
and basically just win the thing you got
to do now is
[Music]
win you got to
win because it's the only way this goes
away now there's going to be a lot more
trouble between now and winning but you
got to
win
yeah so let's uh talk about some other
people um some people pointed out that
the Secret Service and the CIA and the
FBI will investigate themselves and
conclude that they were not
involved I assume that will happen you
should assume that after the
investigation there will be complete
Clarity that nobody in the government
possibly could have seen it coming
nobody was was aware of it in advance
nobody did anything but the best job
they could and the government in all of
its entities had nothing to do with it
whatsoever even if they
did even if they did by the way I don't
I don't think they did so my money says
it wasn't an inside job but you can't
rule anything out I just think it's
unlikely it looked like a lone shooter
situation to me but of course that's how
they do it
so when I say it looks like a lone lone
shooter situation that doesn't
mean anything really it's just what it
looks
like all right let's talk about the
worst person in the world there's this
left leaning guy called Destiny who
makes his living by going online and
saying the worst things that any human
being could ever say and here's what he
said Donald Trump incited an
Insurrection here it comes and then was
granted full criminal IM for possibly
all of his involvement here it is I have
zero sympathy for anything that happens
to him or anyone who supports
him hold
hold go for a
walk take a
walk don't go
nuts hold on be strong
and Destiny says I will argue this
position against any and all
conservatives of reasonable size but
there's a reason none of you spineless
hacks step outside your Echo
Chambers yeah that's
why now I'm not going to debate his
point of
view because he's just the worst person
in the
world who does not deserve any
violence let me be clear about that this
is how you talk about about people who
are the worst people in the
world you should just live your life as
the worst person in the world and that's
enough
punishment can you imagine trying to be
friends or having a relationship with
this Destiny person I don't think it
goes well I don't think this person is
killing it in life I think that they're
probably creating a bubble of hell that
they're living in of their own
making and that's good enough for me if
you create a hell for yourself and you
in
it that's good enough that's your
punishment well what did Russia say
about this because you know in 10
minutes Russia is going to be accused by
Hillary Clinton the odds that the CIA or
Brennan or Clapper or Hillary
Clinton the odds that they don't come
out and say you know this is looking a
little bit Russian likee it's exactly
what Putin would do you know it's
coming cuz they only have one play but a
Kremlin spokesman got ahead of it
Dimitri pesov he said uh about the
attempted
assassination he said quote after
numerous attempts to eliminate candidate
Trump from the political Arena using
first legal instruments courts
prosecutors attempt to politically
discredit and compromise the candidate
it was obvious to all outside to
observers that his life was in
danger that that's
Russia Trump says he wants to work out a
peace deal with
Russia do you think he can do
it
yep yep there's a there's all doubt
being removed right there that's uh
that's Putin sending you a message that
says we'll
negotiate we're going to talk to
you yep that's what that is
so when I said everything changed
yesterday it really is
everything I think that this ended the
war in
Ukraine I think it probably will bring
some sanity back to the country the the
toughest part will be see if to see if
Democrats can acknowledge that what they
did with their rhetoric take
responsibility and change their
approach if they do
I'm actually going to respect
that I don't expect that I I think
cognitive dissonance and team play will
kick in and they'll just double down and
I think they're going to follow the lead
of this Destiny person and say that
Trump had it coming because they believe
the Insurrection
hoax so remember I told you that the
Democrats have what I call a hoax mesh
Network where there are so many hoaxes
if one goes down the others keep the
network alive so the so we watched as
the fine people hoax got taken down you
know Snopes finally debunked it it was
widely reported for the first time so
when that hoax fell did you say to
yourself well glad the hoaxes are gone
nope it looks like they just took all
their energy from that one and shifted
it over to their other hoax that somehow
the president was going to take over the
country with some paperwork and some
friends who were
trespassing now the Ridiculousness of
that hoax doesn't seem to make any
difference in how well it's believed on
on the by the Democrats so they're going
to push it because it's worked before
and they're going to say look at all
these examples of when when Trump got
shot he jumped up and he pumped his fist
and he said fight so obviously he's
calling for violence isn't he no do you
know what that do you know what fight
means to
Republicans it means
politically what do you know what he's
Hitler means it means maybe you should
take it matters into your own hands
those are not the same in politics fight
means politically unless you say he's
hler and he will end the entire country
and there'll never be another election
if you hear one more person say it's
going to be the last election he's going
to steal your democracy and he's a
dictator fascist even the word
fascist they're the ones who are trying
to kill
them and they're just as guilty as the
shooter because they created the
environment in which the shooting became
inevitable so there's a lot of guilt
that they're going to try to you know
try to shk off or shrug off but I'm not
going to
forget I'm not going to forget what they
did to my potential president president
and past
president
yeah there somebody in the comments is
saying the the Lincoln the Lincoln group
is sort of a tell that Lincoln
thing all
right let me
uh just look at my notes make sure I
talked about everything I want to talk
about here today
because well
has anybody watched MSNBC yet are they
going to let their opinion people back
in air was Morning Joe on today did
anybody check
MSNBC C because I
think I think Morning Joe probably would
have been preempted by the news people
if they're smart MSNBC if they if they
know they're guilty you won't see their
opinion people for a while and when they
come on they're going to have to have a
whole new a whole new approach because
if the if the joy reads and the Rachel
madow come back on and they say he's
trying to steal your
democracy they're they're right back at
it and I think that's what's going to
happen if I had to guess the most likely
outcome is they'll try to bsides it so
first they'll try to bsides it it's like
well you know bad rhetoric on both sides
so here's what we should do both sides
should agree to take the rhetoric down
should they should should Trump stop
saying that dangerous people are being
led into the country by the thousands
when it's
true because that's the dangerous
rhetoric they're talking about should
Trump stop saying that he thinks the
election was rigged because a lot of
people think it
was I think so if I had to bet I don't
have proof of it but if I had to bet
I'll bet it was rigged and I'll bet
every system is rigged and that's my
take my take is that we've observed
every system in America being rigged in
one way or another you know rig being
you know a generic word but we've seen
everything from a finance system we know
the marketing of every company we saw
all the experts the health care people
uh we're watching the Democrats you know
make one hoax after another everything's
rigged everything so why would the
election be the exception
now I think that what this causes is it
would be too obvious to rig this coming
election because the polls might I I I
still think I might bet against it I'm
going to bet against a major move in the
polls that lasts all the way to election
day I think that by election day the
polls will tighten and it doesn't matter
what happened over the summer because
the the memory during an election is
about two weeks do you remember when
Trump did the grabbing by the
thing and it was really close to the
election but two weeks later it was the
old
news in two weeks this is going to be
like grabbing by the it it's just
going to be um completely absorbed by
some other
news oh my
God here's what the bad Dei people are
saying he's saying this is a headline
from Sean Harper who is a diversity
equity and inclusion expert so this is a
Dei expert contributor in Forbes he says
will surviving gunfire be Donald Trump's
next appeal to Black
voters so you
know people said that Trump being lawed
would appeal to Black voters and then
they mocked it and you know what
happened it appealed to Black
voters it did exactly what you thought
it would now why well why wouldn't it
why wouldn't it appeal to Black voters
if if if black voters believe and
there's plenty of historical context to
support that they've been treated
differently than other people by the the
legal system and then they watch
somebody else who is very clearly being
treated differently by the legal system
why wouldn't they feel something about
that why wouldn't they to to imagine
that that's some kind of unreasonable
stereotype is racist
itself because it's just a human thing
it has nothing to do with being black it
has to do with a common experience or at
least a common feeling that that
experience you know influences people
who you think look like
you of course you would find some
commonality in that of course that's
just the most natural thing in the world
does that would that extend
them to you know black voters saying he
got shot so that they before they no I
don't think that's a
logical
conclusion right I don't think anybody
thinks oh I got shot you got shot I've
never heard of that I've never heard of
the like
a a group of people who got together
like you got shot I got shot too let's
form some kind of a
group so here's a little sub uh
story so uh you know Elon Musk has been
going back and forth with Reed Hoffman
uh Reed Hoffman biggest donator to the
Democrats and he's one of the ones who
said at a recent uh event that Peter
that teal was at that yeah I wish I'd
made him an actual
martyr so Reed Hoffman saying in public
he wished he'd physically killed Trump
now it wasn't completely serious but
it's not the kind of thing you can say
joking unless you
serious in your mind or your
imagination so even though he said it as
a uh a laugh Point uh it's not
funny and here's what Elon Musk said
about that he uh responded to something
about Reed Hoffman he said Reed is
afraid that if Trump wins Reed will be
prosecuted for going to Epstein's
Island well if he thought Elon Musk was
gonna pull his punches
that didn't
happen
um there there is I guess evidence that
Reed Hoffman went to the island there's
no evidence that he did anything
illegal but it doesn't look
good and it would certainly explain why
he's so absurdly in favor of a
ridiculous group of people the
Democrats he's way too smart Reed
Hoffman is way too smart to know that
he's on the right side way too smart so
he's acting like somebody who's being
blackmailed now that doesn't mean he is
he could be just doesn't like Trump and
he's a good Democrat could be just he's
a team
player but he doesn't act like it you
know who acts like he's not being
blackmailed uh Bill
lman he acts like he's not being
blackmailed cuz he he's watching both
sides and commenting both sides I don't
see any blackmail it looks like he's
looking objectively at it you know who
looks like he's not being
blackmailed Elon
Musk voted Democrat all his life just
endorsed Trump that looks like you're
not being
blackmailed but Reed he looks like he's
being
blackmailed I can't say that he is I
don't have any information that but he's
acting in a way that would be compatible
with it but also being compatible with
you know having TDS so two possibilities
there or they could be
both
um do you think you'll see the fine
people hoax for a
while I feel like this may have retired
the fine people thing because anybody
who would bring that up today they would
have to know that they're going to get a
lot of
heat a lot of heat I think it might
suppress it for a while but it's you
know the unkillable hoax so it'll just
come
back oh here was uh Trump's statement I
just took out some of the key quotes he
said stay strong and determined and
defiant in the face of
wickedness I like the fact that he's
he's talking about it in terms of
wickedness and
evil without getting too
specific here's what he didn't say
Democrats did this to
me did you
notice did you notice he didn't do that
did he notice he didn't do what I
did blame
Biden his instincts are freaking
incredible and I've said it before I'm
going to say it again a million more
times whoever is advising
Trump is really doing a good job and has
been for a while just noticeably
obviously high quality of advice but as
I also always say the boss still gets
the credit because the boss has to pick
the person who gave the advice the boss
has to look at the advice and the boss
has to decide if it's good so credit
goes to the boss and
Trump handled this
perfectly perfectly be
defiant be strong be determined
and we're facing
wickedness you don't need to put a
further name on
it you don't have to say Democrats are
bad because then you become them don't
become the thing you hate that that's
the the biggest risk for
violence besides actually dying and
being injured is that you become the
person who did it to you don't become
the person who did it to you you got to
be better than that that's that's how
you win
all right let's see how we're
doing all right um so I want you to I
want to put uh one thought in your
head the uh RNC Republican National
Convention was scheduled to be this week
and still scheduled to be this week as
far as we know and this seems obvious
Trump will be there there's a moment I
want you to hold in your head before it
happens the moment he first walks on
stage that's it just think about
it
fight and on that note ladies and
gentlemen I'm going going to end uh my
comments to uh YouTube and Rumble and X
thanks for joining I'm going to go talk
to my beloved members of locals
privately after I say goodbye to the
rest of you um there'll be lots more on
this um but let's uh go on with our day
and uh make the best of it all right
locals I'm coming hope the rest of you
