good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization the thing
that's gonna get your day off to a good
start
it's the positive vibe that you can't
find anywhere else
today's the day that you're going to
feel a little bit better about well just
about everything
because that's the way it goes
on coffee with scott adams and all you
need to guarantee this good day is a
copper mug glass of tiger chelsea stein
a canteen joker flask it's a vessel of
any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid i like coffee
and
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
that's the dope of being here today
somebody showed me showing me a meme
of a stamper of the
simultaneous sip
in a text i don't think that's real
but
you ready
go
oh yeah
yep
i don't know about you but i felt it i
would like to make a media
recommendation
recommendation for some content
you need to watch the bilber
stand up special on netflix he's got
several of them it's the newest one from
red rocks
i'm about three quarters through it
and oh my god is it good
it's so good
there are points within it
where he's just pissing off the audience
and you're not sure he could ever
recover
and then he does
and then it looks like he couldn't
possibly recover from the thing he's
saying now
and that he does it's really watching
him fly that close to the sun
and not get burned up
is really amazing he goes after every
everything and everybody
i think the real secret of it
is
that he is unrelenting
i think if he went at these topics in a
half-assed way it wouldn't work
but the fact that he's just so
completely all-in
you just say all right all right
and just entertain us
um did you see the uh alleged nazis who
were protesting in favor of desantis in
florida yeah allegedly allegedly they
were pro-desantis nazis
now
and of course the democrats fell for it
do you know what the budget is
to get some uh fake nazis or even
surreal ones
to demonstrate in favor of your
political opponent to make your opponent
look bad
what do you suppose would be the budget
for that sort of thing
real expensive
pretty sure you could get it under a
thousand dollars
you could get several people
for about a thousand dollars probably
yeah somewhere in that neighborhood if
you paid 5 000 you probably should have
negotiated better
but for a very low price
you can get people to dress up as nazis
or actual nazis you know neo-nazis or
whatever and they'll stand there and
hold a sign for your opponent now i have
a suggestion
since you know this nazi trick is going
to be used over and over against the
republicans
the republicans should form or maybe you
know not the politicians maybe some pac
or interest group form a nazi
uh dancing troupe
people who dress like nazis
but they present themselves as
entertainment
so they're not trying to pretend to be
nazis
they're they're only actors who are
telling you they're actors and it's a
nazi dancing troop and then you send
them to every event that the democrats
do
now even though they would be clearly
labeled as entertainment
you know they would not be trying to
present themselves as actual neo-nazis
how many times do the democrats have to
see the dancing nazis attempt to attend
their attend their events
before they feel uncomfortable with the
whole idea
i think that i think the republicans
could completely take this
ridiculous political trick off the map
by going really hard at it themselves
just just have a nazi dancing trip at
every single democrat about
that
you know they'd have signs and they'd
have like really good costumes you know
like actual actual like world war ii
nazi costumes and you know maybe
maybe they do the the uh goose step
maybe some kind of a goose step dance
like mel brooks yes
very much like
the mel brooks play
all right
uh
i like to remind you of bad crazy
things i've said
that ended up being actually the
general understanding in the country
after a certain point
now you could probably come up with
several examples yourselves
of things i've said or predicted they're
just bad crazy
and then you wait a year or two or maybe
several and it's the standard of
thinking
here's another one
nobody understands economics
do you remember the first time i said
that
and you probably heard it and you're
like okay that's a little hyperbole like
what's that mean or are you talking
about something specific
now it's the headline the headline to
cnn is that the economists don't
understand the economy
it's the headline
right how many how many people thought
it was ridiculous when i said that the
experts don't understand the economy
it sounded ridiculous didn't it but now
it's it's common understanding
how many times have i done that
do you remember in 2015 i told you that
trump was persuasive
and do you remember the response i got
to that he's not persuasive
come on
he has what
13 support even among republicans
right
13
come on
he's anything but persuasive he's a big
crazy clown he doesn't know what he's
doing
and now what's the headline today
the headline is that trump is so
persuasive
that he may have accidentally triggered
something like an insurrection
because he's so persuasive
and that the entire
more than half the country believes the
election was sketchy
more than half of the country
that number has never been achieved or
even close
that's all trump
that's all trump
he is literally
proven to be the most persuasive
human in modern
modern civilization i think
and people laughed at me when i said you
have no idea what's coming here in 2015.
you don't see this coming but trust me
i i have just the right skill set that i
can you know i can look through this
little window
there it is
all right so nobody understands
economics specifically uh
and this is one of those things you can
do when you have no shame
just try try to imagine yourself doing
this
this is something that i did
in public
in the most public way i did
i have a degree in economics
and i have an mba
and i'm an adult who has lived in the
world and watched the news closely for
decades
and the other day i tweeted that i don't
understand
the
unemployment number
like i don't even understand that
what the hell is going on
how in the world could the economy be
having so many problems and the
employment looks great
now many of you said scott scott scott
everybody knows it's because people left
the employment pool
i know that
that's not the part i don't understand i
get that that the employment is only of
the people who are looking for a job
so if fewer people say they're looking
for one well you've got full employment
yeah i get that
that doesn't come close to explaining
what we're seeing if that explained it
like fully it's part of the story of
course of course it's part
but there's something else going on here
and i don't know what it is and i have a
hypothesis
and i would expect to win the nobel for
economics for the following hypothesis
and by the way i'm not even kidding
i'm not joking i'm gonna add a
hypothesis to the body of economics that
i don't think you've seen
that will explain all the things that
don't make sense right now
it goes like this
economics assumes
a
a let's say a small range of change
economics assumes
that the world changes at a somewhat
predictable regular pace or at least is
the same as it was the last 10 years
right maybe maybe modern day has changed
faster than old days
but if the last 10 years would be
a pretty good proxy for change
so everything that you know about
economics every common assumption
is assume that the base
of you know all of our assumptions about
everything stay about the same
and that economics is just running on
top of those assumptions
but the pandemic and i'm going to give
naval ravikant
the credit for i think the first person
who observed this
his prediction was that the pandemic
would make everything that was going to
happen anyway
happen faster
and we're seeing it right
so right now we have um
legacy systems
that are operating at the same time as
the replacement system
for a short period of time
what happens to employment numbers when
you still have the old system
but you're you're bringing up the new
system
you need twice as many people
because you still have the old system
but you've now added the new system
for example
before the pandemic
mostly you got your food from the
grocery store
is the grocery store still there
yes it is
grocery store is still there still
employs about the same number of people
but on top of that
because it was so hard to you know go
anywhere during the pandemic the food
delivery business exploded
so now you have the
entire grocery industry just the way it
was but on top of it you have
what i think will be the long-term
replacement industry which is the food
comes to you
do you buy it
so that that would be an explanation of
why things could be falling apart we
could have you know recession inflation
we could have
supply chain problems we could have
every problem that you're seeing
but at the same time
we're in this weird situation where the
pandemic said wait everything you're
doing is up you better you better
start putting the new plan in place
right away
and then we did
we did
so at least part of the
part of it i think is the
rapid acceleration of the baseline
world
what do you think
will anybody accept that and will you
nominate me for the the nobel for
economics
do i have to do some math to get that
nobel
i want the nobel i already already
invented by the way how many of you know
i invented the concept of the
confusopoly
which is now
standard part of economic thought
how many of you knew that
that that i'm actually part of the
economic literature
now a confuseopoly is a word i it's a
word i invented years ago
and it refers to the fact that
businesses such as let's say cell phone
companies
and insurance companies banks to some
extent lots of businesses
the reason that they don't need to
compete with each other
is that they've made their products too
complicated for you to know who's doing
a better job
imagine going to get your cell phone
if you knew for sure which was the
better deal
you would just walk in and get the
better deal because cell phone coverage
is kind of like every other cell phone
coverage but you don't
when you go to buy a cell phone it's
like well this one's a plan but this one
has rollover minutes
but this one i can add a family member
you have no way to compare it that's a
confuse opoli
the way economics was supposed to work
is that the free market would drive all
the weak competitors out of business and
eventually you'd have one strong
competitor
but that's not happening you have lots
of competition insurance and everything
and the way they compete is they confuse
the
consumer so the consumer can't tell
which product is better
and i believe that they do it
intentionally
meaning that they're all quite
intentionally making sure that nobody
can compare their products
i mean i know that's the case i'm not
guessing that's definitely the case so
before i explain that concept didn't
exist in economics
but if you if you google it now confuse
aptly you'll see it's
it's a standard concept
so how many of you thought that i would
be famous for adding a concept to
economics
so you didn't say that comment did you
but it happened
all right
um
rasmussen did some polling on
american voters and energy independence
and found out that only 19 of those
polled
oppose a policy of encouraging u.s
energy independence
in other words
81 would like more of a trump approach
you know going for energy independence
and only 19
and remember
this includes democrats
right
only 19 of the public
um
wants something like what we have now
where we're not encouraging domestic
energy
and let's say
53 percent of voters and remember this
includes democrats and independents and
everybody else
uh trust republicans uh more to
encourage u.s oil and gas production
well that makes sense right
but why is it only 53
if you took the assumption
even if you don't assume that you want
that
even if you said to yourself i don't
want more domestic energy production i
don't know why you'd say that but
suppose you did
wouldn't you still at least recognize
that republicans would
do more of it
how could you be so dumb
that you think the republicans and the
democrats would you know roughly the
same
when it comes to encouraging domestic
energy production
that's a pretty weird opinion
i mean we fly against literally 100 of
all reporting from both sides
uh
18 percent of the public thinks there's
not much difference between the two
parties on the issue of energy
18
it feels a little low
that's the number i would have expected
closer to maybe north of 20
closer to closer to a quarter i would
have expected that closer to a quarter
just saying
all right um
and 71 percent of likely u.s voters
think the u.s government should
encourage increased oil and gas
production in the u.s
71
how in the world does a democrat get
elected president in this atmosphere
there's a really dangerous situation
shaping up here and i think you all see
it right
everything in the news and the polling
suggests that there's no way a democrat
could win the presidency against anybody
basically
what if they do
what if they do
i don't know i mean if it happened
in this atmosphere
where every indicator is pointing toward
you know a strong republican win
if it doesn't happen
and all these indicators stay so
strongly in in the other direction
it could be a problem that could be a
problem
so we'll see if that happens
um
so as you know the january 6 hearings
have completely cleared trump of
any criminal behavior
by showing that there's no evidence of
it they have completely eviscerated the
encouraged and insurrection narrative
completely gone
because i don't think anybody believes
that there was a planned insurrection
in which don jr wasn't let in on it
or ivanka
it's to me that's just funny
not only did they disprove their own
contention that there was some planned
insurrection but they disproved in a way
that's actually funny
it's like
really
somebody somebody should have checked to
see if don jr was at least informed
about this alleged insurrection because
if he if he had not been and
the evidence clearly shows that he
didn't know anything about any planned
insurrection
there's nothing else to talk about
none of the other evidence is even worth
looking at you know once you've seen
that his own family didn't know anything
about it
that's sort of it and then you say but
but
but scott but but but what about all
those people in the administration who
are helping him try to you know
gain the rules to take over what about
them to which i say
what about them
do you notice anything in common
with those people who have been named
who are like trying to find some scheme
for you to keep power you know playing
with the electoral
the electors and stuff like that they're
all lawyers
they're all lawyers don't you think the
democrats owe it to the united states to
say well there's one thing we should
point out
that the people who did seem to be
supporting the idea that there might be
some legal challenge here we're all
lawyers and that's what they do
it's not their job
to tell you what
trump should do ethically or morally or
what's right for the country
they are there to say is there a legal
argument yes or no
and they did their job
you could argue they did it well
because if the boss who's paying them
says
is there a legal way that i could find
this
their job is to go find the best
argument to support your
your preferences
they came up with the best argument they
could
but it was weak
would you all agree with that
the best argument they came up with
about you know changing electors or
whatever was a little weak
i mean it didn't even convince pence
if you can't convince pence that's a
weak argument
but that doesn't mean they shouldn't
have done that
and it doesn't mean that trump shouldn't
have asked
because in the process of leadership you
ask all the questions
in fact one of the biggest
i guess criticisms of trump
is we keep hearing stories where he asks
crazy
like can you stop a hurricane with a
nuclear weapon and
uh i doubt he ever said that by the way
i don't think he ever actually said that
but um what was the other one can you
nuke or no can we send the missile
into the cartels basically can we attack
the cartels now the answer he got back
was no don't do that i think that's the
wrong answer i think he could attack him
but you see that he always asks the edge
question
if you're a leader
and you're not asking the edge question
you're not doing your job
you need a president who says all right
here all the standard things we've
talked about
now you better tell me why i can't do a
non-standard thing
why can't i do something outside of this
box of options
tell me tell me if i if i go outside
this box tell me what's going to happen
that's what trump does all the time
his most basic way of managing is okay
now i'm thinking of something that's
outside that box
how much trouble would i get in if i do
that
it is the question you're supposed to
ask
if the answer comes back if you get
outside this box you're going to get
creamed
and then he says okay thank you and then
he stays in his box
wasn't that exactly what you want
somehow the democrats have made
good basic leadership which is asking
all the questions the questions inside
the box but importantly the ones outside
the box those might be the important
ones
and every time they describe trump doing
exactly what i want my leader to do
as if it's a mistake i always say the
same thing
do democrats know anything about
leadership
it's as if they don't even know what it
is
like it's some weird concept
right yeah they don't understand human
motivation
if you don't understand human motivation
and you can see that in a number of
examples of the systems they prefer
if you don't understand the human
motivation how could you possibly
understand leadership
right
those two are linked
there's no such thing as leadership
without a big variable about human
motivation
[Music]
because that's what the leader
tweaks that's what they work on they
work on your motivation
to motivate you to do what they want
all right
um
so now that the january 6 hearings have
shown that trump uh
clearly was not trying to do any illegal
insurrection
clearly it was not planned or at least
there's no evidence of it
and
what so what is what are the people who
have bet everything on this and now lost
the bet
because there was nothing there how did
they act
did they say wow well we looked and i'm
glad we looked there were some flags
there
there were some red flags and by the way
i agree there were some red flags
would anybody disagree with that
i i do think this was worth looking into
you know i had
i wish i had been done better you know
in a different way
but i think the republicans ended up
they they pursued what i would say is a
risky strategy
by not supporting the you know members
of the thing so you know mcconnell
withdrew withdrew their support because
they didn't get the
people on on the committee that they
wanted
but those people were also implicated in
the actual
the actual allegations
so that was a little gamesmanship right
so it was mostly gamesmanship and
politics
that mitch mcconnell decided not to
participate
so
uh it was a show trial and then the show
showed that trump basically was not
guilty of the primary allegations
so now they're they're they're backing
up from well we didn't mean he planned
an insurrection
did it sound like that
oh
well mccarthy i'm sorry let me correct
that being corrected it was mccarthy not
mcconnell who
pulled out of participating in the
hearings
so do you get that correction it wasn't
wasn't
it wasn't mcconnell
but whenever i see a clever political
thing i think i'm biased toward thinking
it was mcconnell i mean you could hate
that as much as you want but he
knows how to do this stuff same with
pelosi right
no matter what you think of pelosi
don't you don't you ever have this
feeling god damn it
she does get some stuff done for her
side right
as old as they are they do get stuff
done
for their team anyway even if you wish
they wouldn't
um so now since the main insurrection
planning and insurrection thing has been
completely debunked
does the news go back and say well we
checked it out they were
you know serious allegations
and there were some red flags there we
checked that we found nothing
so let's let's go on with their lives
glad we checked is that what they'll say
no
and no they won't
they will show you no evidence and tell
you you saw it
same same with russia collusion
they will prove by looking for it and
not finding it if you can call that
proof
they will show that there's no evidence
whatsoever of their allegations
and then at the same time they'll tell
you that they found them and there were
plenty of them and oh my god there's so
many i can't even get into them
and and their their base will actually
believe that
now we don't have to guess
if that can happen because we watched it
and it's happening right in front of us
in real time
it happened with the russia collusion
when it was shown that there was no
evidence for russia collusion
instead of just saying whoops you know
there were some signals there but i'm
glad there's none there glad we checked
instead
they made it sound like russia
interference in the election was really
sort of the same story and really it's
been proven to be true so it's really
the same as collusion
and they sold that
ask a democrat
if trump was colluding with russia and
they'll say yes
and it was shown it was proven
and then you ask them like what
and then they'll describe that the
russians had some memes
and that's it a hundred thousand dollars
worth of memes that nobody saw
that's it and then they'll say that
russian collusion was now as bashia
crazy as that sounds a standard
cognitive dissonance
if you didn't know what cognitive
dissonance
is
that would make no sense to you think
you'd think they were lying right
some of them are
but mostly
they actually believe their own story
because the brain can't hold the fact
that they were that wrong about
something that important
so their brain allows them to be right
by just redefining stuff
now
correct me if i'm wrong
but i've decided that if america ever
split up you know we're talking about
red state blue state kind of thing i
don't think it's going to happen but if
it ever did happen
you would have the republican party the
country
would continue to follow the
constitution
right
i think that's a fair a fair prediction
the red part would just say well we'll
keep the constitution this will be the
country
the blue part i believe would start a
new system
they would focus less on the
constitution
and more on their primary way of
operating
which is to change the definition of
normal words until they can put you in
jail
and that sounds ridiculous doesn't it
that they would have a system of
governing
of which the operating system that the
basic prevailing you know the biggest
theme that goes across all of it is that
they can change the definition of a
standard word that's been used forever
and that by changing the definition of
that word
they can make you a criminal
right
so they can look at trump and say
all right we saw you do a bunch of
things and we're gonna we're gonna
change the definition of insurrection
to be what you're doing there
that's it all they did is change the
definition of an insurrection
to make it look like you fit
now you say to yourself well that's a
one-off
that's a one-off right
but it isn't
because right as i'm being prompted in
the comments remember when he talked to
rafsenberger he said
in the context of an audit
he said you only need to find 11 000
votes to change the outcome
and the democrats changed the word find
into
lie and cheat
which was the opposite
of what was in evidence what was in
evidence is they were talking about an
audit the person talking believed that
the
the votes had been miscounted and
miscounted against him
and that all that rafsenberger needed to
do is find
the votes that trump believed existed
and had not been counted
that's it
or vice versa find some votes were
counted they shouldn't
and
the democrats turned that into lying and
cheating
a common word find
and how about protests got turned into
insurrection
and now
believe it or not
they are literally trying to convince
you
that the standard definition that has
served us forever
of a recession which is two consecutive
quarters of negative growth
is no longer the definition of a
recession
and that it must be looked at in a
holistic way
for the first time
we never did before
but now they need to change the
definition of recession so that the
thing we're going to experience and
observe with our own eyes and and our
own bodies
isn't what it used to be now it's
something else
and a cnn headline
and i'm not making this up this is going
to sound like a joke
this will sound like it came from the
babylon b
parody website
swear to god i'm not making this up an
actual headline from cnn today
this is a cnn headline
who decides if the u.s is in a in a
recession
eight white economists you've never
heard of
can you all join me in just a heavy sigh
i don't even feel like i need to talk
about it do i
because anything i say is your head is
already there so join me i will read it
again and i'd like to get a simultaneous
sigh
this will be our first simultaneous
heavy sigh okay
and wait for the prompt
cnn headline who decides if the uss u.s
is in the recession
eight white economists you've never
heard of
moving on
um i think i saw this in the hill there
was some uh
publication there was some
study that says a new poll
the majority of americans say the u.s
government is corrupt
and almost a third of americans
say it may soon be necessary to take up
arms against it
so one-third of the
now remember that includes democrats
so one-third means you know something
like 80 of
well actually they had the number
some gigantic percent of republicans
obviously are saying that now again
here's the context that
the news always leaves out
when was the last time you were in the
group of republicans who did not say
they might have to take up arms against
the government
i think the proper context for a study
like this is
and we should note
that 100 of republicans 100 of the time
say we might be getting close to needing
to take up arms against our own
government
again
it's the operating system of republicans
it's not a it's not a poll
it's a definition of a republican
if i were gonna define a republican
you know in like a like a funny summary
it would be someone who thinks that at
any minute they're going to have to
shoot their own
government
to keep them in line
am i wrong
a republican by definition is somebody
who thinks at any moment i mean i might
need to shoot a government official to
keep them in line
not trying to no i'm not talking about
an insurrection
i'm talking about keeping the government
from
abusing you
there's nothing more basic to the
republican personality than
yeah i gave my government some power i'm
not comfortable with it
but i did keep one i did keep one right
all right
what does a republican hate worse
than giving rights to the government you
know powers to the government nothing
there's nothing they hate worse than
that
but they did keep one right for
themselves
the right to shoot those
 if they go too far
i mean it's really the right tone of gun
but it ends up being the same thing
so i'm not sure that we should do polls
when all you're really doing is finding
out the definition of a republican and
reporting it like something changed i
don't think anything changed
all right
um
i would like to thank the january 6
committee for my victory
you know i've been saying since the
beginning there's no evidence of
trump forming any kind of an
insurrection but i don't think i could
have
operated in society successfully unless
the hearings had shown me correct and
now as mark levin has pointed out on his
show i think last night mark levin was
saying the same thing i said which is um
nothing happened
there's no evidence whatsoever and all
the evidence we did get the stuff that's
new
such as the knowledge certain that don
jr didn't know about any any res
insurrection plan that's for sure
we now know that there was no evidence
and that i've been exonerated by the
january 6 committee so i would like to
thank them all for their service i think
they have some more special thanks to
our representatives kenzinger kinzinger
and cheney who i have to admit i had a
negative initial thought
about their participation but now that
they've exonerated me and president
trump
i would like to thank them for their
service because there were some red
flags there
i think we need to be smarter
about agreeing when there's a red flag
but understanding that doesn't mean
there's really a crime it just means
there's something to look into
i'm kind of glad we looked into the
russia collusion thing you know given
that unfortunately it was
an allegation that was out there
we kind of had to look into it
as much as i hated it
so
i respect their service and thank you
for clearing me and exaggerating the
president opening up his path to the
presidency
trump that is
so i think they've pretty much
guaranteed his win i don't think trump
could have won without the january 6
hearings
i think this is the key to his comeback
and i think that mccarthy not
participating
in the long run is going to look like
one of the smartest
political plays of all times because
imagine if the republicans had
participated i mean in a meaningful way
not not kinslinger and cheney
if they had participated
it would look like they had to defend
themselves
what does it look like when you don't
even bother to defend yourself
it looks like you didn't need to
yeah
yeah one of the the baller plays that
your defense attorney can do
is to not present a case in rebuttal
that's like a pretty baller move if you
get away with it basically the move is
well you just watched the entire
prosecution and they didn't have
anything
i'm not going to waste your time ladies
and gentlemen the jury
given that right in front of you you saw
that there was no case i don't need to
present a case that there's no case
because the prosecution just did it
they just did my work for me
all of the discovery all of their
testimony goes to the innocence of my
victim of my victim of my client
and so with your with respect and with
your permission ladies and gentlemen the
jury i'd like to leave this to your
decision making i think you've seen
enough
there's there's nothing i can add to
this the case is over
and in effect that's what mccarthy did
now i don't know if that was his
intention or what forces were operating
on him but i'll tell you this
probably it had to do with trump more
than mccarthy
am i right
do you think mccarthy made that decision
himself
or do you think it was trump
and if trump made the decision
to not have a defense
and he pulled this off
it's the play of the year
i don't know
it's premature
i i don't know that trump was behind it
and i don't know that that's the outcome
exactly yet but it looks like it
at this point it looks like he took a
very high risk play
not defending himself
and it worked perfectly
because there wasn't anything there was
no evidence of his crime now trump is
the only person
who could have known that play would
work
because he's the only person who knows
exactly what he did and did not do
nobody else knew
even the people closest to trump don't
know every conversation he's ever had
you know even though i joke that
obviously don jr would have to be in on
a coup even don jr doesn't know what
trump is doing all day long
who we talk to what calls him but nobody
knows that there's literally one person
in the world
who could have known
that not putting on a defense
would
work only the person who knew he didn't
do anything wrong
he's the only person who could have
known that for sure
and i think this was his play
and i think it worked
it looks like it worked
now of course the you know half the
country will say it didn't work and he's
been proven guilty because that's the
way it works you know but it looks like
it worked
it looks like it worked
and once again
you'll you'll see that
the things have gotten so bad in terms
of the gas lighting in this country
that we won't know the difference
between the thing and the opposite of
the thing
we are observing in real time that
there's no evidence for the allegations
of a planned insurrection
we're seeing it right in front of us
but half of the country will literally
look at the same thing you're looking at
and say i saw plenty of evidence
and so i would offer you and i tweeted
this earlier if you want to see what
cognitive dissonance looks like and
practice
this is actually this will sound like a
joke but it's not a joke
you should practice identifying
cognitive dissonance in those rare
situations where you know you can
produce it
sometimes it just pops up in in the in
the wild
and you don't know there was any trigger
so you don't know if that's really
cognitive dissonance or it's just
somebody acting weird
but if you know you can trigger it then
you get to watch the face
and then you can recognize the look
because there's a look
the best way i could describe it is
a person who looks like their eyes have
light and there's some intelligence they
will suddenly turn into an npc
for about half a minute
so let me give you
this won't help if you're listening on
spotify but i'm going to give you my
visual representation of somebody being
triggered into cognitive dissonance
they'll start like i am you can see that
i have a light the light of intelligence
in my eyes i hope
unless i'm an npc but it looks like if
you looked in my eyes you'd say oh
there's he's thinking there's stuff
going on there the moment cognitive
dissonance goes in the eyes change and
they get
and
then things come out of their mouth
they seem disconnected with the light of
intelligence that used to be in the eyes
the light of intelligence just
clicks off
yeah and you'll see word salad
you'll see word salad you'll see anger
you'll see completely irrational
arguments that something proves
something that doesn't even make sense
and
shark eyes somebody says they'll have
short guys confusion word salad yeah so
the way you can trigger that is to say
that the january 6 committee was a big
success because it cleared trump of
insurrection charges
and
opened his path to the white house
say that to a democrat
and then look at the eyes
seriously no there's no joke here
seriously i sound like
i sounded like a joe biden there no no
joke
yeah
all right
so try that
let's see
um
so there's a the wall street journal did
some kind of a weird hit piece on on
musk
uh here's the story which i think has
been completely debunked
uh musk says that there's no truth to it
and there's evidence that there's no
truth to it
but uh apparently the wall street
journal is reporting
that one of the founders of google
sergey brin
broke up with his wife because his wife
had an affair with elon musk
elon musk says he's never even been
alone with her like he's only better in
some places with
where other people were there a few
times that's it he doesn't even know her
basically
except for those few you know public
events uh and then here's the funny part
oh and the story says
that musk got caught in the affair and
allegedly got down on one knee and
begged sergey brin for forgiveness
can i get a simultaneous sigh
can i
yeah this is a little bit too on the
nose
right
do you have to wonder if this is
true
it's not true
as soon as you see this part he got down
on one knee and begged bryn for
forgiveness
please
please
who thinks that happened
really
really
come on
and
so but but here's the funniest part so
musk responded by showing a selfie that
he just took partying with sergey brin
so apparently those two don't have any
issues so that that part seems to be
demonstrated but then musk said this in
a tweet
i i'll let you wrestle with this
yourself
he said that he hasn't in fact he hasn't
had sex in months because he's too busy
um i'd like to introduce
the world's first
simultaneous scoff
[Laughter]
now i'm going to combine this with a
simultaneous sip
and i'd like you all to join me
and again i'll prompt you
but it's going to go like this
in this case the the
the beverage will just be a prop
and so once i read you the the the lead
in i want you i want you to do this
you have to do it just like that
right so that remember the sip is just a
prompt or a it's just a prop all right
so i'm going to read i'm going to read
the news story again
and then you give me the simultaneous
scoff but i'm going to add a little to
it okay
so i'll enhance it a little bit
so according to the wall street journal
the richest man in the world who is
single
and flies around anywhere he wants and
does anything he wants in his private
jet
according to them or according to musk
uh he hasn't had sex in months
okay
now
you have to you have to love elon musk
for that
because
first of all here's a question
is it a lie if you know it's not true
it's sort of a weird question right
is it a lie if you know it's not true
that couldn't possibly be true
now unless now if the real story you
have some medical problem i'd say oh
okay
but
you probably would have mentioned it you
know because it seems like it would be
important to the story
no
that's funny
all right
um
i believe i've covered everything
it was a very newsy day
did i talk about bob the engineer yet
or did i imagine it
did i do that yet
i was talking to the locals people
before i came on live here i don't think
i did
all right well uh so there's a good
chance that i will be canceled by the
time i'm done here not because of
something i said today
but because of a comic that ran today in
which some of you know i introduced a
new character um called bob
i'm sorry not bob
what do i talk about dave
so the character's name is dave
um the reason i said bob is that i have
like a
i always use bob as my example name if
you've noticed that because it's a funny
sounding name and it's a short name
but uh so i got confused so dave the
engineer is a black engineer he's a new
character in dilbert
and the back story is that i wish i'd
introduced more diversity earlier on
but it's a minefield if you're a white
creator and you add a black character or
even a female character anything that
isn't you
you're going to get um
you said ages oh
i think he said months actually
in a different
different context but he did say ages as
well
anyway ages months whatever it is it's
still funny
um
so here's what happened so i create the
daily comics in black and white line
drawings and then the colorization is
done by a third party that
i don't know
so somebody i've never met
adds the color to the daily comics
now interestingly
if you like nerdy behind the scenes
things
i do the color for or my assistant does
for the sunday comics
so if you see a colorization problem in
the sunday comic that's on me
if you see a colorization problem in the
daily comics you know the three panel
ones that means that somebody else that
i've never even met
made that problem
so
here i did a comic that
i only thought was safe enough for me to
do
because the character doing the talking
was a black character
the colorizer turned my black character
white
and the backstory would be erased by
that
and turned it into something that i
wouldn't have published
because it would be
sounding too insulting right
so here's the comic and you can see the
my black character dave has been turned
white
right
against my will
now believe it or not i don't get to see
these before they're published
so there was no i didn't there's no part
of the process where i see it and
approved the coloring no normally
there's no problem right
and here's what uh dave the engineer who
should have been black should have said
to the boss from now on my pronouns are
she and her and i will report to h.r any
bigoted use of the wrong pronoun
and then the boss says is this parody or
are you serious
and then dave says as he's walking away
i think you will find it doesn't matter
now
if you make this character black
it adds a whole new flavor of you know
you understand he's just messing with
the system right
if you make the character white
you can't you're not really sure if he
is serious
right
so
i feel like this removed a layer of
safety from me
in which it it makes the it makes the
intention of the author ambiguous
if the black character who is known for
screwing with the system
screwed with the system then you say oh
that's that's what he intended
that guy always screws in the system
so there he is doing it again
but if it's a different character you
don't know if his background is he
screws with the system or if he's
serious
so the whole little joke falls apart
now if i'm not
you know if i don't get some pushback
from this by today it could mean that
people are just tired of the whole
pronoun thing
which i feel like that's happening
does it feel to you like the pronoun
thing
um
is is going to die out
feels like it yeah it feels like it lost
its energy
but uh we'll see if i get cancelled for
this
so uh
this will amuse you
so i did send a message to my editor to
ask the person who does the colorizing
to give me a call
[Laughter]
how worried would you be if you were the
person who does the colorizing
and instead of just asking them to
you know correct this next time
if i asked you to call me directly
yeah that's sort of an oh morning
now i'm going to be gentle because you
know mistakes are mistakes i
typically
typically i'm not going to go off on
somebody for a mistake
so i i need to put that out there i
don't i don't go off on people for
mistakes
i go off on people for doing something
intentionally
if you do something intentionally
and i don't like it you're probably
gonna hear about it
but if you you know run over my dog
and and i i'm genuinely convinced it was
an accident
i'm very sad about my dog
but i'm not mad at you because an
accident's an accident
so so this the whoever did the
colorizing
probably wasn't aware that i have a
standing standing instructions to make
that character black and that it's
important
so that would just be a mistake
i'll make sure it doesn't happen again
but i wouldn't
uh
all right so i just got to notice that
the correct version is live let's see
that
let's call that up and see if the
correct version is live
um it's going to take a moment now there
it is
while i was talking
he got recolorized literally while i was
talking
so there's there's the new one
so
so but here's the thing
it's already in newspapers
so online dave will be black but in
newspapers that run color they don't all
run color on the weekdays but a lot of
the newspapers run color comics in the
weekdays and
so this character will be a different
ethnicity in those comics
all right
um you're gonna have to
probably refresh the page
to get a change as i did
was there any other topic
can you make an nft of the white dave
well that would be a copyright violation
but this is a heck of an idea
oh kids and monkey box
all right so i was going to tweet this
but i didn't want to get cancelled
so i think i can do this live because
it's i'll add some explanation
did you see a tweet by uh uh e with ian
miles chung
and
and it was about the story that
um there were
two children who had monkey pox
and uh
and they believe that they contracted it
at home
and then there are there's other
reporting that suggests that it might be
sexually transmitted
and
and
the tweet was
are we allowed to ask any questions
are we allowed to ask any questions
it might be sexually transmitted and two
children got it in their own home
and
are we are we allowed to ask any
questions
i love that tweet it like that summed up
that summed up the whole last five years
didn't it
are we allowed to ask any questions
oh my god
any news from behind the curtains
well um i did give you some
which is it's not hard
that it's not hard
uh to hire some nazis
so i don't know if he knew that
all right
um
sudafed is great yeah
so
i had an interesting experience
i i suspected that um i don't have real
allergies even though i appear to have
the worst seasonal allergies in the
world
and that is actually food
and that i narrowed it down to cheese
and i thought there was some kind of
sulfites in the cheese
because that seems to be my algae
and sure enough parmesan cheese has
sulfites and i've avoided cheese when my
when my voice was clear and you could
tell i didn't have any congestion
those were days that i'd gone without
parmesan cheese for several days
when i went to an event
you know really the first event where
there were lots of people this weekend
in two years
the
only food that was vegetarian had some
parmesan cheese
and so i said to myself well no it's not
lactose intolerance so it has nothing to
do with the dairy it has to do with the
additive in one kind of cheese
and parmesan cheese it was sprinkled
with parmesan cheese and for three days
i've had
allergy like symptoms
and i think if i just go to a couple
more days without eating any parmesan
cheese then i'll be clear again
now i've been
here's some of the best
um
here's some of the best
life advice you could ever get
some days
if you could pick like a couple of weeks
and try to bring your diet
down to the most minimum
clean diet you can
just for like two weeks as an experiment
and what i mean by that is just you know
eat vegetables and
you know avoid anything with a sauce on
it and just get really really basic
and see if your allergies go away
because i have a theory that our food is
is poison
and you know not every kind i think if
you get some you know a bag of washed
broccoli florets you're probably fine
probably as far as i know
but i think everything that's in a can
or a freezer
they've got additives
and i think we're allergic to the
additives where many of us are
have you noticed that everybody's
anxious and everybody's got allergies
and everybody's got asthma there's like
a there's an epidemic of adult onset
asthma which was historically unusual
it's in the food
i mean at this point we just have to say
our food is killing us
have have you gone to a large event
for the first time let's say after two
years of the pandemic did you notice
anything about the uh
the shape and size of the attendees
oh man did people gain weight in the
last two years oh man
did people gain weight a lot of weight
and
you know so our food is just killing us
it's absolutely killing us
and if you just eat clean for two weeks
tell me how much inflammation you have
there are days when i have so much
inflammation
that it's hard to walk up and down
stairs
like actually it's sort of a struggle
there are other days
when it doesn't seem to be related to
exercise
i can run up and down the stairs with no
inflammation like i'm a teenager no
difference at all
and it's something i'm eating there are
days when i'm eating something that's
making me inflamed for 48 hours and i
don't know what it is
it's probably not the sulfites might be
something else
but there is something
that is killing me and it's in
the food and it's killing you too we
just don't know what it is
it's probably more than one thing
i think i actually ate too little salt
not long ago because i was eating so
clean
that my salt i think got lower than i
needed for the amount of heat and
exercise i do
is it a pot allergy no pot actually
cleans up my my allergies pot actually
decreases the symptoms
quality sea salt
micro plastics in the water could be
it could be micro plastics in the water
yep yeah you need a little salt and fat
that's true
i can overdo it sometimes
seed oils
not intentionally i don't intentionally
eat any seed oils
all right
uh
did i miss a comment you wanted me to
see yeah i've tried hani i don't believe
in that
i i think soy is probably a problem in
our diet
try the carnivore diet well i'm a veg
i'm a pescetarian
so i won't be trying your carnivore diet
cucumbers are good for inflammation i
know they scare cats that's their that's
their primary use
all right that's all for now and i'll
see you later youtube
and spotify
