ladies and gentlemen
good morning and welcome to probably the
best experience you'll ever have in your
life
if you wait until i get through the
newsy stuff
i'm going to tell you stuff that will
change the world
change your life for sure
make you happier and less anxious
how would you like to be less anxious
or do you have any kids who are less
were anxious would like to be less well
i'm going to fix all that after we
sort out the world affairs
all right should we i don't know i just
feel a responsibility we should take
care of all the big problems in the
world first
and then we'll work on you
okay
but first let's take it up a notch let's
take it up
let's let's go up a level we're going to
level up and all you need is a couple of
my girth glass of tanker tells us time a
canteen jugger flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite beverage
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the dope
media of the day the thing that makes
everything better you can feel your
pulse quickening your breathing is
getting
faster it's coming it's the simultaneous
step go
i can barely explain
the euphoria i'm feeling right now
speaking of euphoria
i'm going to make an entertainment
recommendation a non-recommendation
i don't know if i've ever done one of
these before
there is a series called
euphoria uh
i didn't know what to say about it i
watched two episodes
and
first of all it's kind of a masterpiece
i gotta say
because
it looks like what they did was they
they took some high school
you know the the plot is about high
school kids
and what they did was
say what would happen if we showed you
what it really looks like
and then they show you what it really
looks like
and you're just horrified the whole time
you spend the whole time just thinking
really
what
is this what happens when they walk out
the door now i'm not your children right
so it's a certain subculture
but uh
it is just jaw-dropping
anyway
it's scary and if you don't want to be
exposed to that kind of stuff that's why
i say it's a recommendation
non-recommendation
you might you might just not want to
have it in your hand
you know you just might want to avoid
that kind of entertainment but it's a
masterpiece it's really well done
well
who loves canadian truckers
who does who loves canadian truckers
you do
i do
yes we all do except for trudeau
well uh i don't know how any
single industry has ever become more
popular more quickly
but there's nothing i love more than a
canadian trucker
right
it's funny just because they're doing
this protest
which apparently is getting fairly
massive
uh in canada over the mandates up there
uh elon musk has tweeted his support
how much difference does an elon musk
tweet of support
mean in today's world
probably a lot
probably a lot
and i don't know how many other people
you could put in his category
i can't think of another one frankly
think of anybody else
who would have enough credibility
frankly credibility is the thing
to
to be able to you know tweet support and
then people would think that's a good
thing
there aren't many people
there's a great video of a canadian
small business owner
who's putting up a sticker on his
business he tore down the
the mask signs i guess or the mandate
signs i'm not sure what they said
and and he put up his own sticker of a
canadian truck
and as soon as i saw that i thought i
thought well i want one of those
i want a canadian trucker
sticker don't you
i mean i i don't think i've ever seen a
bumper sticker that i craved before
but if you could give me a bumper
sticker of a just a canadian trucker i'd
put that in my car tomorrow i know
i like it
so i love what those guys are doing and
i love the idea of putting up a sticker
on your business
the point of which is that
he's defying mandates basically
now locally
uh most of you are probably in
non-band-aid states would that would
that be true
how many people watching are are already
past the mandates a lot of you right
so
good for you
wish us luck
those of us who are still behind
uh
the concentration camp doors here in
california
yeah so i
i crave your lifestyle but i got to tell
you i'm starting to
uh to feel it
locally
let me just say this out loud
you know i didn't want to say this out
loud right away
but locally the mandates have dropped
for small businesses
meaning that
if if you went into i don't know maybe
if you went into the cheesecake factory
or something that's a chain
they might tell you to put on a mask i
don't know target store they might
but if you go into any local business
it's done
the local businesses are all done
am i right
now
all i mean is that i'm not saying there
are no masks i'm saying that they're not
going to ask you to put one on
there's no local business that'll do
that anymore here i don't know about
your town
because number one there's nobody afraid
of consequences
what exactly would be the consequences
for your
your local whatever
if they don't require masks on february
1st
nothing right there's no consequences so
they just have to decide they don't want
it anymore and a lot of them have
so on february 1st i'm going to do my
damn just to not go anywhere where they
still require that
now i don't know how long i can hold out
right if the mandate sold out i might i
just might need to go to target
i just might need to
but i'm gonna
do what i can to
just for as long as i can
you know not fly
i'm just gonna avoid flying until the
masks are gone
because by february 1st i'm pretty sure
i can say all right i can hold out
for however long that's going to take
if it takes a week or if it takes three
months i can hold out i don't have to
fly for three months
but i'm not going to support any
industry that's still sporting the masks
for sure
but i'll do my best i can't promise you
i'll be consistent on that but i'll do
my best on that
i hope others do just to put a little
pressure on it now i was trying to think
of what kind of symbol
could small businesses or even big ones
put on their
building
to say that they're done with mandates
what would be the most
appropriate symbol besides the canadian
truckers which i like a lot
the american flag
i would think that if you wanted to show
that you were done with the mandates on
february 1st
just put on a flag
you don't have to say anything else
i don't think
i think anybody who was aware of the
february first date who saw an american
flag on a business or even even a
residence
even a residence actually if you have an
american flag
and you have a flagpole you know maybe
you put it out on on
the patriotic holidays
maybe think about it
just think about putting it out
because if you think about it there is
no
there's no more
universal signal
for revolution
than the american flag
if you want a real insurrection
yeah the american flag is a good symbol
for it all right uh there's a report
jack possabic
is saying that
the white house had no idea about breyer
retiring from the supreme court and now
they're scrambling
they asked kamala and she said no per a
white house staffer
do you believe
well first of all some context
um
jack passabek has good sources
right
so he has good sources so that's the
first part of the contact but do you
believe this
that doesn't mean every that doesn't
mean every source is correct right
um
but do you believe that kamala was asked
if she wanted it and said no
i believe it
i believe it
and here's why i believe it
because asking doesn't mean they wanted
her to have it
asking sounds like
within a political context
they just wanted to check
because what if she said yes
it would be kind of a disaster if she
had secretly craved
that position and nobody asked
so i think you just have to ask
but i think they also knew that they
probably knew what she would say by then
right
so don't you think the asking was more
of a
a political formality just to make sure
she didn't have an issue
so if you ask me that sounds like a
that that sounds like a completely
accurate
um
what would you call a scoop
yeah i think jack got this one right
as he often does
so
um that doesn't mean anything about
kamala it just means they probably asked
her
now what do you think what are you
thinking about this uh
supreme court
having to be a black woman
um i think the rasmussen poll said uh 61
61 of the public
thinks you shouldn't prick a
prick that you shouldn't pick a supreme
court nominee based on race or gender
61 is a pretty big majority
in american politics it's hard to get 61
for anything
but
um
i'll tell you i'm i'm a little bit of
two minds on this
i'm a little bit of two minds
i've i've told you before that when it
comes to
uh the republic
and and protecting the republic
and the system
versus getting my way on a specific
policy
i'll usually pick the system over the
specific policy
there might be some exceptions but
generally speaking i would do that
now what does it do to the system
when the supreme court who would be the
very entity that says a business can't
do this
the same entity
that has ruled that a private business
can't do this you can't hire people
based on race and gender
uh is is going to be the subject of this
very treatment i mean it's the president
doing it not the supreme court but they
would be subject to the same treatment
does that look like a gigantic mistake
let me let me give you the best argument
to support biden's position
because i think if you can't do that
you're not really an honest
broker if you know what i mean
if you can't tell the other side's
argument in a coherent way
and then still say your side is the
better one
you you just feel like a propagandist
basically
so i'm going to give biden is due and
here's the argument
we need to protect the system first
the the entire system is having a
credibility crisis i think you'd agree
congress the government experts
fake news there's a credibility crisis
of unprecedented proportion
supreme court is sort of our last
defense
against all of that you know as long as
we keep the supreme court
relatively coherent and credible
the other stuff has time to work itself
out in a variety of ways but you can't
lose the supreme court i feel like that
would that would just take the whole
system out
so if you imagine that the supreme court
is the the ultimate thing that keeps the
country together
i would say that having a supreme court
that
better represents
the public
remember this is a perceptual thing
it's not a data thing it's just a
perceptual thing
would the credibility of the court be
better
if you had at least one
black conservative man and which we have
and one black conservative woman
in the mix
now you might say to yourself no it
makes it worse because it looks like a
you know it looks like a
diversity higher
but nobody's really saying any of these
people are unqualified are they
is there anybody in the supreme court
that we think is unqualified
they're just people that we hate their
decisions in some cases right
i don't think any of them are
unqualified
yeah i see the names there's some names
going by blah blah but you know is it a
coincidence that the unqualified ones
are always on the other team
seriously
just a coincidence that all the
unqualified people
disagree with your opinion
i mean maybe i mean you could be right
and it's exactly that
but i wouldn't i wouldn't automatically
assume that that's what's going on it
sounds a little bit more like
a little bit team play situation going
on
so if i were to support biden's argument
i'd say you do want the supreme court
to look
at least a little bit like the country
because then whatever it comes up with
is going to have that little
that little five percent extra well
you know we we got a lot of opinions
from different kinds of people
now if that require if the net of that
is you end up with a worse
uh justice well then
that's a step backwards would we agree
with that
if having this
i hope it's temporary
silly
diversity higher thing on there if
having this temporary little thing
caused us to get a worse
justice that wouldn't be good but
there's no evidence that that's the case
is anybody saying that the
i know a dozen or so
black women who are being mentioned is
anybody saying they're unqualified
i don't think that's in the argument is
it
so
on one hand i reject anything that seems
like discrimination and this certainly
smacks of
racial discrimination
uh on the other hand
it does favor the system over the
policies
i generally don't take a stand when
that's the case
so in other words i i'm not even going
to say which is a better way to go i'm
just going to be silent whenever the
system is supported over the over the
decision
i'm not sure if that's fair or not
let's talk about russia and
ukraine
so
are you a little bit puzzled as i am
about the way the united states is
handling all of this as in
there's something we don't know
does it feel like that to you
and i'll give you some more context
about this you know that the few times
that i've been allowed behind the
curtain
to see how things really run as opposed
to the public impression of how anything
works
you always get such a different view
you know from behind the curtain
nothing's the same
and basically nothing is the same behind
the curtain
so why would this be different it's sort
of like that the gel man amnesia thing
if every time i i peek behind the
curtain i see that everything we know
or thought we knew is wrong
like every time
why would this be different
do you really think we have enough
information about this little russia
ukraine thing that you and i could say
let me assemble the variables as they've
been reported
and judge the actions of our government
based on these totally accurate
variables that leave nothing out
probably nothing like that can happen
probably there's something gigantic or
several gigantic things
or forceful people or
some money interest or something
that's going on that's big enough that's
distorting this thing
but let me tell you what it looks like
this is not a claim that this is what's
happening
i'm going to say that
missing that variable or variables
this is what it looks like
which is different than what it is
what it looks like is that we're
intentionally suckering
putin into a limited uh limited
attack
because you know how biden sort of let
it out
you know we we don't know what we do if
with some kind of limited incursion
that kind of opened the door for a
limited incursion didn't it
sort of
you know at least at least put that the
thought in your mind is like
it seems they would they would treat a
limited incursion slightly differently
than a massive incursion
so is it possible again
i'm just considering all the
possibilities
that there's anybody in this world who
has influence over our government
whether it's biden staff or somebody
influencing them who thinks that a
limited incursion by russia would have
some benefit
to them or to the united states
for
example if russia did a limited
incursion
it might not change the security section
of the situation of the world much
but at the same time
it would allow us to close down their
energy markets
totally their country
and probably some american energy
companies would benefit but can somebody
do a fact check on that
are there any large entities doesn't
have to be american actually american or
european let's say
large entities energy companies
there would definitely benefit by russia
being shut down as an energy exporter
can you give me a fact check in the uh
some of you know the answer to this
right
china somebody says china
i don't know about that
so
so what i'm wondering is um do we know
for sure that russia is not going to
fall for this trap
i'm calling it a trap like
hypothetically i don't know that it's a
trap
um
and then here's the final clue and this
is from cnn now now hold what i've said
so far
and now i'm going to add a clue
this is cnn's reporting
and it says a call between zelinski head
of head of ukraine and biden on thursday
should have been used to get on the same
page
but the ukrainians made it known ahead
of time they would ask the us president
to tone down his rhetoric
interesting
and
after the leader spoke a senior
ukrainian official told cnn's matthew
chance and kiev
that the call quote did not go well
and that zelinski had asked his u.s
counterpart to quote calm down the
messaging while arguing the russian
threat was still ambiguous
still ambiguous
in other words it seems as if the united
states is selling
a higher certainty of invasion
than the ukrainians
believe is realistic
what does that tell you
does that tell you that somebody who
is maybe more of a friend to the united
states or to their pocketbooks
is influencing the united states to be
not on the same page as ukraine
and can you give me a good idea
why we would not be taking ukraine's
let's say opinion of risk as
fairly
definitive
why would our assessment of risk
trump ukraine's assessment of their own
risk i would i feel like they're pretty
tapped into whatever the risk is here
more so than we would be
or do we know more than they know it's
possible we know more than ukraine knows
and we can't tell them because of
sources and methods and
corrupt corrupt governments and whatnot
so
it's really
uh
burisma somebody said barisma comes up
in every conversation
yeah
so and what does it mean that ukraine
and the united states are not on the
same page would that suggest that
ukraine does not have any blackmail
on hunter biden
or will you see biden immediately
conform to ukraine's preferred
communication on this
which would suggest that ukraine does
have a pretty big influence on them
so
there are a number of scenarios here
that are
alarming uh when i tweeted about whether
or not we were trying to sucker russia
into something minor so we could grab
their energy markets
uh ian bremmer
who i looked to as the
the sane voice of the issues like this
assures me that we that we definitely
don't want
russia to attack
we definitely don't now
we definitely don't want a major war
i would agree with that
and i would agree that if we means most
people i would agree with that too
and if we means most of the government
i would definitely agree with that too
but i'm not sure we extends to everybody
who has billions of dollars to spend on
this project
i'm not sure we extends to every
influencer within the biden
administration
it wouldn't take many people
to be on the side of war to make it
happen
unfortunately like they would just have
to be the right people you would only
have to get a few opinions changed
before
biden would probably go along
so i remember those 17 intelligence
agencies that said blah blah blah and it
turned out it was really one but it
wasn't even the whole agency it was just
a few people and then it turned out that
the few people were handpicked by one
person
so the 17 intelligence agencies were
really one person
person could do a lot of damage
do you know how many how many things
have been done by one person recently
i mean look what greta tunberg has done
she's one person look what michael amina
did with a rapid testing
there was probably one person who
presented it
um there are a lot look what fauci does
one person
you know
yeah desantis one person
joe rogan one person
there's there's a lot of one-person
stuff going on here malone one person
no matter what you think of him big
influence
soros one person
so you know although one person can't
control everything that there is to
control
one person can definitely control one
topic
and it doesn't have to be the richest
you just need george floyd one person
yeah a good example
all right
so i'd say that there's a missing
variable in this russia stuff but i'm
not going to rule out yet despite the
smarter and more well-informed ian
bremer saying that nobody wants it
i'm not sure that nobody wants it
i'm not sure
i think there might be a play here where
we're just trying to
bluff them into doing something that's
bad enough
that we can crush them
financially and take their markets
i feel like that's the play
i don't know
nobody thinks russia is going to go
nuclear over ukraine i don't think
nobody i don't think anybody thinks that
all right
there's a new numbers that suggest a
growing crisis of men
so men
now comprise only 40.5 percent of uh
college students
what
they're they're
50 more
uh women in college than men
50 more
that's not close
and apparently one of the problems of
this is that women are less likely to go
to college if there aren't enough men
there
i hate to say it i i didn't make that up
by the way yeah
innocent innocent
innocent
as soon as you think i made that up i'm
in trouble i'll get cancelled nope nope
nope i'm not saying that some women go
to college to get married i'm saying i
just read an article and that was one of
the claims
that women say they don't want to go to
college if
if
finding a boyfriend is going to be like
a struggle
[Laughter]
i would like to admit
that i chose my undergraduate college
based on the male female ratio
i thought i needed an edge
so i chose a nursing school
it wasn't just a nursing school i had a
lot of majors but it was famous as a
nursing school so i had a high
percentage of
nursing students
and i thought what could be better than
having a college that has not only extra
women
but they're nursing students
i mean i figure i needed every advantage
i could get i need the ones with lots of
empathy
the ones who say oh
you're not that sexy but you do look a
little sick can we spend some time
together
so that was my strategy and i think it
worked brilliantly
so anyway men are failing everywhere
and of course the big question is is the
problem with men
or is the problem that college and
schools have been designed for women
what do you say
have schools been designed for both men
and women
let's stipulate that men have still a
sports advantage
meaning that sports seem to be
still more dominated toward men in lots
of places so besides sports
which we stipulate to be the case
besides sports
is college and high school designed for
men or for women or let's say optimized
is it optimized for men or for women
well i think that because we're a woke
society
you optimized for the comfort of the
the greatest number of people wouldn't
you say
you optimize for comfort
because you don't want women to be
in the situation with
a bad situation basically an
uncomfortable situation
and if you optimize for comfort
is there anything that might be
de-emphasized
yeah
for example maybe attracting men
because maybe maybe the curriculum and
the way it's being taught and and the
the let's say the extra stuff that comes
with it maybe it's not ideally suited
for men
so maybe men are just opting out because
it doesn't make sense but also because
it doesn't teach
in many cases the kinds of skills that a
lot of men are looking for
right maybe they're not looking for a
russian literature degree
maybe they just want to you know be a
plumber or something
but
so what can we do to fix it i told you i
was going to fix everything and i
thought i would do that right now
um i've said this before but i think
i've got a little more meat on the bones
and i just tweeted i said
suppose you were designing an open
source
not-for-profit
virtual college in which people could
independently assemble useful life
strategy skills
life strategy skills just things that
would help anybody
you know things like how to communicate
better
how to persuade
how to
how to work on your fitness and just
basic life strategies how to how to
build a skill stack how to use systems
versus goals you know that sort of thing
and
and i said what books would be on that
list if you were going to have a
credentialed
uh type of thing and so a number of
people suggest books i hope some of my
books make that list
uh i think i saw that they were on there
but
then i asked myself do you know what a
uh dow is d-a-o we've talked about this
before
a dao is a is a decentralized autonomous
organization
in which you use the blockchain part of
the the crypto universe you use the
blockchain to build um to create trust
and build a organization
for a single purpose
could you
and i'm not sure if this is a good idea
or not so somebody who knows more about
the
the these da
o's taos
can maybe inform me could you build a
dao to build a life strategies
credentialed
course
in which people who are simply
interested enough and qualified enough
say yeah i'll be on that project we'll
just put together a uh we'll just put
together a list
and we'll maintain it somehow and it'll
say if you read these books blah blah
blah now i think it also needs some
testing
could you create a way
to do
a quick enough test that you would say
you would know that somebody read my
book
right i'm not i'm not talking about like
testing you read everything in the book
and you understood it but did you read
the book
right enough of a test
that that you could be sure somebody did
and a way not to cheat
now could the blockchain
allow you to know your you didn't cheat
on the test
you did read the book
and you did get a credentialed
degree
and then could you form a different dow
for different uh let's say flavors of
life strategy degrees
and all of them could be credentialed
but maybe they'd be different so one
might say emphasize
i don't know more physical skills
one might emphasize more
you know mental
officey type of skill something like
that
but you can you can imagine some
different flavors it would all be
credentialed
so here's my point uh it seems obvious
at this point that the um
the embedded
educational system doesn't want to
change as fast as we need it to
would everybody agree with that
if you wait for the
the colleges and the
and the teachers unions to change
themselves you just be waiting forever
so you need some kind of outside
disrupting force
could you create
a situation
where somebody comes in for a job and
you say let's see your resume whoa
it looks like you were smart enough not
to rack up 200 000 in college debt
for a russian literature degree
i like that
let's see what you did do
okay you got one of these life
strategies credentials
can i see your certificate oh okay yeah
i could check that on the blockchain yep
there it is
our hr can check that and sure enough
you do have a degree in life strategies
well i mean is that good for us you know
we train you in the actual job
so we're going to train you how to do
the specific job but but let's see if
you're training bull
let's see
you've learned
communication you've learned public
speaking
you've learned persuasion
you've learned
how to build a skill stack systems over
goals
you've learned
and then i just go on
who do you want to hire
yeah who do you want to hire
that this is a trainable curious
um person
somebody who has the the skills to learn
a skill
right do you have the skill to learn a
skill that's all i care about i'll train
you the specifics
you know keep in mind that unless you're
something like a let's say lawyer doctor
engineer a few other fields
a lot of your
a lot of your stuff becomes obsolete in
a year anyway
you know even having experience isn't
what it used to be because you know
who's experienced in
the newest field
all right so that's my my first idea is
to fix all of education
by some kind of open source i'm not sure
if if crypto needs to be part of it but
maybe somebody smarter can say yeah that
would that would be a good component
uh number two
here is my single biggest uh happiness
tip
uh which will be followed by a few more
the best way to be happy is to match
your energy
to your schedule
and here's what i mean by that and by
the way this some of this comes from my
book cattle filled almost everything and
still win big
um
suppose i said how would you like some
delicious food
and i'd say i love delicious food
yay
and then you say all right we're gonna
do it right now
and i say oh
i actually just ate
so how much value would delicious food
be to me if i just ate i'm full well
none
so my my energy i'm using that
generically in this case my hunger
was not matched to this excellent thing
that i like eating good food
likewise
exercising when you're in the right mood
for it is actually kind of fun
exercising when you really don't want to
is just pain
it's just torture
so my one
whole life arc happiness tip that's the
best tip you'll ever hear
is work toward a situation and it won't
it won't happen instantly but work
toward a situation where you can control
your schedule as much as possible
because then you can say to yourself i'm
hungry
eat food
2 o'clock in the afternoon
and nobody's gonna stop you right
i i'm anxious
i'm going to go exercise right now i'm
going to stand up and walk out the door
right now
the moment you can match your exact
energy and need
to the thing that satisfies it your
happiness level is going to go through
the roof
i reminded myself of that yesterday
by
taking and this is uncharacteristic for
me i don't usually take a block out of
my day and just say this is just for me
like i'm always doing something for
somebody you were something i committed
to or something so typically i'm going
for one thing i have to do to one thing
i have to do
and even with my schedule
and i have a lot of flexibility but even
with my schedule
there's a limit to the flexibility
but in that two hours or so
in which i just said i'm just gonna do
whatever my energy wants me to do and
then i did that
i can't tell you how good that felt
just matching my exact schedule to my
exact energy
just through the roof
now just make sure you do that don't
don't save all of your
leisure for a vacation
don't save it all for vacation
sometimes you just got to carve out a
time to do the thing that you want to do
during that exact time
see how it feels all right next thing
it has been said of me many times and i
believe it's true that i'm unusually
good at handling pressure
has anybody noticed that about me i'm
not sure if you can tell from a distance
but do i seem like i'm a i'm good at
handling pressure i would be interested
in your subjective
evaluation
now you do see me blow up and stuff and
if anybody doesn't know it
if i let if i allow myself to lose
control on the live stream
it's because it's part of the show
you all get that right
you all get that if i were not doing a
live stream i wouldn't be
cursing as somebody and
you know and shouting and being a madman
it's just part of the entertainment if
you didn't like it i wouldn't do it
the moment the moment the audience no
longer wanted to see it i'd be like oh
okay
it would be easy to control
all right so here's my point in my own
opinion i think that i'm unusually
not susceptible to pressure
indeed i actually have always performed
better
in competition
when things are tight
yeah and i'm not sure how much that is
organic
but i will tell you this i have spent uh
most of my life
working on that like it's a life skill
of maximum importance
if
uh
let's say if you were to compare my
nervousness level to yours at age 11.
at age 11
pretty much a nervous mess
and it made me unhappy pretty much all
the time
nervous mess
and so i i realized at that point that
if i didn't make it my full-time job to
figure out how not to be stressed as
i would just be stressed forever and it
wouldn't matter what else was happening
even if everything else went well
i was still gonna feel like crap if i
didn't figure out how to get out of my
own head
so i'm going to teach you
how to get out of your own head and i'm
going to tell you why
everybody in this generation has an
anxiety problem
you've noticed right
everybody has an anxiety problem
mostly younger people
and if you're above a certain age you
probably don't
have you noticed that
above a certain age you probably don't
have an anxiety problem below a certain
age oh you have one oh you got one
yeah
so let me tell you what's different
about uh you know when i was young
versus when somebody's young right now
you know what's different
everything that affects your anxiety
everything everything that affects your
anxiety is worse
like way worse
let me give you an example
um
let's see
do you think that uh kids uh get get
outdoors as much as we used to we
meaning anybody in my age
no no there's no way in hell the kids
get outdoors
is getting outdoors correlated with your
anxiety yes
yes
it's super correlated like really really
strongly if you don't get outside you're
not going to feel as well right and
there's a big difference
how about complexity
when you're around a lot of complexity
does it make you anxious
it does
it does because it's like too much work
right
is life more complex
yes
by
by what uh order of magnitude it's not
even close
so of course they have more of a
challenge
how about uh are is it easier now to
compare yourself to others
oh my god yes
you know when i was a kid the only
person i could compare myself to
was somebody on the one channel of
television that came in well
and uh the the 25 people i knew
personally that's it
now you're comparing yourself to the
whole world and filters and yeah of
course all that
how about family cohesion
less
right there's less
how about
addiction
more
right so even if you're not the one
who's addicted
how many people have an addict in the
family mother father sibling
a lot
how many people had an addict in the
family when i was a kid there's still
too many
but i don't think it was close to what
it is now if you have one addict in the
house how's everybody's anxiety doing
am i right
everybody who has somebody who's
addicted to alcohol or substance
if you have one of them in the house
how's the energy level in the house
everybody calm
no
now one addict can ruin five people's
lives minimum
i i think that's actually
a reasonable ratio it's probably higher
but here's my number one addict ruins
five lives minimum somebody's saying 10
and i think you're closer to it
i think 10 is closer
one addict ruins five lives
minimum minimum
so that's different how about more fake
news scaring the out of you yes
that's different how about climate
change scaring the down to you well
that is different but i will say to
balance it out we my generation we had
the nuclear war risk all the time
and that felt similar like you know life
as we know it could end any moment so
maybe that part's similar but different
how about are we eating the wrong foods
and getting fatter and yes
are we less confident about the future
of course because everything's changing
faster and right
when i grew up i could be confident
about the future
because i knew if i went to college got
good grades i'd get a good job in any
variety of places
so i didn't really have any lack of
confidence because everybody had the
same path
study go to school get a good job
it was pretty much straightforward but
now who knows could be robots and ai in
five years
how about uh um
how about being less self-sufficient
i would argue that a 14 year old in my
generation
could successfully run a small business
is there anybody my age or older who
would disagree with me in my generation
a 14 year old could successfully and did
and in fact i know people who did
exactly that
i know somebody well
who ran an entire
bowling alley at 14.
it was something his father his father
built
and owned but then his father had you
know his career went somewhere else and
so he just said well i can either sell
this thing or you can be in charge of it
he was 14 years old he said okay i'll
run it
and then he ran his business at 14.
later started his own large business
sold it for millions do you think that
running a business at 14 helped him
become an entrepreneur later
yeah
that kind of builds your confidence
doesn't it
now
now here just for a joke
imagine a 14 year old today running a
business
i'm sure there's still some
but it it's it's almost like a joke
right it's a complete difference in in
how self-sufficient you were a 14 year
old back then
would not know how to do things but
would know how to figure it out we just
ask somebody figured out
but we'd have the confidence that we
could figure it out
so all those things are wrong and here's
uh here's my
tip for
fixing it all
do you remember you were have you ever
been taught that happiness comes from
within have you ever heard that saying
happiness comes from within
were you taught that when you were young
yes if you
if you just seek within
you know find out who you really are you
know follow your dreams follow your
passion so you know for sort of an
internal
process
that you could find happiness
that might be the worst advice ever
given
it's the worst advice there's no
happiness within
it's not in there don't look for it
it's not in there
your brain is just a recipient of inputs
you just change the inputs
happiness is without
happiness will come to you by doing the
right things externally with your body
take your body outdoors
don't look within your skull go outside
in the sun walk around
happiness is not in your head
it's in your stomach
don't eat and then tell me you're
unhappy
maybe it's because you ate all day
maybe that made you unhappy i don't know
i just did a little experiment in the
last month
where i tried to really clean up my
eating
my allergies went away
i mean seriously
i mean i have pretty much permanent
allergies all the time
all i did was say offer for a month i'm
just going to really just eat really
clean i mean as much as you can in the
modern world my allergies went away
and i and yes i do have allergies in the
winter and all year round normally
so did i find happiness within
no it was on my plate
happiness is on your plate it's out
there
did i find happiness within or
you know did you have some good sex
you know did you
did you meditate did you do some yoga
did you get some exercise
did you put your phone down at 9 00 pm
instead of playing with it at 2 p.m and
do all the wrong things to sleep
have you spent 10 minutes
googling what it takes to have good
sleep habits
number one go to bed about the same time
every night and wake up about the same
time actually the waking up is more
important
right
here's my
when i was 11 and i realized that my
anxiety level somewhat biologically was
through the roof
i said to myself my number one job is
that
every day i'm gonna work on figuring out
how the
to stop worrying about everything
and i did
i
exercised in every way you can sports
i learned meditation when i was in high
school
i became a hypnotist
to use in part to use self-hypnosis
which is very effective in the same way
meditation is
uh and i've spent all of my adult life
studying every skill that could give me
any angle
on how to make my anxiety less
which is related to your entire health
right the whole thing is wrapped up in
your whole health
and so
do not short change yourself
if you want to know what your priorities
ought to be
and i say ought in terms of best
best outcome for all people
usually best outcome you know is usually
for one person
at other people's expense but here's the
best outcome for all people
take care of your anxiety first
which means taking care of your health
right i could have said take care of
your health first but your health isn't
like the concept is bothering you it's
your anxiety that's bothering you
make it your full-time job
to figure out anything you can do to
make that go down and do it without
drugs if you can the exception is weed
weed works for some people and it's just
a positive in my life it's just a
positive that doesn't mean it would be
for you
i think maybe one in five people could
say that for sure
at most
so you have to find your way like
there's no one thing that i'm going to
tell you that's going to work for you
you're going to find the system that
gets you outside
you've got to find the system that less
you eat right by the way that's my book
teaches you how to do that had it failed
every almost everything and still
still win big
but do not allow yourself to think it's
a uh is something happening inside your
head it is not
all right so that is your uh
lesson on happiness make it your
full-time job
now
um
how do you know when somebody's having
cognitive dissonance
and how do you know it isn't you
i've told you before so i'm going to add
something to the things i've said before
i've told you before the first way is
look for the trigger
all right because somebody needs to do
something that's
uh or be in a situation in which their
self-image is challenged or they've been
proven wrong in public
those are the those are the triggers
now suppose
suppose you're not sure who had the
trigger
maybe you think oh i think you had the
trigger
and then the person you're pointing at
says i'm not so sure i think you're the
one with the trigger
how could you further figure it out if
you if the trigger doesn't answer the
question
well i would say that one of the ways
and not 100
is to help you how people have prepared
for the trigger
how prepared were you to be wrong
because that'll really tell you
something and let me give you my example
one of the
reframes that i do
that i think keeps my mind healthier
is that
i find that being wrong even in public
is thrilling
how many of you could say
and honestly
that being wrong and uh and other people
seeing it would actually give you kind
of a charge
not many
right it's learned it's a learned
ability
i don't think you're born with that i
think that everybody has a natural
uh sense of shame and embarrassment and
i i had plenty of it i mean i had lots
of it
but i do think you can practice in a way
that there's a skill set
about that now in my case
i've also monetized being wrong
since what i talk about
what i talk about here is
cognitive illusions
if there were a really good cognitive
illusion and i got one seriously wrong
my business model would make me more
money
because if i do if i do a title of these
live streams
that says oh i got everything wrong or
here's here's how i have to apologize
for this my traffic goes up 30 percent
you've seen it
but if i tell you that i'm right about
everything and you got it wrong
what happens to my money
goes down 30 percent
you know my live stream traffic is
probably down 25 or so from its peak
for no other reason
than because i'm not telling you i'm
wrong so if you're going to follow the
money i guarantee you
that admitting i'm wrong is more
profitable for me
do you do you accept that
you can see it yourself right i mean you
could just check my numbers the republic
they're listed right there on you just
look and you see that when i when i'm
eating crow
people love to watch it so people like
to watch other people squirm
but
for me it would be a uh actually a sort
of an exciting learning experience
now keep in mind that one of my frames
of life
is that i'm
living in a simulation
and that reality is slowly you know
revealing itself to me so anytime
reality
feels like it comes from behind a
curtain and then reveals itself to me
and i find out how blind i was to
something
i kind of like it
i kind of like it
so
while nobody likes to be proven wrong
uh
i do have a business model that supports
it
and i can think of lots of examples
where i where i thought whoa
i was so wrong about that and
said it in public and i was fine
i also know that i survive it just fine
being wrong
how many times have you seen me be wrong
and here i am i'm still here
there's no difference
but i i have trained myself by being
wrong enough in public embarrassing
myself enough in public and finding out
that i wake up the next day and
breakfast tastes exactly the same i'm
like
well let me test this theory
i was a lot of people uh think i'm wrong
and uh they hate me right now
okay let me taste my coffee
same
that's the same
you think something's going to be
different because because you're
embarrassed or because somebody has a
lower opinion of you but it's really not
it's really not
things are just the same and once you
realize that that other people's
opinions
here's another reframe for you i'm
starting to work on a book on this topic
which is why i'm thinking about a lot
one of the reframes for you to avoid
criticism or the impact of criticism
is
to remember
that somebody else's opinion of you
is a chemical reaction happening in the
brain and the skull i like to say
inside the skull of a stranger
who's not even in the room
is it it's a microscopic chemical
attraction
or a chemical reaction
an electrical i guess happening in the
skull of somebody who's nowhere around
like i don't know where that is and even
if i were there
the chemical
little reaction would be so small
i couldn't even detect it
and that's the thing you're worrying
about
tomorrow your coffee will taste the same
when you're on your deathbed here's
another reframe
here's another reframe
every time something like that bothers
you and you know it's small ball
you're saying to yourself i know that
small man that bothers me oh god it's
small i get it but man that's bothering
me just think about your last breath
you're on your deathbed
are you going to be thinking about that
is that going to be in the top million
of things you're going to think about on
your last day on earth
nope
nope so don't worry about it now let it
go all right
so
those are your
reframes
for the day
i believe that we've solved or put into
motion a solution to
education the high cost of college
i believe that will also get rid of
systemic racism as it is mostly present
in the public schooling system and the
teachers unions supporting it
once we have everybody trained and no
longer trained to be racist we will have
the strongest
most powerful country that ever existed
i'll tell you what china doesn't see
coming
they don't see
talent stacks and systems over goals
something that has swept america and
made people who used to be
pretty good at doing things
into people who are great at doing
things
do you think that this reframing stuff
and the systems over goals doesn't work
i'm going to prove it to you
right now
in the comments
both locals on youtube
tell me how many of you
have recently
quit drinking
and go
i'm not going to say anything if you're
listening to this
i'm not going to say what's happening
right now
look at the comments
now youtube you're a little bit slower
but uh let me just say that the local
people
uh
are incredible
oh my god
i've never seen so many people say they
quit alcohol
here comes youtube
coming online
youtube
now let me ask you this
do you think that the representative
sample of other live streams would have
this many people who quit alcohol
recently
ask yourself do you think any other live
streams
for
would have this many people immediately
saying i quit alcohol
yeah this reframing stuff is powerful
when i told you that alcohol is poisoned
and i repeat it all the time
that's the reframe
if you think alcohol is a beverage
you're
let me be clear about that
if your idea of alcohol is that it's a
beverage you're
you're just
it's poisonous
now it is poison that feels really good
and i've greatly enjoyed the times that
i've used it
greatly enjoyed it had terrific times
but it's poisoned
let's not kid ourselves
so if you want to drink less
just think you're
taking poison
it's just you decided you won't take
that much of it so you think you'll
survive
but that little bit of a reframe it'll
work on you over time and over time you
will
you'll find that it's easier to quit if
you want to i'm not saying you should
not say you shouldn't you're free people
but
this is powerful stuff
and i will talk to you
tomorrow
