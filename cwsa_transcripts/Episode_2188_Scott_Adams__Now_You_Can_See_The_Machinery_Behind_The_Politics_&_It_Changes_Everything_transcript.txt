good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams
and it's exactly what you need right now
so if you'd like to take this experience
up the levels that you don't know and
think are possible all you need to do
is grab your cup or mug or glass a tank
of jealous of style and a canteen jug of
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamines of the day the
thing that makes everything better it's
called
the simultaneous Sip and it happens an
hour ago
that's what I like that's what I like
why
there's some good stuff
well I hear there's some news today
we'll be talking about that but while
you're streaming in to watch this
wonderful broadcast here's some
interesting things
uh there was a new survey that found out
that people think their jobs are
um I don't know if you knew that but
apparently those working in business and
finances sales were more than twice as
likely to say their jobs were socially
uh useless
they think they go to work and their job
has no no point whatsoever to the world
that is exactly what created the Dilbert
comic
it was my experience of going to work in
corporations
and seeing that there was nothing I ever
did that made a difference to anybody's
life
by the time I was done all of my work
would be diluted into you know just
nonsense just none of it affected
anybody and that's where the Dilbert
comic was born
it's always nice to know that there's
some scientific basis to that but I hope
those people change jobs
all right uh this is new Rasmussen poll
of course we're going to be talking
about
the Trump indictment and the Biden crime
family of course
and I'm going to cheer you up by the end
of this broadcast
you're going to start out feeling oh my
God my country has fallen apart
but it hasn't you're actually in pretty
good shape I'll tell you why and I'll
make you feel good by the end of this so
don't leave
but first Rasmussen has a poll about
trusted media
turns out Fox News is taking a hit uh Dr
Carlson was more credible than the
network itself so when they lost Tucker
Carlson their their credibility went
down a little bit
so only 23 percent of the likely U.S
voters trust Fox News the most
followed by MSNBC now remember this
isn't this isn't just conservatives this
is all voters so 23 for Fox News uh 15
percent of trust MSNBC the most CNN's
down to 14 and news max at 12 well 7 say
CNBC
um then oan and Newsmax are down below
that
now that's how much people trust the
news
it's going to sound like everything I
tell you today is bad news
but when you see it all together it's
going to reverse it's going to be the
weirdest thing it's going to be like an
optical illusion where you know from one
angle everything looks bad and you just
move a little bit and it changes what it
looks like
you just watch
all right so I've I've suggested
that a good TV show
would be a show in which people learn
the real news for the first time about
politics now I jokingly said it'd be
funny to see Democrats being exposed to
actually real news in context
for the first time
and what would it do don't you think
their heads would explode
would you watch that all day long I
would I would never get tired of that
watching people being explained or
having it explained to them what they've
missed on the news now to be fair
to be fair you could do it with
Republicans as well
to be fair
right there are things that Republicans
have a blind spot for and they just
don't say if you don't watch certain
kinds of media
but I think you would all agree with the
following assessment
Republican this is a this is a big
generality it doesn't apply to any
specific person but Republicans tend to
know what the argument is on the other
side
they disagree with it but they hear it
because that's the dominant news is the
other side at least there are more
outlets and maybe not dominant but there
are more Outlets recovering the other
news so they hear the other side and
then they hear what would what you might
call their side and then they make a
decision usually they side with their
side like everybody but at least they've
heard it
you know that I know it's a big
generalization but at least they've
heard the other side
it would be fascinating to see people
find out for the first time that they
never knew what the news was
that the news organizations are not real
and so I introduced to you my theme for
today's live stream
it appears
that we're starting to see the machinery
the machinery
this week
the hood was lifted
and you no longer just heard that there
was an engine under there you actually
got to see it
you actually got to see the engine
that hasn't happened before
everything about the Biden crime family
maybe it's all legal
I don't know it's entirely possible that
everything that they did is completely
legal
but you got to see the machinery
you got to see it
right
what about the Trump indictment
does the Trump indictment look like a
completely ordinary legal process
no no it's because it's a pattern
they've developed now that it's a
pattern that whenever there's bad news
for Biden there's a new indictment for
Trump
you could all see the pattern that's the
machinery
you know the entire Machinery of the
Biden crime family which again it might
not even be a crime I don't know
I mean you know maybe there's a fairer
violation or something maybe
but it's entirely possible the whole
thing is legal
it's possible
it's also entirely possible
that we're going to see in real detail
that the move the moves against Trump
are only political and they're not
really part of the the real justice
system as you know it
you can see it all now
you can see it all
and in the next few months you're going
to watch something that will be glorious
you're going to watch the internet dads
as I call them the sort of responsible
believable credible people on the
internet are just going to take the hood
off of this thing
you are going to learn how to drive a
stick shift from Dad
you know what I'm talking about right I
don't mean a specific dad but the dads
and again I don't mean they don't all
have to be male you know I would throw
Molly Hemingway in with the dads
and that's a compliment meaning that any
anybody who could just see the whole the
whole system
you know I'm talking about anybody who
can open the hood and tell you how to
change the oil right so if so if that's
men and women you know let's not be
sexist Miranda Devine Divine another
good example
but you're watching you're watching the
emergence of the people who know what's
happening
trying to explain it to you
and I'll we'll talk about that as we go
so there's something really really good
happening
that's disguised as something really
really bad happening
I don't think I've ever been quite this
optimistic about the country in several
years
I know it looks like it's the darkest
before the dawn situation doesn't it I
mean it looks like they're gonna lock
Trump up uh the country is lost right it
looks exactly like that
but here was the here was the thing that
you didn't see as excuse me it might be
because
the Democrats didn't see it
I believe the Democrats had a blind spot
and you know how you know Republicans
can't quite fully understand what it's
like to be a Democrat
and I think for example the Republicans
didn't fully understand
how Democrats would react to Trump I
think that was a little bit of a blind
spot
but likewise I would say that the
Democrats have gotten away with so much
right in front of you
that they didn't know what too far
looked like
they just found out
the the latest round of trump
indictments
are not the regular game
you're you're off you're now off the
playing field you're actually standing
with the uh The Spectators now
if you get off the playing field
and you start hanging out with the
spectators The Spectator is now part of
the game
right you just brought the country in we
used to be watching but now we're
playing
now we're playing
the game just started
is a new game
the new game is
we're involved now
The public's involved
that's a whole new game because we're
going to start paying attention
and you're going to get it explained to
you by the internet dads in a way that
the media never allowed before
because before you just saw the news as
it was packaged and presented to you but
now there's an entire industry of people
telling you what a they're
bringing
and the industry of telling people
telling you how they're lying to you is
now as strong
as the media itself
and that wasn't here before
before the media could overwhelm any
voice that was a Critic now the critics
are as strong as the voices
and you're going to see them Rising you
see it already
you're seeing the rise of people who are
done
and people who will risk anything
to fix it that's new
people will go the people are going to
go to the they're going to go to the mad
on this one
so this is serious business but when
serious business happens
dad comes home
and dad is very much coming home and I
don't mean Trump although you know it
could be Trump
but dad's coming home
one way or another dad's coming home
there's nothing will stop it now
let's talk about what's that what else
has happened
so I would love to see that TV show
where
um essentially it would almost be a
campaign ad but it would be a TV show
now it could be a live stream show with
a regular time but wouldn't you love I
mean honestly wouldn't you love ordinary
voters brought in and just say just want
you to listen to some context that
you've never heard before
do you know how our reaction videos are
big on the internet now on YouTube
you'll see for example
um a popular form of it is a let's say a
young black man maybe with a friend
who's listening to some 70s classic
music that's you know outrageously good
and you hear some a young person
listening to a genre of music they're
not familiar with
and you know they're hearing it for the
first time and you just see their eyes
like oh my God are you telling me that
you know my grandfather had amazing
music you know like they're learning it
for the first time are you kidding
they're Led Zeppelin who are they
just imagine
you imagine you're
you're 19 or something and you've never
heard Led Zeppelin and somebody said hey
put on the headphones see what you think
and you just hear it for the first time
that would be that would be like
watching a voter just an ordinary
citizen being told the actual news the
real news in context
for the first time
can you imagine what their face would
look like
[Laughter]
it would be amazing and then then I
would finish it off look let's say just
for fun that is a Democrat who's the the
subject you can again you can do it with
a Republican but let's say you're doing
with the Democrat
and at the end of the episode you've
completely changed their understanding
of the news but then the last minute of
the show there's a there's a little cap
off and the cap off would be that prior
to the beginning of the show they had to
give a DNA sample
you see where I'm going
and at the end of the show The Host
tells them that they're related they're
descendants of slave owners
come up come on it's the best show
you've ever seen in your life tell me
you wouldn't watch that show
come on that would be the best show you
ever saw in your life the last minute of
the show oh and Bob we have a little
little extra news for you uh while we
were doing doing the show we did a
little research we found out that your
great great grandfather his name was a
rooster cornmire and he owned uh
three under slaves
thanks for coming I'm glad that you were
part of our show tune in tomorrow would
that be the best show
come on
you you would talk about that all week
and is there to be made
how easy would it be to make that show
it'd be an easy one
the timing of the DNA thing might be
hard but
all right
so maybe we see something like that
um that would be a case of entertainment
solving
for
the news all right
um and let me give you an example of how
bad things are
I tweeted this I think two days ago so
that so listen to the tweet and then I'm
going to tell you how many views it got
which is a measure of its popularity
um so I tweeted this my condolences to
the half of the country that doesn't
know the biggest Story American politics
by far broke today that was the the
Biden Orchard Devin or Devon Archer
stuff uh the biggest story in American
politics by far broke today which was
the other day uh this is what they
prepped you for
it worked when I say prepped you for I
mean the news has been getting you ready
for uh something and so the biggest news
in
I would say in my entire lifetime of
politics is by far the biggest news the
Biden crime family being you know
completely exposed in terms of the
machinery
we'll talk about that Jonathan Turley
has a has a good take on that
um
but how many people do you think uh
viewed that which would be a uh
which would be a proxy for how many
times it was retweeted now I've got a
million
followers on Twitter
a really solid tweet if I really like I
had a nerve I can get
um you know 50 000 people to view it
which is a lot if I really hit it out of
the park
and it's happened a few I can get a
million people to view a tweet a million
people
how many do you think viewed this one so
far
I think it's pushing 10 or 11 million
10 mil I was saying it's around 10
million now 10 million people agreed
with the fact that it was the biggest
news in the country in the half of the
country wouldn't even see it
wouldn't even know what happened
10 million oh it's up to 11.5 something
is 11.5 million people agreed with that
now that's that's an indication of
something that they don't agree with
just with their brain
do you understand that most of my tweets
if I get you know 20 50 000 people agree
with it or or even see it then I would
say oh that intellectually
like on an intellectual level I said
okay one plus one is two yeah I agree
with that one plus one is two
that's not this
that this is something that people are
feeling
in every part of their body this is this
goes down to the particle level
they feel that they that the biggest
thing in the country happened and that
the the bad guys
are actually so good at hiding the news
that they're going to hide it from half
of the country and work it works and
we're watching it run for living now
remember the theme
the theme is watching the you know
opening the hood
and actually seeing the machinery
that's 11.5 million people who saw the
machinery
they can they can see that we've
developed a news business whose job it
is to prevent half of the country from
seeing the news
that's not a joke
the news industry the the biggest part
of it
their their purpose now is to prevent
you from seeing the news
and you know that now
you maybe didn't know that before
but the hood just lifted
dad is standing next to you and dad is
showing you where the oil goes
we don't have a news business we have a
news concealment business I'm not sure
if it was always that way but we were
not looking under the hood before before
I could hear the engine and I could get
my car and I could drive so I was pretty
sure there was an engine in there
but this is different this is new
this is Dad standing next to you and
lifting the hood and pointing to where
the oil goes
and he just pointed and told you the
news business is the opposite of what
you thought it was
you thought it was to give you news
it may have been at one point but it's
definitely not that now and you can see
it in a way that your own observation
confirms it you don't have to listen to
me explain it to you you don't need to
read an article
you just have to look up lift the hood
and have somebody point to it and that
just happened I just lifted the hood and
pointed to it and you saw it
it won't be the only Machinery you see
today
this is going deeper
come with me
down the rabbit hole
all right
um there is a lot of good news disguised
as bad news and I would say the way to
explain this is that because the
Democrats didn't understand
and can't understand really the the
opposite side of the political world
just as they don't understand Democrats
fully right people don't understand
themselves the problem is that the left
didn't know where the line was
what is too far
because you know when things go too far
all the rules change
you get that right if we're in a normal
game
we're going to play normal rules you
might try cheating a little bit but
somebody will catch you get you back on
there mostly the rules
but once you go beyond the game and
you've you've gone beyond the rules of
the game and you're trying to put let's
say for example
trying to jail your political opponent
for free speech
well let's just use that as an example
that would be too far
once you reach the too far stage all the
rules change
and nobody knows what happens next
except me and I'm going to tell you
because it's pretty clear at this point
that the future is becoming very clear
and I I can't even imagine it would be
different than what we can see at this
point and I'll tell you as we go
yeah but we have clearly got let me let
me test your uh your feelings answer
this from your feelings not from your
brain turn your brain off for a moment
do you feel that the latest indictments
against Trump
are too far
how many would say that that's too far
right yeah now I felt a little bit like
that when you know in Prior prior
indictments Etc I thought that went too
far with the uh fake impeachments and
stuff but this does feel different this
feels let me tell you why it feels
different
the current polling the current polling
for Trump shows he has a dominant really
probably insurmountable lead in the
primary correct so far
likewise this week we also saw the Biden
crime family completely exposed and
while I don't think that means anybody's
going to jail because it just doesn't
work that way
can you imagine
getting into the general election with
Trump having that in his toolbox you
wouldn't have to talk about anything
else he would just describe the Biden
crime family thing until you couldn't
think about anything else
in my opinion
Biden has no chance of re-election and
for all practical purposes he's off the
field
he's off the field
you know what's more interesting
so is DeSantis DeSantis was taken off
the field by this week and the reason is
that as soon as this news came out of
this new uh
this new set of indictments
Vivek ramaswamy and I'm not positive of
this I can use a fact check of this I
think he did it just give me this is
this is my impression so I'll take a
fact check on this it looked to me
like he turned on a camera
stood in front of it and for 10 minutes
spoke perfectly
about how he would pardon he would
pardon Trump for this and other things
and that is purely political and that uh
you know this is too far this is the end
now when you see somebody who can just
turn on a camera and give you 10 minutes
of the best
perfectly engineered and composed speech
that's right on target it hits the
moment perfectly and here's the best
part
he's been nailing his campaign
for a week after how many months has he
been campaigning do you remember the
mistakes he's made none none do you
remember the awesome things he's done
during that time a whole bunch of things
going on CNN he's fought against the
enemies he's he's ripping up the
podcasting world even Trump is Trump is
running against him and even Trump had
to say yeah he's doing a great job right
the vague is killing it but here's the
other thing he killed DeSantis
because he created a moment of contrast
like you've never seen so far
and here's the way I would put it
if Trump if Trump goes down for this or
he's taken off the field
the Republicans are not going to be
looking for a memo
they're going to be looking for a sword
the VAC is a sword
he's a sort
DeSantis also responded with a text
message that looked like a corporate
memo
nobody wants the corporate memo you want
the sword Vivek said he'll bring the
sword he's not just gonna
free the people who are being as many of
us believe unfairly targeted January 6
people as well as Trump he's not only
going to protect them he's going to take
a sword and pull up from the roots
every corrupt entity in the United
States from the you know um was it the
education department or whatever it is
to Department of Justice FBI
and
that takes DeSantis right out of the
game
do you agree
let me just check your uh temperature
Biden is off the field and so is
DeSantis and that happened yesterday
that happened yesterday do you think
anybody noticed
the news will report it do you know why
the news won't report it
because the news is not in the business
of telling you what's true or useful
they're in the business of concealing
the news from you so they're not going
to tell you that yesterday both Biden
and DeSantis became unviable candidates
there are two in the race right now
maybe there'll be a Newsome I mean if
Newsom comes in he'll be you'll be a
competitor
but right now it's down to Trump and
Vivek
because there isn't any way the
Republicans are going to lose this one
they're not going to let it happen
because this one is personal
this is not politics anymore
if they take Trump out they're taking
his voters out
and they're not ready for that
they might be ready to lose a political
campaign
yeah that's America sometimes you win
sometimes you lose but they're not ready
to be targeted to themselves and when
they look at the January six people they
say
oh that could have been me
how many of you have said to yourself
you know
I I wasn't inclined to go to that
January 6 but I easily could have been
there and I easily could have been
walking through the Rotunda and I easily
could be in jail right now
for expressing my political preferences
in the physical form
yeah you feel this like it's you that's
not the same
that is not politics when you feel it
like it's you
you act like it's you
you're gonna show up
you might get a hundred percent voting
from Republicans this year
what's it normally 60 well what would be
a normal uh like a good year 65 percent
of registered Vote or adults may be
voting
was that about it you might see
something like you've never seen before
oh it's even lower it's like 55 you
might see something you've never seen
I'll even go further
that Trump could possibly win the black
vote
now that sounds stupid doesn't it like
that's too far
I'd like you all to disagree with me
really solidly before I give you my
argument everybody disagree please
please disagree it's not possible he's
Republican he's been branded to races
blah blah blah not possible all right
here's the argument
suppose Trump says
the justice system is broken
it's broken for you black America and
it's broken even for me
I'll fix it for both of you
here's what I'm going to do for you
and here's what I'm going to do for
everybody else
you're right you know I gotta I gotta
admit I really didn't think the justice
system was as broken as I've been
hearing for years but Black America let
me tell you this
I commit to fixing this
I don't believe this system could be
working for you if it's not working for
me there's no way it's working for you
let's figure out what's wrong let's take
it out by the roots and let's fix this
now that might all be right
because what exactly are you going to do
you know you need some details but
he could actually sell this as having a
common enemy
he could do a common enemy
and you can sell it do you know who else
do you know who else could sell that
message
give me who else could sell that message
well you know if they could if you
imagine he's a vice president he could
sell anything but only Trump trump is
the only politician now nope nope nope
nope Trump is the only one in the world
Trump is the only one in the world who
could sell that message that he is on
the same side with the young black men
in the streets who have a problem with
law enforcement he can sell it
there's nobody else who can sell it RFK
nope RFK couldn't sell it Vivek I doubt
it
I mean he's great but I don't think he
saw only Trump could sell that
you would need the greatest salesperson
in the history of America
but you have it
that would be Trump
all right
let's give you a
Biden crime family update this is the
Jonathan Turley quote
all right so this is from a tweet
Jonathan Turley which if you're not
following Jonathan Turley as you're
trying to navigate through
these new stories you're really missing
a lot
I think the people you need to be
following are Mike cernovich is required
that's just required you got to follow
sirovich when stuff like this happens
follow sirovich all right you gotta you
gotta have your
um your Jonathan turlease you know
dershowitz might be on vacation but when
he's back
follow him watch your uh Elon Musk your
David sacks you know I could name 10
more but you know to watch well you're
Molly Hemingway is your Miranda divides
they're the ones you gotta follow you've
got to follow them if you want to know
what's going on
all right so Jonathan Turley says in DC
influence peddling is an art form and
the bidens are its Rembrandts demands
are conveyed through as few people as
possible that is how it is done not on
the speakerphone in the middle of Cafe
Milano while ordering more breadsticks
Jonathan Turley is an internet dad
right he's not just an attorney who's
got some points of view that are fun to
watch he's dead he actually just opened
the hood and pointed to where the oil
goes right he described to you the
actual machinery
of how people can be in a possibly a
completely legal form
doing things you wish they weren't doing
you can see the machinery
Elon Musk
tweeting about this is a sort of a
related topic I guess there's some kind
of uh
anti-haze speech bill
does that is Congress doing something
like that some kind of anti-haze speech
anyway musk was tweeting about it and he
said this you can tell it's propaganda
when they choose terms that are
impossible to invert
who is pro-hate speech
right so if they do an anti-hay speech
Bill and you're on the other side they
they turn you into the pro-hate speech
he says that's that's the tell for
propaganda
um
and then he says their actual goals have
nothing to do with hate speech and
everything to do with censorship of
public dialogue
that's an internet dad
who's lifting up the hood
and pointing to where the oil goes he's
telling you the machinery
the Machinery is when they use this term
a non-reversible term
you are not having a political
conversation somebody's trying to screw
you
and your dad just told you to watch out
for that
again dads don't have to be women in
this context
all right
um
here's what's different and I'm not sure
if I said this or I started to say it
earlier
now that Trump is the presumptive
nominee
he's also not running against anybody
because Biden can't possibly be a
candidate well he's not he's not a
viable candidate in the sense that he
couldn't win at this point against trump
it wouldn't be close now I polls polls
polls don't tell me the polls
I don't want to hear about the polls you
have not seen Trump
take his big old pit bull jaw and
uh
the true thing about it I mean
bite on it yet
at the moment Houston
because the whole you know half of the
country can ignore him and anything they
want but once he's on the stage imagine
him on a debate stage with Biden just
put hold that in your head if you're
wondering if Biden is still viable
Just Close Your Eyes for a minute
imagine it's every month in the future
and let's imagine it's just Trump and
just Biden on the stage
and and that's after we know everything
about the button you know the so-called
Biden crime family and Hunter Biden just
imagine it
who wins
Biden would up be up there mumbling or
maybe they'd juice them up with some
Adderall or whatever the hell they're
giving him yeah you know maybe he would
be coherent for a little while
but there's no way Trump loses that
debate
he's going to destroy he's going to
destroy the whole Biden family
and let me let me be clear I don't think
Trump is going to just take out Joe
Biden I I I may think the whole Biden
situation is going to look pretty bad
now because Trump is the dominant
candidate on the Republican side and
also because he's basically running
almost unopposed
in my mind and I would imagine some of
you are starting to think the same way
it's no longer about trying to stop a
candidate from getting getting a little
foothold in a race
if they had done these indictments much
earlier
when when people are still talking about
who's going to run besides Trump and you
know you're just forming your opinions
if they'd gotten them early
and they had succeeded that might have
been a good play
but they waited too long
by waiting until after the Biden crime
family stuff comes out the art the Devon
Archer testimony by waiting that long
they guaranteed that Trump was no longer
one of the people running for president
but rather in your mind he's already the
president the next president meaning
that it's hard for me to imagine any
outcome except that unless they stop him
with a legal trick
so now it doesn't feel like they're just
trying to stymie some candidate one of
many now it feels like they're coming
for the king
doesn't it
now now they're coming from the King if
you come from the King
you better finish him off
because he's going to be really angry
he's going to be really really angry and
I don't know what he does it is normal
you know it is normal world I mean that
could be
pretty uh interesting to watch on its
own but if you actually try to put him
in jail
and you come close and by the way one of
the charges has a potential death
penalty did you know that
one of the charges has a potential death
penalty so one of the new charges about
January 6 if you add on top of it the
people died because of his actions you
could make the argument that people did
die and therefore is because of his
actions Ashley Babbitt Etc if you made
that argument you could actually put him
in Jeopardy of the death penalty
for free speech
for free speech
the death penalty
just think about that
the death penalty Mary Lou I just told
you Ashley Babbitt died that's all it
requires it doesn't require that the
deaths be police officers and it doesn't
require that they die the same day
you're right if if somebody died and you
can just make the argument
because of it that might be enough
right now Joel Pollock pointed this out
in Breitbart
that the death penalty is on the table
now imagine you're Trump
and you're the presumptive next
president at this point I call him the
presumptive next president I still yeah
I'm still backing Vivek but uh you know
I also can't ignore the polls
if they come for the presumptive
president with
and it includes a potential for the
death penalty
I don't think they realize how much too
far it looks like
that's so far beyond too far
that you can barely hold it in your head
it's almost makes your head explode it's
way too far and it changes everything
all right
um so here I'm no lawyer so I'll give
you just a basic idea what he's being
indicted for the latest ones the the
topic is the January 6th stuff so
um here in the Elon Musk way let me
explain the following New York Times
says that Trump is being indicted for
trying to overturn the 2020 election
overturn the election
Wall Street Journal reporting on the
same story
says that he's being indicted for his
attempts to reverse reverse the election
which one is propaganda and which one is
news
overturn or reverse
do they sound like synonyms
you're the way you feel about them just
the same just two words that mean about
the same overturn reverse both the same
right no overturn
you you tell me if I'm wrong you hear
overturn and you think that the person
who's trying to overturn it is the bad
guy am I right the overturner is the bad
person you just assume it it's just
baked into the word now let's say that
somebody was trying to reverse something
if you're somebody who's trying to
reverse something are you the bad guy or
the good guy
you might be the good guy
it's unstated
so if you say that he tried to reverse
it you've reported the news and I'd like
to give Wall Street Journal a little
ovation
little elevation for the Wall Street
Journal The Wall Street Journal reported
the news
that's the news he tried to reverse
reverse an outcome
overturn is propaganda
right so I'm doing what Elon Musk did
for you which is uh Elon Musk showed you
the machine right
and now I'm showing you the Machinery as
well
overturned is not a news organization
word that's somebody who's trying to
conceal from you the news
they're trying to conceal from you that
he ever had an argument or a point
reverse doesn't tell you anything except
somebody had an intention of things
going a different way
very different
so so look for the choice of words in
the headlines and you can tell who's
telling you the news or even trying to
tell you the news and who's
trying to conceal the news from you very
clear very clear and I would say that
the whole uh the the news as we're
learning it is also revealing the
networks of bad people the Bad actors
because as you watch the indictments and
also the defense of the Biden crime
family given that you know for sure
that the Biden crime family stuff is
real
there's nobody who doubts that right
again we don't know what's illegal don't
know what's illegal I don't even have an
opinion on it but you can see the
Machinery the Machinery is now
completely clear
so
if you're looking at that
well you're you're certainly a lot
better shape than you were in
understanding what's going on all right
so
um I would say that Trump expressed free
speech and they're trying to
assassinate them with illegal means to
me this looks like an assassination
yeah I think sort of it said the same
thing
do you do you get the sense this doesn't
feel like a legal action and it doesn't
feel like a political action with the
death penalty on the table it feels like
an assassination attempt
now I don't think they expect the death
penalty but they know what they're doing
and they would certainly be aware of all
the ramifications at least the legal
people would
all right
um so the things that Trump did was he
followed a lawyers advice even though
the lawyers were giving him a long shot
advice well you've got a shot at this uh
also as by the way you should be
following uh Joel Pollock
um I think he has actually the best
takes on this topic so far I should have
mentioned him in the first list because
uh Joel has a legal background as well
as you know a writer background so he's
very quickly producing the the takes
that you haven't heard from anybody else
yet so if you want to be like a day
ahead of the probably a full day ahead
of the news process follow Joel
um
so let's see
um we got the death penalty on there for
free speech and following his lawyer's
advice
you think would have happened
in the uh let's say just play this
through
let's say that Trump had prevailed and
some uh alternative uh you know electors
had been picked and they they came out
with a decision that Trump was the real
president
but other people said no there's
something wrong with that process really
Biden's a real president what happens
next in our system what happens next it
goes to the Supreme Court right
am I wrong about that doesn't the
Supreme Court say all right let's take a
look at it and then the Supreme Court
would decide what's legal and what's not
legal and then we would regroup we would
regroup under that understanding and
then there would be decision which
probably would have picked who the
president was would that be a civil war
why would you have a civil war you have
the Supreme Court
for exactly that
that's maybe an appellate court first
but
we have a system that sorts out exactly
that's that sort of thing
why did we let the system do it
why didn't we have to uh why do we have
to arrest somebody
or arrest lots of people I guess why do
we have to arrest people or indict them
for something that's normal business
that the Supreme Court works out in the
normal course of things
people disagreeing on what is the legal
process is just normal business
the fact that happened to be Trump and
it happened to be a presidential
election does not take it from a normal
amount of business to some crime
it's not a crime to do something that is
gray area enough that you need a Supreme
Court to tell you what was true and what
wasn't
all right
but basically following a lawyer's
advice it was probably bad advice
but if you follow a lawyer's advice
typically that's enough to make it seem
like you're not the criminal you know
that worst you took some bad advice
usually
and the Free Speech argument to me
that's a slam dunk
right if you can put him in jail or
possibly execute Trump
for saying what he thinks is true which
is that he believed that the election
was uh you know rigged
we're in bad shape now
um have you seen anybody in the news
refer to the latest indictments at least
the Free Speech part where they say that
the claim is that that Trump knew his
claims about the election were a lie
how would they know that how does the
how does the legal system prove
what Trump thinks in his private
thoughts
can they do that I suppose if there were
you know a body of evidence where he
talked about it with different people
sure but is there anything like that is
there any body of evidence where he
where he said you know I I don't believe
anything I'm saying but I'm going to say
it anyway no no
there is one documented thing where
there was a specific claim about
election irregularity among a sea of
different claims there was one specific
one that he he reportedly didn't think
was likely to be true
but he didn't know he just thought you
know maybe it's true maybe it's not but
that doesn't mean he didn't think the
whole system was rigged in some way
now how many of you remember
um I guess it was a few years ago when I
introduced the idea that when somebody
is trying to mind read in other words
imagine what somebody else was thinking
that that's never valid
how many of you remember hearing from
the first time from me
this thing called mind reading in
politics and you never really noticed it
before did you it's like before you
didn't notice they were doing it
but somehow it seemed valid it just
seemed like what people do but as soon
as I told you people can't read minds
so if your entire argument depends on
knowing what somebody's thinking and
worse and worse not only do you imagine
you know what they're thinking but you
imagine what they're thinking is an
absurdity
and then you blame them for it
right
do you think that Trump would have tried
to reverse the election if he genuinely
believed the outcome was valid
do you think you would
how how the hell with any of us now
we don't know
I doubt it and to me that seems very
unlikely but I know that whether whether
I believed he would or believed he
wouldn't I wouldn't want him to go to
jail
for what I imagined literally imagine
is in a stranger's head well he's not a
stranger but in somebody else's head
we don't have a country where you should
go to jail because strangers imagined
what you were thinking no that's not
good enough strangers cannot imagine
what you're thinking and send you to
jail
but that's
what it looked like and now we have this
situation where Trump is literally
being at risk of being
well really at risk of being executed
he's at risk of being executed because
Democrats are trying to tell you they
can read his thoughts
is that an exaggeration on my part
did I just exaggerate I'm going to say
it again you tell me if this is
hyperbole or exaggeration
there is a risk of execution in in the
charges yes or no
there's a risk of execution yes
and they're telling you that the main
thing you would have to believe the main
thing the most important part to believe
that he should be put in jail or
executed the most important part is what
he was thinking his intentions and
there's no documentation
and there are no eyewitnesses
to suggest that he thought the election
was fair but decided he would lie about
it none
you have to completely believe that you
can read his thoughts
for this to be wrong
you have to believe that
now
before I told you that mind reading
wasn't a thing and yet it's a widespread
phenomenon
you didn't have a framework
for which this new thing could easily be
mapped onto the moment the moment people
saw these charges
people said that's mind reading
in other words I created a mental frame
that was available for you that the
moment this happened you said Ah that's
one of those
and as soon as you could put it on that
frame that mind reading frame then
suddenly everything made sense to you
didn't it
in other words
I lifted up the hood
I pointed to the engine and I showed you
where the oil goes in
I'm showing you the machinery
the Machinery is one side pretends they
can mind read and hope she don't notice
that's the Machinery that's that's the
bad bad acting that's the way that's the
way it's done
so musk is telling you have a spot
propaganda
Turley is telling you have a spot uh
this you know crime family activity
um I'm telling you how to spot mind
reading do you see the pattern
the internet dads
are not going to let this happen
we're not going to let it happen
so while you think the worst case
scenario looks like it's about to happen
it does look like the worst case
scenario the thing you're missing is
that they went too far
too far changes all the rules
too far activates the dads and when the
dads enter you don't know what that's
going to do yet
the dads are now strong enough
to move the needle
and they are you what you're watching it
happen so watch watch for this pattern
as you see it as you watch the the news
coverage you'll see some pundits who are
just foolish idiots right
Republican and Democrats you're going to
see the pundits who are just like you
know talking point I'm not talking about
any of the talking point of people
they're not the dads they're just clowns
they're just clowns ignore the clowns
who just are oh my side my side just a
clown
look at the people who clearly know how
to take a different position if it's
warranted those are the only ones you
should listen to this is why your your
Mike cernovich's are worth gold
because you know he could take he'll
take the position that's unpopular and
he does
when he thinks the facts go that way
that's why you listen to him
because you know he's not going to be
just in the bag for somebody
right same with Turley same with musk
they're not in the bag for anybody
they're just trying to show you the
engine they're just pulling up the hood
they're just showing you where the oil
goes that's it you get you get to do
what you want you can put your oil in
your car or not put your oil in your car
but you know where it goes now
you know where it goes now they're
showing you
all right
um
so uh also Joel uh Pollock points out
that there might be a weird Double
Jeopardy thing happening with Trump
so Trump was impeached for I'm not going
to do a good job of explaining this as
well refer you to Breitbart and look for
Joel's article or you could see the
retweet in my Twitter feed
um
the argument is that our system doesn't
allow does not allow double jeopardy
so if there have been a federal case
against Trump for the same crimes
you wouldn't be able to charge them a
second time no matter if he had been you
know innocent or not found guilty the
first time so our system doesn't allow
you does not allow you to be tried twice
for the same
federal crime anyway if there was a
federal and a State Crime then then that
would still be allowed
but as Joel points out
the uh and here here's where I'm not
going to do as good idea a good job of
explaining it so I'll just give you the
idiots non-lawy review that the
impeachment
is a process is similar enough I hope
I'm close on this uh is it is a process
similar enough to a legal process that
you might need the Supreme Court to tell
you if there were two trials
which is pretty interesting it's
entirely possible that double jeopardy
would be the reason these get thrown out
it's like we we've we've already shown
the evidence we've done it in you know
there's a there were uh there were risks
of the outcomes
um very similar not the same but in some
ways similar standard of collecting
information and showing it to everybody
now of course it's not as rigorous as a
regular Court situation which would be
far more fair and better
but it might be close enough that let's
say a supreme court would look at it and
say you know you just can't do this to
some the same person over and over
and I would have some sympathy for that
in fact I think I would have some
sympathy for that if happened to Biden
or anybody else
because there's a reason that double
jeopardy
is such an important part of our system
the reason is that bad people can abuse
the ability to just you know keep keep
trying somebody over and over and it
wouldn't it wouldn't be fair by
anybody's sense of fairness
so
this will be really interesting
um we'll see we'll see
well in uh
let's see uh
in other news
um study came out that said that big
companies they have high ESG scores in
other words they're the ones who are
good on environmental social and
governance issues
diversity especially but in terms of the
environmental part the companies with
high ESG scores pollute about the same
as everybody else
in other words
ESG
is complete
that's right
lift up the hood
point to the engine
show you where the oil goes in
ESG was never real
ESG was always
It could only be it never had
the possibility of being anything but
 it was always a power play
it was always about somebody thought
they could collect Power by you know
being the champion of ESG some people
thought they could get jobs because what
would be easier than being the manager
of ESG I mean really yeah it's barely a
real job harking back to the first thing
I read to you about people realizing
that their their jobs don't have real
meaning
just think about that there are a whole
bunch of people who think that their job
the thing they do every day for money
doesn't have any good purpose in the
world
how would you like to be the head of the
ESG process in your company
you feel good about that
do you go home every day and say well I
killed it today
no because if you're the head of the ESG
Department do you know what your real
job is
to conceal what your company is doing
just like the news
the ESG is not about making your company
better at ESG it's about figuring out
how they can look better
have you ever worked for a corporation
no Corporation cares as much about doing
right as looking right because if they
can look right they're kind of done with
that problem right then they can go make
some money
so they need to look right they don't
need to be right and anybody who had
even a little bit of corporate
experience knew that the minute ESG
became this exterior let's say from the
outside
thing that was layered onto companies
and as long as they were required to do
it
you knew it was going to be why
because a hundred percent of things that
have that quality something from the
outside that's supposed
people in corporations to act like
criminals
because they didn't ask for it they
don't like it they probably don't think
it's a good idea in that situation you
just try to make it look like you were
pretending to play along
it's just about playing along it never
had a real benefit or even a potential
for one and it was clear that people
would try to monetize it you know
BlackRock would try to make it their
brand and it was also clear that it
would fail on its own merits of course
it would because then this study is the
beginning of what you'll see I believe
somebody said that Philip Morris had a
better ESG score than Tesla
I don't know if that's true but it's
within the family of things that are
true meaning that if Tesla has a bad ESG
score
you know what's like what are you gonna
do
I mean that that does show that the
system is not designed to do what they
say it's designed to do it's a bunch of
people chasing money
Jason power and not understanding how
anything in the real world works you
cannot
impose ESG or anything like it on a real
company and expect to get a good outcome
that's not a thing you can do it
it's not about how well they implemented
it it's not about their good intentions
it just can't be done and I could they
could have asked me
as I said in the beginning hey creator
of the Dilbert comic strip
I think what happened if we took three
unrelated things and put them together
environment
social things and diversity well what
would what what do you think is the
likely outcome of putting environment
and diversity into the same package and
then putting somebody in charge of it
and then saying that the the companies
have to do it or else what do you think
hey Dilbert guy give me a prediction
well what I would predict is it would go
exactly the way it is
that you would wait a little while and
everybody would bow to it oh yes G
because Corporation is want to first
play along oh play alone oh I love your
ESG I'm so ESG I'm way more ass to you
than you are and then eventually as it
becomes more and more ridiculous and
absurd as as the
as the internet dads start to talk about
it and the dads say you know that ESG
isn't bothering me much but it's it's
but then it starts bothering you
then it starts affecting your portfolio
then you see it's distorting the whole
country
and then you see that your son can't get
a job at that Corporation huh didn't see
that coming did you
and now it's real
as soon as ESG mattered and it wasn't
just that people talked about
as long as it was just people
talked about everybody's in favor of it
oh I love that can you give me
another bowl of ah ah I love it
in fact I love it more than you do
you're probably a racist yeah why do you
hate the country why do you hate the
world ah I I like good environments and
and diversity and Equity
eat that
But as time goes by
you have to live the
you've got to live it
somebody doesn't get a job
company can't do something that makes
sense
Tesla gets a lower grade than Philip
Morris
and you realize how much money and time
and energy are we spending on
and then the internet dads come in and
say you know what how would you like
your son to be able to get a job or your
daughter based on their qualifications
how about that
and people go
uh that's not bad
or how about we
you know we do as good as we can on the
environment but we don't act as if we
can compare two companies on their
environmental record because you know
unless one is disgusting
you really can't
pick two companies and tell me which
one's better for the environment I don't
know
do you think anybody can measure that
because they'd have to measure your
entire supply chain just just think
about this from a data perspective
you're trying to figure out what company
is better on ESG so you look at how much
they pollute right obvious how much CO2
they're giving out you know are they
putting anything in the water so that's
good so far but what about other
suppliers
uh what about the suppliers suppose the
company isn't doing any big polluting
but they can't make their product
without getting materials from the
biggest polluters in the world
how do you measure it
do you say to yourself well that's
really the other companies so we'll give
them an ESG score
but you know that that's different than
this company who's not doing any real
polluting is it is that different if the
only reason that product is made in
China and they're you know dumping crap
into their own water supply if the only
reason China made that product is to put
it as a component of yours why isn't
that your problem
so the point is ESG
could never be measured
from the start
from the start
it couldn't be measured
anybody disagree
I I did you know my job in corporations
was mostly trying to figure out what was
real
by looking at the data and what I
discovered is the data never tells you
what's real
you end up making an assumption about
what data you think is valid and it's
the assumption
that drives the decisions it's not the
data
first you assume a bunch of stuff and
then you gather data that falls under
the umbrella of your assumptions and
then your assumptions plus the data
which of course just supports the
assumptions is given to management and
management says oh it looks like you did
an analysis because you've got some
assumptions you need those you've got
some data
you did some analysis you wrote it up I
guess that's an analysis so sign off
approved
but your assumptions are what drove the
decision not the data so did you ever
think that ESG is something you can
measure and then compare to another
company how many of you thought that was
ever a thing admit it how many of you
thought that ESG the environmental part
could be measured
even even in a real General sense so you
could tell which company was better than
another company
now nobody with actual experience in the
world
believes that you could quantify or
measure that stuff nobody nobody who's
done that kind of work nobody who's been
involved in data nobody who's been
involved in economics nobody with any
business experience whatsoever believe
that you could measure that stuff
and if you can't measure it accurately
in a way that everybody agrees what do
you do instead
what's your fallback
your big Corporation it's your job you
got to get paid you got to do a thing
they told you to do a thing you got to
do the thing but it can't be done
so what so what do you do when you're
paid to do a thing that can't be done
it's always the same you don't you do
not quit your job and protest
do you no that's what you should do like
if you're a real honorable person okay I
am the director of ESG and honestly I
thought this would be a good job but the
more I look into it I can see that it's
based on data and none of the data could
be reliable because you can't really
collect data on that sort of thing and
compare it so therefore I resign
because this is a stupid and
unproductive process I would like to
attender my resignation
zero people have done that
well maybe somebody has
but you know only if they had another
job lined up you know real people don't
do that do you know what they do
they lie
because you're paying them to lie
you're paying the ESG director to lie to
you because he doesn't or she doesn't or
they don't
have a choice
why do all the ESG directors have to lie
to you a data there isn't another
alternative
they'll have there's no second path
they only have unreliable data so
they're going to dress it up and you
know slap some paint on the pig and show
you
ESG has always been absurd and
ridiculous
but it had but it had to run its course
before the internet dads got interested
and did what I'm doing for you right now
there isn't a single person who's going
to leave this live stream with the idea
that ESG was a good idea not one and all
it took was and how hard was it to
convince you
if you were a little on the fence or
wasn't really you weren't really
thinking about it one way or another
which would be most of you most of you
are not putting any real thought into
ESG but after this thing
how hard was it to convince you simply
by lifting the lid
pointing to the engine and showing you
where the oil went in
every one of you said yeah you're right
there's no way that could have ever been
a good idea from the start every one of
you
so and that's what's different about the
what I'll call the the dad View
the dad view is the one that people go
ah yeah you're right
like it it just ends all the
conversation it's like uh do you think
that we should have fewer police and
don't lock people up for crimes uh what
do you think will happen well the dads
are setting it out you know maybe they
say some things but they're not too
involved and then of course the city
goes to complete hell
complete hell and then the internet dads
get interested
theoretically and they come in and say
you know what I can fix this but you're
gonna have to hire more police and
you're gonna have to you know stop
letting people out of jail for multiple
crimes and then what do people say do
they say well that's crazy
get out of here you internet dads who
might also be women get out of here with
your opinions no
if your city is falling apart you know
to crime
then the internet dad says how about you
know more police and you know fix this
bail situation
everybody in the city goes ah okay we'll
try your way
uh do we have to get rid of Karen
her her actual name was Karen
um all right
uh here's another uh
thing I'd like to ask and tell me if I
said this on the live stream yesterday I
can't remember if I said this on the man
cave which is a separate live stream
remember we heard that the barisma
prosecutor being fired or being removed
with Biden's push
remember we heard that that was all
legal and copacetic because the other
countries also wanted that prosecutor
gone do you remember that
did I talk about this yesterday
because if I did I'm going to talk about
it again
did you ever say to yourself
um
who are those other countries and which
which member of the country
okay yeah I think I did talk about it
but I'm going to do it again
I'd like to see a little reporting on
that wouldn't you if if the news if the
news business we're in the uh the job of
giving you information
don't you think it'd be pretty easy to
Google it see who wrote about it and
find out exactly who exactly who was it
the leaders of other countries
was it the Prime Minister of Great
Britain
do you think the Prime Minister of Great
Britain was up to date on the issue of
the Ukrainian
prosecutor and barisma
do you believe that do you believe it
was the Prime Minister of Great Britain
was like ah you know I've been doing a
lot of thinking about that Ukrainian
prime minister and that barisma
situation
because that's what the news the news
the news told you that the other
countries were begging for this
do you think it might have been
that Biden's uh and Obama's appointed
diplomats were simply asked to tell
their country to agree with them
do you think if we said to the Diplomat
hey go to somebody in your country who's
got some government job and tell them
that this prosecutor guy they've never
heard of in this country They Don't Care
About That America really says he's he's
dirty and we've got to get rid of them
see if we can get some agreement from
New Zealand
I'm just making up New Zealand
and then then somebody in New Zealand's
I don't know Department of whatever says
all right well I don't know anything
about this Ukraine purisma prosecutor
situation but you sound pretty
convincing so sure I'll sign off on it
yeah you can tell New Zealand wants some
gone too
in the real world and the real world
that you live in
do you believe there were multiple other
countries that were engaged in the
question of the Ukrainian prosecutor and
barisma specifically Prisma
do you think so because we were all told
that
we were all told that this and and
therefore is no story now this is no
story every everybody everybody wanted
him gone the United States was just one
of many he was just doing the bidding of
the International Community has nothing
to do with a Biden crime family thing
it's everybody everybody wanted him go
on
that was always
I didn't think about it too much until
recently
but now you look at it and you say to
yourself seriously
do you think it was the prime ministers
the president's presidents they were all
engaged and it came up with a big
National opinion about this one
prosecutor
no there isn't the slightest chance that
any other country was even interested
and maybe one other or something
yeah so here's what it looks like it
looks like the uh Biden crime family had
enough power to make other countries
agree on something they didn't care
about one way or another
so they're just like yeah whatever yeah
if you know what you're talking about
we'll we'll just sign into that and that
the news sold it to you as a universally
wanted thing that that prosecutor would
be removed but now we know that barismo
was actually asking for the prosecutor
to be removed they believed they were
paying the bidens to get it done they
asked them to get it done and then they
did it
and then the news told you that
everybody wanted it done and you
believed it
maybe not you because you're smart
but but the Democrats believed it they
still say it and even today
even today
uh I don't believe you'll see any
reporting about all those other
countries that wanted that prosecutor
removed do you know why you won't see it
because if it were true
if that story would hold up you don't
think that would be all over the news
you don't think CNN would say uh look
we've got the Prime Minister of Great
Britain let's just ask
did you say you want this this
prosecutor removed and why oh yes I
totally did he was bad for the country
bad for the world even though it's just
a prosecutor I don't know his his impact
was Global and so yeah I really cared
about that
if that existed you don't think you'd
see it
you don't think that dog is not barking
so loud that it's making you
deaf no that dog is not barking
lift up the hood
look at the engine
I'm pointing to where the oil goes in
right I'm pointing to it you can see it
if you didn't see that mechanism before
that all those other countries who
wanted them gone were clearly fake from
the start
is that the other countries are as fake
as the uh the 50 people who signed the
laptop letter saying you can get 50
professionals to say anything
they just have to be in your team that's
it if they're on your side you can sign
anything
unfortunately that's the world we live
in
well
um Marjorie Taylor green
who is rapidly becoming one of my
favorite political figures
which is not to say I agree with
everything she says right that that's
not my game I'm not about agreeing with
everybody but as just a personality and
a force to be reckoned with and
I'm just going to say it
she's weirdly sexy
am I alone on that
I I've developed kind of a margin
retailer green Crush
is anybody anybody else see it
I'm getting nerves in the asses
I don't know there's just something
about her her spunky personality
this very appealing
so I'll just say it yeah she's she's
super sexy as a politician
um and it's just my opinion you don't
have to agree with me
but she points out that there's a thing
called expungement of impeachment have
you ever heard of that
so in theory let's say if Republicans uh
you know captured the Congress back in
the presidency apparently there's a
process where you can expunge a past
impeachment
see we might end up this is really
possible
with a second term of President Trump
and it could end with no impeachments
no impeachments in the past or the
future or the president
that's actually possible
and I would say it's the most likely
outcome
do you know why
why is that the most likely outcome
because it would be the most
entertaining outcome
from the perspective of an observer
who's not directly involved
ask Elon Musk he's already showed you
that machinery this is the weirdest part
of the engine
you know you open the engine there's
always at least one part that you're
confused about you know unless you're a
mechanic or something but there's always
like I don't even know what this part
does what about catalytic converter
what the hell is a catalytic converter I
didn't know I had a catalytic I didn't
know it needed to be turned into
anything at all
I can explain the spark plug
regulator yeah I I could I could explain
most part I don't really know what a
catalytic converter is I I don't know
so there are some things in the engine
that are mysterious
uh
and uh
and one of them is as Elon Musk points
out
that reality does for reasons I don't
understand like I don't understand the
catalytic converter reality does seem to
be biased toward the most entertaining
outcome
I mean I mean it might it might just be
confirmation bias but if you use it as a
predictor
maybe that'll tell you something so
let's use it as a predictor my
prediction is a second Trump term is by
far the most entertaining outcome and
expungement of his impeachments by far
the most entertaining outcome
let's see how it goes
let's see if the most entertaining one
uh works out
all right
um
Scott went to school back when they
actually taught science yeah he retains
nothing
were we talking about science
what kind of weird the trolls got really
weird this week
so have you noticed the return of the uh
the five follower troll
you know the troll that literally just
started their account yesterday so a
troll came in yesterday to tell me that
my political opinions were flawed
and that's why I let my stepson die
somebody actually signed up for Twitter
to come tell me personally
that my political opinions are the same
reason my stepson died
now do you not wonder what is the
motivation of such people
like what was that person thinking
because I don't know if these are real
people
uh I I speculate that there's some
number of people whose only job is to
make you use Twitter less
or X less
it feels like their only job is to
discourage you from wanting to open your
Twitter
or X app
that's what it feels like and they they
uh they pop up whenever the politics
turns against the Democrats at least
they pop up in my account so that that
kind of troll I hadn't seen for months
and then suddenly well there is just at
exactly the time where I you know like I
told you I had I had one tweet that got
it's probably pushing 12 million views
now
you don't think that Democrats have
noticed that a little less of me would
be good for them of course they have a
little less of me would be a little bit
better for Democrats
and then suddenly a troll pops up who
appears to be their only purpose was to
make me not want to use Twitter
didn't work
but it's what it looks like so I don't
know if that's what's happening it could
be just bad people attracted to
I don't know energy they're just like
energy moths could be that
so ladies and gentlemen I give you again
my theme and ask you if I have uh
accomplished it
so the theme is
that the events of this week
have opened the hood
so that you can see the machinery and
once you see the Machinery they can't do
to you what they've been doing before
they can only abuse you until you see
how they do it once you see the toolbox
and the Machinery you say ah you're
doing that was he overturning an
election or was he reversing it because
he thought it was bad in the first place
right
uh did Trump really think that or are
you mind reading right now are you mind
reading
are you really anti
hate speech
or are you really just creating a
situation where you're trying to make
your enemies look like they're in favor
of
speech
and is it a coincidence that we get a
new indictment
on Trump at exactly the same time that
they need to get rid of this Biden crime
family Archer Devon story that's all
over the news oh what a coincidence open
up the hood look at the engine
that's where the oil goes
so
that
concludes my live stream for YouTube
today
I think it's the best
best thing you've ever seen
uh we'll probably change the direction
of humanity itself but I'm done for
today and I'll talk to you YouTube
tomorrow I'm going to go talk to the
locals platform separately I give them
all the good stuff I mean this is good
but way do you well you won't see but
the stuff I give to the locals play oh
my God insights laughter
Fellowship I mean it's
it's just like better than anything but
you wouldn't know if you're just over
there on YouTube just trying to
get some free entertainment but that's
okay too that's okay too and I'll talk
to you tomorrow morning
