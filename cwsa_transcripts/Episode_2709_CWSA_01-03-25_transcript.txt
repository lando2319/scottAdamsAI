let's see if this works better the first
try didn't work and that mean everybody
be looking for the first try and not
finding the real
one
um there we
are all right we're good to go I think
some non-locals people will get lost
might take them a while to find us but I
think everybody will figure it out
eventually there you go the YouTube
people are figuring it out so sry had a
little technical difficulty there I had
to I had to quit and back in so it means
her
to if my engineer is
listening please delete the first
try all right
[Music]
so good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and it
took me a couple of tries to make the
technology work I think it was human
error in this case my my human error but
uh so you'll see there's a wrong one and
a right one if you're listening to this
you're in the right one good for you
good for you but if you'd like to take
this experience up to levels that nobody
can understand with their tiny shiny
human brains all you need is a cuper
mgar glass or tanker chel sign a Cen Jer
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparallel
pleasure the dope being here the day the
thing that makes everything better
except my lighting which is
terrible I sure wish I knew what was
causing that it's kind of a new thing
anyway it's called the simultaneous up
and happens now
go feels like nothing's working just
right this morning everything's like off
by one
do you ever have those days when
everything's just a little bit off no no
major problems I mean it's not like a
big deal but everything's a little bit
off today I don't know keep an eye on
that why in the world am I
fuzzy why why suddenly is the video just
like I I look like one of those aging TV
stars have you ever noticed that as you
know a beautiful celebrity will age uh
they they have to fuz the video more and
more until they're just like a blotch
you can't you can't even make out the
nose I think that's what's happening
with me maybe it's an
angle no let me try to see if I can
clean the camera is there a camera
problem oh yeah maybe that helped a
little I think that helped good we're
ready to go finally
finally all right well here's some uh
Science News according to Brian methley
at the University of Utah a study shows
that if you lose Urban
trees it disproportionately affects some
places so apparently the educational
attainment is better where they have
more
trees so where they're poor trees or the
trees have died and not been replaced
they don't do as well in school
H is it the lack of trees that make
people do worse in school in the
city uh or could it be that the
correlation is if everything doesn't
work in that City including education
you also can't keep a tree
alive what are the odds that you're
running a first class school system in a
city where you can't keep a tree alive a
tree
do you know how hard it is to kill a
tree you pretty much can throw an acorn
in the ground and walk away 40 years
later great tree well you know sooner
than that so yeah I don't know if this
science is getting the order right I
don't know if taking away the trees
makes you do poorly in school or it
could be that if you live in a place
that can't keep a tree alive it's not
going to do much better with you just
ask
him well it turns out that the Surgeon
General wants alcohol to carry warning
labels because it's the third leading
cause of cancer I didn't know that after
after tobacco and obesity alcohol is the
third leading cause of
cancer so it turns out that alcohol is
poison told
you you don't need science really you
don't you just listen to me babbling
about
stuff you know it it seems like my
babbling is like 80%
um like I have an 80% win record of just
guessing
anyway uh we also hear zeroedge is
saying that
uh parents need to be worried about
forade AI toys for kids used as
propaganda that's right if you have ai
built into a child's toy you better be
careful because that child is talking to
the AI and you don't know what they're
going to say apparently there's a report
according to Zero Hedge of an AI
powerered robot called
Mo so some father bought it for his
2-year-old and uh it says that KL Harris
will be the 47th president and Praises
comma and
Biden uh but when asked about trump it
says nothing positive according to the
libs of Tik Tock I guess Libs of T to
notice this
first do you
remember uh long ago not really like
last year when we thought that AI would
be the thing that would teach us what
was true and what wasn't true do you
remember that we we thought that AI
would tell us what's
true nope it turns out AI is just a
better way to lie to us because when AI
says something is true and I've had this
experience I'm really ready to believe
it because it talks like a person and
why would it lie to me I mean it
wouldn't lie would it so when AI gives
you disinformation it's really powerful
because you think the disinformation is
true so there is really no possibility
that AI could ever be used to tell you
the truth because whoever controls it
has their preferred idea of what's true
whoever built this moo doell probably
thought it was a fact that kamla was
awesome and Trump would never become
president so they programmed it to think
that
I I doubt that this came up with that on
you know just from some pattern
recognition I don't think so maybe but I
don't think
so anyway AI will be the biggest source
of misinformation in the world by
far well of course we have to talk more
about those two Terror attacks recently
that happened on the same day New Year a
new years it was the new or New Orleans
one and Las Vegas one and
have you noticed that whenever there's
something like a terrorist
attack that there's always an
alternative explanation for what
happened it's like if you look at 9/11
it's like well uh Osama bin Len ran a
plot and it became
911 but then you know there's always the
group that think
it's the government did it itself or
some other government did it for their
own purposes there's no such thing as a
terror attack where we don't immediately
suspect our own government is behind it
which which on one on one hand you might
say well that's that's the worst
possible
situation on the other hand you could
say it's a good thing we don't trust
everything like it's really healthy just
to not trust anything like anything that
happens I think I wonder if my
government caused that it doesn't even
matter if if I fell off my own bicycle
the first thing I do is look behind me
and see if Congress is there you
oh oh maybe it wasn't the government
this time it's just automatic we just
assume the government's behind
everything so that's part of the New
Orleans story but here are the things
that are notable about the story that's
newish it does seem that at least on the
political right there seems to be a
settling in on the narrative that Dei is
the main
problem now did you imagine that that
would ever
happen that people people just casually
talk about it like it's a fact oh it
looks like Dei is the the base problem
here because if we didn't have
de you know we would have blocked off
the
streets right if we didn't have Dei we
would have caught this guy early now I
don't know if any of that's
true so let me be very careful when I
say this I don't know that any specific
situation and I don't think there's any
way to know you don't know that any
specific situation is a Dei problem but
it is 100% fair to surface it as your
top
suspect because at this point in history
Dei has crippled or ruined just about
every large
organization and again has nothing to do
with anybody's genes or their
culture it has only to do with
constraining your hiring choices so that
you don't have an option of just looking
for the best person now in theory you're
you're by getting the best person but
also diversity in
reality if you're getting measured for
diversity you're going to get diversity
one way or another so in the real world
it just means don't hire white guys
that's really all it that's literally
all it means so so of course people are
looking at this as a Dei story even
though we don't know if it is but it is
the right question to
ask so here are some of the things we
know and by the way on the Dei thing
this is the price of
Dei and if the proponents of Dei did not
know that the the perfectly predictable
outcome of succeeding in getting a lot
of Dei candidates in office or getting
hired if he didn't know that was going
to cause a massive backlash against
everybody who gets gets a job under that
context how did you not know that the
the price of Dei is that for an entire
generation if you're black and you're
capable and you just do a really good
job and you get promoted on all of your
merits you will be widely assumed to not
be
capable now I didn't make that system if
IID made the system this wouldn't happen
so don't blame the people who are simply
responding to the system you built
they're The Messengers if they tell you
H looks like we have to suspect Dei in
this situation they didn't make that up
that's not an opinion it's it's the
clear just observation it's an
observation that you have to include
that V variable when you're looking at
any complex situation in
America don't blame the
messenger all right so apparently the
Airbnb that we think was the New Orleans
connected to the New Orleans attacker
was on
fire was
it I'm not even sure if anything that
was reported early on is true but there
was so much fog of War false reporting
that I don't really even know what's
true at this point but uh so apparently
the uh New Orleans B&B had bomb making
materials in it I didn't see any signs
of the fire so I don't understand what
part of this is true and what's not and
and also by the way I should tell you
that the odds of me confusing these two
headline stories is nearly 100% I'm I'm
already having a tough time figuring out
wait which one was the Las Vegas guy and
which one was the New Orleans guy is
anybody having that problem it's like
wait one was a cyber truck the other was
an electric Ford truck all right so if I
give some of the details
wrong just know it's
coming
um so here are the things we know the on
the New Orleans
one um a reporter was allowed in to give
it a tour of what looks like essentially
part of the crime scene and conveniently
laid out in the New Orleans terrorist
home is the open
Quan
coincidentally and uh tables of you know
work tables where he's making all kinds
of bombs and stuff now it definitely
looks like 100% looks like somebody
who's a terrorist lives
there do people
do people make their apartment look
exactly like a terrorist live
there maybe you know
maybe um so I guess we'll figure out
what that is now part of the uh part of
the issue is that
Trump said that uh the open borders are
causing more crime and terrorism now you
already know that the the New Orleans
terrorists was American B
now he had an Islamic name and you know
he was obviously in that life but he's
American Born he went to was in the
American Military so is Trump right or
wrong when he uses that situation which
was an American Born guy when he uses
that as an example of open borders being
a problem the answer is yes because it's
a reasonable assumption that since he
was living living among a lot of recent
immigrants within the same
cultural uh same cultural
situation does it seem likely that he
was living with somebody who came more
recently who was either encouraging or
radicalizing him we don't know the
answer to that but like the Dei case
it's the first question you should ask
the first question
so it feels to me like if the guy is
American Born but he was living among
recent immigrants who brought a
different culture and some of it may
have radicalized them I think Trump's on
point now again we don't know if he's
technically right on this specific case
but this is the kind of hyperbole I
don't mind at all because it's so
obviously directionally correct it
doesn't really matter to me too much
that he was born in America if he lived
among people who weren't and that
culture is presumed to have had some
impact on it
I don't know I don't know could you
become that dedicated if if all of your
friends or where you lived didn't have
any of those views possible but it seems
less
likely so all right so what else
um we'll talk about the coincidences in
a minute but the the funniest thing was
the cybertruck guy now it may not be
funny because I think there there's a a
real possibility that the so called
terrorist in the Cyber truck may have
been actually a
victim so there's there's certainly as
many indications that he didn't do it as
there are that he did it even though he
was the one his body was the one found
in the car so here's what we know
apparently the we know the path that the
Cyber truck took from Denver to Los
Vegas but it did not take the direct
route it took a very indirect route
do you know
why his first stop was in Las Vegas New
Mexico it looks like can't be
sure but it looks like when he took off
he said hey
cybertruck uh give me take take me to
Las Vegas and it took him to the closest
one apparently there are two places
called Las Vegas in the United States
one is in New Mexico I didn't know that
so so it looks like he drove to a
completely wrong State and then when he
got out of his truck he's looking around
he's like I don't see any
casinos uh something pissing and then he
realized he was in the wrong State and
then he then he drove directly to Las
Vegas the real one
now who doesn't notice they're driving
to the wrong State well maybe I wouldn't
I have to admit if you said you're could
go from Denver to Las Vegas and it took
me through New
Mexico I wouldn't
maybe be alerted to it right away
because I'm so smart I might be reading
a book and letting the car drive or the
truck if he had it on full self-driving
probably wasn't even paying attention he
might have been just doing his own thing
and the and the truck was driving itself
don't
know
so here are the things that are strange
about this to make us think maybe it
wasn't really him who was in the car
his burned up body was found uh one
thing is that he was in the military and
people say he definitely knew how to
make a proper bomb and this was the
least capable bomb making you could
imagine so why would a person who could
make the best
bomb show up to actually risk his life
with the worst bomb how do you explain
that well the best explanation would be
it wasn't
him now he also had a bullet in his head
in the in the truck that blew up with
the
blums did he shoot himself in the head
after he lit a fuse of some kind so
therefore he wouldn't know for sure if
it even blew up it would make sense
because he wouldn't want to die in a
different way or makes he wouldn't want
to take a chance that he didn't die I
suppose that would be a reason but have
we have we seen a lot of American
military people who do a terrorist act
and shoot
themselves it seems like they either go
there to die as somebody else's hand or
they try to get away I've never heard of
anybody shooting themselves I mean if he
if he wanted to cause
trouble wouldn't he blow up the truck
but leave it a minute before it blew up
and use his handgun to kill random other
people like a proper terrorist you know
like the the goty like the goty the Ford
truck did so none of this makes
sense um and people are asking oh and
he's also reportedly a trump supporter
so that wouldn't make sense that he blew
up a cyber truck in in front of um
there um I think he had some kind of a
breakup not long before that but I don't
know if that's
relevant um I mean a breakup would make
you do crazy things but then
like why why would he attack the person
who supports by parking in front of that
hotel now I heard somebody
say
um I heard somebody say that he might be
opposed to
gambling uh here's a little Insider
knowledge the Trump building in Las
Vegas is the one of the only hotels that
doesn't have gambling that which is rare
There's No gambling in that hotel not
that I don't think the gambling had
anything to do with anything but it
weirdly it's the one that doesn't have
gambling um and nobody nobody heard the
shot so there's reporting that Witnesses
who were around the truck before it blew
up they didn't seem to hear a shot and I
asked if if the truck was so good at
noise cancellation that maybe you
wouldn't hear it from the outside and
smart people said yeah you would hear it
from you would hear her from the
sidewalk pretty easily so it doesn't
look like the shot may have happened
when people were nearby or at least
people were near enough to hear it and
didn't die in the explosion I guess
so that's weird so people are
speculating that what really happened
was somebody who has a problem with both
musk and Trump which doesn't appear to
be this guy and somebody who was bad at
bomb building which doesn't appear to be
this guy um and somebody who had a um
well it also doesn't there's no
indication that he was suicidal
nobody nobody's talking about
that so here are the
coincidences so anyway the the bottom
line is a lot of people suspected that
there's something about the self-driving
car that may have taken his dead
body um and turned his dead body into
some kind of a um directed
bomb now how can you do
that one way you could do it is if he
was already dead and then you did the if
you and you had the key then you could
summon it as though you're summoning a
parked car couldn't you or or would that
not work if you're on a city street it
would work in a parking lot I don't know
if the Tesla will allow you to do that
if it means that the car is going to be
on a public street without a driver I
think not my guess is it'll work in a
parking lot but Tesla knows when it's on
a real Road
so I don't think he could just summon it
the way you would summon your park car
in the parking lot I don't think
so but it was also
self-driving so suppose the bad guy um
you know killed the other guy just kept
him in the passenger seat and then uh
set it to self-drive
but it won't self-drive
unless a passenger touches the steering
wheel occasionally right could you kill
him and tape his hand to the steering
wheel or could
you just tie his hand to the steering
wheel or could you just drape it on the
bottom of the steering wheel while he's
dead so that you know he's just a dead
man with with a hand that just happens
to touch the steering wheel would would
the Tesla know he's
dead or would the Tesla say seems like a
human hand on the steering wheel to me
and just drive him right to the
hotel so it could be that if you wanted
to use a self-driving car as a car bomb
that you could send to a destination and
blow up the one and only way you could
do it is to shoot the driver drape them
over the steering wheel and then send it
so it could be it's simply the only way
you could send a self-driving car to do
something is kill the driver and and
have him not know he's doing it because
he's dead
now I don't it seems to me that's a too
clever it fits into the category of
that's a little too
good right you don't expect your your
general terrorists to come up with that
clever an idea and if your idea was that
clever you you were so good that you
could do that would you put crappy
explosives in a in a cyber
truck like at the very least you'd use a
a regular Tesla car so it have a chance
of blowing up better so none of this
really fits but there's also the
coincidence part number one coincidence
that January 1st was where two things
happened at the same time so people say
it must be connected now let me ask you
this question if you plan to make a 2025
attack and you had waited for
2025 and there is some evidence that at
least Al-Qaeda wanted things to happen
in
2025 and you were indep dependent cell
Terror cell and you got to pick your own
date they just said well do it early
like do it early so we can really set
the tone if you wanted to do an early
2025 attack what date would you pick
well if it's
me and it's winter you're not going to
have big outdoor crowds very often right
it would be rare to have a big outdoor
crowd in the winter
but January 1st is the one time you can
guarantee it so if you said do an attack
sometime early in the year I would say
hm early in the year well the only time
I'm sure there'll be big crowds and the
biggest crowds would be January 1st so
is it really a
coincidence that two people pick January
1 I would say not much one it's not much
of a coincidence and it will look like
less of a
coincidence if as Sarah Adams the xcia
person says um there's going to be a
wave of these and it's just going to
happen all year if it's going to happen
all year then January 1 is not a
coincidence it's just the obvious time
that you would do this sort of thing and
it will be one of many and then the
coincidence will just disappear because
we'll say oh it's not like there were
only two attacks this year and they
happened on the same day that would be
too coincidental but if there lots of
attacks yeah January 1st would be
exactly the date you'd expect two of
them let me give you another date you
would expect two of them July
4th right July 4th there'll be big
crowds there'll be American patriotic
crowds if you're a terrorist you'd pick
a time when you know you can get the big
crowds and it would have a little extra
meaning because it's about
America how about the anniversary of 911
do you think there's more likely going
to be two attacks on
9/11 than on any other day probably
right so January 1st is a meaningful day
it's not a random day if it were a
random day like
February 20th that would be
random then it's a big coincidence but
it's the most non-random day you could
possibly pick if you wanted 2025 to be
full of Terror you'd pick the first day
because here's what it felt like to me
because Al-Qaeda is good in the
psychology part here's what it felt
like the whole year is going to be like
this because it happened on January 1st
if it happened on December
20th I wouldn't automatically think oh
no 2025 is going to be full of it
because I'd be like well I mean it
happens anytime but the very fact that
happened on the first day takes your
brain and says 2025 Terror 2025 Terror
and it's locked
in so by doing it on the first day you
get the extra bang for the buck which is
it makes people think there's more
coming and the year is going to be full
of
it maybe it will maybe it
won't but I certainly feel like it and
terrorism is about how it makes you feel
and how I feel is oh my God there's a
lot coming because as they did it on the
1 so not random at all and uh I would
not incl I would not consider that date
too meaningful in the larger explanation
of why there were two of them at the
same
time
um apparently the two terrorists came
from the same military base all these
smart people who were in the military
say that's not a real coincidence
because something like one and three
people go through that base ass
something it's like a huge number of
people in the military spend some time
in that same place so that that
coincidence is not really a coincidence
the larger coincidence I guess is that
they're both American military people
now if you knew that you were let's say
you're the al-Qaeda
organizers if you knew that you had one
uh born in America person which will be
scarier to us right because we can't
catch him as he if they're if they're
American citizens so it's scarier if
it's an American citizen and then it's
scarier again if it's somebody who was
in the military so that would be the
ultimate Al-Qaeda plan is to make us not
only
afraid but to distrust our own
military that's like a double win but
suppose they only had one suppose they'
had been trying hard Al-Qaeda and they
could only get one actual American
citizen to do something like this
and they said to themselves if we could
get
two if we could get
two that's going to tell a different
story because then it's going to look
like the entire military has been
flipped because our brains will will
treat two as a completely different
story than one and if we put them on the
same day now this this would argue that
it's not a coincidence but we'll see um
if they happen the same day and they're
both us-born military
how do you get that out of your
mind right so that would be sort of a
perfect psychological operation but
suppose they only legitimately flipped
one person the New Orleans person how
could how could they get that second one
well they might have to fake it they
might have to murder a military guy
um imagine if they had scammed him the
following way hey whatever his name is
um
if you meet me in Las
Vegas um I've got a great job
offer or if you meet me in Las Vegas
I've got that money I owed you or
something there there must be some way
you could you know fool somebody into
going to Las Vegas once he shows up you
put a bullet in his head drape his arms
over the steering wheel put a bunch of
fireworks in the back because you don't
care how good the bomb is it just has to
look like it's a bombush and then you
just send it to Trump Tower because
where else they can send it if you were
in Las Vegas where else would you send
it P pick the other place that would
make more sense there isn't Trump Tower
yeah so that makes sense so one
possibility is that they only could get
one organically so they fake the second
one so it looks like the American
Military is
turning can't rule it
out um then the other coincidence is
that they both use this app called turo
to rent their vehicles now is that a
coincidence the answer
is
maybe uh as Tyrus pointed out on the
five and I pointed out in my show
yesterday turo
is and Tyrus kind of confirmed this it's
sort of the preferred car rental app of
the people who might run into problems
using regular rental company or wanted
to improve the
possibility that they wouldn't raise any
red flags by getting a car now I don't
know this to be true but if the FBI is
trying to catch
terrorists and terrorists are likely the
ones who would rent a let's say a panel
truck and fill it full of
bombs don't you think that by now the
homeland security has a back door into
all of the rental companies so if they
they see a if they see somebody renting
a
truck and they see it an Islamic last
name you don't think the FBI gets a bing
bing bing bing I assume they
would the reason I assume that is
because I assume Homeland Security can
get into every system that is relevant
to what they're trying to do protect the
country what would be more relevant than
knowing somebody with an Islamic last
name and and military service had rented
a
truck that would be right on the top of
your bing bing bing now I'm assuming
that there are plenty of Muslim citizens
of the United States who rent trucks
because everybody rents trucks so it's
not like it's usually going to be a
terrorist it's usually just going to be
a citizen who needs a truck but far more
likely an Islamic last name plus a
rented truck is going to be a little
more trouble than
some other name in a rented truck now of
course that's you know racial
profiling but don't you assume that
that's what the government is doing
because they need to of course they are
they're looking for patterns that they
don't they don't care about your racial
profiling they're just trying to stop
stop you from blowing up the country
so turo might be just the first choice
of people who don't have good credit and
don't want you to check on what's going
on maybe maybe I don't
know um so that's on that well you see
the fog of War about that story that
everything about it seemed to be uh an
of an of kilter a little
bit yeah all right on the other biggest
Scandal um you know I'm talking about it
but I got a lot of other people talking
about it I didn't realize how bad the
Amazon counterfeit product Scandal was
but it turns out it's actually a
Homeland Security problem because
somewhat accidentally Amazon turned into
a way for China to destroy all American
small businesses that sell things
online all of them now I knew that my
products were getting counterfeited
often because if when I when I'd put a
book up on Amazon it would immediately
be copied by AI or whatever and it would
be all these fake ones under my name my
name would be on the fakes now if I
tried to get rid of it now you're going
to say to yourself but Scot I I looked
into this and there's just a page you go
to and you put in your information and
then you can have Amazon remove it do
you think that's real do do you think I
can just go to a page and they'll remove
it nope I have to prove that it's
counterfeit do you know how the only way
that they'll let me do that I have to
buy it I have to buy the counterfeit I
have to wait for a week or two two weeks
or however long it comes and then I have
to take pictures of it and then upload
the pictures and upload the picture of
my book so that I can show that it's the
same as my book on the
inside that's their
process do you believe that they meant
that process to solve the problem now
Amazon is the best user interface people
in the world do you think that it would
build a completely unworkable system by
accident
no no there's no part of me that thinks
that's an accident because it's the
simplest problem they solve routinely
Amazon is by far except for Apple maybe
maybe better than Apple Amazon is the
best user interface I think I've ever
seen and and the reason that you don't
think of it as being the best interface
you've ever seen is because it's the
best interface you've ever seen if you
use Amazon and not once to use think ah
where's that button or why does it do
that it's the best interface you've ever
seen because the the level of complexity
of what they do is completely hidden
from the user we just know what we want
and there it is and then we click on it
so it it uh defies
imagination that their system for
correcting counterfeits which they
profit immensely from I'm told
immensely it it my imagination can't
imagine that's an accident now not all
products require you to buy the product
but mine do so right now every calendar
every Dilbert 2025 calendar on Amazon is
a
counterfeit let me say that again
100% 100% of all the Dilbert calendars
this year on Amazon are
counterfeits all of them because I don't
sell it on Amazon I'm only selling it on
a private site if you want to look for
it go to dilbert.com and you'll see the
link at the top
but every one of
them so here's what I did I of course
complained on uh on a it doesn't take
long for Amazon to notice when a big
account complains because they they have
the big companies have a they're
watching social media and they they jump
right on any complaint so that the rest
of the public doesn't see it so they
jumped right on the complaint which is
what they're supposed to do and they
said hey DM DM us and we'll see if we
can help you so I said to myself whoa
great I can just talk directly to
somebody tell them what the problem is
maybe they fix it so they say yeah we
we'll help you uh go to this form and
fill it out now as soon as I hear that I
know I'm not going to get helped so I
say are you Ai and it responded with
exactly what it said before
go to this forum and fill it out we
could help you then I said I'm done with
this process because it doesn't work I
want to talk to your legal team and they
said fill out this form with exactly the
same
words and I said I can't tell if you're
Ai and then it said oh I'm I'm not AI
I'm a human but it acted like Ai and
then I say to myself is it part Ai and
part human maybe the human checks in
once in a while but the AI does the main
work or was it Ai and it's taught to say
that it's human well let's just say that
it couldn't help me at
all so and I wasn't going to go to The
Forum and fill it out so I just said
here's my information every one of the
dilber kers is fake what else do he need
what else do you need I just told them
everything they need my phone number my
name as the author which is easy for
them to check and that 100% of the
dilber calendar are fake do and then I
said why don't you give this to your
legal team that I I asked for their
legal team because it's a legal issue to
me it's not a it's not a it's not a
customer service problem it's a legal
issue all right
um
so so basically then they said fill out
this form or we can't show it to our
legal people I'm like really you you
can't tell them that one of your most
notable authors just told you 100% of
the calendars are fake and you can't
deal with that like your system can't
accept everything that you need to know
there's nothing else you need to know
now suppose I said is there any way that
this could have been a better system
well let me design one right now when
you become a seller on Amazon the first
time you're signing up to be a seller
you have to prove who you are which
makes perfect sense so the first time
that you prove who you
are wouldn't it be good if you got like
a secret 10 digigit code so that when
you you publish something else under
your same you know publishing name it's
got that code on it they go oh that's
real only that one person would have
that code and then everybody who tries
to knock it off would be able to
perfectly knock off the product but they
wouldn't know my magic code so they
wouldn't be able to post it how hard
would it be to do that and then if
somebody steals my code I tell them and
they give me a new code it looks like
it's moronically easy to fix now so I
posted about this and I thought it might
be something limited to books and
calendars and printed material oh no it
turns out that Amazon working with China
is a way to destroy all American small
business because as soon as any small
business that's selling on Amazon as
soon as they get some um good sales
it's noticed and one of two things
happen either Amazon itself builds a
generic and sells it instead of yours
which puts you on a business or China or
India look at it and say it looks like
they're selling a lot of these widgets
let's make a fake one and they'll
they'll have way more fake ones that are
on the account than the real ones so
you'll you won't know what's real and uh
will but it's better then the fakers
will also buy the real one and return it
multiple times they'll also give bad
reviews to the real one so the real one
gets the bad reviews they're dealing
with purchase and returns that were
always meant to be returns they were
never meant to be purchased it's just to
put them out of business and then
they'll flood the Zone with their
knockoff product which is sometimes okay
and sometimes not now here's what you
need to know that happens 100% of the
time 100% of the time
it doesn't happen with every product
because not every product has sales
there are a lot of lot of small products
so you wouldn't bother knocking off but
100% of the things that sell well are
stolen from the person who invented it
and made the business 100% so either
Amazon steals it themselves and makes it
a
generic or they allow other companies to
steal it right in front of you and then
they they carry it now the question I
would ask is isn't that deeply illegal
if you know you're doing it and it
wouldn't be that hard to
stop it feels like it's deeply
illegal um now you might say to yourself
and and I threatened a class
action because there's a gigantic class
that would probably want to get in on it
now the last thing in the world I want
to do is to get involved in a giant
lawsuit with Amazon like there's no way
I win there's no winning path there I
would only do it as a suicide bomber
meaning I would only do it if I thought
it would help the other sellers sometime
somewhere down the road so I might you
know I mean might need to be you know a
weapon of mass destruction but I can't
help
myself I don't think there's a path
where I can man ahead because if you're
a book seller and you take on
Amazon you could imagine a thousand ways
they could get even so it doesn't make
sense business-wise it doesn't make any
sense but sometimes it's not about
business is it it's not about business
here's what I think I don't think this
is a legal issue I think it's a homeland
security issue why is it that we're
trying to make sure that we reshore our
businesses and Manufacturing from China
is it because we want to make more money
no it's because it's a homeland security
problem Amazon is now working for the
adversaries intentionally or not
but it's a homeland security problem
Amazon probably needs to be shut down if
they can't fix this because they've
developed a system to destroy all
American
companies Homeland Security should just
shut them down and say you can't destroy
American companies intentionally now
when I say intentionally clearly they
know this is
happening right there's nobody here who
doubts that they know it's happening and
they've built a system that optimiz for
that it doesn't optimize for protecting
the the seller it optimizes for the the
counterfeits now I saw that uh I think
I'm right about this that Nike pulled
its products entirely off of Amazon
because the Amazon couldn't stop the the
counterfeits now let me ask you this do
you really think they couldn't stop
counterfeits from
Nike all they had to know is that Nike
only has one official source and all the
rest are fake how hard is
that all Nike had to say is here's our
here's our legal sources just don't
don't buy from anybody else or don't
list anybody else the other way you
could go is have um blue
checks so suppose they give me a blue
check mark so that if you saw multiple
copies you'd say oo these other ones
don't have a blue check mark
then let's say I decided to turn
somebody in with my blue check mark so
I've got like some Authority now
hypothetically so I turn in some some
other person well what happens if I'm
I'm actually a bad guy and I turn in
somebody who who was legitimate well
then then we get into a battle and then
they find out and I turned into somebody
legitimate and then they take my blue
check away and I'm out of business as I
should be as I should be the all you
have to do is give people who are
legitimate a way to prove their
legitimate
once give them a blue check or the
equivalent and then train the other
people that they're looking at something
that's not been
verified right so all I need to know is
The Fakes are not verified and I am so
that would mean that 100% of the fake
ones would show the whole product and
then very clearly you would say the
seller is not a
verified legal
seller doesn't mean they're illegal
they're just not verified as a legal
seller it would take you five minutes to
learn never to buy from them because
that just means counterfeit right how
long would it take you to figure out you
got to buy from the blue check
companies that it's the easiest problem
to solve and I heard somebody say that
they make more money from the
counterfeits than they do from a lot of
other stuff
so it could be that's absolutely nothing
except a big source of money and they're
pretending they can't solve
it but while they're pretending they
can't solve it it is a homeland security
problem and I really think they need to
be shut down if they're not going to
address it seriously like the whole
thing just shut it down just turn off
the switch because if you're not even
trying to stop destroying the economy of
the United
States Maybe you shouldn't be in
business um the other thing that it is
which I thought also was affecting only
me if you have a new book and you you
upload it because there's a process for
independent people like me to upload a
book working with Joshua lysc in this
case uh when you upload it the odds of
getting a glitch on your
page my experien is 100% a glitch means
there's something wrong with the listing
you'd either doesn't show up or it's not
connected to your other books it it's
not visible it takes it takes weeks for
reasons you can't figure out and they
won't help you and what happens in the
time it takes you to get the glitch
fixed do you know what happens you're
flooded with counterfeits that didn't
get a glitch oh really so only only the
person who really owns the property gets
a glitch but all the people who are fake
no glitch right in there
and they sell all the books for the
first few weeks because that's how long
it takes you to fix the glitch but if
you're an author who makes most of their
sales on the first few weeks which is
typical they take all all of your
profits and then oh oh we got it fixed
finally it took a month a
month ordinarily it's ordinary for them
to take a month to fix a glitch it's
ordinary for there to be a glitch every
time
now I thought it was just happening to
me until I saw some comments apparently
it's a
system it now that part I do not believe
is intentional on the point of Amazon's
management what I do think is that
people in charge of posting things are
taking bribes from China or
India I think the employees are bribed
and I think that they're glitching it
intentionally and they're working with
the counterfeits to make sure the
counterfeits have a month of a month of
free access before the real one is UNG
glitched now there's way too many
glitches to imagine this is an accident
given that it's their Core
Business to upload things and make them
properly listed it's no coincidence this
has to be bribery at some some sub level
so the level of illegality is just
incredible so what it's doing is
basically somebody else said this these
small American bu businesses are taking
the risk they're doing the R&D they're
doing all the marketing for whatever the
product is and then China steals it so
they're stealing our IP by stealing the
product right in
effect all right so that's Homeland
Security that would make it Christy
gnomes business right yeah and and this
really has to be reframed this is not
just some ordinary domestic business
glitch uh customer customer support
isn't as good as we'd like it it's not
that this is a Homeland Security
gigantic gigantic risk destroying
American small business right in front
of us
intentionally
intentionally and we're just letting it
happen it's time for the Trump
Administration to put a big
it's time for the Trump Administration
to put a big foot on this and see what
they can
do anyway speaking of trump he uh he
likes Tik Tock and he's trying to see if
they can get a delay so it doesn't get
banned um and we'll we'll see what
happens with that but you should know
that one of Trump's big donors owns a
big part of Tik Tock so Trump says he
likes Tik Tock now because it worked in
favor of him um and that I'm sure that's
part of the reason but another part of
it is he's got a donor that's so big
he's probably not going to go against
that donor so that's a factor however I
did have this experience the other day I
mentioned the Tik Tok ban to some young
people who are frequent users of Tik
Tok and the first thing I heard was um
Tik Tok shows both sides on political
stuff is that your experience how how
many of you use Tik Tok do you think it
shows both sides and so the argument was
if it shows both
sides what's the problem now that's a
pretty good question isn't it if
somebody who uses it regularly says I
see both sides all the time I see prot
Trump I see anti-trump if I'm seeing
both sides what's the
problem well here's where
someone trained in Persuasion is Handy
here's what I explained how do you know
you see the best stuff from both sides
if I were if I were some uh nefarious
person at Tik Tock or in China and I
wanted to game the system I would make
sure that you saw both
sides but their algorithm tells you
which are the which are the
most uh viral and Powerful so I'd make
make sure you saw weak Arguments for one
side and strong Arguments for the other
do you think you'd know that they did
that to you do you think you'd do you
think you'd know that they intentionally
gave you the weak Arguments for one side
and the strong Arguments for another or
would you just say looks like I saw both
sides you would say you saw both sides
because you wouldn't know you saw the
weak argument versus a strong argument
and they have every ability to do that
I'm not saying they've ever done it I'm
not I'm not claiming they did that I'm
saying how easy would it be because the
risk is not what they've done so far if
you if you believe that the risk of Tik
Tok is what you've seen so far I've
never said that that's not something
I've said it's the futurisk and it's the
fact that they could do things you never
know they did so the the other thing is
how do you know you see the same amount
on both sides it's easy to
know if you saw both sides
it's hard to know if you saw the same
amount because it's not like you're
keeping track so what if they gave you
7030 if they gave you 70 from one side
and 30 from another would you notice or
would you just say well I see both sides
oh yeah I see a little more of one but I
see both sides like I see both sides
what else do I need but if it's
7030 would you know cuz it would
definitely change your you're thinking
that would be enough to persuade how
about this what if the people who were
talking to me um were not the people
that Tik Tok cared about meaning that
Tik Tok knows who you're going to vote
for pretty quickly do you think it needs
to send persuasion to people who made up
their mind and are not going to change
it no it turns out there's only a narrow
sliver of Tik Tok users who might be
independent enough that they could go
either way can Tik Tok identify them and
if you were going to compare this the
thin number of people who can be
persuaded would they also get just as
much from both sides and would it be the
same quality on both
sides because look how well they could
hide the persuasion first of all you
don't do any special persuasion for 90%
of the public and then when people weigh
in they say I'm pretty sure I'm not
being persuaded because I see both sides
it looks like a good argument to me you
can't tell me I'm being manipulated I
see everything and maybe they do but
what about that 10% that are the magic
ones who could be
persuaded you wouldn't know if they were
the only ones getting the persuasive
stuff you wouldn't know and they
wouldn't know
either um and what if they're saving
their play for some big play later you
know what what if they haven't used any
of these powers that would be available
to them and they're just waiting for the
big opportunity something that just
kneecaps America if we believe it to be
true now let me ask you this if you
think if you think you're on Tik Tok and
you've seen both sides how much anti-
Dei stuff do you think is on Tik Tok
just to pick one political topic do you
think there's as much anti- Dei as there
is pro Dei on Tik Tok
I'm I'm open to being fact checked I
that would be amazing if that were true
but I don't think so do you I mean just
just the demographics of the users
should largely guarantee that it's 80%
or more Pro
Dei I don't know I don't think anybody's
seen both sides of that maybe they're
seeing both sides of trump as
Hitler I mean which is better than
nothing but do you think they really see
both sides of
Dei I doubt it seems unlikely to
me anyway uh James Carville has a theory
about the mass
Killers uh
he even when I don't agree with James
Carville he he's so quotable and fun to
listen to because he'll just say
whatever it is that nobody else is
saying that and there's a reason they're
not saying dang
it but the reason is that they're afraid
not not that he's wrong so here's what
he says at the end of the day it's just
my theory I'm going to be right 80% of
the time these people meaning the mass
Killers have some kind of sexual problem
most of them are
incels now I don't know if we need to
take that like so seriously because
remember carville's a you know he he's a
bomb thrower and he's provocative and
you know so some of it's just his
personality and the way he communicates
and you shouldn't take it too too
seriously but here's what I would note
uh this this reminds me of backward
science where you got the cause and the
effect
wrong do you
think that um that women like to
date a guy who is a suicide bomber
do do you think there would be no
indication that there's something wrong
with the guy if he's a little bit you
know too radicalized how many women want
to be with a radicalized guy who was
always talking about I wish somebody
would blow up the Trump
Tower I I I feel
like there they may be
incels but maybe it's not their
choice yeah so so maybe just being a
super suicide bomber make sure that you
can't get a date so I'm not sure that
not getting a date turns you into a
suicide
bomber I think that whatever comes along
with being a suicide bomber is something
that women can pick up PR
easily but but he might not be wrong
there might be a lot of them that are
not getting their other needs met uh I
have said in the past and was mocked
mercilessly so I'll say it
again so the the first time I said this
it was years ago I was mocked oh God I
was mocked but I want to see if you
still mock me or or if the the vibe has
changed a little bit what I said was in
the the uh Islamic systems if the rich
people can have multiple
wives what's going to happen to the rest
of the
men well they will be unwiped right if
if you believe that you could never do
the thing that humans are born to do
which is have kids and have a family and
you thought it was just un unavailable
to you because you're not rich you're
not going to be rich you're just going
to be this single guy wandering around
doing nothing and then I say to you
but what if you did something really
Noble and you killed a bunch of people
and went to heaven and got your 72
virgins I
believe that the the amount of of people
who are suicide bombers and you know
willing to run into battle at all risks
you know like you see over there I don't
think that would happen so much if the
people doing it had a better
alternative so to me it seems that not
getting laid which which I just say is
in the category of you know not
being a person who's going to have
babies I do think that that creates a
situation where somebody would say well
might as well
and I'm going to go further if I lived
in a system where I knew I could not get
my basic biological needs
met I'd probably do something
dangerous maybe not that specific thing
but yeah I I would do illegal drugs
without thinking about it if it made me
feel good I don't know I'd probably do a
lot of criminal things because I
wouldn't care about Society I wouldn't
be a part of it you know if you can't
have kids you're you're not locked into
the system the way a single person yeah
a single person is not locked into the
system so would would the end of
multiple wives create a change in the
Middle East I think it
would it may not be the biggest change
it might not solve all the problems but
yeah the basic thing I'm saying is that
people evaluate
Alternatives right so I have an
alternative of living uh a full complete
life so it never occurs to me that
committing you know violent act would be
on my menu why would I even look at
it but if I didn't have any way to meet
my basic needs as a living human being I
would look at any alternative and I
would look at an alternative that had a
quick ending too
so I completely understand um now of
course there'll be some exceptions there
will be uh happily married people who
become Mass killers and that's probably
more to do with mental health so you
don't want to conflate the crazy people
who nothing will stop them with the
people who are literally looking at
their options and going you know all
things considered suicide bombers
looking pretty good
today anyway um Biden blocked the sale
of us steel to Japan he said he might
and I guess after there was some big
committee that tried to decide on it and
the committee came back with a can't we
can't decide and so that made Biden the
decider and Biden stopped the
sale do you mind if I just say that was
the right
decision yeah he he's going to get a few
right I'm pretty sure this was the right
decision so
I'm just going to say
unambiguously with no
caveats Biden made made the right
decision so we we're going to give him
that I'm pretty sure Trump would have
done the same thing I'm not 100% sure
but I'm pretty sure so I think he could
be happy with that
one um but why did Biden say no to Japan
buying it well I've got a
hypothesis Japan has never been accused
of bribing the Biden crime family am I
right
if um if Biden had blocked the sale to
China I would have been a little more
surprised because he did take money from
China but he didn't take any money from
Japan and I guess Japan
loses maybe they should have been more
involved in the Biden crime family and
they could have bought themselves a
steel plant we don't
know if that had any influence on his
decision but since it was the right
decision we'll give him the benefit of a
doubt all right do you remember when you
thought that China their GDP their
economy would grow until that uh
surpassed America and that was just
assumed to be true because they have
more people you more vitality and and
the lines were definitely going to
converge well at the moment it doesn't
look like it's going to happen because
China is having so many economic
problems that uh it might still happen
but um certainly not as soon as people
thought the experts thought it might
happen around 2030 and it still could
happen but boid it has slow down so
China is sucking wind but so are we if
um Trump vows to block us steals take a
okay so CBS News is reporting that Trump
would have stopped it as well so we can
be happy with that
decision but here's what I would say
about China versus the United States um
I don't see a path for China to
survive because their entire economy
depends on manufacturing at a low cost
and certainly there are a few other
countries that are trying to compete but
not super effectively like Vietnam is
trying to
be a you know but they they don't have
the
manufacturing um knowhow if you go to
China there's like this entire gigantic
industry of people who are experts as
saying what is it you want to make oh
you want to make a a lamp and of
cotton okay and they can build you a
factory that'll make a lamp and of
cotton that's not a real thing so in
fact I had a um a friend who had a
product designed designed he designed it
on sort of a napkin and stuff and he
found a Chinese company uh he was making
giant tennis rackets so he was making
tennis rackets that you know were just
for decoration if you were a tennis
player but it looked like a regular
wooden racket but it was like four feet
tall or something I bought one they
really cool but he basically said to a
Chinese company all right here's a hand
drawing of what I want it's just a giant
tennis racket it's made of wood and they
somehow made a giant tennis
racket like do you know how many
Technologies they would have to pull
together to make a giant tennis racket
strong you know at at a price that you
know that if it got bigger they could
afford and that's a lot of manufacturing
knowhow and I when I saw that I was like
holy cow I don't know that I could find
a place in America that would do that I
mean maybe so so places like Vietnam
can't just knock off um China even if
they have lower cost labor they they
don't have the factory Engineers that's
that's the big Advantage however what
happens when the cheap labor is replaced
with cheap
robots that means that the United States
will have a manufacturing Advantage at
least for stuff that is sold in the
United States because the shipping costs
and the shipping
delays are a big part of the you know
acquisition problem but if you're buying
it in America it comes faster you don't
have to worry about any economic
instability you don't have to worry
about as much you don't have to worry
about the intentional IP threat you
don't have to travel to China to make
sure that they're doing it right and
have your laptop information stolen so
robots should destroy the entire
economic engine of China while
strengthening the economic of
America and I don't see any way around
it do you because robots are definitely
coming they're definitely going to do
all the manual labor they're definitely
going to replace most manufacturing jobs
they're definitely going to be cheaper
than hiring humans and even cheaper than
having it made in
China so what's their plan
B how do how does China
survive with that and the answer is I
have no idea and I wonder if they do do
they have any idea that they don't have
any way to
survive I mean that their
system it seems to be brittle
so I will say at the same time that
betting against China's economy is
probably one of the worst bets you could
ever make but on paper it's not looking
good in the real world China is really
smart right right the the Chinese
leadership are like really really smart
people it's a lot of
Engineers so they don't do real dumb
stuff they just don't so maybe they can
figure it out but I don't know how I
don't I have a good imagination and I
can't imagine how they get out of that
we'll
see
um there's a 20-year-old uh soldier who
apparently is a hacker in his spare time
who got arrested and charged for uh
apparently he hacked into the phone
companies and got the private records of
allegedly Trump and KL Harris and then
sold the personal records of their phone
calls on the black
market let me say that again an ordinary
American 20-year-old US Army
soldier had the
wherewithal to get the president of the
United States personal messages from a
telecom Company by hacking
it now do you think there's any chance
that China isn't in every one of our
systems if a 20-year-old can get into
what I would think would be a pretty
darn secure
system pretty darn
secure then anybody can get
in you know anybody who has that talent
and China has that Talent times a
thousand so
we should assume that China is already
in
everything now I don't hate that believe
it or not because it would give China
some sense of having a weapon of mass
destruction that's not
nuclear because they can turn off the
lights in the United States and 90% of
us would die in a year
so my question would be doesn't the
United States have the same kind of sort
of balancing risk you know you don't
think that the US has hackers that are
in all the Chinese systems I assume they
do so I think we have a mutual threat
there um but maybe that's wishful
thinking anyway I saw a claim that
uh that supermarkets Food Markets are
90% owned by just 10
companies does that sound right it
doesn't sound too far off directionally
I don't know if the exact number is
right but let me tell you something
about the food company uh the food
company is a thoroughly corrupt
industry um I I worked in it a little
bit as I tried to introduce the dill
burrito a a a burrito that had uh all
the well here's two things I
learned when I many of you know I tried
to create a um a frozen burrito that
would be just the healthiest thing it
would have all the right vitamins and
minerals and vegetables in it and it
would taste good and I thought yeah why
don't we make one food that's convenient
inexpensive and perfectly healthy
wouldn't that be great then I found out
that all the information about vitamins
and minerals was fake it's all fake
science I don't trust I don't trust even
one fact about vitamins and minerals and
I was trying to do that as you know my
competitive advantage and and soon I
learned wait a minute all the science is
made up it's obviously made up it's not
obvious until you get into it but every
day that I had that business there'd be
a new news story that says oh turns out
vitamin E can hurt you I'll be like
what oh but sometimes it helps you what
you know maybe pregnant women needed or
something what and and and I kept
finding that all the vitamin stuff was
fake so on top of the fact
that the food pyramid was fake all the
vitamin and mineral stuff is
fake on top of that the supermarket
grocery industry is completely corrupt
and I've told you this before so we were
developing a super healthy food if we
did everything right to compete against
really unhealthy crap but the people who
make the unhealthy crap have uh armies
of people who go into every store and
make sure their product is well
displayed and they answer any questions
and sometimes they even go in the back
they even work for the grocery store in
the back they'll go back there and
unpack their own products and bring them
and and put them on the shelves
themselves so the grocery store lets the
vendor stock the Shelf with their own
products what do you think when you let
the vendor put their own products on
your shelf what do you think they do
when they see your product sitting on
the shelf next to it they bury it
they take your product they put it in
the back of their product so there'll be
two of theirs in front of in front of
yours and if you don't have an army of
people to move it back then you can be
in 7-Eleven for 6 months and have zero
sales that's what I
did can you imagine selling it to
7-Eleven it wasn't all of them it was it
was one subset of 7-Eleven but imagine
being in all these stores and and when
you make that sale you say to yourself
yes finally because if only that worked
it would have been cash positive if just
it if only that worked just the subset
of 7-Eleven stores if all they did was
just put it on the
Shelf it would have been cash positive
in a big
business they put it on the shelf and
then it got buried and we know that
because we checked a bunch of stores and
in 100% of the stores was buried behind
the same product
craft so so we even know who did it you
know we know for sure who did it didn't
help 7-Eleven eventually said we sold
zero of your product or something like
that so so it didn't work out so we
won't carry you that's a real story and
that and you know I could give you other
examples but trust me the food industry
is just a criminal Enterprise so if you
find out that your your food people are
selling you poison and they know they're
doing it that would actually fit
perfectly with everything I observed
that it looks like a massive criminal
Enterprise that's what it looks
like Anyway Elon Musk is weighing into
British politics he thinks the
government uh needs to be revised and
they need to hold new elections he said
specifically the people of Britain do
not want this government at all new
elections now of course he's being
blamed with inter in with British
elections the first thing we would all
note is the British government has
interfered with American elections
repeatedly so shut up shut
up is Elon interfering with your
elections I don't care shut up as long
as you're going to interfere with our
elections just shut up because we're
absolutely going to do it to you
absolutely and
unrepentant so I'd like to weigh in and
I don't know anything about I don't know
anything about UK politics but I want
them to change their
government I I
insist they're not listening to me so it
doesn't make any difference but no if
you're going to mess with our government
which you do and we know that from
various mean everything from the steel
dossier you know wink wink um the steel
dossier to sending people over to help
campaign for Comm
Harris yes they're all in our business
and other countries are always in our
politics one way or another so
no don't tell us to stop talking about
your country whether it's Elon or me or
anybody else we'll we'll we will
interfere as much as we feel like
it as long as you are and I would ask
the question when does it observation
become interference because what Elon
said is the people of Britain don't want
this government
that's true based on
polls that's a factual
statement the people in the country
don't want it the polls agree you know
completely the polls are very
overwhelmingly agree with
that so is an observation and
interference shut up Great Britain just
shut up I don't care I don't care if his
observation feels like interference to
you don't care keep it keep it
up and but it does raise the question I
wonder if Elon Musk is sort of a king
maker for other
countries is it possible that if people
think he fixed America by getting Trump
in office with Trump's
Solutions does it look like he could fix
another country because honestly I'll
bet the UK is jealous of the United
States because we have we've presented
it hasn't been implemented but we've
presented a completely workable solution
for our biggest problems which is
Trump's
policies now don't you think the UK
would like a really good plan to solve
their own problems and they don't have
one that they don't have a
trump so they don't seem to have any way
to
recover and um I think that they're
beyond what I'll call the cultural
Tipping Point
the cultural Tipping Point at some point
if you bring in a uh let's say a
contrarian or even hostile culture if
you bring in one or two people in a big
country no big deal if you bring in
enough people and they can start forming
their own communities within your
community so that they have you know
isolated communities that are not uh
acclimating to the rest of the culture
that pretty much guarantees if there's
isamic if they're bringing you know
fundamental Islamic beliefs all they
have to do is get a
foothold if they get a foot hold in the
modern world the only way you could stop
it from taking over everything because
it's a it's a viral religion they they
pretty much want to make sure that they
convert you or die trying not all of
them we're talking about the the
extremist
um that that will succeed over time if
you live in a system where we don't do
cruel terrible things now Great Britain
does not like to do cruel terrible
things to brown people it's just a
terrible look so they'll do everything
to avoid it that guarantees the end of
England it guarantees it and I don't see
anything changing in so it looks like no
matter how small the foothold is like
don't hit me with any statistics like
but Scott don't you realize that they
only make 2% of the whole country
doesn't make any difference if if all of
them are in a few Central metropolitan
areas they will eventually control the
metropolitan areas and then it just
spreads from there so now if it's
2% but they're all concentrated where
they can group and keep their culture
intact and and use it to work against
others around them you're dead do you
know what this solution is it's called
the Wagers in China I'm not recommending
it all right because if I recommended it
I would be as bad as China but China
basically says we're not going to have
any Islamic people in China it's a viral
dangerous religion it doesn't fit with
our system and we're just going to put
you in concentration camps and
essentially sterilize you effectively
now am I in favor of that no way because
nobody nobody who's a good person could
be in favor of
that but
what if he didn't have any
choice Great Britain is beyond the point
where it's fixable um I I will tell you
with Fair confidence that Great Britain
will fall it will just become an Islamic
country and they did it to themselves
completely self-inflicted the United
States might have had the same
fi but I think that the Trump
Administration who has never said this
by the way but when they do the order of
De pations they say quite wisely and
smartly that hey let us focus on the
illegals and then we'll figure out you
know who goes after that now who goes
after the people who are literally
criminals what's
next well here's where it gets
dicey if it were up to me I would ship
people back based on cultural
nonfit so if somebody was illegal but
they're also so a member of a culture
that is hostile to our culture they go
back first would that be gross racial
discrimination yes it
would but it would also be
self-defense and in the context of
self-defense totally
acceptable yeah in a in personal
interaction completely
unacceptable and certainly if you're
hiring or firing completely
unacceptable um but when you talk about
National Defense yeah you can do
anything you want there are no rules for
defense if you're literally defending
yourself against a risk there's no
ethical or moral anything but we will
act like there is and so I don't imagine
that Trump could get away with
it but it's the conversation that needs
to be had should we decide who will
destroy the United States the way Great
Britain is certain certain to fall at
this point do we want that
CU if we don't there's literally one way
to to deal with it you'd have to ship
back all recent um
non-legal immigrants who came from
certain parts of the world you'd have to
do them all just get rid of everybody
who's not a citizen who came from the
wrong part of the
world You' want to make sure that you
discriminated as little as possible
against American citizens and against
non- radicalized people because it would
be a horrible horrible thing but it
might be the only thing it might be the
only thing that saves the country and I
feel like the big problem is that we're
afraid to say that ideas
matter if you put people who want to get
along with a bunch of people who don't
want to get
along and want to conquer
you that needs to be
discussed you can't just act like it's
not
there and you can't say but but it would
be discrimin
because most are not you know
most immigrants who came to this country
from those countries probably just
wanted a better life probably not in any
in any kind of bad business at all but I
don't
care don't really care what I care about
is that we don't go the direction of the
United Kingdom and be
doomed and there is a way to prevent it
it just would
require somebody with balls the size of
the size of mar Lago to get it done I
don't know if he can do it that might be
a step too far but I I would go crime
first and culture cultur will fit a
second so now it's out
there so this is one of the things I can
do because I'm cancelled you know I
can't get further canceled than I am so
I can say what the government can't say
and shouldn't say which is who is second
after you get the the known criminals so
of course you want to get the Venezuelan
gangs you want to get the murderers and
the rapists and stuff of course but we
need to
be at least a little aware of what the
second wave would
be and I would get rid of anybody who
wasn't culturally
compatible and was recent yeah I
wouldn't obviously definitely don't
Deport any citizens of the United States
and if there's some way to tell who's
not radicalized then definitely like to
keep them
but if you don't know if they're
radicalized and they came from a certain
part of the country and they're not
citizens and they're not here
legally yeah that they got to go
next everybody
agree and somebody has to say it out
loud because I've told you before that
persuasion wise sometimes you need the
person who goes first first and just
says the thing that gets you canceled
for sure this this is like cancel bait
if I were not already
canceled I would get canceled for this
would you agree this is total cancel
bait but you know what's the point I'm
already
canceled and but I but again I'm
completely against discrimination and
any personal
professional you know in-person way
totally against that but but
self-defense different
standard no rules for
self-defense all right here's some
science things surround things out
according to rikman University people
who can see the big picture and are good
at
storytelling have more meaningful
lives so people who think of things in
terms of stories and can tell stories
have more meaningful
lives I can see that because
storytelling especially um it just seems
that people who can see things as
stories would ordinarily find more
meaning if you don't see the story then
you just see what you're doing which
might be drudgery and that doesn't make
you too happy but if you see the
drudgery you're doing as connected to
the larger story of your
life that could give you some
meaning so I look at the times in my
life where I did horrible work I mean
the work was hard and unsatisfying but
as long as it was moving me along my
storyline I was fine with it so you know
College college classes I found you know
largely
uninteresting in drudgery but I knew I
needed it so I always was
enthusiastically embracing the challenge
because it was part of my story now I've
told you the um prisoner Island
story it's good to have a story of
yourself and then make yourself conform
to it so I've got a couple of stories
one is that I always win in the end
which is not you know literally true but
as long as I tell myself that story when
bad things happen to me I just say h
I've seen the story and the story is I
fix this in the end turns out I usually
do I usually do fix my problems in the
end so you know it's easy to convince
myself and then I use the prisoner
Island example you've heard it before
but the idea is that you imagine you're
you're dropped on a prisoner Island and
there's no law there's no Warden and on
day one all all of the bad prisoners who
are already there beat me up steal
everything I have and leave me for
dead because of course they're bigger
and meaner and there are more of them on
day two they beat me up again and it's
even
worse day three same thing day four same
thing but if you come back in a
year I will have killed every one of
them and I will be ruling the
island now it's called escape from
prisoner
Island and what I find is that um it
helps me understand myself or really
program myself it programs me to say it
doesn't matter what you have to do
you're going to do it it doesn't matter
how hard it is you're still going to do
it it doesn't matter how much how how
badly beaten you are you're still going
to win it doesn't matter how many times
they beat you up you're going to get
them in the end now again it's not
technically true that I'm going to win
in the end all the time but I treat my
life as that story and it's a recurring
one every time every time something bad
happens there you are prisoner
Island so imagine how good that feels
when something bad happens to you
whether it's a divorce or uh you know in
my case getting cancelled I just go
right to prisoner Island and go yep you
beat me up and left me for dead let's
check back next year a year after I got
cancelled I had built an entirely new
distribution system and was happier than
I've ever been um in terms of you know
my
creative um work it's it's just ideal my
current situation is so much better than
before I was cancelled that's escape
from prisoner Island so whether you use
that story or some other story you
should have a
story have a story for yourself where
you win and then just keep plugging
yourself into the story it will
help um let's see what
else according to uh sa poost and
Vladimir
hry uh people who know two languages
might have more protection against
Alzheimer progression to which I say you
could have just asked
me because don't we have plenty of
science that says the more you use your
brain the more protection you have
against you know all all forms of losing
your cognitive
ability so knowing two languages would
be evidence that you've used your brain
more than somebody who knows one
language which would be right on point
with you know being a protective thing
against
any kind of mental decline so next time
just ask
me um Eric Dolan writes for cpost he
says oxytocin influences moral emotion
decision-making so oxytocin is the
chemical your brain or your body creates
when uh you're in like personal contact
and intimate situations and stuff and it
makes you feel love and connection to
things but they found if they give it to
you artificially
that you will have uh greater moral
Behavior basically it make makes you
feel shame more and makes you care more
about harming other people so basically
you you just love your fellow human
beings a little bit if you're on this
drug and my takea away from this
is science has a million ways to tell us
you don't have free
will and 98% of you are not getting the
hint
I I'll just say this because I love
saying it and watching people not accept
it if you can change people's decisions
with a
drug they don't have free
will now I know you're going to use word
thinking and say but I have free will
because I can choose and they'll say
well all you did is substitute a
word then you'll say B Scott there are
lots of things I could have done but I
only chose one that's free will now
would say no you just put a word in
place of
it unless you think that the rules of
cause and effect and the rules of
physics don't apply to your
brain I don't I don't know why you think
that that wouldn't apply to your brain
no you don't have free will science
keeps trying to tell us but we reject
it uh there's some kind of new uh Nano
based sensor that can diagnose your
health so instead of looking at lots of
cells like a lots of blood samples or
something that they think they can get a
they don't have it finished yet but a
detector they could look at
one one
um let see one
what uh one molecule they can look at
one molecule from your body and diagnose
your health
problems now whether or not this ever
works this is by uh let's see it's in
Riverside University of California Jules
Bernstein's writing about
it but whether or not that works and
they can diagnose you with one molecule
or not there's going to be a whole bunch
of diagnostic devices that will be
desktop and consumer friendly so you'll
just have something on your desk that
you'll stick your finger in it'll take a
prick or take one molecule in this case
it will tell you all kinds of things now
what do you do about it suppose you
diagnose yourself take your blood test
you found you got a bad problem well I
think the future is nurse practitioners
plus
AI I think AI will be your doctor but
sometimes you need to be physically
manipulated such as a bandage put on or
you know an injury cleaned or stitches
or something like that so I think I
think you'll have nurse practitioners
doing the physical part that the AI
doctor said should be done because we
know we're at the cusp where the AI
doctor is going to be better than the
real
Doctor any minute
now I mean at the moment it might be a
tie um and and I believe AI already
outperforms doctors reading X-rays and
reading scans I think that's already the
case
um so so yeah I mean we're right a year
from now probably you're going to use AI
instead of a real doctor that's my guess
and then nurse practitioners so I don't
know what doctors are going to do it's
going to be a tough economic climate for
doctors going
forward and that ladies and gentlemen is
all I had to
say took way too long I'm going to say
bye now and I'm going to just say hello
to the locals people and everybody else
thanks for joining we'll see you see
next time same time tomorrow and locals
coming at you I'll only be
brief
