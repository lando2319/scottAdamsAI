foreign
hello and good morning everybody how are
you
are you as happy as I am today
no reason no reason I just got enough
sleep and uh I'm looking at a very
disturbing photo picture on the locals
right now I've got two streams going
uh I'm trying to ignore
a pig and a thong on the other screen
why'd you have to do that to me right in
the middle right in the beginning of the
show all right if you'd like to make
this day special all you need is a
copper among your glass a tanker Chelsea
Stein I can't do yoga class a vessel of
any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day thing
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous yep it happens now go
I was I was asked this morning privately
uh how do you how do you get your voice
modulation so that you're not monotoned
when you're doing stuff like this
and there was a huge problem for me
um trying to get a little bit of variety
in what I'm doing and this the problem
is that there's an illusion when you're
in front of people
you feel that you're
um
you feel that you're you're you're
modulating a lot
but when you play it back it's like I am
not actually modulating a lot I
certainly thought I did in my head but
in fact nothing happened
and the only solution I know
is to first of all get more relaxed the
more relaxed you are the more natural
variety just slips in so practice helps
that makes you relaxed but on top of
that you have to play it back
and you have to learn that there's an
illusion that you think you're doing it
but you're not and so you have to go way
big
and it's the same with public speaking
with public speaking a lot of people
feel like they need to jump right into
it because you know they don't want the
audience sitting there born
and the Illusion in that case is that
the audience's sense of time is similar
to yours on stage but actually your
sense of time is all distorted once you
get on stage
so you can actually just take a breath
just look at the audience
I used to do that when I did a lot of
public speaking and once you realize the
illusions of Public Presentation then
you have the mechanism to work past them
so just play back your presentations and
you will see for yourself
that when you thought you were doing
this
I think I'm doing this and really
modulating sometimes I go down to a
whisper like Joe Biden and sometimes I
make a big deal
you think you're doing that but you're
probably not gotta play it back and see
for yourself
all right let's talk about all the
things
uh the Rasmus and the pole people
uh did a poll in which they accidentally
found the exact number of idiots in the
country
now it wasn't what they were trying to
do the the poll was about opioids
and whether people thought the problem
was getting better or worse and how
Biden was doing 44 said of likely voters
said Biden was not doing enough about
the opioid problem
but here's where it got interesting
40 of the respondents say the problem
got worse
now if you've looked at the data
it's unambiguous
the problem isn't just worse it's way
worse
all right so there's no question about
that got worse but only 40 percent of
respondents knew that
what
how is the opioid deaths not one of the
top I don't know 10 stories in the
country at least
and 40 percent is that's it only 40
percent of Voters
know it's getting worse
it's getting way worse
but here's here's the fun part
11 say the problem got better
what
what
and 18 said they're not sure
what
how could you not be sure that opioids
have gotten worse
really let's add these together the
people who say the problem got better
for opioid uh deaths
uh and the 18 who aren't sure let's see
add those together 11 18 you get 29.
29 percent
is the exact number of idiots in the
country
now on most polling questions it's an
opinion right but this isn't an opinion
this is just a hard cold
well-known fact
opioids are getting worse and still
what have I told you about the 25 right
the Magic 25 in any poll
something around 25 you know in that 20
to 30 percent range
around 25 percent of the people are just
absolute idiots on any question
but usually
that's a little disguised because it's a
piniony or maybe the data is unclear
there's a controversy about how to how
to measure stuff
none of that none of that exists for
opioids we know the data
and we know it's getting way worse
so if you're in the 29 who think yeah
the problem got better or you're not
sure
uh you're an idiot you're an idiot all
right
do you know how hard it is to analyze
anything with data and facts and reason
let me give you just an example
of something you think would be pretty
easy to analyze right like the opioid
thing
but the opioid thing really stands alone
as being easy to analyze almost nothing
else is almost everything else is more
complicated than it looks here's an
example
uh did you know that well let me ask you
the question uh have home is the cost of
owning a home
and home prices
have they gone up
in recent decades what would you say has
the cost of owning a home
going up in recent decades yes yes of
course obviously yes right so that's
easy to analyze right I don't think
there could be anything more obvious
100 known
to all people
that the cost of housing has gone up
except that it hasn't
according to
humanprogress.org who tweets uh the time
all right so the price of U.S homes per
square foot
which would be a good way to measure
right because you don't want to compare
a big house to a small house because
obviously a big house costs more so you
want to compare it square foot to square
foot
if you do that the cost of U.S homes
stayed about the same from 1980 to 2020.
would you have known that
this seems to me like the most obvious
fact that house prices went up like a
lot
but no because the other the other
factor is that the the average size of a
household decreased quite a bit
so although you've got two things
happening that the size of the house
probably got bigger
but also there are fewer people in it
so if you were to measure this correctly
the way an economist would
not not the incorrect way you do by
reading the newspaper but like an
economist you actually are measuring
Apples to Apples you would say what's it
cost for one person
for one square foot of home now and in
the past
about the same
about the same
did you see that coming
um
the average person now has 55 percent
more living space
so so as soon as you get an Apples to
Apples
it just disappears
now this is like just about every other
economic analysis
it's also just about every political
analysis
that there's not just one way to do it
and that the people who know how to do
it correctly are so rare
that I'd never even heard this until
this Tweet now of course
what happens to the next person who
tries to study this would they come up
with the same answer
probably not
because two different people are still
going to analyze it differently so
anytime you're believing that you you
really have a grasp on things any big
Topic in the world because you
understand the economics of it
you don't
you don't
what about the national debt
you know the national debt is bad and
all the money that's being pumped in
that's going to cause inflation because
it's just obvious right everybody knows
it there's no way it can't happen
except that
maybe it won't
oh YouTube Just disconnected
it's trying to reconnect
interesting let's see if it works
so
um my live stream I know it's not my
Wi-Fi because it's working perfectly on
locals but uh YouTube just uh just
the bed
so it looks like YouTube's completely
down
huh or at least it is for me well one
moment
I got you on YouTube
can you see it right now is there
anybody who can go to YouTube and see me
right now
um
it's buffering it's down some of you say
you can see me nope okay I was waiting
for the no
Let's uh let's kill YouTube and see if
we can
let's fire back up
um
so oh it looks like I can't even kill
the stream so there's some technical
difficulty over at YouTube well
oh well
all right give me a moment let me see if
I can reconnect here
uh it looks yeah it looks like YouTube's
just
basically just it's got covered
I think YouTube has coveted
well everything's working over here so
let's just do it over here
um so anyway that my point was every
time you think you understand the
economics of something or even the risk
of something you probably don't and and
when I say probably 95 chance
so imagine going through life thinking
that the things you're sure about
you're also 95 chance that you're really
wrong like way wrong
um
all right
so moving on here
um I've noticed that I never get accused
of things that I've actually done I'm
going to tie this back to something in a
moment
um so here's a tweet from some random Mr
Ballistic on Twitter today was talking
about me you know replying to me and he
says says the man who doesn't need or
seemingly desire to leave his home
so here's somebody who's blaming me or
accusing me of uh not having a desire to
to leave my home because I'm so afraid
of the coronavirus what it what is the
truth
does that track
would many of you agree that I haven't
left my home much
well here's the fact I've traveled more
miles on Earth this year
than any other year of my life
this is the year I've traveled the most
in terms of miles
of any time in my life
now I went to Bora Bora I went to Greece
through Germany I've never had two
International trips in the same year
this is by far the most I've ever
traveled but what do I get accused of
being a Hermit and being afraid to go
outside
I swear to God
all of the things people accuse me of
are things that don't happen
in in my personal life my professional
life it's just consistent
so I don't know how much this happens to
other people but it's my my personal
being of existence Adam dopamine alerted
me to this story
apparently there's a startup well funded
with people like Bezos and gates are
behind some of the funding
called form energy and they've they've
made they figured out how to make
batteries out of iron
now why why is this important well two
reasons number one their iron is
plentiful so you don't have to get your
rare earth materials that's a big deal
but although iron is too heavy to use as
a battery in a device or a car it might
be exactly what you need
for your your power grid so in other
words you could put a bunch of
iron-based
batteries in your grid and then suddenly
your your windmills and your solar power
make sense
because you would have an inexpensive
easily reproducible way to store the
energy until it's dark and the wind
isn't blowing
sorry
that could change everything
could change everything
me let me just delete the YouTube
thing and see if I can restart it
looks like YouTube is just down the app
isn't even starting oh well
um somebody says iron rusts well yeah
but maybe they have some way to work
that I mean I'm not sure that that makes
a difference in this in this application
um
all right so that this is a small piece
of news because it's just one startup
but could easily change the planet this
could have implications for really just
everything you know our entire power
grid energy the cost of energy you know
the the competitiveness of countries
pollution climate change
politics
I mean this is the kind this is the kind
of technology that could just change
politics
like change everything it's just one
little startup trying to do this thing
but the implications are vast
let me ask you this what is the pandemic
plan
what what is Joe Biden's plan
for getting us past the pandemic because
I don't know it do you
because what it looks like we're doing
doesn't have any chance of doing that
because we can't really get everybody
vaccinated we can't really get 90
vaccinated you can try you could try to
force them but it's the most heavily
armed country in the world and a lot of
people don't want to get vaccinated from
a practical perspective
I don't think we can get there I don't
think persuasion will be fast enough and
strong enough
to get to whatever Joe Biden thinks is
the vaccination number so if that's the
strategy if that's the only plan
is to get to 90 vaccination or something
near it
we don't have a plan do we because
that's
feels impossible
now I don't know how much you know
pressure he can put on people to get
vaccinated
um but I don't think this could be that
much
so it seems to me that the default plan
you know the plan that's the thing
that's going to happen whether you like
it or not
is that everybody has to get infected
including the vaccinators
so since we know that P being vaccinated
doesn't stop you from getting infected
entirely
and we know that you're not going to get
that sick if you get if you're
vaccinated in all likelihood
isn't that the best thing
it isn't the real plan
to get as many people as possible both
vaccinated and infected you gotta have
both
if you have them vaccinated and not
infected
they'll just get infected later
right so it seems to me that the only
plan here is to get everybody infected
and as many as possible vaccinated to
reduce the load on the Health Care
system
so if the only reason that anybody's
getting vaccinated in terms of the
system not in terms of the individual
but in terms of the larger plan
if the only reason to get vaccinated is
to reduce the load on the Health Care
system
maybe that's good enough I don't know
now for me the pandemic is over except
for the bad political implications of
having to wear a mask and stuff but I
I'm not worried about anything in the
pandemic I'm I'm not worried at all
about getting the virus
because the my chance of having a
problem with it just so small you know
having been vaccinated
all right here's a question you know I
got mocked uh uh was a little over a
year ago when I said that Republicans
would be hunted if Biden won
what is happening to Tucker Carlson
is in my imagination or is he literally
maybe this is figuratively being hunted
their their hashtags today about you
know trying to get Tucker there have
been at least two viral videos of
individuals with phones accosting him in
public once at a fishing hole and once
at the tackle store or something might
even been the same day I don't know but
if you look at how the media is going
after him how individuals are going
after him in public
and the hashtags Etc
I feel like he's being hunted
now there's a rupar video and I use this
literally in this case you all know what
a rupar video isn't right this
individual named rupar who has uh has
been accused of showing video clips that
are out in context
now there's he's showing another video
of Tucker accusing fauci of creating the
covet
now if you show that without context
sounds a little crazy
but if you show it with the context that
the accusation is that fauci was by
behind some funding that went to a gain
of function that may have not been
directly related to this covid but maybe
somehow in the big soup of things
there's some kind of connection
um locals is working fine as far as I
can tell
uh
yeah
yeah rupar believes that uh
as a lot of people did that uh that
Trump suggested drinking bleach
which never happened of course
all right so here's my question
um on this is Tucker is Tucker Carlson
being hunted
do you think that that works
all right
let's talk about Donna Brazil
who famously fell for the fine people
hoax or at least pushed it and
um now she's become some kind of a
horrible
Force for evil
um let me tell you what she said
recently
if I can
um
damn it oh here it is uh Donna Brazil
said in a tweet we are facing a
radically new threat in the kinds of
forces that combine to attack our
government on January 6. the future of
our democracy is on the line
this assault was an attempt to overthrow
the US government
now here's the thing
we know it wasn't an attempt to
overthrow the US government
because if you want to overthrow a
government you need to bring you know
tanks and atomic bombs and you have to
have some plan or at least have a heavy
weapons or something
so it could not be more obvious
that there was no plan to take and hold
the country with a bunch of people with
you know flags and selfies and you know
some bear spray and clubs right that
that wasn't the plan certainly not for
most of the people there now I'm not
saying that some people there weren't
crazy and thought it would they would
open through the country but not in any
any meaningful way was that ever a risk
so when
people like Donna Brazil Who by the way
I've been a big fan of you know I like
her on TV I think she's great
um in terms of personality and stuff
um
but you know maybe I woke up cranky but
when I see her spreading the big lie you
know the Insurrection big lie
um
and all of us deplore the violence I've
never heard anybody say otherwise right
we're all good people we deplore all the
violence that happened on January 6th
but calling it an insurrection
is an attempt to demonize Trump
supporters
and
um
I don't think you can I don't think we
can be soft about how we feel about that
so let me just say Donna Brazil is a
huge piece of
and I liked her before but when you when
you tell this big a lie you know the big
lie that January 6 was an insurrection
you are going directly against the
well-being the the health and the safety
of the public
you are putting the health and safety of
the public at risk far more than
somebody not getting vaccinated for
example I mean this is directly calling
for a civil war basically I mean
indirectly I guess but it has that
effect and so Donna Brazil has just
become a Force for evil
push at the you know the fine people
hoax pushes this hoax
and I don't think you can this is not a
difference of opinion right she's not
giving you her well the Democrats like
some socialism it's not about that this
is a person who is a huge piece
of
just a horrible person just pure evil
and gets to be on TV
saying something that you would expect
Hitler to say
now I'm very reserved or at least I try
to be
when making a Hitler analogy
but if you're literally demonizing a
group of people with words that would
put them in jail if you believed them
you know if you believe this it was an
erection interaction if you believe it's
an erection if you believe it's an
insurrection
let's try that then uh then you would
also believe those people should be
jailed or I don't know executed right so
this is just
the most completely corrupt evil
take I've ever seen I mean really
daughter Brazil you should be ashamed to
yourself
just ashamed to be part of this just
ashamed I mean I don't know how you
sleep with yourself
anyway
um so I'm putting a little uh
little push back there
the worst take on the pandemic that I
see is I call this the most low value
take on the pandemic as people are
pretending to act confused
about why the tactics have changed when
the data changed
stop being confused about that when the
data changes
pretty typical for the strategy to
change too
so what do we know now that we didn't
know in the beginning of the pandemic
well all kinds of stuff right the data's
changed so if you see the tax exchange
um there's a reason for it might be a
bad reason like the new mask mandates
are based on data
that's changing
I don't agree with the Band-Aids but at
least you have to recognize that there's
some data that's different I mean
you know
that has to be noted all right so the
CDC says you should still get a covid
vaccine even if you've already had covet
now I'm no medical expert
but I can tell a gigantic pile of
pretty easily let me give you another
example
I'm not a doctor
so no medical expertise here whatsoever
but if I came across uh a body that the
head was severed from the Torso
could I without any medical trading at
all determined that the person was
deceased or would that be going too far
would I be going into the medical field
like whoa Scott
I don't think you're a doctor just
because the head is not connected to the
Torso don't be jumping to your Layman
conclusions that this person's dead you
need 16 years of medical training
to make a determination like that
that's why people are telling me
people keep telling me that I'm not an
expert so therefore I can't identify a
two mile high pile of
well you're no expert but I'm looking at
a two mile high polish yet
am I wrong about that I mean I don't
know everything about the field but this
little one thing I know because I'm
looking at it gigantic pile of
and what do people say Scott you're no
expert
you're no expert
so here's what I know
and the CDC went on and said experts
don't know how long you're protected
from covid after you recover
now that's true
but our experience is that immunity is
long lasting from everything else and we
have no data to suggest that natural
immunity won't be the best kind
probably it probably is I mean based on
what we know probably is the best kind
but
the CDC without new data
is saying that you should get vaccinated
let me tell you what they should say if
they wanted to have any credibility
all right CDC has lost their credibility
it's just gone it's not my fault I'm
just observing it you can see it
yourself I hate it because we need them
to be credible but this ain't it all
right this ain't it now even if they're
right
and it would be unusual that if they
were right about this specific thing
even if they're right that natural
immunity this is the one time it doesn't
work you know we found the one novel
virus where natural immunity is
different than all the other things
maybe
but it's unlikely and there's no data to
suggest it
so how about this if they wanted to be
um
if they wanted to be completely credible
maybe they should say you don't need a
vaccination if you have immunity
but we're going to keep tracking that
and if we see that people in general are
losing their immunity we're going to
circle back to that and tell you to get
a vaccination too
now I get it that it would be faster
just to vaccinate everybody even if
they're infected just in case but you're
asking them to put a drug in their body
for a thing for which there is no
indication that they need the drug
there might be I mean later there might
be an indication right as their immunity
wanes Maybe
but then you do it you don't do it
because it might happen
you know you don't you don't get your
you don't get a triple bypass because
you might have a problem
I mean you'd have to actually identify
the problem before you did the operation
so the CDC is just totally on
this I mean they're just totally
up right if you're trying to preserve
your credibility and you really need to
if you're the CDC because you can't do
anything without credibility right
you're you're useless
they gotta you gotta try a little bit to
be credible try just a little bit to be
freaking credible and this isn't it this
is just a pathetic failure it's just
pathetic really
all right here's an idea I was just
acquainted with today
um thank you Raul uh the 14th Amendment
did you know what the 14th Amendment
says it says that can be used to borrow
people from office
uh if Congress basically says that they
were involved in an insurrection
what did you know that
like I I just learned this today
that apparently the 14th amendment
allows Congress and Congress alone not
the courts
but Congress alone
to say that an Insurrection has happened
you know they can brand it an
Insurrection and then they can identify
people that they say are part of it
with no legal recourse
and if they have enough votes they can
just say oh you were in an Insurrection
that you can never run for office
targeted at Trump but of course any
Trump allies who were you know complicit
so
it looks to me
ironically like Pelosi might be using
the 14th Amendment
to Stage what
an insurrection
if if this actually happened if Pelosi
tried to use the 14th Amendment to let's
say ban Trump or any of his allies from
running for uh for for office or even
remove somebody from office if she tried
to do that
I would call that an insurrection
because it would be an attempt to
overthrow the will of the people the
voted you know the people that they want
to vote in and it would be using an
um an illegitimate means
because you can call anything an
Insurrection and this definitely wasn't
one January 6. so if you were to push
this argument to its conclusion and
actually you know ban Trump I would call
that an insurrection
how would you not
it would be somebody trying to change
the government without the without the
voting process now of course they would
be using an existing constitutional
process but illegitimately
if you illegitimately use the
Constitution to change the nature of the
government isn't that that's an
Insurrection right
so what would happen if
the Democrats pushed this line as far as
they could and then the Republicans
ended up winning a sweeping majority in
both houses and later the president see
couldn't the Republicans use the same
thing to get rid of anybody who was in
favor of using this to get rid of
somebody else I mean how far does this
go can you just grab the gun and turn it
around I don't know well now Congress is
going to be uh requiring or already as
requiring masks
or members of Congress and I guess uh uh
Lauren bobert
um yeah Lauren bobert already tossed The
Mask back in the face of some
um some staffer now I don't know if that
literally happened but we're speaking
figuratively through the mask back at
her
um
and here so here's the question will
there be any real
leaders
is there anybody in congress who's just
going to say no I'll I'll take the
penalty I'm not going to wear a mask
I'll come to I'll come to work politely
every day
and and have authorities take me out and
find me or whatever is anybody going to
do that because you know it's not going
to be very safe if only one or two
people do it
you know you need sort of all the
Republicans to do it could the
Republicans just get on a bus and drive
to Texas so there's no Quorum so the
infrastructure Bill can't be voted on is
that a thing can they do that I mean
just like the Texas Democrats left the
state so there would be no Quorum and
they couldn't have a vote on Election
stuff
um
could the Republicans just
hypothetically
say we're just going to jump on a bus
and get out of town until the mass
requirement goes away
I don't know
so
I tend to like Lauren bobert just
because she's got Bert in the last part
of her name so it's sort of the Dilbert
dogbert bobert situation so so I like
her for that I don't know about any of
our other policies but I like her last
name
[Music]
um
so I guess the Capitol Police have been
directed to arrest staff and visitors at
Congress uh to comply with the mass
mandates
and
but for members the people are actually
members of of Congress they advised not
arresting
but quote reporting members to SS SAA
for their failure to comply
 that
 that
they're saying directly they're going to
apply the law
differently
is that what this is taught me yeah
where's where's your equal treatment
right that you either arrest every
 person or you don't arrest
anybody you Nancy Pelosi
this is not cool
you've got to arrest them all or don't
arrest any of them just period we can't
stand for that you know this is the
 United States you treat them all
the same or you
all right you got to pay for that
and you're doing it right in front of us
don't do it right in front of us
all right
piece of
all right uh how many of you have seen
uh Dr Robert Malone the inventor of at
least or co-inventor I don't know he's
listed as an inventor of the MRNA
vaccine Technologies and these uh
vaccinologists I think so about the the
highest level of expert you could get
now I saw him on uh bannon's uh podcast
and
then I saw a title this is fake news by
the way so the this section is fake news
so the fake news is that there was a
tweet going around and there was a video
on Rumble and it was titled uh as if Dr
Robert Malone had said this it was
titled the vaccine causes the virus to
be more dangerous
how many of you believe that Dr Robert
Malone is telling the world that the
vaccine causes the virus to be more
dangerous real news or fake news
he did not right it's fake news and he
said so himself so he tweeted that this
was fake news here's what he did say and
I'm going to remove all the smart Parts
it's like so I'm going to remove all the
scientific talk I'm going to give it
give it to you in a dumb person
talk
uh there is exactly one study
that shows an indication
that you should check the blood of a
number of people
to make sure it's not making things
worse
right so there's one study that he
hasn't looked at you know personally
he's just heard about read about it that
has a suggestion
that there's an indication
in a very unreliable way something about
you know virus in the nose or something
and if you don't test it in the blood
you can't know for sure if what you're
finding in the nose in one study that he
hasn't looked at
if the one study is sort of a sort of a
flag that you should check further
that's all he said there's a flag here
that you need to check further because
if it's the worst case scenario you
would find it in the blood and you could
do that it's a very it's a very
practical thing to do it's expensive and
hard but it's practical you can do it
so
um
yes thank you the blood titers
t-i-t-e-r so there's nose titers and
blood tighters and I don't know what the
titers are but if they're not tight
enough you gotta tighten your tighters
see practically an expert
all right
yeah
um
so
just be aware that there is at least one
very qualified person who says maybe we
got a gigantic problem on our hands
but that's not confirmed it's not even
close to confirmed it's just a really
smart person who's smelling it early and
and telling us let's check this you got
to check this so just think of this in
terms of something that might be a
problem that you need to check if you
said to me Scott what is the track
record of experts saying something might
be a problem
even very qualified people something
might be a problem
but we better check it how often
do you check it and you find indeed it
is the worst case scenario
well I don't know I'm how would you know
but
yeah I'm saying in the in the comments
somebody says one in ten that feels
right right I I don't know that that's
right but if you ask me after a lifetime
of just existing in the world and sort
of you know breathing these situations
one chance and ten he's right but
remember
if there's a one in ten chances right
you gotta check the blood
because if he's right it's the worst
case scenario it's like really really
bad
so I mean Dr Malone I think is doing a
valuable Public Service uh and I I honor
him for doing that but even he says he
can't be sure so don't go further than
he's saying all right
that is some of the most interesting
thing that's happening today let's see
if I missed anything in my poorly
delivered notes
I think I got it all
that means it's time to do something
else so thank you for watching
um I don't know what happened to YouTube
but at least we've got this here I did
open the subscription
um
gate so that everybody can see this
particular video but not necessarily
other things that are on locals beyond
the paywall
all right and that
that's what I have for today
now let me ask you this I know you hate
the mask
content
but it's somewhat unavoidable wouldn't
you say
isn't it pretty unavoidable because
really we're talking about the the legal
part we're talking about the the logic
of it the science
Etc yeah now like I said
um yeah I'm an anti-master or the
vaccinated even though I know the Delta
variant and even though I know I could
get it but at this point I want it
is that irrational is it irrational for
me to say that being fully vaccinated
with the moderna vaccination is it
irrational for me to say that I want to
catch the virus because the sooner the
better
there there's nobody has a plan for me
not to get it
is that fair to say is it fair to say
nobody has a plan there's nothing being
implemented now that could stop me from
getting it
so let's just get it over with I'm
vaccinated my vaccination rate is at the
strongest point right now because it's
fairly Fresh So if I'm going to get the
if I'm going to get the virus
I kind of want to now
am I wrong
because I'm gonna get it I don't want to
get it when my vaccination has worn off
do I you know the worst time to get it
would be right before you got a booster
shot and I don't even know if they've
been doing it people are going to need
that
but
you know I I've heard I don't know if
this has confirmed that but they used to
have chickenpox parties where the kids
with chickenpox would all hang out
together so they could just freaking get
the chickenpox and get it over with
and I feel like at least for the
vaccinated the recently vaccinated the
people whose vaccinations are fresh
I feel like I should be swimming in
covet right now for my health
for my long-term benefit I I should be
swimming in covet so I should take my
mask off
shouldn't I well now that I'd be more
spready so I guess that there's two ways
to look at that
all right
um
I I think all this stuff is kind of
interesting especially in the
psychological part of it but if uh if
the mask content it just becomes
impossible to handle anymore I'll back
off it
all right that's all for now talk to you
tomorrow
