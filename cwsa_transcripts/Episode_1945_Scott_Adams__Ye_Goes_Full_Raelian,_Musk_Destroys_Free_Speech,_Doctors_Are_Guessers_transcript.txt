buddy and welcome to the highlight of
civilization
and civilization is getting pretty wonky
today we're going to have a good time
talking about all the craziness but if
you would like to take this experience
up to
stratospheric levels
and I know you would that's the kind of
people you are all you need is a copper
mug or a glass a tanker jealous of style
not canteen Joker or flask a vessel of
any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's a dopamine the end of the
day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous sip
it happens now go
that'll put you all on the same page
well of course we're going to talk about
yay
uh but before we do that let's talk
about some interesting good news number
one
scientists have used Quantum computing
to make a coating for glass
that will make it maybe up to 30 percent
more
more uh what do you call it
insulating
so it will reduce your heating and
cooling by maybe 30 percent or at least
the window part will be 30 more
efficient now
they did that because they had Quantum
computing which I didn't know was
commercialized yet but apparently it was
now imagine what will happen when the
singularity comes
now the singularity is when computers
are so smart that they can program
themselves and become smarter and
smarter on their own
Quantum Computing is still just a fast
computer that's still just a human
telling a computer what to do it just
doesn't fast
I don't think we have any risk
whatsoever from climate change
like none
because because this is just a trivial
example and this was before the
singularity this is when we just have
really fast computers and it already
made glass 30 better do you know what
part of your house
is a big risk for insulation it's all
the windows you know doors a little bit
but it's mostly Windows right
so this is like one little tweak
just one little tweak that has this
enormous implication for for energy
usage across the world
so just a little bit of good news we'll
see if that gets commercialized
you know I don't like to laugh at the
hardships of other people
do we agree that's not the kind of
people we are
we do not take cheap shots at people who
had a bad day
well we don't do that but fortunately
the ex-executive producer for the Modern
Family TV show Danny Zucker does not
have this limitation
and while we find it very unseemly in
fact it's below us it's below us to
insult people who are having a bad day
for reasons not their fault
and so
thank goodness Danny Zucker is here to
do it for us because we're not that kind
of people but apparently Chris saliza
got fired from CNN do you know Chris
Alyssa he writes a lot of opinion pieces
and they have they have a certain vibe
to him
here's what Danny Zucker said about it
on a tweet
quote how firing Christopher salsa may
actually help Chris salaza uttered a
stunned Chris Alyssa to himself over and
over again as he approached his parking
space one last time
I I have reopened that tweet
now at least five times just to laugh at
again it's so well written you know
Danny zucker's executive producer of
Modern Family which is in my opinion the
best written show of all time
so he's you know he's a key person in
the best reading show of all time so
it's not a not an accident that he knew
how to write a funny tweet
but thank goodness we don't have to be
mean to crystalliza because Danny did it
for us
um
so have you ever spent five minutes on
Twitter and looked at any doctor's
opinions on vaccinations
and have you noticed a horrifying
pattern
that you can find a fully qualified
working doctor
who says oh you better get those
vaccinations because
you know it's better for you but you can
find other qualified doctors who say no
no do not get vaccinations is clearly
bad for you and then you can find other
qualified doctors and say whoa wait a
minute it might not be so good for you
if you're below a certain age but it's
probably good for you if you're above a
certain age now here's my question
whose job is it just stay up to date
with medical science whose job is that
is it your job
is it your job no no is it my job my job
is
now is it the doctor's job to stay up to
date on studies
yes
now can we conclude with no with no
doubt whatsoever that doctors cannot do
that
have we proven
that a basic function of the doctor
profession is to say up to date
and they're staying up to date is
something that they can't do and by
definition they're not doing it because
we can't tell which one's got it right
and which ones got it wrong can we
if if I look at two doctors and they
have two different opinions opposite
how do I judge which one is right
I don't have those skills
so even if some of the doctors are right
and presumably some are because they're
all over the place how could you
possibly tell which ones are right
see the problem
it's the same problem with the financial
industry
there are ten thousand stocks ish that
you could choose
but there are probably a hundred
thousand financial advisors
what's harder picking a good stock or
picking the right financial advisor
it's actually easier without the
financial advisor because they just add
another thing that could go wrong and
they charge you for it right
now I was having this conversation on
Twitter just before I came on here about
doctors and a guy with a PhD in
nutrition
argued Scott Scott you can't expect the
doctors to know how to read and new
research
to which I agree because that's my
entire point my point is if doctors were
qualified to look at research they would
largely have the same opinion wouldn't
they they're looking at the same stuff
so obviously they're not qualified
because otherwise most of them would
have the same opinion
right so who is qualified
well according to this PhD
there are people who are qualified to
look at the science and then they can
tell the doctors
what to believe do you think such a
group exists yes doctors don't have to
make the decisions themselves there are
professional organizations and experts
they can look to to see to see if the
study was done well
do you believe that there is such a
thing
as experts not doctors necessarily but
experts who can look at advice at
research and tell if it's good or not
and then inform the doctors do such
people exist no of course not of course
not because if they existed the doctors
would all have the same opinion or
largely because they would simply refer
to those experts those experts being
experts would be all on the same page
because that's what they do right but we
don't see that we don't see the experts
agree we don't see the doctors agreeing
so how in the actual
are you as a patient supposed to decide
how the actual
seriously
anybody who tells you that you've made a
good decision or made a bad decision
that's just nuts
the only thing we know is that we don't
know
that's the only thing I know for sure is
I don't know if you believe you know
why do you know when the experts who do
this for a living can't tell I mean
collectively they don't have a the same
opinion nobody knows anything
now why can't the experts who are
literally experts at knowing whether a
study is well designed why can't they do
it
why can't you depend on them well number
one experts always disagree so it
wouldn't matter what the topic is you're
going to get experts disagree that's
normal number two who do these experts
work for yeah you beat me to it the
money can you trust an expert
who probably needs to get money from the
Pharma industry one way or the other no
of course not that's the least credible
source of all of all sources
uh so you can't trust them because of
money
then but how about their expertise
suppose you found an expert who actually
had expertise and did not have any money
interests could you trust that
no no
because they don't really know what's
going on with the study they know what
the people who did the study told them
that's it they only know what the people
who did this study told them but if the
people who did this study cheated
nobody tells them so how are they going
to make a decision without information
so anyway we could argue all day about
what what is or was is not dangerous but
you should know that nobody knows
right now don't confuse this with the
fact that there's some people say yes
and some people say no so one of them is
right
do we agree with that it's not like
there's no right answer
somebody's right
but how would you know it's unknowable
all right
we'll get to yay
um
so the Wall Street Journal says that
Twitter is offering some kind of a deal
to advertisers to get them back
so they'll get some kind of a huge I
think they get if they buy a little
advertisement they get a bunch of free
advertisement for free
do you know why this might not work
so in theory
if follow the money works
and the best advertising deal is on
Twitter
then follow the money right
because it's just pure money and if you
can get three times the ad value on
Twitter that you could get somewhere
else then the at the ad the ad people
will say oh we better put it on Twitter
right
because you get more bang for the buck
right so that should work right
do you know why it won't work
let's see if anybody knows why it won't
work
because it definitely won't work
because advertising isn't real
it's never been real
did you know that
advertising is just something the
advertising the Ad Agency sells to a
company so they could be doing something
it doesn't sell more product
right now the exception would be
if you're like PG e and you're like so
massively advertising that you're just
like brainwashing people another
exception would be if you didn't know a
product existed
so if you're trying to sell an Apple
Watch and there had never been an Apple
Watch you got to advertise right but if
you're just a brand
you're Chevron or your BP or something
do you think they're advertising sells
them more product
no no
so the so uh Musk
um musk has created a situation which is
a little bit sketchy because if the
advertising if it becomes clear the
advertising doesn't follow the money
it might be because getting three times
as much advertising won't sell you any
more products
and then the people who are paying for
the advertiser who say
I feel like you told me you were going
to get three times as many ads for the
same money but my sales look exactly the
same
let's see the trouble is
that it reveals a little too much about
the weakness of advertising as as a
useful thing
now does
um Michael Lindell sell
stuff on Fox yes
that would be a case of advertising
working for sure because that's
something you didn't know existed right
and I do suppose you get some like brand
preference over time maybe you start
liking your Chevron gas more than other
gas or something so a little bit but for
most of your generic stuff
advertising makes no difference do you
know how I know that
ask me how I know advertising makes no
difference
because I've been doing it for 30 years
I get talked into it all the time so you
know like I'm so stupid I'll just always
be talked into it when I own two
restaurants we tried every form of
advertising radio print you know special
events
no impact
none just zero impact from advertising
every form in any budget didn't matter
and that's actually that's actually
pretty common
do you think Apple needs to advertise
well only if they have a new thing
otherwise you go to buy a phone and what
are you going to do you already know
it's two choices
basically
um yeah Tesla doesn't advertise oh yeah
Tesla doesn't advertise
well see that's the other weakness with
musk's model
he bought a company to sell the thing
that he would never buy
he's the most famous
non-consumer of the thing he's selling
that's a little awkward I hadn't never
really put that together until just now
all right well as you no doubt know yay
appeared on Alex Jones yesterday
and he said a few things he said a few
things
and everybody has a few things to say
about the few things he said and of
course everybody got it wrong and that's
why you waited for me
you waited for me to sort this out
because do you know what
everybody's getting this wrong
everybody got this wrong I think
now you would not be surprised here I
have a contrarian opinion
I don't know that I'm right
it's a little too soon to know that but
I'm going to put something new out there
something you won't see elsewhere
all right now I'll work into it slowly
all right we're gonna we're gonna
gradually ease you into it but I'd like
to start the conversation
with this notice
I I think Hitler was a bad guy
thoroughly
uh his little mustache
 the things he did when on office
 his clothing his eyelashes
 his dog
 his chair
 his car
and the comb they used for his little
weird haircut
 everything about him
thoroughly him everything
as somebody pointed out earlier
there is only one redeeming thing about
Hitler
and I hesitate to mention it
but of all the people who say they hey
Hiller
there's only one person to kill them
and that was Hillary
so
I don't want to go full Kanye or yay
but he had that one redeeming
things
although I heard a comedian the other
day I wish I could give credit because
it's a great joke
and he said that Hitler went through six
years of war
and he survived that okay
but he married Ava Braun in the bunker
and after one day of marriage he blew
his brains out
all right
you have to do me a favor
it's totally uh it's totally
inappropriate that I can't name the
comedian who has that joke so if one of
you know because it was on social media
it was going around if you know who said
that could you please give him Credit in
the in the comments because you you
shouldn't be able to quote somebody who
said something that funny without
mentioning their name that's just wrong
was it Dana Gould
that might be right was it Dana gold
I think it might have been I think
you're right
so let's give him credit amen he's very
funny if it wasn't him he gets some
credit anyway all right
so yay appears on Alex Jones and he's
wearing a ski mask
so so he's yeah visually he's impossible
to look away because not just a ski mask
but like a sock over his head or
something so his entire face is covered
not even his eyes are out now I don't
know why but it certainly gets your
attention
now of course the big takeaway was that
he
he decided he'd say some good things
about Hillary
and even Alice Jones even Alex Jones was
shocked
the look on Alex Jones's face he's like
oh laughs
now that was I was awesome entertainment
all right now
so yay was said he actually uh I think
he said he actually liked Hitler
you know not not for the bad things but
he had some good qualities according to
yate like he built highways and invented
a microphone
so you know I was pretty anti-hitler
until I heard they invented the
microphone
he invented the microphone I think he
invented roads
because there hadn't many highways until
Hitler
and then then yay said something about
questioning the Holocaust
[Laughter]
so
so that went well
and then
uh
now yay was explaining that the reason
he was
he was embracing the anti-semite label
as he was trying to do what uh the black
the citizens of this country had done by
uh appropriating the n-word in other
words instead of letting words hurt him
you know like being called an
anti-semite so instead of letting words
hurt him he's gonna embrace it and own
it and amplify it until the words can't
hurt him anymore or anybody else I guess
now I'm not so sure that's the best
strategy
but
we're going to talk a little bit more
and I'll give you my opinion about the
whole thing right so you have to hear
the details if you haven't heard all the
details so yeah so he's
now I don't know if he's denying that
the Holocaust existed in any form
or if he had some you know nuanced but
uh let's say unwise things to say about
the details of it I don't know so well
who knows what he had to say about that
uh
then Elon Musk suspend him from Twitter
uh not because he not because yay
printed a very uh direct derogatory
picture of Elon Musk in a bathing suit
apparently but
and Elon had to clarify that that wasn't
the reason that he banned him or
suspended him but rather it was for
inciting violence and the tweet that
incited the violence was
um
a logo that apparently yay seems to be
embracing
that appears to be the Star of David and
then on the interior part is modified to
look like a swastika
it's a swastika surrounded by the Star
of David
and that so that was hate speech and or
no it was inciting violence and so Elon
Musk announced that he had to suspend
Kanye for that
all right
so that's one movie
yeah do you know what's happening in the
other movies
different stuff a completely different
stuff
now if you didn't know the uh the logo
that yay was using
that looks like the star David with a
swastik in it has been the raelian logo
for years like decades I guess the
raelians are a group who believe in
space aliens and UFOs I guess and some
other stuff
uh but I don't think they're too
involved with anything about Nazi or
anything anti-semitic are they
I'm not I don't think they have any
anti-semitic things I think they just
have a logo that's unfortunately
provocative
but correct me on that
now here's the thing
do you think that yay knew
that this logo not only already existed
but it was on it was already on Twitter
apparently the raelians have been on
Twitter since 2017. and I assume their
logos been there I didn't see it but I
assume it has been now
let me tell you what I see right
everybody's got a take on this and we're
all guessing
so anybody's opinion about what's going
on in EA's head is ridiculous wouldn't
you agree
wouldn't you agree it's sort of
ridiculous to speculate what's in his
head because whatever's in there makes
you a yay
and whatever's in your head made you you
and if you could know what was in his
head
well you would have been the
the richest black man in America for a
little while too
Maybe
so we don't know what he's thinking but
here's here's what I would dismiss as
the least likely explanation
the least likely explanation is that
it's only Mental Health
it's just it's just Mental Health
I think that's the least likely
but definitely it's involved
would you all agree that his mental
health is part of the story but we don't
know what percentage would you agree
with that
it looks like it could be a lot
but we don't know it's hard to know
because here's the other possibility
the other possibility is that he's just
being yay
and that he's picking intentionally the
single most provocative thing he could
do on social media
because that's the test
that's the test
it's the ultimate test of free speech
can he say his opinion
on on social media
well if his opinion incited incited
violence would you agree that that would
be inappropriate and that you should
kick somebody off for inciting violence
how many of you would agree that if it's
very clear let's say he said let's all
get together and pick up guns and go
attack some other group
you would kick him off of social media
for that right if it's clear
so in my in my hypothetical everybody
would say oh that's clear nobody would
argue about it in some hypothetical
thing
so musk says okay this is clearly
inciting violence with this logo
and maybe maybe with his rhetoric as
well but mostly the logo because that's
the part that was on Twitter
and so musk and probably consulted some
other people decided that was against
Twitter's long-established rules about
inciting violence and so he kicked him
off
are you comfortable with that
you know it's the end of free speech
right
it's the end of free speech
you couldn't even pretend there's free
speech under this condition
you know why
in in the law and I'd say with terms of
service as well
there has always been a reasonable
person's standard do you know what that
means
it means that you have to make laws and
also in terms of service with the
understanding that there is such a thing
as a reasonable person now you could
argue whether such people exist but you
have to have that standard that any
reasonable person would look at this
other reasonable person and that all the
reasonable people would say yeah that's
reasonable right without getting into
all the details of all the different
things that could ever happen in the
world can we all agree that if we all
look at it and it looks reasonable we'll
we'll just treat it like it was
reasonable all right now that standard I
would say has worked for maybe hundreds
of years I'm not sure when it became you
know a legal standard in this country
but it's a long standard this worked
really well so why not keep using it
why not keep using the standard that's
worked forever
let me tell you why
do you know where that standard doesn't
work
when you're all awoke
you can't have a reasonable person's
standard when the environment is
wokeness because you know what wokeness
is not reasonable
it's not it's opinion
and so Elon musk's opinion that this
logo was inciting violence differs from
my opinion which one of us are right
my opinion is that it did not incite
violence very offensive
very offensive provocative he may have
intended that
but
did it in sight violence
well here's the problem
at a deeply conceptual level yes
right at a conceptual level yes anytime
you anytime you identify a group
and then you throw some shade at them
you're making it easier for someone else
to say Well everybody's Throwing Shade
at this group I'll bet I could slap this
person on the sidewalk and people would
cheer me because everybody's saying bad
stuff about these people watch I'll just
go up to this person and say slap them
and put it on video and everybody's
gonna laugh this will be very viral
right
so you would agree
that putting shade on any group
incites violence
so by that standard
musk is correct
because he put shade on the Jewish
community
and by definition that makes it easier
for somebody else somewhere to abuse
them because they think they've got some
cover
here's the problem
it would apply to everything
it applies to everything you would have
to take everybody off of social media do
you know how many times I've said
something that threw shade on an
identifiable group
like every day
Democrats how many times have I said how
many times have I put shade on leftists
Or democrats
I appreciate on all kinds of people
including yay
I'm putting shade on musk right now
I'm saying he made a he's got a standard
that can't work
right
Twitter is nothing but people throwing
shade on people
I'm literally calling for uh for an
armed attack on the cartels on Twitter
I'm not just inciting violence I'm
trying as hard as I can to create
violence
but I guess I'm okay why
presumably because people think that's
good violence
oh that would be the good kind of
violence
or or I have an argument for it or
something so that's okay
is it too Direct
yeah see the problem here is that as
soon as you allow that somebody can
decide what incites violence and there's
no standard for inciting violence
because everything looks like it does
you have no no free speech that is the
end of free speech
the only thing you can say on Twitter
are things that Elon Musk personally
believes will not incite violence you
trust that
it doesn't matter if it's Elon Musk it
doesn't matter who the it is
somebody else's opinion of what will
incite violence you're done with free
speech that's it but the important point
is the standard did work until recently
that the reasonable person standard was
perfectly fine until wokeness made all
speech violent
as soon as all speech is violent you
can't use that standard anymore and
that's what's Happening Here I believe
that musk is
essentially trying to guess what other
people would have thought was reasonable
right he had a guess of what other
people would think was reasonable
because he's he's doing things for
public appearance as well as his own
opinion
you think he was told to do it in a
sentence yeah I think there was so much
immediate
pushback now here's why my take on yay
is a little different than the rest
is mental illness involved probably
because yea says that himself I mean
he's not hiding it right and I think his
actions suggest a non-standard
personality
now non-standard can be good
right
you know people with mental illness make
great art
so it's not necessarily a bad thing but
here's what I'm going to add
I would not rule out the fact
that yea is trying to break the system
and he might
it like instead of he's not trying to
win the game
he's trying to throw uh throw the board
up you know what I mean
he knows he can't win the game because
he didn't make the rules
the rules are made by other people and
they're you know he doesn't have an
advantage there so if he plays the game
by his rules he loses
but yea is not the person who loses
it's not it is it's not in his nature
to not think he can succeed
so he just takes it to the next step
what is the next step next step is you
throw the whole board over
so he came into Twitter
with a raelian logo
that he might have known
was not provocative in that context or
as provocative
he may have tested the limits of musk's
free speech and broken
in my opinion he broke Elon Musk
Elon Musk up
he up and it wasn't because Elon
Musk is dumb because he's not it's not
because Elon Musk is uninformed
because he's not it's not because Elon
Musk has bad intentions
because he doesn't it's not because he
doesn't like yay
because that doesn't seem to be the case
it's because it's an impossible
situation
Elon Musk has chosen the standard that
cannot be enforced
it cannot be enforced and Yea just broke
the whole game
because he just proved it
you just proved
the free speech is gone
and that ladies and gentlemen was
exactly what he was trying to do
now that doesn't mean he wins
that doesn't mean yay becomes president
doesn't mean he goes back to his old
reputation but he had a goal and he
 did it
he did it
he did it now you can hate him that's
fine I wouldn't I wouldn't argue with
you at all you can say he's really
anti-semite and that's the whole story
okay I I think he's given you that in
other words he's he's walked into your
trap and if you'd like to Spring the
Trap I say okay but so does he
so does yay yay says spring the Trap
that's what he says he says go ahead and
spring it let's see how this plays out
but he did turn over the board and and
the rules just changed
and did you think I would be arguing
that wokeness makes the reasonable
person standard extinct
I didn't think so I didn't think I'd
wake up this morning and say that he
broke Elon Musk but he did
he did now let's be really careful here
because somebody's going to watch this
and say
it's got
um supported yay who supports Hitler so
Scott's a Nazi blah blah blah
to which I say
are we really talking about
black yay
becoming the leader of the white
supremacists
because that's what people are acting
like they're acting like the white
supremacists are going to Rally around
yea
and that's our danger because what if
everybody listens to yay all the white
supremacists and they say yay you're our
new leader
are we really talking about we want to
reduce the risk that the white
supremacists will start following a
black man
in America
I mean the whole thing has become so
ridiculous
that yay's point is really being made
he is making his point and whether you
agree with it you hate them you know I
I'm just to say it again
uh I don't approve of any level of
anti-semitism
period
but here's an interesting question
if you were to ask yea
if white people should be allowed to use
the n-word
what do you say
has anybody ever asked in that
because he's basically making the stand
that he can say whatever he wants about
the Jewish community
even if it's offensive
I mean I feel like that's what he's
trying to make the point he's trying to
make the point that nobody the Free
Speech extends to where he wants to
extend it I guess
as odious as that feels
but
if yay says no you can't use the n-word
but I can say anti-semitic things
then he's either crazy or just a
if you ask yea and he says you know what
I do think you should be able to use
that word in public
then
he has a point
You can disagree with it
you could disagree with it there's
plenty of room to disagree but it's not
crazy
if he's consistent
right so I'm only looking for
consistency I'm not saying I agree with
him I'm just saying is that crazy like
crazy would look inconsistent
but if he has a consistent point of view
where he actually just broke open the
conversation about free of speech
than what I saw
on Alex Jones
was 80 percent performance art
the good kind
the good kind
and 20 mental illness
and here's what I mean by performance
art
it's supposed to shock you
it's supposed to make you say this
couldn't possibly be art
this must be something else
it's pissed Jesus
do you remember who pissed Jesus there
was the artist who made a crucifix that
was contained in a container of urine
yeah piss Christ it was piss Christ and
everybody said no no that's that's the
worst thing in the world and other
people said
welcome to art
welcome dark
it's the worst thing in the world
sometimes
so
is is uh yay a good guy I don't know
is yea right about his uh criticisms of
the Jewish Community I doubt it
just sounds like he has problems with
individuals that he's he's generalized
that doesn't like I can't support that
um
but
but did he do a performance piece of art
that changed the conversation in a
meaningful way in a way that could be
positive
because that's you know good art makes
you angry but maybe there's something
good that comes out of it
I don't know it looked like performance
art to me
now if you say but he's also crazy I say
yeah I give you that like 20 percent
it but I think he actually moves the
needle
I don't know
but you're those who've been watching me
for a long time can you confirm that
I've always said the following thing
because this is important
I've always said
that yea is not somebody who creates art
he is someone who is Art
he lives it he lives art
every time he walks outside he is the
art right he dresses the art he talks
the art he's never not the art
there are people who are artists oh I
guess I would be one so I'm a perfect
example of an artist so to speak
who is very different from my art
like when when I'm drawing my art I'm an
artist and when I'm standing outside I'm
just ordinary guy standing outside like
I'm not an artist when I leave the house
you know what I mean
but yay he's an artist all the time
he's not the artist who was something
else on the Alex Jones Show
he just took his art
to Alex Jones
and I saw
art
and I also saw the highest level of art
I may have ever experienced
does that mean I liked it
not exactly because it was odious
right
but did I recognize it as art yes I did
in my opinion that was Art and the fact
that you hated it doesn't make it not
hard
because you didn't like piss Christ
either
his cartoon is different from artists
well that's another conversation
somewhat
so can I be very clear on this
yea is not trying to make us like him
so I don't
okay
he's not trying to get us to agree that
Hitler was a good guy
he's not trying to do that
do you think he was trying to convince
you Hitler was a good guy no
to me it looked like he he said to
himself what is the thing I'm least
um allowed to say
watch me say it and then he did it he
found the one thing that he's least
allowed to say and then he said it
he's the only free person in the country
do you know uh the old Janice Joplin
song from the 60s in which she said
Freedom's just another word for Nothing
Left to Lose
Nothing Left to Lose
that's yay
he lost his wife
his kids you know custody
his reputation
his fortune
he has nothing left to lose
he's the only free person in the country
because he's not in jail
and he can say anything he wants
anywhere
because he's willing to pay the price
and the price is Extreme and he's still
willing to pay it
I don't know
there's something horrifying about this
whole situation of course Holocaust
denial and any anti-semitic stuff is
horrible and has to be disavowed but
there's also something happening about
free speech
there's also something happening
about art
and those are very big things also at
the same time
all right
um
so we're all going to see a different
different situation there
um
I wonder what the raelians are doing
today
it's a tough day for the raelians isn't
it they just woke up today it's like
oh it's another day in my aurelian life
ah
let's see what's happening in the news
bad day for the aliens
all right
um now when we're talking about inciting
violence one of the things I'm glad
about is that we don't have a culture
in which our movies and our video games
glorify violence
isn't that lucky because if if any of
our video games or movies or TV shows if
they glorified or showed a lot of like
exciting violence and made it look
really cool to kill people
um that would be terrible
and that should be banned completely
because it incites violence doesn't it
can you argue with me that a hundred
hours of
100's low number can you argue that 10
000 hours of gaming that involves
killing people
has no impact on the person who did it
no impact at all
of course it does
now whether it does or not
whether it does or not
wouldn't you agree that reasonable
people would probably argue it does
so who gets to say who has free speech
do the video game companies get to
create their art because a video game is
art as well
do they get to create their art or Does
Elon Musk say I think that incited
violence
so you can't advertise that on Twitter
who gets to tell them that they can make
that game
I don't know looks like it incites
violence to me
um
well on another topic as you know ESG
is dying on the vine that's the the idea
that BlackRock and some other Financial
entities could grade public companies
for how well they're doing for the
environment and governance
and equity
and of course all the smart people now
from
I think everybody Bill Gates to Dilbert
have now debunked ESG as a horrible idea
because it gets between the business and
and the customers and you never want to
do that there's never a good way to do
that
now that that seems to be on its uh it's
sort of a dead man walking should be
should be dead at any moment now people
said to me Scott can you do uh Dei next
and that's the corporate programs in
which they try to Foster diversity
equity and inclusion
now I said to myself well I've been out
of the workplace so I I didn't
personally experience this I need to
read up on it
how would you like to know what are the
key elements of this diversity equity
and inclusion
well sounds pretty good to me so I'll
tell you the things that sound good
um so this is just from the Internet off
of Google searches so Dei is a policy or
practice designed to make people of
various backgrounds feel welcome and
ensure they have support to perform to
the fullest of their abilities in the
workplace
anybody have a problem with that
wouldn't you like everybody in your
workplace from various backgrounds to
feel welcome and to have the most you
have the best chance of doing a good job
and to be mentored all good right
does anybody have any problems with that
no we're all we're all on board of that
all right so I don't see any problems so
far
um
and uh the Dei team would work towards
these full-time strategies that really
you know incorporated into the processes
of the company to make sure that the
hiring retention and unbiased
recruitment happen so they've got
systems that make sure that they're
diverse and everybody feels comfortable
with the situation any problem with that
wouldn't you wouldn't you like all the
employees to feel comfortable
I would all right how about this
uh the formula policies and nullify old
ones
you know to get to their Dei initiatives
now here are the types of diversity that
they recognize see here's here's the
part where you're going to say hey
they're not including all the types of
diversity or do they or do they so here
are the ones that they list cultural
diversity of course
um racial diversity of course gender of
course physical disabilities of course
does anybody have a problem with any of
those things
being treated as special categories
well they also add this last one
diversity and interests
diversity in interests
does that cover everything else
because interests and preferences are
kind of the same right and interest and
a preference almost the same
so wouldn't this include Republicans
wouldn't Republicans be people who had
different interests
they should right it shouldn't cover it
should cover every everybody who's
different now
um
I don't know if it actually accomplishes
that but
um
all right
um and then why do some companies fail
at it so what are what are the problems
with it this is again from the internet
there are three reasons three key
reasons according to the Google search
uh failure to explicitly connect the Dei
objectives to the corporate mission
okay vision and values lack of
sustainable support blah blah blah so
sometimes it fails because it's not
being supported enough it looks like
um
and let's say
so
so what do you think should I kill it
because it sounds good to me where's the
problem
why would I kill it
because people keep asking me to kill
this but I I like I like diversity
why would I kill him don't you think it
but don't you think everybody should be
comfortable at work
somebody says it's racist what what part
of what I read
would make it racist because they're not
saying make white people uncomfortable
they're saying make everybody
comfortable who disagrees with it
no no I I think you're you're all acting
a little bit bigoted here and let me
tell you what we should do
we should embrace it and amplify it
and I'd start first at the places where
there's a big problem so I would go to
professional sports first and I'd say
the the Warriors Golden State Warriors
they're struggling this year you know
they were champions last year struggling
a little bit and I'm not positive but I
think the problem with the Golden State
Warriors is that their coach Steve Kerr
he's not rapping diversity equity and
inclusion
into his systems that are managing the
team
I don't know if you've noticed but a lot
of the people on the Warriors they seem
to have the same interests same
interests they don't seem to include
people have different
interests
so they should and I think that would
improve their performance greatly to get
those different interests in there now
the second I would go for the teachers
unions which are largely women
and I think that they need to implement
some Dei so that we could get some more
men in there and more more black
teachers and you know more more Jewish
teachers maybe yeah maybe more of
everything that's diverse we should get
them in there see if that makes a
difference and then the Biden
Administration
you know one part of Dei and I actually
one of the most important parts
is a report is measuring and Reporting
right if a company says oh we're doing
Dei but you say can you show us your
reports and they say oh we don't have
any reports are they really doing Dei no
they're not no they're not because the
reporting and the measuring are just so
vital to the whole thing that if you're
not measuring and Reporting you're not
really doing it and that's true of
management in general if you're not
measuring it you're not managing
so wouldn't you like to see the Biden
administration's report on Dei to see
how well they're doing
I'd like to see if they're doing a good
job encouraging the people with
different interests to be part of the
administration
or do you think the government is trying
to get people who have similar interests
because the government is trying to act
similarly like Democrats which would be
pretty bigoted
just because the Democrats got elected
I don't think that's a good enough
reason that they should ignore the
interests of the people who didn't get
elected
so you know if it's good enough for
businesses I think it's good enough for
teachers unions and professional sports
which is business
and certainly good enough for the
government and I would like to see all
other reports right now so that we the
public can make sure that they are
putting the proper amount of emphasis in
Dei
um
what do you think
wouldn't you like to see a lot more of
this Dei stuff a lot more
now I'd like to see a list of all the
different interests because we have a
sense of what different ethnicities look
like and what different genders look
like well it's a little confusing at the
moment but wouldn't you like to see the
list of the different interests so for
example could
could
the teachers union
do they have enough people in the
teachers union who think that
homeschooling is better
because homeschooling would be an
interest right
so the teachers union should be
represented with you know a good chunk
of people
who would prefer homeschool
over Public School
that would be an interest and shouldn't
the Democrats have uh plenty of people
who want strong border security
and lower taxes
because those are definitely interests
so what are those interests
and and if Dei is good for a business
why wouldn't it be good for a government
just because the government got elected
to pursue some interests over other
interests that's still discriminating
isn't it
because if diversity includes people
with different interests you can't just
pick one set of interests and say oh
these are the good ones will favor these
interests that's opposite of Dei so I
think we should push this D I think
everywhere
I'm I'm going to start sanctioning
myself because I don't know if you've
noticed but there's almost no diversity
on this live stream
and that's on me
that is on me
right because I try to be two people but
I'm only one
I'm only one
um I was planning to
become non-binary or something just to
just uh have a little bit more
inclusivity but I thought that was a
sort of a big sacrifice though no
all right
so you would all agree then right
more Dei
should we push this thing to the Max and
get as much of it as we can
and how about BlackRock
as a BlackRock published it's a Dei
because I know BlackRock thinks that ESG
is good and it's very sort of there's a
lot of you know Venn diagram on there so
don't you think BlackRock
should give us a report
on whether BlackRock is a bunch of uh
white guys
do you think BlackRock has a lot of
white guys working there
I don't know I'm just guessing
what do you think a bunch of white guys
and don't you think that BlackRock needs
to address that pretty quickly
I think BlackRock should be look like
the rest of the country
they're so influential and so big that
they do have an impact on the country I
think just like the government they
should not only have a Dei program and
so should Steve Kerr at the Warriors but
they should be reporting on it on a
regular basis to the public because it's
a public
it's a public interest right
we don't we don't say hey you you
companies you should do Dei because it's
good for you
that's not why we it's good for the
public so that's the public that needs
to know how you're doing so let us know
how you doing on this Dei I'll give you
a report on mine on failing
I I've got basically my whole
organization is run by a white guy
and it's starting to bug me
although that white guy does identify as
black so
okay that's a softens a little bit
um
Newt Gingrich is uh I guess on Fox News
he was giving people the bad news I've
set a version of this but news says it's
stronger so it's more provocative
and he says the Biden Administration has
been a huge success
its first term is like
gangbusters basically
I agree
I agree
for what Biden wanted to do he did get a
lot of stuff
he did so I mean it's hard it's hard to
hear but
things happened it may not be things you
like
but did the Democrats not open up the
Border yes they did
you know they did a lot of things they
said they were going to do
so you can't ignore that
Carpe
yes
um nude also reported I guess he had on
his podcast uh Dr Colin Hale
uh from the University of Houston's drug
Discovery Institute who has
we think a fentanyl vaccine
a vaccine that would negate the effects
of fentanyl so if you took fentanyl you
you wouldn't get the the high that you
hoped
now
see any problem with that
why the hell did it have to be a
vaccination
of all the things that could have been
of all the the ways you could address
the fentanyl problem
did it have to be a vaccination
really
it had to be a vaccination of all the
possible things it had to be that
I mean if you tell me that reality is
not following the path of most
entertainment
then I can't explain yay and I can't
explain this this is clearly following
the path of most entertaining
story right
really The Sentinel story turns into a
vaccination story and that's an accident
I don't think so
clearly something's going on here I
think this is scripted in some in some
ways
but here's your problem
what addict
who goes and buys fentanyl every day
because they really like that fentanyl
well addict is going to get vaccinated
zero yeah no addict is going to get
vaccinated because they want the high
they would just have to do some other
drug now maybe it would cause them to go
get heroin instead I don't know I don't
know what they do instead
but it might work
it might work for parents making their
teens get it that might work
so this does have a pretty high
potential but not for the serious adult
addicts but more for a parent telling
their team because the teens
accidentally get the Fentanyl and if you
can make the accidental fentanyl desk go
away
that's a big deal that's a really big
deal
I wouldn't I don't think it would block
all opioids because they were pretty
specific about Fentanyl
so that would still I guess I would
still give you plenty of
oh then I guess the question is would
you have painkiller
options if you went to the hospital
huh
that would be a problem right
so they'd have to find some kind of
painkiller
um
Beyond Fentanyl and even car fentanyl
would probably be
probably be affected by the vaccination
I think
unless car fentanyl is different enough
because if you have car Fentanyl
then that's all you would need for pain
relief right
but probably the vaccination affects car
sense null and Fentanyl because the only
thing I know about it is they have
similar names so I'm just guessing
there's some similarity there
yeah I don't know
did you all know that uh plastic
recycling is complete
how many of you do that
you know I knew it was a little bit of
but uh Palo Alto looked into where their
plastic goes after they recycle it and
apparently it's sold to a company who
doesn't have to tell you what they do
with it
I'm not making this up
Palo Alto
in the middle of the you know the green
estate the greatest people in the green
estate and also Palo Alto home of smart
people
you know very smart people Palo Alto
and very green and for years
they've been having a company take their
plastic away and they won't say where
because the answer is they they shifted
all the Asian countries that have low
standards and they dump it there it's
literally just being dumped in Asia
and or Africa too I guess and then it
gets into the water system and then it
kills us all
so it turns out that the worst thing
we've ever done is recycling plastic
do you know how many hours of my life
I've spent recycling plastic
all waste of time
at not just a waste of time it made
things worse because if I'd thrown it in
the landfill
I guess that at least it's in the
landfill and it's less likely to get
into the water supply
but if it goes to Laos or something it's
going to end up in the ocean
so
the whole thing was
now let me ask you
in the past few years
have we discovered that anything we
thought was real was really real
is it my imagination or is literally
everything fake
like every organization every drug
I I heard somebody else tell a version
of this story but I'll tell you my
version again if you haven't heard it in
the past in the past two months
on two occasions I've talked to doctors
of my own you know doctor group
uh and I've and they've recommended
um meds for various things and in both
cases I said this directly no I'm not
going to take those meds because I don't
believe in medical science
I said that to two different doctors
I said I'm not going to take those meds
because I don't believe in medical
science I think it's all fake
do you know what both doctors said to me
no pushback
just just absorb that no pushback
totally agreed they actually agreed now
they didn't say it directly they but the
the context was no pushback if that's
your opinion
as a doctor I don't have an argument
against it
can you believe that
actual doctors
cannot give me an argument for the meds
that are routinely prescribed
because if you actually push them on it
and I I said directly that it looks like
astrology to me it doesn't look like
there's any science backing the
recommendations and neither doctor
pushed back on that
I just think about that do you think
that would have happened five years ago
do you think five years ago I could have
said to my doctor you know I don't
believe in medical science because I
think the studies are all
here's here's how I think that would
have gone I think it would look like
this
you know there are a lot of smart people
who do these studies
ah it is not smart to ignore Medical
Science right
don't you think that conversation five
years ago would have been you idiot
you absolute
how could you be so dumb that you would
ignore the best medical science that we
have
but in 2022 I can say it directly
I believe your science is made up so I'm
not going to take those pills and they
will look you right in the eye and say
okay next topic
foreign
I mean it's just so mind-boggling
that we've reached a point where
everybody understands that everything is
a lie
all of it
everything the government says
everything a company says everything
pundits say seems to be it's just all a
lie nothing was real everything we
thought was real was all of it
yeah China Russia all of it's just all
this is a good comment even though it's
an insult to me MB says doctors know how
to deal with narcissists
I'm not going to push back against that
comment
I'll do what the doctors do I will not
push back on that comment you you may
you may accept that for what it is
that's not a bad comment
I have to give you credit for that
you might be right
all right
gotcha
all right well that is the conclusion of
my
live stream the best thing you've ever
seen today
wait till tomorrow it's gonna be even
better wow
um
so
what do you think
did I sell you on the idea that uh EA is
is performance art
some yeses some knows
now do you think none of it is
performance art you think it's all
mental illness
yeah did I sell you on the point
that incitement of violence cannot be
our standard when we're in the the woke
era
would you buy that
I got some more yeses on that again yeah
I think so now I don't know I don't know
what the standard would be because we're
sort of without a standard we're
Uncharted Territory
but I think I think uh yeah you pushed
us into Uncharted Territory
and I think that's what performance art
does
if you do it right your performance art
pushes your brain where your brain had
never been and then you have to find
your way back that's what he did
yeah he put us in Uncharted Territory
and we have to find our way back that's
art
that is art
all right
that's all for now YouTube I'm going to
talk to the locals people a little bit
more and I'll see you tomorrow
