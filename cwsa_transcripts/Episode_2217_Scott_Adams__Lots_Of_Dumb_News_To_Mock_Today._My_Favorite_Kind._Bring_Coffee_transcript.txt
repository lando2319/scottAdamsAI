dude
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and
there's never been a fighter moment that
you've ever ever experienced
um and if you'd like to take it up a
level I can use a cup of micro glass up
take your Chelsea's Diana canteen Jacob
flask at the festival of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine the end of the
day the thing makes everything better
it's called the simultaneousip
go
oh so good so good
do you know that my book
reframe your brain
hit the top 20 yesterday on Amazon the
non-fiction list
and apparently it's changing lives
everywhere
I dare you to pick any book all right
here's a challenge for you
for those who have read my book reframe
your brain
name any non-fiction book
that has created more change in you
positive change more quickly and more
easily
I believe there won't be anything close
in the entire entire history of books
that's my claim
it's because I use a different technique
I mean I'm using reframes and hypnosis
and uh
it's going to change your life anyway
enough about that I wasn't planning to
say that but
um there's a terrible development in the
mascot situation
as you know
Keith Olbermann has been my mascot for
years and by mascot I mean the troll
that is so over the top he's just kind
of funny like a mascot
but today there was an exchange on X
between Keith Olbermann and Riley Gaines
you know Riley Gaines a woman who was a
swimming champion who thinks that men
biological men should not compete
against her
as she would say
and
so Keith Olbermann
posted to her and said can you just
address the reality and move past it you
sucked at swimming that's why you lost
Riley games replied ah makes sense now
why you got fired from ESPN
all right all right
all right not bad
not bad Bradley Gaines
um but
you know to you this is just
I know to you this is just a funny story
of somebody who made a good comment on
the X platform I mean it means nothing
to you
but to me this has a little bit more
meaning
because once again a biological woman is
trying to steal my mascot
and I don't think that's right
all right that's all I had to say about
that
uh so the news says that Ukraine has
finally broken through the Russian
defensive line in one notable place and
they're expanding that hole and they're
going to drive their artillery through
and Destroy Russia
everybody believe that
so they broke through that defensive
line so everything's good now
should be no smooth sailing from now on
if I were Putin I would already be
trying to fly out of Moscow in an
exploding plane
now
I don't think you can believe anything
about this do you
but what are the odds that this story is
accurate and fully in context
on
zero none
uh what was I just hearing uh General
Flynn I saw him on a podcast
just yesterday and he said that the
first reports first intelligence reports
about everything are always wrong
you know 100 of the time the first
report of anything like this is always
wrong
fog of War
so it might be that they broke through
the line but can you be sure that that
wasn't intentional can you be sure it's
not a trap
in which the Russians are going to let
the ukrainians go through and get into
some kind of a kill box and take care of
business I don't know we don't know but
that's the point there's no news that
you can believe about Ukraine
how many of you noticed that because of
the writer's strike
the five hosts of the late night shows
minus Greg gotfeld who actually still
does his show
yeah he's not a quitter like the rest of
them so the five I guess is like Jimmy
Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon and Colbert and
uh
Oliver and uh
uh somebody else I can't remember
and
so the five of them have decided that
they will do uh I guess a nightly
podcast
because they don't have writers for
their shows
so now they're just going to do their
own thing you know just on the podcast
and what did we learn on their first
attempt
we found out why they use writers
not so good and do you know why that
late night hosts have guests
well you found out because when they're
each other's guests
not so good not so good yeah that's too
many comedians in one place
every time I watch a show where they put
five comedians in one place to have a
conversation because you've seen this
format before
I always think this is going to be the
greatest thing it's five comedians I
like all five of them
five comedians are not funny what do you
put them together
yeah something happens I saw Ricky
Gervais in one of these four or five
comedian things that there was with
Seinfeld and Chris Rock
some some other famous comedian and
Ricky Gervais the funniest person on the
planet he's not even funny when he put
him with the other comedians because
they get weird there's somehow they act
differently
but one comedian gold
five comedians talking to each other
trying to impress each other maybe I
don't know if something goes wrong when
you put them together
um
so how many saw that uh singer
Oliver Anthony that's his performance
name I guess was on Joe Rogan
anybody see that
what could he possibly have to offer
that this song doesn't say
I'm trying to figure out why he's
interesting
and I can't figure it out because he
doesn't interest me so I'm trying to
figure out why he's interesting you the
song was amazing so I think most of us
would agree
if we judge him as a musician wow right
there's almost nothing else you can say
but wow
that's that's some musician right there
but as soon as you get into
yeah he has a story of you know maybe
addiction and poverty and stuff but what
part of that is surprising you
and what what is he offering does he
have some solutions for monetary policy
yeah I mean we're interested in him
because he's an amazing talent but I
wouldn't confuse that with uh socially
relevant
I don't think he's socially relevant
in in the sense of politics or how we're
going to change anything I don't believe
he's suggesting anything in particular
is he
it's not like he said we should be doing
X instead of Y
so why are we even talking to him
we should talk to people have some ideas
some suggestions and by the way I'm not
I have no objection to him this is
nothing about him I'm just thinking
didn't he tell us himself
that you know it's more about the song
and he put his message out there and we
heard it
so maybe he's done what he platform is
going to have phone calls and video
calls
but you think that's no big deal right
and you say to yourself ah you know you
can do that on lots of different
platforms I can I can zoom and I get a
WhatsApp and I can signal and I can text
and you know so what if there's one more
place that does that
well I think it's bigger than that
because Elon Musk has already teased
that X will be the global address book
can you imagine if he pulled that off
could you imagine
if you could call anybody
just by knowing their their address on x
now I suppose that would be a problem
for people like me because my I guess my
ex would be ringing a lot
um you know anybody who's got a big
following they'll probably get a lot of
random phone calls but presumably you
can turn off the ringer and screen it or
whatever
but
how much would you love to be able to
contact anybody in the world even if you
didn't know anything except their
Twitter address
that'd be pretty good
and at what point does it replace your
phone
or replace phone service
because what what would I need to do on
x
that I couldn't do with my phone if I
had the universal access to other people
so ideally I'd want to be able to send a
message on x
that would show up on just regular text
message or Whatsapp or something else
should be able to link them in some way
that'd be cool
but
um here's what I really want
this is what I want more than a
universal phone number which is
my Twitter address I guess or e or my X
address I would love to be able to Grant
entities
access to my private information
on at least five different levels
so here's what I'd love
now I don't know if this has anything to
do with X but it's what I want how often
do you put the same information when
you're signing up for stuff it's like
all day long aren't you doing that fill
out a forum name and address and then on
the same formula asks your name and
address again
how many times does that happen right so
here's what we have we should have at
least five levels of personal
information and I should be able to say
to you
um take out my phone and say I'm going
to give you Level D
access
word e so let's say level E is your name
just your name and your email
the the lowest level of information it's
not even your phone number it's just
your email and your name
so you say I grant you level E and it
just automatically populates
yeah a little bit more would be your
phone number
so Level D would be your
sorry I just heard the garbage truck
outside which means that again I forgot
to take my garbage out which means that
all my garbage will be overflowing for a
week
and my Gardener is going to be mad at me
because the the thing doesn't get taken
out
do you know what I do every day I pull I
put it on my calendar I put a warning I
check it several times and then I go to
sleep
it's not working for me at all anyway so
I should be able to say I'll give you
level C and it'll give me say your
social security number and your address
level B towards the top would be all of
your personal information plus your
banking if you want to get a loan
if I want to apply for loan I should say
level B excess and give somebody all of
my you know tax information and banking
and level a would be your health
information
right because that's the last thing you
want to give somebody after you're
banking is your health information so
wouldn't it be great if you could just
fill out forms just say I give you level
B access
once again and uh reality is
is uh heading toward the most
entertaining outcome if you've been
following The Saga of Dr Jordan Peterson
who is being challenged by the Canadian
psychology let's say what is it the
Toronto
College of psychologists of Ontario
the College of psychologists in Ontario
they want to take his license away
his psychologist whatever license that
is unless he goes to re-education camp
and he challenged him in court and lost
and now apparently he has to go to
re-education camp
now
what would be the most entertaining way
that this story could go would it be
that Dr Peterson won his court case and
then did not have to go to re-education
camp
would that be the most entertaining
it might be the best you know if you
were going to choose you'd probably
choose that one
but the most entertaining
is he reports back everything that
happens one way or another you know he
doesn't know if he'd be able to film it
or audio it or just take notes he says
but one way or another he's going to
make a hundred percent of the process
transparent
what could be better than that
I I'm trying to think of anything I
would more want to see than that and I
can't think of anything what what would
there be on Netflix that would be more
interesting than the you know the first
day report
from Jordan Peterson about his
re-education camp
it would be the number one thing I would
want to watch
so let him monetize it
you know he makes content and he
monetizes it so monetize the hell out of
it I think he's going to find a way to
make a huge profit off the College of
psychologists of Ontario
so keep an eye on that and I'm not sure
how much it really matters if he loses
his clinical license at this point
you know I'm sure you'd hate it you know
on a on a personal level it'd probably
be terrible
but I don't know how much time he spend
doing personal practice you know baby
yeah I certainly certainly would be a a
an ultimate assault on freedom and
principles and you know what is right it
would be immoral it would be unethical
it would be lots of bad things but I
don't know if his actual life would have
much difference maybe five percent
I don't want to speak for him but I
would hope that you would be
um
you know have a lot of Happiness whether
he had a license or not
but obviously he wants a license and we
want him to have it
um
Trump was on uh
uh Glenn Beck show
has some good words to say about Vivek
ramaswami and yeah it was It was kind of
easy to predict
what Trump would say about Vivek and
here it is because you know for Vegas
said good things about Trump he says I
can't get upset with him he's a smart
guy he's a young guy he's got a lot of
talent he's a very intelligent person
he's got good energy which is basically
the best compliment do you know what the
best compliment Trump ever gives
how smart you are
and what your energy is
those are his top top compliments I've
told you this he loves smart
you know everybody who thinks oh he's
you know he's maybe not want to compete
with uh Vivek because he's so smart or
not want to have him on his team or
something no Trump loves smart he always
has he always talks about it
so of course they would get along
um
so that's not a surprise no I I Vivek of
course says he could never be a number
two
but
anything can happen in the world of
politics
so we'll see he's definitely not running
to be vice president I'm sure that
that's my opinion but I'm sure of it all
right Dr Carlson on a recent podcast
said that he believes that if you look
at the sequence of events recently that
we are quote we are speeding towards
assassination obviously of trump
they have decided that there's something
about Trump that's so threatening to
them they just can't have it
too far do you think do you think that's
uh hyperbole
or does that seem
probable
well if we had never had a president
assassinated uh probably by our own
people
within my lifetime I would say that is
absurd
there's no way that our own people would
kill a president
but probably has happened at least once
probably at least once maybe more than
once but at least once
and
I wouldn't rule it out
would you say that the people who are in
charge of the country would be let's say
morally or ethically Beyond doing such a
terrible thing
not even a little bit no no no that's
right I would say that's right in their
sweet spot
yeah that we've watched them jail people
and ruin their lives they're doing it
right now
so if they could jail people forever you
know j6 people for example yeah no the
the extra level to go to assassination
it's like it's not that much
so the only thing that's going to
protect Trump is his secret service and
the fact that the country is watching
it's a little bit different if you
expect it to happen and then it does
right now I don't want to say expect
because I don't want to will it into
existence we don't want to do that we
want to will it out of existence but
don't do it right in front of us
you know you you might have fooled this
once allegedly
with you know Kennedy assassination you
know maybe that's what happened
I don't know for sure
but if we're all expecting that it's a
too serious of a possibility
I don't think you can do it
I think this would be you know a touch
point that would be crazy I don't know
what would happen it would get things
would get unpredictable
I don't like to use reference to any
kind of violence or revolution I think
that's inappropriate but things would
get real unpredictable real fast
if you want to be in the unpredictable
world
um
I I think I would agree with Tucker
I think I have to agree
it now I would say that 98 of the public
has not been watching the news closely
enough
for this to seem reasonable
but the two percent and I think you're
all among it who watch the news and
they've watched the entire sequence of
events developing for several years I I
do think it looks like that it
absolutely looks like that's a
possibility
I'll go further
I guarantee it's been discussed
would anybody take the other I mean
there's no way to prove it but I
guarantee
somewhere in the government
Maybe not maybe not at the
decision-making level but somewhere
somebody's having the conversation
I'll bet they've actually tried to
figure out how the best way to do it
would be
I wouldn't be surprised
all right
my ongoing segment that I call black and
white stuff
where we make up news about black and
white people so we have a reason to get
more dopamine and fight with each other
all right here's the first one uh John
Cougar Mellencamp was on Bill Maher's uh
on the show uh Club random
and he thinks things are so bad for
black people in America right now
that he said he actually said this out
loud while he knew cameras were filming
him
write out loud he said this
he said that he thinks that things are
currently as bad for 99 of black people
in America as they were for them during
slavery
I've got a new rule
wouldn't it be better
if white people never talked about
slavery again
or maybe anybody I guess yay got in
trouble for it too right wouldn't it be
better if just nobody ever gives an
opinion about how anybody felt during
slavery
let me tell you what I don't know for
sure
I don't know what it would have felt
like
to be a Slave
I'm pretty sure I don't know what that
felt like and I can't read their minds
so anytime I try to get inside the heads
of
you know people I couldn't possibly
understand what that situation really
felt like
uh it's probably a bad idea bad idea so
what should we say about this topic we
should say we don't care
I don't care
and I'll tell you more about why you
shouldn't care
all right yeah well I'll tell you right
now every time you every time you talk
about the average one group to the
average of another you end up looking
stupid in 2023.
so here he is talking about the average
of some group
and it looks stupid didn't it
and I'm pretty sure that every time you
do it in 2023 and it did make sense I
mean there were times in history talking
about you know one group compared to the
other group probably made perfect sense
but in 2023 if you're measuring the
differences in two groups you look like
an idiot
you look like you're lost in time
you want to reframe
all right you know I have a best-selling
book on reframing
so here's a reframe for you how many of
you like to watch uh cute animal animal
reels on social media sometimes it'll be
like
two animals hogging there there's a
there's real about a bird that was using
tools
uh it was great now do you see other
sometimes you'll see an animal helping
another animal
almost like a person would help another
person
and then you see sometimes an animal
will like share some food like a person
you'll see the dog like you know let the
other animal eat first the pig or
something no I'm kind of addicted to
those I get I get a little charge every
time I see it now you probably have
watched these videos and if you notice
that they have one thing in common a lot
of the ones you like best often have
something in common do you know what it
is what what do the animal videos that
you like the best have in common
the answer is
animals acting like people
those are the ones that get us the most
when the little raccoons look like they
have little hands like people you go us
like it's like a furry little person
or when two animals hug each other and
Spoon like the dog and the cat
the reason it gets you this because
you're like that's just like me I'm like
the cat
I like that too
right so here's here's the reframe
coming here's the setup
we all love animals
and one of the main things that we talk
about with our love of animals is how
much they're like us
so when you talk about animals you never
talk about how different they are have
you ever seen one that says look this
animal is pooping in the woods and we we
use indoor plumbing
no
you only talk about these animals are
doing a thing like a person would do and
then you love them okay
now if we talk about how alike we are
with animals and it makes us love them
you know and those things work together
we love them so we talk about them you
know they're like us we love them so it
works together now let's talk about race
relations
do you remember this study that came out
they showed how black Americans and
white Americans are so similar on that
thing you know the thing
I don't remember that either
because we don't talk about how similar
we are
do we
have you seen the story that says we
just found out that young black men and
young white men they really like sports
wow we got a lot in common
they love sports we love sports
I bet with some foods we all like pizza
I I'm not sure but I'll bet you I'll bet
you you can find some black people like
pizza and some white people too let's
talk about how much we have in common in
our love of pizza do you remember that
study
nope nope let me tell you the study that
did come out today
a study the funds that black legislators
who deploy rhetorical symbolism and
discussions of race are more persuasive
so we study that
we studied the difference between a
white and a black politician using
racial symbolism
and miraculously we found out that
talking about race is effective if
you're black
oh I'm so glad we studied that so let's
let's talk about our differences let's
do another study about the differences
here and the differences there and the
difference is there if the only thing
you focus on is your differences
what do you end up with every time
every time now sometimes not a tendency
too not a bias in the direction not a
nudge
complete different sides
if all of your attention is on
differences
you solidify the differences
there's no exception to this rule
whatever you concentrate on and think
about becomes your most important thing
if the only thing I talked about were
that the uh the apples were dangerous
and I talked about nothing else
the only danger in the world is eating
an apple it's not dangerous by the way
as far as I know
you'd be thinking apples no look at
those apple trees there's an orchard
over there we better drive wide around
it so we don't accidentally touch an
apple I I think those apples are hurting
us not just when we eat them but I think
they're giving off a gas I think just
being near an apple would be bad what
what about people talking about apples
I'm going to do a study of people
talking about apples and the people who
talk about apples are unhappier and
dumber than the people who don't talk
about apples
and pretty soon
your view of apples would be you know
poisoned and you'd you'd want to rid the
world of apples and is it because apples
are bad no it's because you focused on
them
whatever you focus on becomes the most
real there are no exceptions to that
that's how your brain is designed so we
have a system
which rewards you for doing a study
about our differences
here's my reframe I don't care what the
differences are
anybody who's talking about the
differences in an average is stupid and
unproductive and they're they're not
helping you
and they're not Apple to anybody
if you tell me how much similar I am to
my uh other Americans
I say I'd like to hear that
tell it tell me some more about things
we have in common
I love it give me some of that now it's
not exciting right you probably get a
little more of a dopamine hit fighting
online about these little differences oh
I've got a difference I've got a
difference so give me a little dopamine
hit for my difference
nope I'm not buying into it anymore
I'm absolutely interested in individuals
real people
but the average of a group there's no
average person we are infinitely
different and we are so infinitely
different that if you think the real the
real comparison is black to white
um let me spend five seconds finding you
know a million black people who have
more in common with me than I have in
common with a million white people that
are just have different characteristics
different interests different everything
right
have a difference with black people
I'm very much like people who have you
know similar experience maybe they're
engineers
tell me this if I be a black engineer
am I going to get along
are we going to be okay every time
every time because the engineer part
automatically you know is a
constellation of
thinking Styles and experience that
would be so close to what I like you
know what what is my preference of
people to talk to that we'd be best
friends in about five seconds
and it wouldn't even matter whether the
race would be the least important part
so if you let everybody talk about what
you have different you're going to get
division
so you get what you ask for what I ask
for is I'm not going to compare averages
anymore I'm going to call you stupid
every time you do
so I'm going to mock you every time you
think of the average of one group should
be compared to the average don't care
nope it's all about the individuals now
it's 20 23 time to move on
[Music]
and likewise even when the stories
there's a story about a white Banker who
was discriminated against uh just to be
an I like to tweet that story
and and I like to throw this red bean
into it because I got a little dopamine
by doing it
so here I'm going to model what you
shouldn't do don't do this don't be like
me
this is very much what I'm telling you
not to do and that I'm going to do it
right in front of you I guess I can't
help it
so what I did was I tweeted and I said
that 100 of white men
can confirm that they've been
discriminated in Corporate America
a hundred percent
so that's my claim that you couldn't
find even one man in America
an adult white man in the in let's say
Fortune 500 corporate world that you
wouldn't be able to find one who was not
discriminated against actively and I
mean actively as in somebody said um you
know we're not hiring from your group
right now
100
because the first time I said this I got
challenged by a number of you know black
leader types and reporters oh yeah can
you give me one example where this has
happened like actual can you approve
that a white person has ever been
discriminated against in Corporate
America and I used to make the mistake
of saying yeah I probably could
but you know they're private people and
maybe they don't want to be dragged into
it
but it's much more effective to say it's
a hundred percent
if you can find a white adult male who
works at a corporation you don't even
need to ask me it's a hundred percent
now let me check in the in the uh the
comments I only want to hear from people
who have corporate experience
if you're a white male do you agree that
a hundred percent of white men have
experienced racial discrimination
Network
yeah look at the comments is yes
it's just a wall of yes
everyone
so and then of course the obvious
question you would ask if you were black
I imagine was how am I just finding out
of that about this now
imagine if you're and I'm assuming I've
got a you know reasonably diverse crowd
here if you're if you're black and
you're watching this right now
are you surprised
does it blow you away to know that
everything you thought about
discrimination was actually backwards in
the corporate world not not in the World
At Large but in the corporate world is
very
special situation
because they're trying hard to be
diverse
yeah
so I I now
um here's this is interesting
I've said the same thing
like as recently as maybe a year or two
ago
and when I said it I got all kinds of
pushback
do you know how much pushback I got this
time I got a million followers on X and
I tweeted this and I looked at the
comments before I came on do you know
how much pushback I got
to the claim that a hundred percent of
white men are discriminated again 100
percent
none
none
no nobody said that's not true
you're welcome
you're welcome
now of course I'm doing right now what I
said I shouldn't do comparing groups but
in this case I don't have to compare
anything
right I can do this without a comparison
I can just say here's the experience of
white people in case you wanted to know
is that useful
I think it's useful for both sides to
have as much information yeah there I
did I did it both sides again see what I
did
God it's so hard to get out of that
frame
how about there's no sides
how about that there's no size
except Americans all right so let's be
smarter about that
sorry
all right
um
yeah there's another black white story
end of Oakland I'm just going to skip it
because it's just another black white
story all right
um
Trump claimed in a video that uh the
latest hints of covid
um maybe some kind of mandates coming
back the lockdowns and whatnot he says
that it's a seems like a big coincidence
that whenever there's an election
you get covered
Trump is suggesting that maybe the
election is the real reason that
mandates are being considered especially
the lockdowns and would that mean more
of a drop boxes and who knows
so Trump says if uh when he becomes
president that he will defund The Entity
that supported mandates
what do you think of that now it's
pretty conditional
but
wouldn't you like that yeah I'm not I
don't think he would be the only one to
do that but
um if you want that
he's offering it
all right how many of you think that the
the government's coveted
yeah let's say the rumors that the
government might bring back some
restrictions how many of the how many of
you think those are really 100 political
because I don't think it's 100 political
it might be also political
but I think that the
the experts believe what they've been
saying
so I believe I believe that the experts
actually think that it's necessary
I'm not agreeing with the experts I'm
just saying that probably a lot of them
are legitimately thinking would be good
for the world
but I would think at the political level
they're looking at the politics more
than the health
that's my guess
all right um
we now have uh five
Leaders with no cognitive processing so
we've got fetterman Feinstein
Biden McConnell and Kamala Harris
so five leaders
that very clearly are not cognitively
you know capable now a lot of people
keep leaving Kamala Harris off the list
of mental incompetence but I feel like
that's short-sighted
don't you
it doesn't seem to you that she's
obviously either drunk or maybe she hit
her head but whatever's wrong with her
she doesn't function like a regular
person
and I don't know if she ever did I mean
I thought that she was functional before
she was vice president or ran for vice
president but she's clearly not
functional
and to imagine that you've got um
let's get rid of the
goodbye
to imagine that she's functional and
these others aren't
no I think you're you're slicing it a
little bit finally there
I think we should just acknowledge
that Kamala Harris has a mental
incapacitation of some nature
I mean to me it looks like
you know some kind of addiction but it
could be organic maybe she bumped her
out or something but to imagine that
she's functioning is it's kind of
ridiculous at this point
to imagine that any of the people I just
read could possibly do their job in
their current condition ridiculous
ridiculous but here's what I think it
proves that none of these people were in
charge in the first place
I I feel like that's what it proves the
fact that we're okay keeping them there
suggests that whoever it is who is the
real power would rather have a
you know a scarecrow cadaver of a of a
front person then they want to put in a
qualified person because a qualified
person might push back on whatever it is
they want
clearly they have some control over
these people
and I want them to remain in office now
it could be as simple as they want to
have control of Congress so they don't
want their person to lose but it doesn't
look like that because I feel like you
could figure out how to get somebody
from your own party to backfill somebody
you know if you tried it looks more like
they want the the incapable people to be
there so that people were really in
charge have a little extra power it
doesn't look like there's any interest
in all getting rid of incapable people
all right
um
so but the good news is uh it does serve
diversity
to have those people because we don't
have enough of the mentally incapable in
government but now we've got a good
percentage getting our I don't know what
the percentage of mentally handicapped
people is in the General Public
but we do not have a Congress that
matches it
so
if that's what you wanted he got it
all right here's a question I have for
you
if you were to base your opinion on
observation alone
right pure observation not on thinking
not on the history not on your
preferences but just observation
Which hypothesis
fits the facts better
that the government is trying to help
you or kill you
and I'll give you I'll just read some
things that happen so these are things
that are happening is the government
trying to help you or kill you
mandatory vaccinations
Zoom school is at least being discussed
climate policy climate policy
equity and the end of uh Merit as as the
primary mover
uh inflation spending
the Ukraine war
open wide open immigration with no
control
in my opinion no control uh Tick Tock is
not being banned tick tocks remaining
uh way more people transitioning than
ever before
transitioning gender
um
our incentive system
seems to reward women for divorcing or
not having or have or being single
um
and having children is too expensive you
can't so College it makes children too
expensive
uh the no bail system let the criminals
out
the weaponized Department of Justice
and uh
a weird inability to do Forest
management so all of our our states are
burning up because we forgot to do basic
Forest management stuff
food supply thank you food supply the uh
the level of testing that's required for
pharmaceuticals to be approved
yeah medicine food
what
if if you came from another planet
and you just objectively looked at what
the government is requiring of the
citizens
then you see you know smartphones
would you conclude that the government
was trying to slowly kill the population
or help them thrive
now of course it does some good things
too you know helps to feed people and
give them health care if they can't
afford it in many cases so there's lots
of things the government's doing on the
plus side
but the things in the news are all these
things
I just read you basically all the
headlines from last year the headlines
all suggest
that somebody's trying to kill us
I mean there you could
you could more easily
um
that's a dumb question so
you could easily imagine that uh China
is in charge of our government
because if China were in charge of our
government
which one of these things wouldn't have
happened
all of the things that are happening
suggest China is in charge
right look at vaccinations
virus comes out in China they don't do
the same vaccinations we do
they don't do the same vaccinations we
do
uh did they have zoom School
well they had lockdowns but most of the
country stayed open so they probably did
didn't have zoom School climate policy
they seem to be exempt from it so that
seems like a trick on us uh they're not
doing Equity but we are
um
I don't know what their inflation
situation is so I don't know about that
but they certainly want us to overspend
they would certainly want us to be
caught up at a Ukraine war
they would certainly want us to have
open immigrations while their fentanyl
could get in and their God knows who
else they would certainly want us to
have Tick Tock while they don't have it
that's the current situation they would
certainly want America to be doing lots
of transitioning while they're not
they would certainly want us to pay to
decrease our population
in our incentive system does that they
would certainly want us to have no bails
or weap or criminals running free they
would want us to weaponize their doj so
we turn against each other and they'd
want our fires to be raging out of
control if they were enemies if China
were our enemy
is China our enemy
the government people are awesome I like
the Chinese people
but their government
um
I don't know is it a coincidence that a
hundred percent of things in the news
are things that China would want to be
happening here
is that a coincidence
it might be I mean it might be just a
factor that you know they're they're
doing a better job on something so you
know they don't have as much fentanyl
problems as we do so it could be they
just do a better job on some stuff
but it looks like we're being managed by
our enemies
we have a government that in every way
looks like our enemies are determining
the outcomes not the citizens because I
can't think of which ones we would have
chosen
what what on this list with the average
American have chosen to be good for
America
all right
apple is considering printing the Apple
watch with 3D printing
now I think they meant something like
most of it or the important parts or
something but do you think we could get
to the point with some robots and some
3D printing that China is no longer
necessary for manufacturing anything
because I think that's where we're
heading to me it seems like Chinese
economy is doomed because manufacturing
will
undoubtedly move to 3D printing
does everybody agree assembling things
will move to robots
because they can
and they'll be it'll be cheaper for the
robots than the humans no matter where
you are in the world they'll still be
cheaper for the robots and
and they'll 3D print the parts
there will be a few things that you
can't do for a while but eventually you
can do metal you can do plastic you know
I guess the chips would be the hard part
and we're and we're bringing the chips
back to America
so I would say China doesn't really have
much of a chance in the long run
because they base China had basically
one thing going for it
they stole our our manufacturing well we
gave it to them
right am I wrong that China had exactly
one advantage in the world that it was
the manufacturing leader because they
could be rougher on their on their
citizens than other places could so it
could sort of get people to do terrible
slave labor you just it would be harder
to get it done anywhere else
so if you take away the only thing they
have
which is they took our Manufacturing
what's left
a military that they can't afford to
fund
I know yeah that's right they didn't
steal it we gave it to them that is a
proper way to say it
I would say China is the most doomed of
the countries uh
depend depending on who you talk to
Russia's got some problems but probably
not the elites so
I think Russia is stable
um
all right
here is your spotting BS lesson for
today
spotting BS
so I'm going to give you uh two
situations and I want you to see if
these are true
or BS now I want to tell you in advance
I don't know the answers to the
questions
so they could be true
or they could both BBS or it could be
one of each I don't know
and I'm not going to make a claim but
I'm going to teach you something as we
look at them right
so the first one is I saw Dr Drew had a
guest Dr Michael Yeadon
who is former vice president and
worldwide head of respiratory research
at Pfizer now so here's a guy by by
credentials anyway
really knows his way around creating a
new drug
and one of the things he said is that
all uh was it all five or all four of
the drug makers in the United States
they all picked the spike protein on the
coronavirus as the attack point
for the different kinds of
vaccinations and he says that in all of
his experience in creating new new drugs
that the odds of four independent people
you know entities developing drugs and
attacking the same part of the the virus
he says that's a Black Swan event
meaning so rare
that you would have to assume it was
intentional
and that if they intentionally all all
attacked that same point his second
point is that anybody who is in this
business would understand that you know
the nature of that thing they attacked
would cause your body to melt down
basically that those are my words it
would cause your immune system to have
irregularities and you'd have problems
in all of your systems through your body
and that everybody would know that
before they had developed a drug and yet
the four major ones
made the same decision which he would
say hugely unlikely
you know in the normal course of things
that that couldn't be a coincidence and
that nobody would have made the drug
that did that
without knowing that the ramifications
were horrible for the rest of our lives
now let's put the BS filter on that
BS filter number one
uh what other experts are saying this
it's the first time I've heard it it's
the first time I've heard that it was
intentionally designed to do this so
your first BS filter is
that feels like something that everybody
else would know
like Bob Malone would know that right
all the the top critics they would all
know the same stuff right because he's
not giving us new information
we all knew that the spike protein blah
blah
blah blah blah
so
if I don't hear other critics say it
because there are plenty of critics
right
I'd like to see the other critics at
least agree it would be one thing if the
you know the the normies who are doing
the the work still if they all agree you
can say well that's for money
but you look first to see if the critics
who have gone public with their
criticisms of the vaccination I don't
want to see what they said
right if they agreed with them then then
I'm a little bit more likely to think is
credible
but his main claim here is that there's
no way it could be an accident that they
all targeted the same thing
give me your opinion
if that if that sounds like an accident
or if you could imagine there'd be
another ordinary reason for it
do you think there could be another
ordinary reason why they all took the
same approach
let me throw out an ordinary reason
do you think that all the people
involved in the different companies do
you think they attend the same
um
let's say seminars
do you think they go to the same trade
show I don't know what you'd call it but
an event where the doctors tell you
what's new do you think they read the
same Publications
do you think it's possible and I'm just
going to put this out as a possibility
do you think that they were all aware
that nobody had ever solved this
coronavirus problem
but the closest anybody came
might have something to do with that
Spike protein
and could it be that everybody in the
industry knew that if you're going to go
fast you better start with the stuff we
already know
and maybe the state of the art was the
thing we knew the most about was that
thing
and so maybe that that's not what they
would have done outside of a pandemic
maybe if had not been a pandemic some of
them would say you know we're going to
keep looking
because this approach has some problems
perhaps so let's let's see if there's
something even better than a spike
protein
but since they all had to rush and there
was money on the line do you think that
they all said okay I'm pretty sure the
other guys are going to pick that as
Spike protein so we're going to be a lot
safer
because we all will have picked it and
then if things go wrong with a spike
protein well at least everybody did the
same thing it's not going to look like
we were the dumb ones right so all I'm
suggesting is
that for him to call this a Black Swan
event
seems absurd
there's a very ordinary set of
circumstances that would get you to all
of them doing the same thing
just because they think the other ones
are doing
you don't think the people at the
different companies talk to each other
I'm sure they did either directly or
indirectly you don't think they had
friends in the other companies that do
the same kind of work you don't think
there are people who used to work at one
company but now they've worked at the
other and they still have best friends
at the bass company you don't think that
they all know
yeah but basically herd mentality
plus money
plus having to do do something really
quick
plus wanting to avoid liability
probably would get them all to do the
same thing
does anybody think that is crazy to
imagine there would be just the most
ordinary reasons in the world that they
had that they they approached it the
same way now I'm not saying it's the way
I described I'm just saying that in the
real world
there's there's a probably a hundred
ways that they could all make the same
decision just because you can't imagine
it immediately doesn't make it unlikely
it could be a problem with your
imagination right how many of you until
I just gave my little you know
hypothetical explanation of how it could
all happen how many of you when you
first heard it said I can't think of any
way that could have happened
I can't think of it any way that could
have happened unless it was intentional
I can think of lots of ways it could
happen
so I I don't by his assumption that
there's only one way it could have
happened which is intentionally
um
however I also don't know these wrong
okay so as as clearly as I can you know
because later if it turns out he's right
you're gonna say you tried to debunk
that guy no I didn't there's no
debunking going on here what we're doing
is we're learning how to look at the
news
right and what you do with that is going
to be on your own
but I'm telling you
this this claim that it couldn't have
happened by accident
is ridiculous
it could have happened for a number of
reasons that weren't an accident but not
necessarily because there's a plot to
destroy or depopulate the world
um
and then the fact that we would have
known that there would be a toxic stuff
again there was so much money involved
that I think everybody involved couldn't
see the risks
if you said to me Scott
I'd like you to go mountain biking
in this place you've never been
my my first thought would be oh at my
age and you know I'm not really a
mountain biker I feel like that'd be
dangerous
and then they say I'll give you a
thousand dollars and I go
a thousand dollars well it won't change
my life but it's free money no no I
don't want to get hurt a thousand
dollars I'll give you one billion
dollars
to go trail bike riding on this Trail
you've never been on suddenly
I tell myself well you know I could just
go slowly
people who fall off bikes all the time
I'll just follow off I'll get back on
I'll wear my helmet I mean for God's
sakes I'm wearing my helmet I'll go with
somebody else I mean I'm not going to be
alone so obviously if something happens
you know I can get help so yeah you tell
me it's a billion dollars and I can't
see the risks anymore
right it just erases the risks in my
mind I just see billion dollars billion
dollars that's all I see it blinds me so
it would be easy to imagine how the
researchers were blinded by the prophets
they were about to make
or they're all evil both possible all
right here's another one
I want you to put on your skeptic hat
uh here's a little excerpt I heard from
the book Atomic habits
and there was a story about the British
cycling team you know the bicycle people
and apparently they've been bad for ever
so they were just bad at cycling but
they got this new leader
and the new leader of the British
cycling teams
implemented a a wide series of small
improvements so improvements in the seed
they even approved the pillows
that the competitors use so they'd get
better sleep so he just he just went to
every little thing you could get and
maybe the Improvement of each thing was
just maybe one percent
just a little little benefit here a
little and then the um
the sum of that was that although your
common sense says that these little
improvements probably should show just a
little bit of gain
but when you sum them up you know you're
one percent better about everything
suddenly they became like Champions and
they were winning competitions and very
quickly after this new coach came in
better better performance
so it was probably uh these tiny
improvements that made the difference
right because when I see that a cycling
team
gets suddenly better
the first thing I ask is did they make a
lot of micro improvements
that's the first thing you ask right
what
dope I'm not a dope somebody's calling
me a dope
oh oh you oh
okay you're thinking that maybe they'd
found some way to cheat
that they didn't tell the reporters who
asked about it
are you saying there's some people
now I'm not saying this is true but are
you telling me that you think people
would do this
I think you're way too skeptical
oh you people
why can't you trust the athletes has any
athlete taken an illegal drug and tried
to what Lance who's this Lance Armstrong
guy you're talking about
has anybody ever heard of him that
doesn't even sound like a real name
Lance
is that a real person
oh oh he did what
Lance oh for years for years my God
it's like they never tested him what
they did test it what they did test them
they tested him for years
and and he always came out legit
and then later we found out wow
well that's surprising isn't it
didn't see that coming at all but
um let me tell you that this one British
cycling team they had nothing like that
going on uh what they did was they got a
sudden pretty a major improvement from
all the tiny micro improvements
now I'm going to say the same thing I
said for the last story I don't know
it's true
is it possible that there are great
improvements came exactly like Atomic
habit says from a number of improvements
in everything they do
absolutely yeah I do think that there's
power so the the point of the book is
valid
that if you systematically looked at
everything you do and tried to improve
everything you do a little bit I did
that with tennis
if you've played if you played a sport
I would experiment with the grip you
know which grip gave me the best grip
I'd experiment with the strings
infinitely I'm always tweaking the
strings right I put like little little
lead weights on the inside of the racket
to change the weighting of the racket I
would experiment with which tennis balls
who worked on what kind of court
right I would I would experiment with my
diet I experimented with visualization
with um you know I do practice swings
because I heard that was a good thing it
is a good thing you do practice swings
before you go in the court
I did stretching so I do believe from my
own experience and everything I've ever
experienced in life that it could be
exactly what it looks like they just
improved everything and then they got
really good
I'm just saying that if somebody
presented this story to you the first
time you'd ever heard it
I would not assume it was the extra
systems that they employed that made the
difference I would assume cheating
but I'm not going to make that claim I'm
not making the claim I'm saying that if
you were a smart consumer of news
don't assume that the reasons given by
the reporters
are the real reasons
because people don't tell the truth I
don't know if you knew that if you
interviewed all the people on the team
do you think any one of them would say
oh you know you got me has really taken
some illegal drugs no they would say
what their leader said well we've made
lots of different improvements and they
all summed up and made us great
so anyway so I'm not casting aspersions
on any of the people in these stories
maybe the story is exactly with the way
they told it but that is how you would
examine these claims critically
all right ladies and gentlemen this
Ray's story I'm forgetting because I
feel like I am
anything big happen
yeah you can always tell there's a new
person Scott are you vaccinated
do you want me to go off on him
how many people would like me to go off
of the person who just asked me if I'm
vaccinated
just for entertainment
oh some people are saying no don't go
off on them
should I let it slide
how about if I say something polite but
but uh ominous sounding
I'm gonna I'm gonna go I'm going to
split the difference
I'm going to sound angry and polite at
the same time all right let me split the
difference let's see if I can do this
angry and polite at the same time the
question I'm responding to is am I
vaccinated
I was not under the impression
that my personal medical decisions were
any of your business
how was that
under any conditions
doesn't matter if you think it's
newsworthy
doesn't matter if you made a different
decision
doesn't matter if you were in my
situation you would have chosen
differently doesn't matter if it works
out for me
doesn't matter if it doesn't work out
for me
there's one important thing that's more
important than all of those things
that it's none of your business
all right
but I was vaccinated
it's a long story but I certainly
wouldn't recommend you do what I do and
if I ever recommend anything but vitamin
D and sunshine and exercise and eating
right
sleeping right if I if I get out of that
domain you know maybe do some deep
breathing you can criticize me
but if you're going to make a point
about one individual's individual
decision do you know what that would
make you
that would make you like the people who
talk about averages
oh
so you and your specific medical
situation
you you acted like the average of these
people no
I acted like I was one person with one
decision that was unlike anybody else's
decision at the time
nobody else had the same decision
so
your opinion of my decision is a
uninformed of course
B does not compare to your decision
so you could not say that if you decided
differently therefore anything about me
because you see we're infinitely
different
and we have different situations
so the average of people who got
vaccinated if you're comparing it to the
average of people who didn't
that might tell you something that I
don't give a about
but it doesn't tell me anything about me
which I do care about
uh
am I just mad because I wish I didn't
get it
no how many people live like that
how many how many of you live in regret
of past decisions
I don't I've never had that feeling
regret is the dumbest thing you could
ever feel
in fact one of my best reframes I'll
give you my best reframe for my book
reframe your brain
available now
the best reframe and somebody told me
yesterday that this really helped them
is if there was something that you're
not happy about in your past
just imagine you just spawned into this
environment today like a video game
just imagine you just woke up and this
is the the stuff you had to play with
usually you're fine
right you might have a terrible problem
you have to deal with but usually you
wake up and you're like you know
I'm healthy
I I have ways I can get ahead I know
what to do if I wanted to get ahead yeah
I'll start here this will be a good
starting place so think of today as your
starting place and then just see how it
is
and if you don't like your starting
place the next question is how hard
would it get from where you are
to this better place
well you apply for a better job you
learn small skills you talk to your
cousin who's got a job opening
you do some stuff but probably you're
fine
so when you ask me do I regret a past
decision
the answer is
never
I've never I don't have any regret about
anything
and if you're thinking in those terms
You're really hurting yourself
I said no I don't regret anything
that or anything else it's just what
happened now one of the reasons I I can
live without regret is that I don't I
don't believe in free will
so that makes it easy if you don't
believe in free will
you just say what happened was the only
thing that was going to happen you know
that the nature of my brain at that
moment with all of the other inputs from
the environment
didn't have an option of going a
different direction
there was only one way it could happen
given my brain at the time
and all of the other variables it was
one thing
now benefied says that's excuses no that
would be a scientific view of the world
what you have is a magical view of the
world
where people have this thing floating
around called free will
that would be the least scientific view
so if you want to have an unscientific
sort of a horoscopy kind of a view of
the world then then you've got it
all right so enough of that enough of
the magic beans
Will trump jail Biden
well so Comer representative Comer says
they've got the goods
and you was it uh
who was it recently who says uh
uh that there's some audio tape that's
going to sink by Greg Kelly Greg Kelly
says there's some audio tape coming
that's going to sink Joe Biden do you
think that that's likely
all right let's do some uh news analysis
there's uh one person
and nobody else
who says he knows for sure but hasn't
hurted himself heard it from another
person
that there's a audio that's going to
take Joe Biden down
that's probably the lowest level of
credibility
one person anonymous source
are we done
anonymous source
that happens to be right on the nose
oh it's exactly what you thought might
be and there's an anonymous source that
says it's true
it's going to happen any moment now if
it does happen and he's got the scoop
uh I want to pre-apologize right so if
Greg Kelly really had the scoop
well then I'm the loser
but if you were to look at this
situation in this generic form without
thinking of that one individual because
I I don't have an opinion of that one
individual's credibility but
uh if you were to look at this
generically you would never believe that
story
but who knows
yeah anything's possible
all right
yeah if they had something well I'm not
sure because sometimes there are reasons
why things are delayed
so if they have anything we'd know I
think it's true if they have anything we
will know
but I don't think it's true that at any
given time we should have seen it
already
things do go slowly
Fair elections you know there are more
and more people on let's say the
political right who don't believe
there's any chance of a fair election
how many of you were in that camp as in
it's already over there there's not even
any point in talking about politics
well
yeah a lot of you think that the
election's already over because it's
rigged
I think that's at least a 50 likelihood
I give it a coin flip
Now by that I mean I'm not saying that
elections are 100 Fair all the time
in every place in every way I'm saying
that uh in all likelihood
the only way they could get away with it
is a close election
so if you have an election which
um one kid they you know just
slaughtered the other it would be pretty
hard to cheat on that
so there is some chance that especially
if Joe Biden is a candidate
if Biden actually limped into the race
you know being as dysfunctional as he is
it wouldn't be hard to imagine
a republican victory of Epic Proportions
in which case
um
in which case
uh I'll bets are off if yeah it would be
hard to it'd be hard to cheat if there's
a landslide
all right the only way to beat it that I
can if it's if it's rigged and I don't
have that information but
the only way to beat it would be massive
election victory
I hear people saying they're getting
Shadow banned on Twitter
I don't know
um what is the idea
uh
uh you'll do you deserved
oh Oliver Anthony is smart
you say that he'll do one more podcast
and you know once once he said who he is
which I think was worth doing
then he doesn't have more to say he's
going to focus on music so
that would be exactly uh the reasonable
approach
he was never trying to be political so
he's not going to turn himself into
something political
which I respect a lot actually
what is Trump like in person
super uh personable and real easy to
real easy to be comfortable with he does
have a Mastery of human connection he's
very good at it
all right oh The McConnell freeze we
talked about it yeah I mean
McDonald froze again but that's just
part of the story of a number of
politicians who are defective
uh an update on Maui
not exactly
uh
uh they have successfully
delayed the information about the deaths
to the point where you're starting to
forget the story
be not literally forget but it's but the
the emotion of the story naturally
shrinks with time
there's nothing you can do about that
we're just built that way so when it's
novel you know your emotions are at
their Maxim but as the rest of life gets
in the way and as time goes by every
every tragedy shrinks in your mind when
they shrink it in your mind enough
you might hear some numbers that are
real
they say only 400 people are missing
are they people or are they young people
so that's the part we don't know
so
I'm not even sure that keeping the
information from us was a bad thing
I have mixed feelings about that I do
think that the tragedy was so horrif
horrible
and the way it was handled was so bad
uh that maybe they were just better off
delaying that information until we could
calm down a little bit because we're
going to find out everything we need to
find out
so it's not like we won't know I believe
we'll know everything but we probably I
don't think we're poorly served by
letting our emotions come down a little
bit
before we hear the the final bad news
because it's going to be bad
yeah
so yeah my my first ex-wife
has a property there that used to be our
combined property so far it's not been
damaged but it's not usable
so if you have undamaged
property uh you can't you can't visit it
because nothing's open
and you can't rent it out so as an
economic asset it's already zero because
it can't be filled
um
I don't know about the mold they do have
electricity back so they should be able
to run the AC
so they do have water and electricity in
Kaanapali
all right
um
I've got a I've got a suggestion for AI
I wanted AI concierge for the other AIS
because all the AIS seem to have
specific things like there's one for
images there's a movie one there's a
script one and there's a deep fake one
and there's a yeah but if almost
everything I want to do
you lost the sound
uh let's say
those down still
okay here
sorry
all right so I have to end that stream
um and I'm going to say goodbye to
YouTube we're done for now but I'd like
a concierge AI that has an API
to all the other AIS
Le so that I can ask my one AI hey build
me a movie
of a deep fake doing this or that and it
just connects to as many other AIS and
gives them the right super prompts to do
that work
that's what we need all right that's all
for now I'll talk to you tomorrow
