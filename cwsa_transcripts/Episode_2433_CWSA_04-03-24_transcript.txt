morning everybody looks like people on
the locals app are coming in first hey
there's somebody from
Rumble anybody from YouTube yet YouTube
or
X I
hear I'll someday remember to turn that
off before I
start
well
really we're going to start by
complaining about the
video that's how we're starting
today anybody's having any trouble with
the audio or video just
restart do that but while you're
restarting those of you who might want
to enjoy the simultaneous hip all you
need is a cup or M Glass of tank or chal
on a canteen jig or flask of vessel of
any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee and join me now for
the unparallel pleasure of the dopamine
here the day the thing makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous zp
and wow it's so good
now much
better all right so restart your engines
if you have any problem if you are sub
subscribing to the Dilbert reborn comic
which you can only get on the xplatform
just the comic plus the daily digital
calendar um or on the locals platform
where you get the dilber comic and
dilber calendar and robots read news
comic my subversive extra extra
provocative
comic and a whole bunch more um if you
were subscribing you would know that uh
the pointy here boss is uh secretary or
assistant if we like to
say uh is booking the boss uh into an
Oakland Hotel even though the boss is
going to San Francisco why because
there's a greater chance he'll be
murdered in Oakland so you can uh you
can watch the boss's assistant try to
murder
him by bucking him to into an Oakland
Hotel all right uh Bloomberg's website
traffic apparently between 202 in 2024
last two years has fallen for about 24
million people to
seven 24 million to
7
Bloomberg um let me just put another
nail in Bloomberg's coffin Bloomberg I
don't consider a legitimate news source
uh they sent a a reporter to spend a day
with me back in the first Trump election
um for the sole purpose of destroying my
reputation with a article that came up
first and all the search results from
that day after now after you know after
a few years it fell away but it was the
number one thing you would find if you
heard something that you liked about me
it's like hey who's this guy talking
about Trump his persuasion then maybe
you'd look up who I am and the first
thing you'd see is a hit piece from
Bloomberg full of errors but wouldn't
know it I mean I knew it but they don't
know it so no Bloomberg I consider an
illegitimate news source and uh if
they're going out of business that's
good
news today I was asked what I think when
I look at
Biden do I think he looks like a kindly
kindly older gentleman with good
intentions or does he look like the face
of
evil let me ask you
when you look at Biden now I know that
you know who he is from his actions but
we're just judging from his face if you
never knew anything about him and you
just walked around the corner and you
saw him and you saw his face would you
say to yourself there's a kindly
gentleman who he's a little bit older
but I like how he you know his his
goodness comes
through I I'll tell you when I look at
when I look at Biden I see pure
evil he his his squinty eyes and his
crooked smile and his little literally
he's
like if you were going to make a
movie and you wanted a character that
was definitely evil it would look just
like
that am I wrong all right now I want to
ask you how many of you are bad at
reading
faces do any of you think you're bad at
reading faces because it's making me
wonder if one of the differences between
uh Democrats and
Republicans is Democrats can't read
faces because if Democrats could read
faces they would see that half of them
are literally bashit crazy they have
crazy eyes you can't miss it I I was
just looking at an interview on CNN
between uh Caitlyn Collins their their
host and I think it was Gretchen
Whitmer and you just look at him in the
side by side
Caitlyn Collin's eyes look like a smart
normal person who's just doing her job
no crazy you know you could disagree
with her job or whatever but I didn't
say they crazy she looked like she was a
total normal person doing a normal thing
and then right next to her on the screen
is Gretchen Whitmer with her crazy
eyes how do you miss
that like did do you not see that you
don't see that one of them you know
they're both Democrats so I I picked I
picked people who are on the same team
so you can see it's not a team
thing there are people with crazy eyes
and it does tell you exactly what you
think that there's something going on in
there that you should know
about so the good news is Caitlyn
Collins does not look
crazy um so yeah to me Biden looks
actually
completely obviously evil I can't even
imagine anybody saw it any any
differently but we're all different and
subjective so there's a more controversy
on the birth control question
specifically the pill and I guess
Charlie Kirk said some things in a
speech yesterday that um maybe some
Republicans think didn't help them as
much as it could
have you may have destroyed the planet
Earth do I mean that literally yes yes I
mean that literally and I'll explain why
in fact that will be part of my theme
for today did Charlie Kirk just destroy
the planet Earth probably not but
maybe here's what I
mean uh anyway I'll give you the uh
story on this and then give you the
bigger picture so Gavin Nome was mocking
Charlie Kirk's take on birth control uh
and he was quoting Charlie Kirk saying
quote birth control really screws up
female brains this is Nome mocking
Charlie Kirk for saying this every
single one of you needs to make sure
your loved ones are not in birth control
that's another quote so Gavin Newsome is
saying basically you know look at this
guy don't vote for him now here's my
take on
abortion as as well-meaning
and as well argued as the pro-life
people are you know you're throwing away
the entire world for that one
thing right now that one thing is really
big in your mind and a lot of other
people's mind so I don't want to I don't
want to minimize it but you know you
know you're consciously destroying the
world right like the whole world
do you have any do you have any sense of
what you're
doing because if you if you want to ride
the the abortion train because it's
moral and it's ethical and you feel
really strongly about
it you know that destroys the whole
world are you missing that connection
because it's the it's the abortion issue
that allows Democrats to have the power
that they have you're basically handing
the decisionmaking to the people with
the crazy eyes because you got one thing
that they can't get
over now again I'm not going to Min I'm
not arguing the the point I want to make
sure you know this I'm not arguing
whether there should or should not be
abortion I'm completely out of the
conversation I believe I shouldn't be
part of it at all and I think that that
is your smart play your smart play is to
say men should just get out of
this right now are there are there
reasons why men should be involved yes
yes there are all kinds of
constitutional uh you know moral eth
there are all kinds of reasons that men
should be deeply involved in this
question
absolutely and if you take that view you
will destroy the whole world cuz
you're doing it right now that's what
you're doing but just be aware of it I I
want you to know that if if abortion is
going to be your your ride or die that
you're taking us you're taking all of us
with you you're killing all of us you're
 killing us do you know why the
borders open because of abortion the
topic the argument not the abortion
itself
do you know why there's crime in the
city because of abortion the topic just
you know the argument about
it why why do you know why the well
everything basically everything that you
think is destroying the country is
because you can't let go of
abortion should you I'm not going to
make a moral argument you've already
made your decisions but just know what
you're doing all right so when Charlie
Kirk goes
full um you know
full religious argument on
abortion or about uh in this case um
birth control which people could
inflate he's he's putting the entire
planet at
risk because if you lose the Republicans
you lose all sense of control in the
country there's no there's no that's too
far you know I was making the case
yesterday that Republicans have a a
gating thing about
stupidity the the Republicans can't do
really stupid things because they get
called out there there are too many
independent podcasters your Joe Rogan
your Allin podcasts your Elon musk's you
know your cicies you're B basically if
you do something that's just plain
stupid and you're a republican you're
going to get Savaged by the smartest
people in the
game I don't know why people are letting
this thing go so I figure I'll wait in
and take the take the
shot so you know if you need if you need
to kill somebody kill me I'm I'm already
dead at least reputationally I can't get
a worse so let me say it as clearly as
possible if you want to fight for
abortion and make that your deal you're
giving up everything and you're
killing me right so here's what I think
you need to understand there is some
kind of gigantic
self-destructive
theme in the Democrat Party mostly the
women if you let them direct that
self-destruction at their own
children that might take some of the
pressure off of all the other things
they want to destroy but maybe don't
know they're destroying it I don't know
it's hard to know what they know
but I I think you're going to have to
negotiate like real person not like a
person who lives in the magical world
where he can get everything now my
understanding is that Trump is going to
take a few days before he talks about a
six week ban or something there there's
some abortion question he's going to get
back to Trump is the only person who can
fix
this Trump is the only person who can
fix this CU he's the only one who has
the
capability to not only convince
Republicans to stop destroying the whole
 planet he's the only one who
could do it how many weeks 15 weeks I
don't I'm not following the
topic so if you want to see the world
get saved what it would look like is
Trump backing off on
abortion not backing off on his personal
opinion but backing off it as a
political uh a political topic can he do
it I don't think think so I don't think
he can do it I I think it's actually
even Beyond Trump's ability politically
because I think he would lose too much
support on his own side but he would
have to make the argument he's the only
person who can do it there's not a
single person in the public who has the
the juice to say Republicans I
completely understand your point of
view but do you completely understand
you're destroying the
planet there there's no way around it
if you're if you're going to fight to
the death on abortion you're going to
die and you're going to take all of us
with you even if you're right has
nothing to do with being right or moral
or on the same side as God nothing to do
with that you're just going to kill us
all if you can't release on that so here
what I'm doing is modeling the point I
made
yesterday that if you're Republican it's
harder to be stupid in
2024 this is the stupidest thing I've
ever seen in my life I mean it would be
hard to imagine anything stupider than
what the Republicans are doing with
abortion even if they're right again
I'll I'll say that every five words even
if they're right even if they're morally
ethically religiously according to God
even if they're completely right about
everything it's stupid Beyond any level
I've ever seen in my life I've never
seen anything this stupid and by the way
the reason that you're missing it is
because you think it's the other side's
fault no it's not the other side's fault
it's your fault because you
control the room you control the room
when you walk in the room you can make
those people go crazy or you can make
them say hi which one did you choose oh
I think I'll walk into the room and whip
them into a frenzy of hatred against me
that's a choice you didn't have to do it
didn't have to do it nope
so so instead uh the crazy women and the
Democrats are going to destroy the whole
 world because uh you're just
going to let them you you've decided
that that's how you want the room to go
and you're going to die on principle and
let your let your own kids die
too good job so you see what I'm doing
I'm putting I'm laying it on a little
thick I want to make it really hard for
a republican to be a dumb idiot
and let me say this if Trump comes out
fullon you know abortion has to be
banned I'm going to say he's a
idiot right I'm going to say it clearly
and often he well you just threw away
the election so might as well find
another country to live in because
you're a idiot if you don't fix
this he's the only one who can and I
believe he can't actually I I think it's
beyond his ability as well I don't think
anybody can fix it I think you dug a
hole too deep
so good job on
that and what the hell is wrong with
speaker
Johnson what the hell is wrong with that
guy how do you pick the guy who just
says yeah let's give all our money away
to Ukraine and
Israel while we literally are running
into a debt wall that's going to crush
us all how in the world do the
Republicans let that guy have any
power yeah if if things are going wrong
I think you need to look in the mirror
Republicans maybe look in the mirror
maybe everything you're doing guarantees
this result if you want to guarantee
this result just keep doing what you're
doing that'll get you right
here so
anyway
um New York mayor ER Eric Adams is uh
you know famously a Democrat and he's
citing the corrosiveness of Tik Tock um
when it comes to the women who are being
punched in the face in New York
City you know some are saying that the
women getting punched in the face is a
powerful signal that crime has gone too
far well you know what I say about all
this punching in the face
business it's too on on the
nose two on the
nose no I don't say that it's
just there's a nose involved that's
all um but do you think the Democrats
are coming around to the idea that Tik
Tock is destroying
everything
yeah
yeah I think mayor Adams is in no
relationship to me but he uh he's right
about
that well Trump is uh embracing the
blood bath thing so he's calling it The
Border blood bath or the Biden border
blood bath I think Biden Biden border
bloodbath is way better than build back
better he promised us build back better
but he gave us the Biden border blood
bath it kind of works it's kind of hard
not to say once you hear it that's
always my test do you need to say it I
kind of needed to say it out loud a few
times
but um this was not the first idea the
first idea is instead of Biden border
bloodbath BBB it was going to be the
Biden border
crisis but that just didn't make a good
acronym Biden border
crisis yeah bad acronym so Trump is once
again uh amplifying their uh persuasion
mistake and embracing it and owning it
and it's totally working yeah totally
working according to just the news
that's a new site um 98% of Colorado V
voters voted by mail in the primary in
March
98% of all the people voted voted by
mail in
March so here is my question and it
looks like there'll be a record set set
for a voting by mail this year as
well doesn't that make the post office
the election
system doesn't it so in the old in the
old way you'd walk down and you'd vote
in the office so if you're going to say
describe the voting system you'd say
well you know it starts with the voting
Precinct office and then that vote gets
put in a box and you know then it goes
somewhere but if you start by voting at
your house and you just put it in your
mailbox that's the election system the
post office is the election system
because they have most of the control of
the actual
vote and I I'll ask this qu there might
be an answer to this question I just
don't know what it is what would stop
the mail the post office from throwing
away ballots that come from a red zip
code how would you
know if if you mailed in your ballot and
your postal worker just said nope threw
it away because it was a a red Precinct
how would you know would you what is the
mechanism for auditing that or more
importantly if in the in the course of
collecting up all the mailin ballots
here here I'm going to speculate if I
were the post office and I knew that
there' be a zillion mail in ballots and
they all go to the same
place I would make sure that I had a
special system just for mailin ballots
do you think that's true do do you think
there's like a special box or something
that they put them all in because they
know it's all going to the same place so
at some point it probably get sorted
into one bin don't you
think what what is the control and video
surveillance and chain of custo
that's happening when the when the post
office has a big old bin of mail ballots
that are all going to one
place it's all it's not registered
mail you're saying your mail and ballots
are registered
mail every ballot is registered mail
somebody saying in the comments I don't
believe that no it's regular
mail
all right so California sends a ballot
receipt are we talking about the same
thing the ballot receipt is when the
election people get it it's not when the
post office gets it the post office
doesn't send you a receipt it says yeah
you you had a you had some mail in that
box and I picked it up so you're good
no you can send a registered mail so
somebody says you have the option of
sending a r well I don't think that
happens
so yeah I don't I think it's just first
class
mail so are you concerned that you don't
know the answer to this question and
neither do
I I have no
idea I have no
idea if uh yeah no idea if the post
office secures all those or they just s
in a big bin and anybody wants to can
throw out half of them I don't
know Utah ATL's online tracking but your
online
tracking well I guess that would tell
you if at least the election people got
it all
right so my point is how do we
know um here's another comparison of
Texas versus California we like to
compare our states so California's got a
deficit of 222 billion
that's a lot 220 billion that's just the
deficit and whereas uh go Greg Abbott
governor of Texas posted that Texas has
a surplus in the billions of dollars and
they'll devote much of it to cutting
taxes that's all I can do I can only
growl at the incompetence of my state
wow and we have I'm pretty sure much
higher taxes than Texas so we're not
only wasting it we're we're getting
extra money to
waste Carol Roth points out as others
have that uh by the end of this year the
biggest budget item will be interest on
our
debt
okay yeah the interest on the US debt
will be 1.6 trillion by the end of this
year
so doesn't that seem like we're just
spending ourselves into
Oblivion seems very
self-destructive you know what would be
useful for fixing
that more Republicans in office do you
know what's keeping more Republicans
from being in
office
abortion all right uh there's a study
John B H is talking about this this
there's a study that somebody did that
shows that employers will be less likely
to respond to an application for
employment if the applicant uses they
them
pronouns and as John says it's clear
evidence that employers discriminate
against non-binary individuals is that
what's
happening that do you think that when
people don't want to talk to the they
thems is because they're discriminating
against non-binary
when I see a the they and the them I
totally discriminate but it has nothing
to do with your sex or
gender you're just a pain in the ass and
probably a
narcissist if you're a pain in the ass
troublemaking
narcissist you just signaled it now you
might also be non-binary I don't care
about that why do I care about where you
put your genitalia in your own time as
long as you don't do it in the
conference room why do I care I can't I
I'll bet there's not a single employer
ever anywhere who actually cared about
their employee being
non-binary I'll bet
never I bet is only they cared about
people being a pain in the ass and when
you when you signal your they them
you've automatically introduced a
problem that non-binary people are not
going to bring into the office so does
it have to do with being
non-binary or does it have to do with
recognizing you might have a mental
health problem or a narcissist or a
troublemaker it's just one more one more
thing you can get sued for so of course
employers are discriminating against the
they thems of course they are because
they're
rational well the Apple Vision Pro um
virtual reality glasses according to
Rowan Chung who's uh talking about that
it looks like they have this amazing
thing now where you make other people
people who are using the system appear
as sort of floating perfect versions of
themselves so you could watch a TV show
this is one of the examples and you
could have your friends just sort of
watching it with
you but they're the real people they're
not AI so they're they're somewhere else
but to you it looks like they're in the
room and I saw a picture of it and they
looked photo realistic because I think
it's actually based on some the camera
or something although I don't know how
Facebook or it's FaceTime somehow it's
through a FaceTime and I don't see how
FaceTime can record your face when you
have the glasses on so I have a question
there but maybe it recorded you once and
then just reproduces
it but it's very cool so up to five
people can watch and play together I
would think that this would be a
gigantic move forward in
reducing um
loneliness because if you can visit
Grandma for 45 minutes and you know play
a game of Scrabble and catch up and and
you were actually like a floating head
in the room I think Grandma would feel
like she had a something like a human
interaction and that would feel
completely different so this could be a
really big deal for
loneliness uh Google's got a new product
notebook LM where you can load uh um
fairly large
files into it and then you can query it
like it's your assistant so I tried it
this morning it seems to be free so far
uh I loaded the PDF of two of my books
into it and then I asked questions about
the books and sure enough they can
answer it now I don't have an immediate
use for it this is still demo
whereare so far
um grandma isn't going to figure out VR
yes is she just puts on the glasses
grandma just has to answer the phone put
on the glasses and and when something
that says ring ring just kids are
calling yeah Grandma can figure that
out
um anyway it's called No book LM and uh
once again I used Ai and when I was done
I said to myself huh that's a good
demonstration of something that might be
useful in the future but not yet for a
variety of reasons
it wouldn't take a word
file so the very first thing I wanted to
do was load in some Word files you know
books it's like nope it's got to be text
or PDF I'm like H really you you're the
only AI that can't read a word file you
can't read my Dilbert comic and read it
I
can't so it's always every time you
think you've got a product with AI it's
always the same there's always something
obvious that you would need it to do for
it to actually be useful
and it won't do the obvious thing it'll
just do some cool things that you can
demo to your friends and that's about
it have you heard anybody say that uh
Alzheimer is really type 3
diabetes because I guess the May the
Mayo Clinic has settled on that so the
Mayo Clinic you know one of your
standards
for you know Health Care is saying that
Alzheimer maybe we've misunderstood what
it was all the time and everything we
were looking at treating was a symptom
and not a cause and that the cause might
be um our our food supply so it could be
that our food supply and the way we eat
it and it's spiking our insulin and
sugar and all that stuff being anab
balance might be the thing that's
primarily causing
Alzheimer's now do you think Alzheimer
the rate of Alzheimer's has gone up at
about the same time that processed foods
became
popular feels like they both increased
at the same time to me don't we have
more alzheimer's than ever but it's a
little bit hidden by the fact that we
have more old people than ever so if you
have more old people all things being
equal you got lots more lots more of
this
so um have you ever noticed that uh
people who seem to be eating well as in
they're not having any diabetes risk
they seem to be sharper in old age has
anybody ever noticed
that have you noticed that after a
certain age it's I don't think you
notice that age 30 or 40 but after a
certain age the people who have clearly
taken care of their diet they seem more
mentally
alert I mean it's just anecdotal but it
seems like it to me so I think Mayo
Clinic might be on the right track with
that stuff
Dr Mark Hyman was on Chris Coro show on
news nation and he was talking about yes
that's his last name his last name is
Heyman shut
up can you get over it please that's his
actual stop stop it stop being so
sophomoric you're so juvenile you're so
so
juvenile anyway Dr Mark clitoris I mean
Mark Heyman he was the uh different body
part I I could it's easy to get that
confused he is talking about the
mysterious rise in cancer and young
adults and one of his hypotheses now
this is not based on a study based on
his work and
hypothesis uh that the immune system is
playing a huge role and that
inflammation in particular is associated
with cancer and so anything that would
cause you more inflammation would give
you more cancer what is something that
causes more
inflammation food yeah food causes
inflammation our current diet so one of
the possibilities is that our food is
causing us to have more cancer but that
wouldn't explain that would not explain
why in 2019 we saw the beginning of the
spike even before the pandemic so
there's something that the Spike
happened before even the pandemic but it
was close enough to the pandemic that it
could be related and this doctor
says that it could be the
co U causing long covid I know you don't
believe in long Co we'll get to that and
he's saying that uh long covid is
basically inflammation so that long co
could be the inflammation that maybe you
don't notice you have and then you get
cancer
so since we know inflammation seems to
be strongly correlated to
cancer and there is plenty of evidence
if you believe Google if you believe
Google because I Googled it and I asked
is there is long Co basically
inflammation and the answer is yes that
long Co if it exists and there's there's
certainly some studies that say it's all
imaginary but if it exists it's
primarily an inflammation issue that
lasts a long time and inflammation is
well correlated apparently
to um
cancer
now let's address the elephant in the
room is long Co
real well I thought I'd catch up on it
by Googling long covid and according to
Google it's very real and there's all
kinds of evidence and all the right
people say it's real and that it's
affecting lots of people
you think all diseases are caused by the
brain well you came to the wrong
podcast so and then of course other
people would say no no no it's a
vaccinations themselves that are causing
the cancer it's so obvious but then I
Googled does the does the vaccination
caus inflammation what do you think do
you think Google said that the
vaccination itself
can cause
inflammation what is myocarditis is that
inflammation actually I don't know the
answer that it is right isn't myocard
it's inflammation so yes there's there's
evidence that you can get inflammation
from the
vaccination somebody says no I'm saying
no but what would cause the
myocarditis it's inflammation no how can
I be wrong about that all right doctor
says yes right I know I have some
doctors with I was waiting for the
doctor yes it's inflammation of the
heart okay good so so the shots cause
inflammation the not getting shots cause
inflammation and then the question is do
you think that the official answers on
Google let let's see if you can guess
this do you think the official answer on
Google is that if you got the
vaccination on average would it lower
your risk of long covid in other words
is is the medical community saying not
Scott don't blame me don't blame me I'm
telling you what the news is saying as
of today don't blame me the news is
saying as of today if you got your shots
in your booster you had much less chance
of inflammation called long Co do you
believe
that I don't know how you'd believe
anything how would you believe any
medical claim about the
pandemic I think choosing a favor a
thing to believe about the pandemic
whether you believe the vaccinations are
bad or you believe the co the long Co is
real any one of those things can't be
supported in my view there's no credible
information about your medical situation
none so to me is just guessing because
um the money Distortion impact and the
fact that we learned that even smart
people don't know how to do studies even
smart people don't know how to read
statistics so I don't know what to think
but I would guess that between the food
the change of Lifestyle the loneliness
that happened because of the pandemic
the vaccinations themselves in some
cases certainly cause inflammation uh
and that would be admitted by the people
uh in the business they would say that
some people do get inflammation they
admit that um and then the long Co if
it's real
inflammation
so don't know what to believe you want
to hear another theory okay uh Dr Paul
saladino uh showed that Wi-Fi routers
are giving off way more radiation than
you think and it would be enough to uh
affect your health as in
cancer and so I said to myself huh I
wonder when these mesh routers became a
big
thing how many of you have a mesh WiFi
systems where it's like several boxes so
you're always close to one it's not like
there's one in the central part like I
have one sitting right next to my bed
and that was specifically what was
recommended
against I I sleep 5T away for my
primary Wi-Fi node I mean it's literally
I could touch it with my
hand well I'll be moving that as soon as
we're
done so step number one get that the
 out of my bedroom now I don't know
that it's dangerous so you know I'm not
a doctor not a scientist I can't tell
you it's dangerous but I'm not going to
take the
risk so guess about what year um these
mesh routers came out
about the same time as the massive
increase in
cancer same time so that's another
suspect right another so at the same
time that WiFi the mesh routers became a
really big thing that's when cancer took
off especially in young people but same
time as the vaccinations same time as
the co same time as the pandemic
disruption
and the same time as our food supply is
getting probably worse every
day and meanwhile all of our sources of
healthy food are being burned down
because all of our food processing
plants are somehow mysteriously having
fires so
yeah what's that
question yeah lots of them burned down
so we got lots of candidates for
whatever's causing the mortality I don't
know uh there's children
children got a record number of
anti-depressants half a million kids got
an
anti-depressant I would think that
depression is strongly correlated with
every kind of disease isn't it because I
think depression ruins your your ability
to fight off everything just lowers your
whole you know bodily defenses so if
you've got that many kids running into
depression uh and if dep well somebody
Google that can somebody do a search
while we're on here search for whether
depression is indicated in extra
mortality can somebody do that
depression and excess mortality or
cancer any of that it has to be right
like that's so obvious you don't even
need to search for
it two way well two-way qu right two
ways if you're not healthy you could be
depressed that's correct
okay so imagine if it's the cell phone
usage especially heavy since the Tik
Tock I I think Tik tok's kind of a 2019
is when it took off oh same time as all
the cancers oh same time as all the
depression so you've got I I think the
the reason it's so hard to tease out the
excess mortality is that it's
everything that's my guess the reason we
can't identify the excess mortality
cause is it's just everything too too
much depression mostly from the phones I
think U lack of play lack of going
Outdoors because of the phones Food
Supplies going in the toilet the Wi-Fi
mesh routers got put in the uh you
basically everything just everything
fell apart around
2019 well over in Great Britain uh Ian
miles Chung is reporting that the
British government is under pressure to
use the big houses that mostly retired
people have to house illegal immigrants
or let's call them Asylum Seekers so
that's not a thing yet but the pressure
is coming down and the conversation has
turned to you know these old people have
a lot of room in their
house why can't that senior citizen take
a few uh few of these Asylum Seekers now
it hasn't happened
yet but I think it's obvious obviously
going to you know you're going to have a
new roommate from Botswana or something
pretty
soon all right uh there's a rupar of the
day a rupar is a named after somebody
named rupar who has a habit of uh
posting edited videos that look bad
because they were edited here's another
one uh there's a clip going around of
trump saying that the the illegal
migrants are animals animals but of
course they cut out the part where he
was talking about a specific crime that
was caused by specific people so that's
a rupar but of course all the dumb
people are posting that
around and and wokeness reminds us that
um the voter the voter registration with
no
ID there's no way to interpret that
except somebody intentionally trying to
destroy the United
States can we be serious there is no
other
interpretation that's somebody trying to
destroy the country now they may not be
doing it
intentionally they they be so stupid or
hypnotized or something but there's no
way this ends well because in three key
swing States Arizona Texas and
Pennsylvania this is the number
of of Voters who have been registered
with no photo ID no photo ID which means
you don't really know who they are
in Texas just this year which I remind
you is only a few
months 1.3 million in
Texas 1.3 million you think that could
uh change the result of a major
election yeah Pennsylvania over half a
million and in Arizona
220,000 now we also know that the uh the
Biden Administration is flying people in
by the hundreds of thousands to make it
look like the immigration across the
border isn't as bad because the flights
are a little more
hidden so yeah it's exactly what it
looks like they are bringing in millions
of people and then getting them to
register without ID which some say is to
get them to vote but others say the
whole play is to get a ballot mail to
them that can be picked up by democrats
and fill down any way they
want right so Texas is at certainly at
Great risk of going blue because of this
scheme um Trump was has a an opinion
about what to do if other countries
refuse to take back the the migrants and
Trump said on day one I will seal the
border and will begin the largest
domestic deportation operation in the
history of our country he says and then
he says if other countries say they
won't take them back I will say yeah
here they come hold on to your britches
because they're coming
back he's the only person who could do
that he's the only person who could say
the the plane's coming and then the
other country whoever it is says uh you
don't have permission to
land and then Trump says okay well
you're R A NATO what yeah you're R A
NATO
what okay you can
land right now I'm just making up that
an NATO thing but yes of course of
course he will he will just tell them
that Landing is your best play because
I'm going to totally with you if
you don't take these people and
everybody knows he would do it everybody
knows he would do it like it wouldn't be
just a threat he would kneecap him so
hard so yeah he's the only president who
could deport
anybody if that's what you
want JK rowlings becoming sort of a hero
there over in Scotland uh CU she had uh
she was at risk of being jailed for hate
crimes because she likes to say that
trans people are their original gender
which is totally
unacceptable and so that's considered
hate speech but apparently the official
word is that there that what she has
done does not qualify so there's there's
no immediate threat to her but she's
actually said that if other people get
targeted this is what rling said if they
go after any woman for simply calling a
man a man now she's talking about the
trans topic she said I'll repeat that
woman's words and they can charge us
both at once there you
go there you go that's how to do
that that's how to do
it very good JK Rowling and JK Rowling
in that one
act
did more than all of her
books I'm a big fan of her
books but this one thing is more
important than all the other things the
other things were really really good
entertainment like great entertainment
really really great this is better this
is better yep my my respect for JK
Rowling very high and by the way I'm not
even giving you an opinion about the
topic that's separate I just I just like
the method right you can argue about the
topic on your
own all right
uh so the Mark Cuban Saga just gets
funnier and funnier so it started with
Cuban saying Dei was great and arguing
that all it does is make sure you're
looking harder to get all the great
employees that would be overlooked in
the people of color and woman categories
and lgbtq I
guess uh he was eventually educated
online while we all got to watch which
was tremendous and by the way I give
Mark Cuban all kinds of credit for doing
this in public you know I've told you
that all good things come from people
who are not who are not
embarrassed he he's like the ultimate
not embarrassed
guy because he seems to be like getting
through this with no problem whatsoever
but my God that would be embarrassing
for anybody else I think I'm the only
other person that could get through
something like this with no problem
whatsoever and it could be some people
have suggested that it's a big play so
that he can get talked down of Dei in
public I don't think so that's not my
that's not my interpretation I think
what really happened is that he had a
CEO view of what it was and when he said
that even if the CEOs say the word
Equity that what they always mean is
equity of opportunity not making sure
you have a quota but Christopher rufo
showed the receipts and showed them in
the company's own words and the CEO's
own words example after example of the
CEOs do mean it exactly as having equal
outcomes it's very clear they do not
mean it the other way and certainly not
every company but a lot of
them
so Having learned that um it is actually
intentional I think Mark still is of the
of the sense that you know you could you
could interpret it to mean equal
opportunity and he goes on to say that
it's clear that Dei works great because
in his companies as you can see it's
really increasing his
profits does anybody believe that's true
did you know even if it were true do you
think you could track
it do you think oh I I hired two more
black employees so now I'm up to
133% whoa look at those profit
surge well I'm pretty sure if you're if
you're hiring people based on their
qualifications it shouldn't matter too
much what color they
are should it how in the world is that
going to make your profits go up and and
I told you yesterday there was some
study that said it didn't help at all
Dei but I guess he's got to rely on that
he sort of had to retreat so far there
was nothing left but absurdity so he
went to absurdity to imagine that you
could track or that it would even
hypothetically
work has anybody seen a company that
thrived because they added
diversity and I'm in favor of diversity
by the way I'm completely in favor of
diversity and I do think that it would
give you greater insight into your
customers at least you know and your
suppliers and everybody else so yeah I
think I think there's some amount of
diversity that's absolutely a benefit
but if you force
it what do you get you don't get the
benefit of
diversity you get less good employees
because the managers are just trying to
meet their quota and the only way they
can do it is hire the people who apply
and if the people who are qualified are
all applying at Google and apple because
those are better jobs well you don't get
any you don't get any
even if you try really hard to recruit
they still want to work for Apple and
Google because better job why would they
take your
job yeah so watching Christopher rufo
win uh Time After Time Again is really
fun I mean the amount of skill and
energy he's bringing to the fight very
impressive very impressive and uh he
reports that the University of Texas is
closing down their Dei division
however um I think what's going to
happen is red states are going to be
closing down Dei and blue states are
going to be adding it like crazy so I
don't think there's any net decrease in
Dei do
you like if if you're in your little
news bubble you might think because a
lot of people are saying it you might
think Dei is
decreasing I don't think it is I'll bet
you if you measure the number of total
Dei hes I bet it's more this year than
last
year that's that's what I
think
anyway um there was a gifted program in
San Francisco or no in Seattle they had
to cancel them Jason rant is uh talking
about this so Seattle public schools
canceled their gifted program because I
had too many white
students do you know who complained
about
it the cancellation of the gifted
program black parents do you know why
the black parents were
complaining uh not all of them of course
but some black parents were pushing back
even though the reason it was canceled
is because there was too many whites do
you know why the black parents pushed
back because those black parents had
gifted K children and they just took
away the gifted children program for the
black
kids because there weren't enough of
them so the ones that were there just
lost their gifted
program do you know what would be more
useful for a black kid than being in the
same program with other gifted kids of
all types
nothing that'd be like the best thing
you could ever do to a kid put him put
him in a group of people of similarly
exceptional
people number one best thing you could
do best thing you could do and they just
took that away from the the black kids
in Seattle because it wasn't black
enough
wow well the bird flu is
coming do you mind if I just don't talk
about this stupid bird flu that's
apparently going to be our next
pandemic you're okay with that right
blah blah cow had it blah blah a chicken
had it blah blah guy got it from a cow
the the only interesting story about
this is that there's a man in Texas who
apparently got the bird flu from
what they call c contact with dairy
cows makes you
wonder was
it cuz he was hurting them was he
hurting them then he got the bird flu
was he milking the cow was he milking
the cow and he just got some bird
flu was he making love to the cow that's
the only thing I need to
know was it a stump trained cow
all right how many of you ever heard
that have you ever heard of a stump
trained
cow I want I want to see how popular
that is has anybody ever heard of
it there was a
uh there there was a uh top manager
where I used to work at the phone
company who used to have all these uh
these old sayings and I'm going to
horrify those of you who have never
heard what a stump train cow is
it's a cow that will back up to the tree
stump so that the human who wants to
make love would be the proper
height see if you're if you're already
standing on the tree stump you can't
really get the cow where you want it so
the cow has to be trained to back up to
the tree
St so he used to talk about he used to
talk about his co-workers being stump
trained
cows it's kind of funny if you think of
the Democrat Party being stump drained
cows anyway it's a just good it's a good
General
insult now if you say to
yourself how did that manager ever last
in that job well eventually that
eventually that senior manager was
walked out of the building by
security
why was he walked out of the building
for security turns out he made up that
whole story about having a
PhD he was a fraud he he was one of the
top he was one of the top technologists
in the phone company his job I think he
was the head of R&D he was a head of
R&D and he made up his credentials they
were completely made
up I I remember I remember watching a I
got invited to a meeting where we were
going to learn about the
Telecommunications abilities of
satellites because that was sort of
relative relevant to the phone company
because you know we needed to know all
the parts of the system so I remember
going in and one of the people he hired
didn't know any more than he
did and so it was somebody who didn't
know anything about satellites more than
I do giving a primer on satellites and I
I was crying by the time it was done
because it was so obvious that the guy
giving the meeting didn't know anything
about satellites the only thing he
learned is that people who know a lot
about satellites call them
birds so he kept referring to the
satellites as Birds to make it sound
like he he knew all the
lingo goes yeah these birds are up there
in the sky they fly around the Earth in
that geosynchronous orbit that's all he
knew it was hilarious anyway
apparently Israel is killing Iranians
wherever they can find them except in
Iran so far well they've done that in
the past but uh the IDF assassinated
this key kuds Force Commander in Syria
and Lebanon and other places so I guess
they've attacked Damascus and Lebanon
and even an Iranian Embassy in Syria and
uh basically if you're a top Iranian
military person and Israel thinks you
had anything to do
with Hamas they're going to get you
wherever you are so some people are
saying my God this is terrible they're
they blew up an embassy to get this guy
but I'd like to hear their side of
things like are all embassies
equal are they all off bounds andab
bounds I don't know how's that work if
if you knew Hitler was in an embassy
would you let it go
I don't know I don't know where the line
is drawn there but uh certainly it's an
alarming development that it looks like
escalation on the other hand it looks
like it might be just power is the only
thing that controls anything and it's
Israel telling Iran they're going to
kill kill Iranians wherever they leave
home I think that's what's going to
happen the leaders anyway well ex-trump
lawyer John Eastman has been disbarred
over his work with Trump the January 6
stuff and that uh there might be a whole
bunch of other lawyers that have worked
with Trump maybe a hundred that are
facing similar problems this effort to
disbar all these lawyers is it organic
no it's being run by Mega Democrat David
Brock one of one of their dirty trick
people and funded by Soros it's called
the 65 project and it's basically a war
on lawyers who help Republicans
all right
so what do you think of that um I saw
the suggestion a few people who made
this suggestion that if Republicans
don't respond with mutual assured
destruction they will never have another
lawyer so some Republican state needs to
just start picking off
um people but I don't know how that
works with the bar because the bar is
its own process right the bar is not a
legal process is it isn't it a like a
private
process so I don't know how you would
make this work in a red State because
the bar the bar is the bar so it doesn't
mean that they're going to go along with
something like
that good way to totally discredit the
bar
yeah so now you've got an association
that's is supposed to accredit lawyers
that turned into the thing that
discredits lawyers so that's not
ideal um wow I I don't know how many of
these things can be
reversed but I could certainly imagine
Trump doing an executive order to ban
the
bar no I don't think that's going to be
a thing but I don't know this can't
stand let me let me just say it this
way this can't stand you can't let Soros
fund a project to get rid of lawyers and
and take their livelihood away for doing
completely legal things that youve found
a way to make them sound
illegal yeah each day has their own
bar so but but does that mean that in
Florida they would be
conservative I doubt
it I feel like the bar is always just
going to be blue in every state am I
wrong
I feel like lawyers are going to be
2third Democrat no matter where you
go it's a RICO case oh it's a RICO case
yeah it's a conspiracy to
uh yeah it does it does have a little
Rico smell to it doesn't
it well Trump says that November 5th
election day will be Christian
visibility day now he's playing off the
trans visibility day the transis
visibility day let me let me Echo the
people who say that's the most absurd
insulting thing
ever there's nobody more visible than
trans it's the single most visible group
in the entire United States and maybe
you've had enough you know maybe maybe
100
lgbtq uh holidays every year maybe it's
enough maybe we all noticed maybe it's
time to take the Victory lap and say
well now you noticed we don't have to do
this
anymore um with with all due respect by
the way with all due respect I don't
need to notice everything it doesn't
help
me
anyway uh there's claims that Israel is
targeting intentionally targeting Aid
workers what would be the argument for
that why would Israel intentionally
target the people trying to bring
Aid because it makes Israel look good no
because it helps them win the
war I don't think so I mean are they
trying to starve out the civilians so
that they'll leave the area to make it
safer to kill the bad guys I don't know
I don't know this one doesn't pass the
smell test there is video of people who
don't look like combatants being killed
by the Israeli military but we don't
know why they killed them have you seen
the videos and then the the description
says oh it's just some innocent young
teenagers going back home or something
and then you see them get wiped out by a
bomb well how do you know they were just
innocent teenagers you can't tell by the
picture so here here's what I would
advise you don't believe
anything from a war zone don't believe
that you know one side is killing the
aid workers even if it's true there's no
way to believe that stuff and to me it
doesn't really pass the sniff test
because I I can't see any argument where
Israel would be you know in their little
secret War planning room saying you know
what would really make a difference is
if we kill the aid
workers does that make sense like yeah I
I don't see
it um here's a funny update remember
Amazon was testing these just walk out
stores where there would be nobody to
check you out you just grab stuff and
you just walk out and their amazing
technology would sense
what was leaving with you and it would
just bill you based on knowing what you
got that was pretty pretty amazing
technology and in fact it was before we
knew AI was out there so I mean it was
really impressive given it was pre- AI
well here's an update from Fat American
capitalist that's a name of a account on
X turns out that the way they were doing
it is they had cameras and they had uh
hundreds of low paid Indian workers just
watching what people picked
up there there were people just watching
him on camera say all right it looks
like looks like he went for the Ivory
soap Ivory soap and now he's looking at
the
noodles okay okay cup of
noodles that that was their
technology Indians writing it
down that that that great new so it
looks like they may have ended that
experiment so so there's that all right
ladies and
gentlemen we're going to do a little
experiment here where I see if I can end
the main feed and just keep the locals
people on we'll see how that goes um
because we're going to go private
because the locals people get extra they
get the behind the curtains extra there
won't be any secrets today but they get
extra all right thanks for joining I'll
see you tomorrow same place same time
watch out for that birth
control all right let's see if I can end
everybody else locals stay with me stay
live
