looks like the stock market is up a
little bit it's a little bit sleepy at
the end of the
year but uh we're going to have a great
time soon as I get my comments working
here success
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams because
it's the best thing that ever happened
to you but if you'd like to take this
experience up to levels that nobody can
even understand with their tiny shiny
human brains all you need for that is a
tankered shell wait no you need a cuper
mug or a glass of tanker Chels or Stein
a canteen sugar flask or vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dop aminia of
the day the thing that makes everything
better including Mondays is called the
simultaneous sip it happens now
go oh so
good well I have to start by saying that
last night in the man cave that I do
just for the subscribers to locals uh we
discovered that you can can make
pictures of public figures using grock
their new image generator and you could
have those public figures appear to be
uh very interested in each other now
it's not going to do porn but if you'd
like to see a public figure making out
with another public figure apparently
you can do that because uh people were
sending me a lot of images of me making
out with Michelle Obama and
a few other
people so after that was done I said to
myself
huh I wonder I wonder how well this
works so I started putting in images of
myself and other beautiful famous woman
just to
[Laughter]
see now it doesn't do anything uh you
know that's beyond PG it's all PG rated
or maybe G but uh it is weirdly
fascinating to see how how just picture
perfect I can do of myself with another
person I've never met in person it is it
is scary so let me tell
you yeah let me tell you the uh the
future is going to be wild meanwhile uh
the X app is the number one news app at
the moment imagine being the one that
the news wants to kill and becomes the
new the number one news app I like that
but the problem is as others have
pointed
out isn't X only the number one news app
because it's where people go to make fun
of all the
news if all the mainstream news went
away
tomorrow there wouldn't be anything to
talk about on X X wouldn't have anything
it would just be independent people who
look at the mainstream news and decide
how true it is but if we didn't have any
there wouldn't be much to talk
about
so
um according to the New England Journal
of Medicine if you're using AI as your
doctor it could have even worse
cognitive biases than human
doctors so they did a test and they
found that depending on how you prime
the AI what question you ask you might
get a response that's a little biased
even more biased than a human
doctor so well AI seems to be an amazing
thing for knowing what question to ask
your doctor it's really good for that by
the way I don't think the doctors love
it but if you want to just know if
you're asking the right questions and
did you leave anything out talk to AI
before you have your doctor appointment
it really makes a difference it's great
doesn't have all the exact answers yet
but it certainly is good way to check
the you've covered all your
bases um according to uh the new Atlas
publication chronic pain can be lowered
by better quality diet regardless of
body weight so if you improve your diet
so you're not eating junk food junk Feud
junk
food um
apparently um apparently it uh makes
your pain go go less now I have to admit
that's not one I would have known if you
had just asked
Scott um but it makes sense because a
good diet will give you less full body
inflammation and you would think that
pain would be quite related to
inflammation depends on the pain but
mostly so yeah apparently eating well
makes you feel
good
surprise um there's a study in yahu FAS
Older Workers are the happiest
workers you know why that makes sense
the older workers are the happiest
workers because after a certain age
you're just delighted that you have a
job at
all if you're over 65 and you have any
kind of a job you're probably delighted
you know uh turns out a lot of people at
that age don't even need the job it's
just the only way they can have a social
connection so they they love just having
their social connection and hey a little
little extra money doesn't hurt so that
doesn't surprise me but uh what's
interesting about worker happiness is
that workers are happiest when they're
youngest and when they're
oldest people are the least happy in the
prime of their
life so during those child raising
years not so so good at all nope not so
good so before you have children pretty
happy after your children moved down of
the house pretty happy but uh raising
children turns out it's hard to be happy
there's a different kind of Happiness
though that when kids are in your life
which most of you have
experienced you you have this funny
experience where if you just took any
parent and you say hey excuse me are you
a parent well yes I've got a 10-year-old
and a
12-year-old uh and you say well how's
the quality of your day today they'd say
well not not great I got to drive this
kid all over and one of them sick so I
think I got their cold and and you know
way too many things to do and I've got
to work late but I also have to go to my
kids game it's it's a
nightmare but if you asked them are you
happy they would say oh yeah I'm really
happy so during the middle of your life
if you have kids in your life
you would find that people will
self-identify as happy because they're
really glad they have kids and they have
meaning and they have something
important in their lives but it's really
hard so the reason I'm talking about
this is that uh we have this decline in
birth
rate and the the biggest reason there's
a decline in birth rate in my opinion is
it's just too damn hard to be a par a
parent now I've been a just a stepparent
which usually is
easier but I can tell you if I did not
if if I hadn't entered that when I'd
already made money so that I could
afford things like you know if somebody
has to watch somebody or you know
basically money makes everything easier
obviously but if I didn't have money and
I tried to have kids or step kids it
looks really hard it looks really hard
so uh we need to make it easier to be a
parent I guess that's my bottom line
there according to Global newswire Nano
nuclear energy and dig host technology
are going to get together to make a
micro
reactor in Upstate New York they'll have
16 mowatt of power now this is only
interesting because the trend for micro
nuclear reactors which I and all the
smarter people think are going to be the
future
um and at the same time just more to
that point the paler
CTO is saying that the uh our Fleet of
ships seagoing ships um should be
powered by
nukes and that it would lower inflation
now there's an idea imagine if the only
thing we did was uh authorize and
approve and build uh shipper shipping
contain what would you call it the big
ships that have contain on um if you
turn those into
micronuclear the way where the way our
nuclear submarines already work if we
already have the technology and it's
been working Forever on nuclear
submarines would it be that much harder
to put it on a tanker I'd worry more
about Pirates then but I suppose that's
not the biggest problem in the
world according to unusual whales and
the Fortune Magazine uh first reported
55% of hiring managers notice employees
juggling side gigs during work
hours 55% of your employees are doing a
second job while they're on your clock
55% now that was always true you always
had people doing side gigs but
55% the uh the character Wall-E in the
dilber
comic uh was patterned on one of my
co-workers who used to sit in the
cubicle behind me and he would run a
second business from his
cubicle his first business was you know
whatever the job was but he had he' made
a mistake with some uh
confidential um with some confidential
information and they said well we're not
going to fire you because you've been a
good employee except for this one
mistake but we can never promote
you so he had a job where he could never
be oted and he was a young
man so instead of doing his job you know
and trying as hard as he could he just
start he just started a second business
and he just ran his second business from
his cubicle he was doing lighting and
was it Lighting and Sound I think it was
mostly sound for big outdoor events so
I'd hear him answer the phone under the
name of his other
company that's the funny part answering
the phone as the other company anyway
um yeah that's a pretty big problem I
don't know how you would manage an
employee without assuming that they have
a second
job um Kyle bass who knows a lot about
investing and he follows China he says
China's economy is experiencing uh its
largest financial collapse since
2002 so bond yields are down and banks
are he call he says insolvent and
leverag that 350% of reported
GDP now I saw in the comments somebody
saying that that might be a little bit
alarmist and that China is a centralized
economy and they have lots of tools that
they can make sure their Banks don't
fail stuff like that so they're probably
not you know it's not like they're
minutes from falling off the edge of the
Earth or anything but uh one more
indication that China is not
thriving
um it was a alarming
report at the New York young Republicans
Club I guess a a young adviser to
president Trump a 27-year-old named Alex
brtz who i' hadd never heard of but he
has apparently a good reputation people
said good things about him but he was
speaking uh on
stage and he just started slurring his
words as if maybe a stroke and then he
just collapsed and like you know dragged
down the whole Lecter and
so he I guess he came around
backstage and he was you know alert and
seemed okay but then reportedly he
passed out again in the hospital on the
way to the hospital so we don't know
what's wrong with young Alex brtz but uh
a lot of Republicans seem to like him
and we wish him the best so keep an eye
on
that um yeah some are saying it was
dehydration I don't know Does
dehydration cause you to slur your words
maybe I don't
know uh well CNN's getting some heat you
know I saw this story and I kind of
passed by it the first time so I
remember seeing the video of CNN
apparently being there when one of the
notorious uh Syrian prisons was being
liberated after the rebels took over
from the government and it showed one
particular Syrian prisoner who was being
freed and I remember people saying that
he didn't look like he was a real
prisoner because he didn't look like he
was you know damaged Enough by the time
in prison and now we find out that the
alleged prisoner was actually one of the
one of the prisons notorious torturers
so he worked for the government he
wasn't a prisoner he was apparently
pretending to be a prisoner ER for the
benefit of CNN's
cameras and so he just acted like he was
being discovered in the
prison did that really
happen um it it makes me wonder if the
if the story that is fake news is
entirely
fake do we know he wasn't just recently
put in that prison I don't
know I don't
know um
so we'll keep an eye on
that uh did you know according to repor
in Wall Street Journal that people will
change their spending habits based on
whether their party is in power and won
the election so when Democrats win
national election they spend more
because they feel more
optimistic and same with Republicans so
at the moment Republicans are looking at
more big ticket stuff like cars and
houses uh because they have optimism
about
Trump and I have uh two comments about
the Democrats number one uh it's going
to be tough to be a Democrat for a few
more years because they hated it the
first time Trump was President they're
probably not going to like it that much
better this time uh but I wonder does
this make democrats undatable for four
years I wasn't planning to date one but
if you're so unhappy that you're
changing your spending
habits and they do seem to have genuine
you know mental distress over
this imagine if you're in the dating
pool it seems like dating anybody who
was a Democrat would be a bad deal right
now because they're all going to be
unhappy and bitching about stuff if you
if you were a dated
Republican hey how's it going Republican
great looks like the golden golden age
is kicked off
got any problems H none really that's
worth mentioning everything seems to be
going great have you caught the vibe the
Vib is all positive a lot of unity going
on hey Democrat how are you doing well
it's the end of
democracy we it hasn't happened yet but
any moment now the big old Orange
monster we'll be stealing our democracy
and our bodily autonomy and uh we're all
doomed we're all
doomed so I'm going to say uh maybe
maybe a little less dating of democrats
for four
years
um so Trump for the first time ever his
favorability ratings are higher than his
unfavorability ratings according to RCP
average Dy wire is talking about
this the first time so did you know that
never before has he had more people are
favorable than
unfavorable and you might ask yourself
why is
that what what is he doing
right and the answer is
everything you as I said before he ran
the greatest campaign uh even the people
on the losing end are saying
consistently okay the Republicans were
really smart Trump ran a great campaign
okay what he did was smart you know and
it's just one after another uh the
people in the losing end are saying yep
they just did better he was smarter van
Jones is saying it I've seen Jessica tof
saying that it was brilliant to ship the
migrants to the blue cities so even the
Democrats are
noticing that the the side that looks
for merit instead of
identity did way
better let me say it again
the team that says Merit should be the
thing you look at outperform the team
that says identity should be the thing
you look
at what what did they think was going to
happen as I've said before Dei destroys
everything it touches and it destroys
the fastest and
hardest whatever dii touches soonest and
most aggressively and that would be the
Democrats the entire Democrat Party was
soon you know they they were fast on the
Dei and most aggressive because people
are watching and it it's completely
destroyed just as the theory would
suggest
but I saw a uh podcast it looked like a
Democrat poster who was doing some uh
some focus groups and what the focus
groups were saying and that it was a
focus group of people who were who had
been non-trump supporters usually
Democrats and had voted for him for the
first time so they didn't vote him for
the first two they didn't vote for him
in the first two elections but this time
they did and so the question is why now
why why would you change your mind now
and do you know
why the reason is not
surprising but it was kind of
encouraging here's the reason that
Democrats at least and it's a focus
group so it's not a it's not a
scientific poll but several people said
the same thing which is Meaningful to
me that they were a little unsure about
Trump still but they liked that he
picked RFK
Jr so RFK
Jr did move votes because his
credibility and people liked his topic
especially the food and the you making
sure our drugs are safer so RFK Jr's
message was so strong and he was so
credible that when he said you know what
I can work with Trump as long as I could
get my stuff done and then Trump helps
him get his stuff
done um people love
that and I love it too because one of my
biggest issues was our food supply and I
didn't see anything that was going to be
done by just Republicans so you throw
RFK Jr in there and I'm like whoa you
suddenly went from most of the things I
like but not even my top
issue didn't even get my top issue my
number one
issue but now they got it now they got
my top issue
food and they got all the other issues
too so you throw that in there you throw
in Elon Musk and you know uh basically
the argument is that Trump assembled the
Democrats of the 1990s because even
Trump was a democrat in the 90s
so um yeah between you know David Sachs
and Tulsa gabard and Bill Amman he's not
in the team but he's you know switch
sides uh Joe Rogan switch sides not on
the
team but yeah it looks like this pirate
ship idea of bringing people from more
than one group together is having a
modeling effect on the public so when
the public sees these public figures can
work together you know being being as
diametrically opposed as you could
possibly be in general but when they had
something they both agree on they could
work together that is really
unifying that that's as unifying as you
could possibly get I don't want
everybody to agree with me I want people
who do agree on the things that we do
agree on to work on that you know and if
that's the only thing Trump gets Unity
on is is that yeah for the things we
agree on well we can work with that like
the border for example that'd be amazing
it'd be better than anything we've ever
seen in this country
really so the pirate ship is
working um meanwhile Trump continues to
do what I call the new CEO move to make
a good first impression and hit the
ground running as they say and to make
it look like he's just succeeded before
he even Starts Now succeeding before you
start Ed is just so strong persuasion
it's just completely baller and so and
so now the uh soft Bank
CEO masaan is going to visit the US the
US today and he's going to make an
announcement with
Trump so I love my de facto president I
love the fact that the world is treating
Trump like the one they need to talk to
they understand he's def back to a
president not regular president but
still everybody's just using common
sense and what is the Biden
Administration complaining about so far
they're
not I don't know why you you do kind of
expect them to complain a little bit
that um Trump's acting like a president
but I feel like they get it too you know
somebody needs to act like a president
and they don't have anybody who can do
it so
so apparently uh soft Bank CEO is going
to put a100 billion investment in the US
