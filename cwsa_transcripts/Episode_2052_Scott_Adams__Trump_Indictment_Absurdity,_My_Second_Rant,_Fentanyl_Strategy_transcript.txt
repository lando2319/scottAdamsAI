oh
good morning everybody and welcome
to the finest live stream in the history
of live streams and today your
experience is going to reach levels
which I don't know if you could even
handle it it'll be so awesome
but if you'd like to take your
experience up with the rest of us join
us join us let's take this experience up
yes
I also almost want to make a joke but
don't ruin my flow
don't ruin my flow that was a
just kidding but anyway all you need is
a couple of my eye
do you know that when my flow gets
Disturbed
it really does have this ripple effect
I'm going to try to regain my and here's
the way I'm going to do it
as I was saying if you want to bring
this experience up a level
somebody mentioned Stormy Daniels in the
comments
and it was just too good like okay no
don't make a joke about bringing your
experience up
and mentioned Stormy Daniels do not do
it and then I'm trying to think at the
same time and I'm thinking no no Stormy
Daniels dope no and then I lost my place
so I'm going to have to do the Stormy
Daniels joke first before I could even
do this simultaneous step it's just down
in my head you did that to me
if you'd like to take this experience up
to levels that only Stormy Daniels could
provide
all you need is a cup of mug or a glass
of tanker cells is dying against yoga
flask a vessel of any kind see much
better that word
and join me now for the young parallel
pleasure of the dopamine here the day
thing makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous sip now we're
back in the flow all right it's working
now go
ah
all right now we're on track right on
track
um
do you all know that uh Dilbert although
canceled worldwide is running on the
locals platform at scottadams.locals.com
and people have asked me Scott these are
new Comics but where are all the old
ones that used to be on the archive on
dilbert.com
I don't have a solution for that but I
probably will
um please understand that when you get
canceled worldwide
it creates extra work
so I'm a little bit busy for the next
few weeks but it's all good stuff
um honestly being canceled is one of the
best things that's ever happened to me I
did not plan it that way I really didn't
but it could not have worked out better
honestly it could not have been better
all right but enough about me
uh Elon Musk says he's got a new plan
for uh Twitter
the Twitter feed so you'll see the first
things you'll see is people you follow
doesn't it seem like that should have
been the first thing you saw before
the people I follow were not the first
things I was saying like I unders I was
definitely missing people I was
following
but I thought
wouldn't it make perfect sense that the
people you follow were the first ones
you saw is that really different
but I I guess it will be different
after the people you follow next would
be verified accounts so people who paid
to be verified and then third would be
unverified accounts
so
I don't know what percentage of my
trolls are unverified accounts
but at least half
so that'd be good at least half of them
are just you know bad people doing bad
things
so I think I think and that must says
that the verified accounts are a
thousand times harder to gain by bot
Central armies so we should see this
will happen in the next few weeks
so we should see some kind of big
difference in Twitter
but I do I do want to make sure that I
don't miss
people who I don't follow I mean the
people that I don't follow are sometimes
the most interesting ones simply because
they disagree with you
so
this is a good thing to try I think I
think it's the right direction but we'll
see how it works out
um
how many of you saw my rant
yesterday
was it yesterday
yeah
uh how many of you think that that ranch
will go viral
do you think it'll go viral
I don't
you know I won't go viral
well it could you know it might go a
little viral just among you know a
certain part of the population but it
won't cross over to the rest do you know
why
it's too dangerous
it's too dangerous yeah yeah now if
there's something in there they could
take out of context because all of the
you know everything's political in this
environment if they could find some
political way to to tank me they'll do
it but there's no way that they're going
to show the whole rant because it's too
honest
it's just too honest
and there's a there is a degree of
honesty that the system can't handle and
that was well beyond the limit they can
handle so you're not going to see that
that will never go viral
promise you
um
I've seen more people speculating what I
speculate that the reason Kamala Harris
acts the way she does in public is that
she's drunk
now
have I ever been in trouble before for
saying somebody seemed drunk in public
yes I have
I would say it about Hillary Clinton but
not every time she spoke
I've never said Hillary was drunk every
time she spoke because it didn't look
like it it was just that sometimes she
looked like maybe she had some wine for
lunch or something
but Kamala
does look drunk pretty much every time
she speaks
now I'm not saying she is
because the story would be just as
shocking if she were not
imagine if she acts like that naturally
I mean literally that would be scary I
would be a little more comfortable if I
found out she had been drinking because
at least you can stop drinking you know
for a few minutes
um
but
here's my current speculation
just speculation so this is based on you
know living a life and knowing a lot of
people and just sort of being in this
world
but here's my speculation I think she's
like Raj on remember the show
The Big Bang Theory
The Big Bang Theory there was a
character Raj who couldn't speak to
women unless he was drinking alcohol he
literally just couldn't speak
and I feel like Kamala has fear of
public speaking
and that when she thinks she's going to
speak I think she has to drink
it's just my speculation and here's what
it's based on very scant Clues very
scant number one she acts drunk
quite often when she's talking number
two the over cackling
seems to be a fear of public speaking
do you get that the the laughing too
hard is sort of like buying your time in
a public situation so it's not just a
speech but also you know she's answering
questions I think the cackle is a
delaying tactic because she doesn't want
to speak
I think that people who are afraid of
speaking in public might sometimes say
to themselves well you know
after a glass of wine I'm a lot better
just one glass of wine
but then you have two because if one is
good
two might be great and
that's my theory is that she drinks
because she's not a comfortable public
speaker now I did a little Googling
and found out that in two occasions
she's helped people who were bad at
public speaking she gave them advice one
was somebody who was breaking down in
public and she helped him out and
another was some young girls and she was
giving them some advice about how to be
comfortable public speaking
how many other
how many other uh
National politicians have ever
advise somebody on public speaking I've
never heard of it
it seems like that would be maybe
something in her mind or something she
cared about so there's there's a little
bit of a tell
that she cares about public speaking and
being comfortable
it would also explain my biggest mystery
about her
what in the in the beginning of the
primary I thought that she would be the
strongest candidate and that was based
entirely upon seeing her
performance during Congressional
hearings where she'd be one of the
people interviewing people and I thought
wow she looks really put together and
when she's interviewing people and
asking tough questions like a prosecutor
she actually seemed on it again
and then I learned that the only thing
she does capably is blaming other people
of crimes
that's the only thing she can do so it
actually explains why she was a public
prosecutor and you know Attorney General
of the state is that blaming people of
stuff she can do really well
but as soon as she gets out of the mode
of blaming stuff you know politicians
criminals as soon as she's not blaming
somebody she doesn't know what to do
so she has one mode that she's good at
oh I'm blaming you of a crime I'm
blaming you of some racism I'm blaming
you of being a bad politician I blame
you I blame you I blame you but as soon
as she's out of blame mode she's it
looks like she can't speak
she's got one mode
so that's on me because I saw her
coincidentally in her prosecutor mode
when she was doing these Congressional
investigations and I thought well
there's somebody who knows how to do
this investigating stuff it looks like
that would be a skill that you could
transfer into the larger leadership
Realm but apparently she doesn't have
those skills she's just good at blaming
people for crimes
a very a very narrow skill
but got her to vice president
and so I'm going to start calling her
instead of a Kamala Harris I think I'll
call her uh drunquila
sort of like count drunkula
drunkula Harris and and here's my take
if she's not drunk
that's not the good news
now the good news is not that Scott
you're wrong she wasn't she doesn't ever
do that she was completely sober that's
the bad news
I'm being a little bit kind by saying I
hope she's drunk because if she acts
like this literally and by the way this
is not hyperbole
doesn't it sound like it that difference
between you know a joke and reality is
now completely merged I'm not kidding
if this is her real self
I'm way more afraid than if she has some
drinks and maybe sometimes she can make
sober decisions when we're not watching
that would be the best case scenario
sort of like Winston Churchill
he drank a lot
but seemed to get the job done right
so it's not the it's not the drinking
that would bother me it would be if
she's not drunk
[Music]
um
Putin is now I guess he's a an accused
war criminal because there's some Rome
statute 123 nations are obliged to
arrest Putin if he shows up in their
country
so remember how uh Putin was always
showing up at all these g20s and he was
he was always visiting other countries
and he had this really high profile
which I think was really good for Russia
like it gave you an impression of Russia
as you know like a number two or number
three in the world stage and you know
real involved in world affairs and you
know one of the people you should take
seriously
but now
but now uh he can't even travel to most
countries without being worried about
getting arrested
what do you think would happen if Putin
got arrested
in another country
and actually held
do you think that over in Russia his
cronies would say oh we'd better do
everything to get him out of there
threaten lore Etc or with the people
back in Russia say
well looks like we all got a promotion
am I wrong I think if some other country
picked up Russia picked up Putin there
of course would be lots of noise oh stop
that we're gonna nuke you but do you
think that they would actually feel bad
because whoever is number two in line or
thinks they might be number two there
might be a number of people who think
they have a shot at it wouldn't they all
be happier if Putin were gone and it's
not their fault
well it's not our fault he's just sort
of not available so I guess the rest of
us will have to figure out who's in
charge but it wasn't us it was that
other country so
it feels like it would be the best case
scenario for the Russians themselves
because even the worst
the worst of the leaders who might try
to take over and be their own little you
know despot
even they would think well I just got
promoted one one level I'm a little bit
closer to the top today
yeah no that's not mind reading that's
speculation that's different
so I I enjoy it when somebody says Scott
are you mind reading because that's
actually a good question
speculation is I don't know what they're
thinking but I'm imagining what Ordinary
People would do in this situation that's
just speculation
but if I said those people are thinking
X that's mind reading
that's mind reading and that would be
dumb
all right
um so Putin can't go too many places
that's kind of a bummer for him
over at CNN the cats on the roof
and by that I mean CNN's Aaron Burnett
was talking to some Panda expert about
the revelations about the payments
from Chinese companies and other
companies to the bidens directly and
indirectly
and this is this is what she said
so this is this is Aaron burdell and CNN
so again from a layperson that doesn't
look good
that doesn't look good
she continued before asking Goodman who
was her guest if he found the records to
be damaging legally
so apparently the expert said there
there's probably nothing legally
that's illegal and I agree with that
probably not there's probably nothing
illegal but even even their experts said
but as early looks unethical
now if you've got
CNN's Aaron Burnett you know stirring to
hint just a little bit of a suggestion
of a hint that the Biden crime Herald
family is exactly what it looks like
exactly what it looks like it might not
be illegal
it might not be I don't know but you
don't want it it's definitely something
you don't want
now my understanding is there's some
Marco Polo document that documents you
know hundreds of crimes that Hunter
Biden did and that might be true too
but also might be hundreds of crimes
that are sort of theoretical like
whatever whatever the hell Trump is
being accused of now stuff that you
wouldn't normally pursue
for anybody
but I'm I'm open to the possibility that
they're genuine crimes I mean certainly
with his gun gun situation there was
something that looked like a crime
well the you know
if you're paying for access
is that a crime
can you not charge for an introduction
I've never heard of that being a crime
you can well that's if you didn't if you
didn't register as a foreign
foreign whatever lobbyists or something
but even that doesn't get to even that
typically doesn't get uh prosecuted
right
there are lots of people who've done the
same thing but they're
sort of you know as long as they
admitted after the fact it's not the
biggest deal in the world
yeah well I guess that's selected
prosecution too depends how much you
like the person if you like them it's no
big deal if you don't like them
arrest them
well here's what they're now saying on
CNN at least I haven't seen it yet the
walls are closing in on Trump
have you seen that yet has anybody on
CNN said the walls are closing in
and I'm pretty sure that they have
somebody on retainer whose only job it
is to say the walls are closing in
like one of one of the anti-trump
you know opinion writers you know they
have their opinion writers were just the
anti-trumper you know go-to team
even they won't do it but no word yet on
MSNBC
MSNBC I think they're probably still
committed yeah they're still committed
to being nothing even similar to news
to be as far away from anything that's
like a legitimate news entity as you
could possibly be
so if you're making CNN look like the
reasonable ones uh that's quite a
statement and MSNBC I think they're
doing it well Jonathan Turley weighed in
on these alleged indictments that are
coming for Trump and the Manhattan
office and Alvin Bragg the D.A
and
um you're so Jonathan Charlie puts it
uh
he says Trump faces serious legal
threats blah blah blah but the New York
case could be easily dismissed outside
of a jurisdiction like New York where
Bragg can count on highly motivated
judges and jurors
so Charlie who knows what he's talking
about you know he's one of the
reasonable people in the world says
basically it's only going forward
because New York
is not a reasonable place
that's your starting point that this
wouldn't work in a reasonable State it's
only that New York is broken
that's even happening now that's a good
starting place for the conversation
uh Charlie is branding this America's
Got Trump
I that's the funny version of the walls
are closing it like from the people who
can see what's happening it's like
America's Got Trump and apparently could
it be could any of this be televised
okay is it possible that this will be
televised and it would actually be like
a reality show America's Got Trump we
got him this time we gotcha Trump
I would kind of enjoy that
I sort of like to see it
honestly I'd like to see it I don't
think there's any chance that Trump will
be handcuffed because that would be just
handing him the election but anything is
possible
um
and apparently the Hillary Clinton
campaign I'm reminded Again by Jonathan
Turley in writing in the hill or at
least is printed in the hill
um
that the Hillary Clinton's campaign hid
the steel dossier payments in other ways
words they paid to have the steel
dossier created but they laundered those
payments as legal expenses
as opposed to a campaign expense which
it clearly was
do you think anybody was saying that
Hillary should be picked up and
handcuffed of course not she just paid a
five
she paid a fine that was it
now it's not exactly the same situation
but on the other hand it's exactly the
same situation
if you know what I mean it's different
but it's exactly the same meaning that
they're both being treated politically
in my opinion now I think the right way
to treat it is politically by the way
and the right way is the way Hillary is
cheated
I'm actually glad that Hillary was not
put in jail for that steel dossier
because if you if you start going down
that road
than a lot of political stuff is going
to be a jailable offense and I'm not
sure that's in our best interest
if you catch them and you make it news
and it's part of the campaign and you
know maybe information is a better way
to go I'm not really in favor of going
hard against candidates especially
losing candidates that's not a good look
for the Republic
so I would go easy on politicians at the
highest level anyway I would go easy on
them for the what I call the technical
violations
they're skeevy and they're sketchy and
they're unethical but if you put them in
jail it's just a whole different game
so so I uh let me say as clearly as
possible I do not believe in equal
justice for all I believe that our
leaders should be treated and treated
better than the rest of us
has anybody ever said that
as long as I apply it to both sides I
feel like it's a completely
reasonable thing to say yeah the whole
uh you know nobody's above the law
I get that nobody's above the law but
you still have to run the law for the
benefit of the citizens
um
right no people should not pull their
money from Banks because the January 6th
thing Do Not Crash the economy of the
United States over a protest that's not
the way to go I'm seeing that suggestion
that's not a good suggestion yeah yeah
you should drop that right away
I'm okay with the protest but don't
destroy your own economy that sounds
like China talking
I mean seriously if I had to guess I'd
say you were a Chinese agent with that
idea that's not any kind of a patriotic
idea
it's the worst idea of all time
protest good
protest good
you know safe protest crashing the
economy now absolutely not worst idea
ever
I don't care who's pushing it it's a
dumb idea it's like really bad idea
really bad idea worst idea I've ever
heard
in the history of ideas it's the worst
one
all right uh here's the other thing
we're not talking about why is this not
a race story because the prosecutor is
Elvin Bragg he's a black man Trump is uh
usually unfairly accused of being a
giant racist you don't think race has
anything to do with this
you don't think if the roles were
reversed that's all we'd be talking
about of course we would of course we
would and of course it's racial it's not
entirely racial it's more political than
racial but it's also racial
it's also racial
um so Soros indirectly funded Alvin
Bragg and other so-called Progressive
prosecutors and I guess the way it's
done is at least in part is through an
organization called color of change
color of change so I I read that today
and I thought well who are they so color
of change is a
group
who has both white and black numbers and
they're fighting for a variety of social
improvements they could broadly be
called systemic racism
so some of the things which this group
has accomplished
as getting NCAA athletes paid in
California
get on the page for racial Justice
because there are so many black athletes
I guess
that's real important work that um I
don't think anybody cared about
nobody
and uh let's see what else have they
done some valuable stuff
uh they've stopped some apps that were
predatory predatory lending
and they've stopped weddings at
Plantation sites so no more weddings at
places where slavery was a thing
uh those are the things that are listed
but then there are also things where
they're trying to get uh
um Progressive candidates elected
so
so apparently that's that's happened
now
how is this not racist
it's racist right it's an entire
organization working for
you know one group and and I looked at
like a picture of the people who worked
for them and I was I was pleased that
with the group photo there were a number
of white faces
who were also working for justice and
they were working together as a group
and I wondered to myself huh
you know if the actual number of people
actually had a pretty good number I
don't know maybe 20 or something I mean
that's pretty significant 20 looked like
they were white but then I looked at the
official documentation for the group
there I don't think there are any white
people
when they advertise their group
just sort of a racist thing they just
show the Black Faces as members of the
group but when they actually do a
photograph
they do have a good number of white
members
interesting that they wouldn't focus on
them or or show that it's a bipartisan
group I mean you think it'd be stronger
if we're bipartisans right
so anyway it looks like a racist group
and but not all racism is poorly
intended it might have good intentions
um but a lot of racism happens just sort
of
because that's the way the world works
all right
um
somebody named John Anthony Castro who
apparently has a million dollars to
waste uh he's talking about the fact
that Trump said
ask people to protest is coming election
or is coming indictment
now is Trump saying protest just that
one word protest
is that uh suggesting people should do
illegal and dangerous things
when you hear the word protest in the
United States do you just immediately
think oh danger violence or do you think
it's the basis upon which our country is
built the most fundamental right we have
of free speech and protest
now I think they're calling for protest
is entirely entirely fair weather is a
good idea or not all right that's a
separate question it might not be a good
idea
I think it would be a bad idea actually
I think that a good idea would be to let
it play out and then Trump wins on the
landslide because it's so obvious that
the system is corrupt
that would be with the way I'd do it now
I think protest can also be verbally
meaning that people like me can say oh
this is clearly you know nothing like
justice not even close so I don't want
to you know suggest that anybody hits
the streets but
uh I guess there's some concern that
they might so this Twitter user John
Anthony Castro says New Yorkers if they
try to January 6 a New York courthouse
show up with bats time to put these Mega
mfers in their place
I'm donating 1 million toward armed
security no more uh effing around if
we're going to take this prick down we
have to do it together
now my first
thought about this is that
um
no story that involves bats
ever works out just the way you hope it
would
first observation that's more of a
simulation thing as soon as the word
bats is part of the story you know this
isn't going to go in a good direction
right there's nothing nothing good
started with bats
can you think of any happy story this
started with bats flew out of a cage and
dropped money on everybody no no never
bats
were used in this battle between them no
good no nothing with bats
but uh
I thought this was a great great idea by
the
by probably a Democrat because if you're
going to take on the greatest supporters
of the Second Amendment the way to do it
is with bats
and and let me extend that if ever there
comes a civil war between red and blue
America
do not take your ARS if you have them
Democrats take your bats
those bats are really going to be
effective against the people who are the
biggest proponents of the Second
Amendment
so good luck with that
now I do not recommend the violence with
bats or guns or anything else in fact I
don't even think you should get hit the
streets about this right but
uh but Batman I'm going to just call him
Batman John Anthony Castro so Batman has
a plan that might be the worst plan I've
ever heard but I do hope he spends a
million dollars on armed security
because that would be funny
I'd just like him to spend a million
dollars on armed security
remember I said that maybe the only way
to do something about fentanyl demand
just on the demand side would be to
provide fentanyl for free
and make it cheaper than the cartels and
maybe put them out of business
turns out the Vancouver is doing exactly
that so Vancouver is doing some kind of
oh there we go we're back so the idea
would be that if you had a prescription
you could give fentanyl powder but the
quality control and the quantity would
be you know carefully controlled so that
the odds of getting an overdose would be
much lower
uh
and apparently substituting fentanyl for
anything won't work do you know why do
you know why you can't say hey hey we
won't give you fentanyl but here's this
free cocaine or free heroin or something
like that do you know why
it's because the fentanyl is better
so the people who are addicts they're
not going to do
the second choice
they're just not going to do that
so they do need the fentanyl or they're
just going to get it illegally because
the illegal fentanyl would be better
than legal heroin or legal anything so
you're gonna have to meet him at
fentanyl or they're just going to go get
it
uh
so
all I will say about this is that I'm
glad somebody's trying it
I'm glad somebody is trying it now if
you ask me would you bet that this will
work I'd probably bet against it
and the only reason I'd bet against it
is that everything we've tried hasn't
worked am I right
it would almost it wouldn't even matter
what it was if it sounded like the best
idea in the world
the best idea in the world
I'd still say well nothing's ever worked
before so probably not this but you have
to try it somebody's got to try it so I
say you know Standing Ovation to
Vancouver for putting themselves out
there trying something
good work I wouldn't rule it out
good work
I was reminded in the comments to back
up on on the Trump
indictment story so Vivek ramaswamy is
calling for Republican candidates to
disavow or to you know talk out against
this illegal looking indictment I won't
say illegal looking let me say that it's
obviously a political indictment
obviously a political dime everybody can
see it well everybody who pays attention
can see it
so
um and I was reminded to say that Vivek
is picking up free money absolutely yeah
so that's another smart
just a smart play by Vivek because if
you're if you're a Republican and you're
not speaking out against a political
arrest of the most prominent Republican
if you're not talking out about that
you do not deserve to run for office
I'm sorry the minimum bar
for being a a you know let's say a
national
credible Republican is to disavow this
if you can't say that out loud and right
away with no hedging whatsoever you
cannot be a president or at least you're
not going to give votes from Republicans
now this puts DeSantis an interest
interesting situation
because I saw Mike cernovich say that he
could DeSantis could you know try to
work against the federal government
jurisdiction you try to try to do some
jurisdiction thing
I don't think it would work
and I don't think that I don't think
that Mike cernovich thinks it would work
but it might be the right look
might be the right look you know it's
free money just pick it up and say
you'll do whatever you can to stop it
from happening because it's obviously a
political thing now it won't make any
difference in the real world but at
least you'd be throwing down your marker
and saying all right I say this is wrong
and it's stronger is stronger because
he'd be talking about somebody who's
potentially uh you know his strongest
competitor to be president
so if if DeSantis can't say out loud
strongly and fairly soon this isn't
right this is political it's got to end
whether or not he tries to stop it with
some you know Florida law is separate
but if he can't say that full-throated
is is not qualified to be president in
my opinion that would be disqualified
and I think that's just another example
where Vivek ramaswamy is doing smart
things
right in front of you
I'm not sure you can get elected doing
smarter things I hate to say it but you
know if you did only smarter things I
don't know if the if the public would
get inspired sometimes they need a
little you know red meat
but anyway uh good to anybody who is
smart enough to take the free money and
denounce it on the Republican side
all right here's another idea for uh
dealing with the cartels but I'll I'll
update you with what Peter Zaya says
about the cartels at the moment now I've
been asked by members of the audience
and thank you for doing that that I
should see what Peter Zan says about
this whole cartel fentanyl business
and so I did now his point of view I
have not heard anywhere else
but I I think he knows what he's talking
about so I'm going to give you the
caveat that I don't know that this is
true because it's still a single Source
but it is a single Source from a smart
connected person I don't think has a
reason to lie
it goes like this
the the image that I had of the cartels
was that there might be two or three big
ones and they've sort of reached a kind
of a sort of a mafia-like agreement
about who has what territory so in
effect one or more of them could control
the government and the border and
everything else but basically the
cartels were like this big well-managed
you know solid industry and then there
were a few of them and they'd reached
some kind of a balancing point where
they were fighting each other so much
they're just sort of controlling their
domains turns out that's all wrong
all wrong apparently and I hope I have
this right that when the U.S got El
Chapo
his his cartel sort of disintegrated
into warring factions trying to take
over what was left
so now the biggest one became a bunch of
Warring factions the smaller ones
apparently also are more characterized
as thugs you know Warring with each
other and that the reason that the uh
the murder rate is currently so high is
because the cartels do not have control
isn't that a isn't that a
you know mind effort I always thought it
was because the the cartels had control
that they were just killing anybody they
could kill you know willy-nilly but
apparently when El Chapo was in control
the murder rate went way down
because they didn't want trouble they
just wanted to they wanted to run as a
business so apparently the city alone
cartel was like a business
uh what's left is more like gangs
so the situation is degenerated from
something like a business of selling
drugs
to gang selling drugs and that now it's
just violence and Inter you know
interfighting now under that situation
you would have to deal with them a
little bit differently
I was thinking that if there really are
big cartels that you could negotiate
with you could actually negotiate with
them just like a country and just say
look we're bigger than you we are going
to crush you
you need to do something different
and then you know at least make the
offer before you crush it
seems like the sporting thing to do
but if it's really a bunch of disjoint
people fighting for power
that's a whole different deal
so let me suggest
a strategy that matches that situation
instead of invading with the military
you simply put whatever Assets in place
that you need to to know what all of the
cartel people are doing
and then whenever you see something you
tell the other cartels
hey looks like this cartel has got a
little action going over here
just letting you know
hey
it looks like there's a big shipment
that just came out of the Sinaloa group
and it's on this highway heading toward
the Border
in case you want to stop it
somebody says there's a movie called
sicario where they did that I don't know
that movie
now I'm not saying this is a good idea
but if you knew that the cartels were
breaking into factions and infighting
would you ask yourself
are we already doing that
are we already doing it
and why wouldn't we
I presume that U.S intelligence assets
are operating in Mexico don't you
don't you think we have some CIA or
something going on in Mexico involving
the cartels I assume so of course we do
right now what would be the best thing
you could do if you couldn't move your
own Assets in
well you don't want the cartels to get
so powerful
that they are you know literally like a
country forming their own armies and
stuff so the first thing you do is give
them all information about the other
ones and just keep it coming
and just make them fight with each other
give them some rumors hey did you know
this other faction is planning to move
against you
I don't know yeah they're really serious
uh I don't know your best bet might be
to move against them first you know take
the first shot
so there's a part of me that wonders
if there's any part of our military or
intelligence agencies that are already
breaking up the cartels into small parts
by rumors and information and knocking
on one group versus the other
kind of looks like it
so I'm not going to say that's what's
happening
but why wouldn't it
I mean why wouldn't it it's the obvious
thing to do isn't it
it's the most obvious thing to do so I'm
gonna I'm gonna say it's not a
suggestion
it looks like it's happening
and
I don't know where that's going to end
up but it looks like it's happened
[Music]
I also heard
let me see if you think this is true
remember we always used to hear about
the crypts and the Bloods
you know it was like you hear about it
all the time there and I don't hear
about it so much
at least in Southern California I don't
hear about it so much and there's some
speculation that the the MS-13 wiped
them out and just killed killed all the
people who were competitors
now obviously they still exist of course
but I wonder if MS-13 actually wiped out
their drug the drug competition
yeah
now I I would I would have trouble
believing that anything is thorough
happened like all the drug business went
away I don't think that but I wonder if
there's anything to that that the MS-13
uh got rid of the rival gangs because
that is the first thing they do they get
rid of the rival gang so they can take
over the business
I don't know
I'm not sure I believe anything about
that
um here's a question for you
if someday we have uh chips in our
skulls you know microchips or little
computers in our skulls that's what you
know neurolink is trying to do I'm sure
others will do it
will we get to the point where robots
can read your mind
I think so because robots will have ai
in them eventually wouldn't you agree
of course a robot will have ai
now if you have ai
can't you hack any password if you had
Ai and maybe a connection to a quantum
computer
yeah right if the AI had connection to a
quantum computer
and also have all full AI it could kind
of crack any password or encryption
and could it pick up a signal from the
chip in your head and could your robot
walk up to you read your signal and say
oh
uh I see you would like a glass of water
I'll get one now that's the good news
but
um suppose you committed a crime
and you died in the commission of the
crime
do you think your chip
will remember the memories of what
happened
because we do know now that you can you
can assemble a memory
by scanning somebody's brain you know
that's real right that's an actual real
thing
if you knew how to scan or you know
monitor somebody's brain you can
actually reassemble their memories
like in picture form
so in theory
you could take a dead guy take his chip
out and if I had any memory in it we
don't know if they'd have memory but
presumably someday they'll have memory
right
and you could actually read the memories
that I believe that's current technology
not operational like not commercialized
current technology but every part of
that has been demonstrated I think
now there's not is there any situation
where you'd have a chip in your head and
the chip in your head did not
communicate with the rest of the world
because that would be its best benefit
it could communicate with the world so
it's got to be sending out some signal
so pretty soon you'll have a signal and
an artificial memory in your head maybe
not you know version one two three but I
think you're going to have
some kind of memory chip in your head
yeah so I don't know what the future
looks like
you know I do agree with uh well I agree
with what I imagined
Elon Musk is thinking so this is not
mind reading it's a speculation again
I think that he probably says it's going
to happen no matter what
saved with AI it's going to happen no
matter what and if he's involved maybe
he can keep it more ethical
but it's going to happen
so you might as well if if you're not an
unethical person well maybe it's best
that you're the one who's making it
happen at least you have a chance that
way
um that's what I speculate he thinks I'm
not reading his mind
all right let's read his mind this time
all right this time we're going to read
his mind all right
uh I went from speculating to this time
I'm going to read Elon musk's mind and
you can all join me just for fun
here's the story
he just he tweeted down a meme uh early
this morning as in the middle of the
night
and the meme said without any
explanation
the meme said falling in love hits
different when you know they're a paid
actor sent by the CIA to distract you
from dedicating your life to dismantling
the government
what does that mean
falling love hits different when you
know that they're a paid actor sent by
the CIA to distract you from dedicating
your life to dismantling the government
first of all is Elon Musk dismantling
the government
I mean in a way
in a way yes
in a in a literal way no
but in a conceptual way yes through the
Twitter files
um
but do you think that he had some recent
experience with somebody he thought was
sent by the CIA to act like his
girlfriend
of course he did
of course
you think the CIA isn't trying to get an
Elon musk's personal life
I assume they are
now I doubt that they would send
somebody
I doubt they would send somebody who's
like on the payroll I don't think they
do that I think it's more like
somebody they know would tell them stuff
yeah somebody associated with perhaps in
some way
yeah now I don't know if that's what he
means do you think there's another
meaning to this because it could be just
a metaphor
for something that's happening in the
news do you think it's just a metaphor
for something happening in the news
or do you think he's telling you that
they send somebody any and he found out
where he figured it out
what do you think
I know is it I just love the fact that
we don't know
like it's open to interpretation
I don't know but I'd be surprised if
they didn't send somebody
wouldn't you be surprised
because I would think the CIA would
wonder ah I hope he's totally on our
side
you know is he ever is he ever not on
our side I feel like the CIA would want
to know as much as they could know about
him and his business
just to you know just to be careful
because he has he has so much influence
you want to make sure that he's not
influenced by somebody from outside
America
I don't know
I don't know I guess we'll probably
never know the answer to what this is
but it's intriguing
all right
article in uh one of the news was it CNN
I think according to Pew research 63
percent of men between 18 and 29 are
single
that means the number of single young
men is nearly twice as that of single
young women
what
what
how's that possible
do the math how is that possible
lesbianism no
the only way I can see this is possible
is that the young women are with older
men
they're dating old demand
is is that the answer
and why do you think that younger women
are
presumably more than ever dating older
men
why do you think that is
do you think it's because of just money
but that was always true it was always
true that older men had money why would
it be so much more now
because the money thing's exactly the
same as the way it's been forever
but why would they be dating them now
well here are some theories that uh
the article had it said dating apps are
you know making it impossible for anyone
but the the best looking people to date
so that's true and then
um porn is mentioned as something that's
draining off the energy of some of the
men so they have something
something that's keeping them from
dating
um I would add a few more speculative
things
a few more number one
uh men between 18 and 29 are captives of
women
in other words the young men are
basically woke
and women
want two things
number one they want their their men to
do what they want them to do am I right
women want the men to do what they want
them to do number two thing you need to
know no woman is attracted to a man who
does what she tells them to do
there's your whole story that's your
whole story the way the men the men in
that age group have been re-hypnotized
into thinking that doing what women want
them to do is their ticket to being
liked by women
nope
and you know I believe that at that age
what is this age 18 to 29 between the
ages of 18 to 29 I believe that my best
strategy with women
was to be as awoke as I could possibly
be
in fact my first relationship she used
to brag to other people
that her guy
was
um where did she use
like
um
something like more open-minded or you
know less sexist or something so I tried
to be the least sexist person I could be
because I thought well that's what
Society wants and let me tell you that's
sure what women want and how did I know
that women wanted it at that age well
that's what they said
when I did things that were you know
clearly
showing that I was
what was the word we used not
metrosexual there was a word that was
like a diabolical word because you
wanted to be that it was like not
open-minded but a word like that
not whipped
not chauvinist
not but good guess enlightened and
like there was
that was the word
that hypnotized me for years
yeah I was called enlightened
enlightened would mean that I would
treat my woman
like a proper man
you know because everybody's the same so
everybody you treat everybody an
enlightened way
and that is your ticket to bear
you want to get some sex guys
be enlightened there's nothing the
ladies like more than that am I right
I actually believe that in my 20s
and you know there's this long process
of getting red pilled
where you where you start thinking well
the people were doing well don't seem to
be doing this
I was that a coincidence and pretty soon
the anecdotal counter evidence becomes
overwhelming
and then at some point in your life you
decide to try it
you know what I mean what if I tried
being a little less what they call
enlightened
and then you realize it works great
and you say to yourself I don't know
what's going on now
why does treating people poorly work so
well well maybe it's not treating people
poorly maybe that's not what's happening
maybe treating people in their
biological truth
is actually something that
has a mating Instinct trigger
maybe it does maybe acting like somebody
who could protect you
is going to be a bigger turn on than
somebody who understands you
all right you got two choices lady
ladies you have somebody who protects
you or somebody who understands and
listens to your
listens to your feelings as much as
possible
yeah of course women lie
you know men lie too of course but women
lie and they tell you that what they
want
is an enlightened guy who understands
the wokeness and and can march with them
and paint their hair green and and be a
proper lady just like they are that's
what they're looking for that turns them
on
no I think that there's an entire
generation have with been turned into
women
and the women say all right the job is
done we've turned these young men into
proper women we're not interested in
them of course but I've noticed this
older guy who seems to be killing it
that's what's happening now I have an
anecdotal experience that I never
believed was worthy of sharing because
it's just so specific and anecdotal it
goes like this
I've been more attractive to women every
year I've aged
including now
explain that now I've been Rich for 25
years
so if you're saying well it's because
you got richer I would say no I did not
get richer in fact it's probably about
the same as it was 25 years ago
had nothing to do with that
right it had everything to do with the
fact that I just started stopped caring
about ridiculous things and just started
acting more
according to my nature I guess
so you're seeing now probably the most
accurate representation of who I am
as scary as that might be
and and believe me men I think you can
concur that if men act honest it's scary
true or false if men are just honest
just honest they just they just
represent their their biological nature
as best they can yeah we're scary
there's a reason that Society
puts a lot of pressure on you know
keeping us under tap
we're just scary people
um
yeah
so I don't think there's too much
mystery to this Millennial men giving up
on dating the women turned them into
women then the women look for men
that's that's the whole story the women
turned the people their age into women
were no longer attracted and then went
and found some older men who still who
still acted like something like a
biological man
I see no disagreement in this audience
almost everything I say has somebody
disagreed and I just got complete
agreement I don't see a single person
disagree
older men know how to be kinder
I don't know if kindness is a variable
yeah now Nathan it was always I always
had money for 25 years
but it's different
there's clearly a
a preference for men who are
more biologically true to their nature
that's the best way I can do it talk
about it I guess
you say older men seem more confident
you shouldn't be a 25.
let me
let me challenge that belief
if you believe that my current self
is confident because I'm older or
something
you had no idea what I was like at 19.
if you met me in 19
if you
I did not lack confidence at any time in
my life
that's never been a thing
I did not become confident because I
succeeded I was exactly the same exactly
the same I just thought I would succeed
I didn't know how yeah now but if you're
confident and you haven't actually
succeeded then people say you're cocky
you're arrogant you're all those things
but I'm exactly the same
I have learned that if you actually
succeed you have to dial it down it took
me a while to learn that by the way
because I took my I took my youthful
confidence
uh into my successful years and it was a
terrible match
because I realized that my sort of cocky
um presentation of who I was
as soon as you actually succeed it's
really a turn off
like you have to dial it way down to
okay I'm just living my life if you
notice I'm successful that's great but
me I'm just living my life now right and
then people accept that much better but
I I really had to turn down the
cockiness
because
I believed I would succeed
it was more than belief I just you know
in retrospect you could say I knew it
but I didn't really know it I just
assumed it
so
anyway
that ladies and gentlemen
is what I wanted to talk about was there
something I think I reminded the locals
people on a separate thing it was
something I wanted to talk about and he
reminded me last night in the man cave
oh that yes but I think I mentioned this
you're reminding me to mention something
that I mentioned see if I did all right
YouTube tell me if I already mentioned
this
that um
Bill Maher
referred to
um yeah we're private that Bill Maher
referred to
DeSantis as the tribute band
yeah I think I mentioned it before right
no yes well I'll just say it again that
apparently I did mention it but I'm
going to just say it again that if you
think of DeSantis as the tribute band
and you think As Trump is the real thing
that is such a kill shot that it ends it
ends the primaries
if Trump ever said don't fight don't
vote for the tribute band
it would just be the end of it
and by the way Trump wouldn't know that
the moment he heard it
if anybody ever said to Trump you know I
would consider this
just think about this answer says the
tribute band you don't think that Trump
would immediately see the power of that
he would that's that's his sweet spot
that's what he does well
yeah use the tribute band
all right so that alone makes me think
that this antis doesn't have a chance
because that that play would would
it would just be so strong
that I don't see how we could get out
from under it
yeah
there's a support rally
Tuesday at 3 P.M at Mar-A-Lago
oh that's interesting that's the perfect
place to have a protest
that's perfect because if you oh that's
so perfect let me just take a moment if
if we assume that's going to happen
a protest where would be the perfect
place to do it
the perfect place would be a Mar-A-Lago
it's the only place somebody isn't going
to worry about violence and nobody's
going to worry
that it turns into something bad well
that's just brilliant
all right whoever came up with that
a plus
a plus that's good that's good stuff
brilliant
all right
um
Rob Reiner already implies that
everyone gets a Big Mac after
uh all right
uh better do it early in the morning why
is that oh because bad things happen at
night
um
all right that's all for today uh
YouTube I'm gonna go talk to the locals
people privately
give them a little extra
and I'll see you tomorrow
