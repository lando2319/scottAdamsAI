Feed to catch up.
And then we're going to do a special-purpose double whiteboard—yeah, it's better than one: double whiteboard.

And I'm going to run an idea past you.
In a way, you have just become part of the first digital constitutional congress, in which I will be proposing a non-binding amendment to the Constitution. A system, if you will—a new process. I'm going to run it by all of you for opinion, so you're going to see it for the first time.

All right.

So, as you know, there are some situations for which our government is ill-equipped. One of those would be getting a budget approved. Am I right? They'll throw everything together into a big bill until nobody likes any of it, and they just can't get past it.

So, is there any kind of process that would help them get past that? It's almost like you need a hostage negotiator—somebody independent who just goes in and says, "All right, all right, let's try to make a deal here and get something done."

Likewise, with the pandemic, we've got this situation where the government is really the worst tool for the job. If you're in a war—a real war—the government's the best tool for the job. Absolutely. You want somebody to organize and organize quickly and have that kind of power.

But as we're deciding to get back to something like normal life, the government is the worst tool for that job, because the government can't make a wrong decision and expect to keep their jobs. And anything that requires more people to die—even if there's a trade-off for freedom—if it's not in the context of a regular shooting war, it's going to be bad for a politician. So they really can't make the cost-benefit analysis that the public requires.

So what do you do?

That's where a hostage negotiator comes in. And I'm going to lay out a process for getting past logjams with something I'm going to call a hostage negotiator, borrowing that term from Greg Gutfeld.

The idea is that if you had a certain situation, somebody could, number one, self-appoint themselves with a three-replacement option. Here's the part I want to run past you.

There would be no process for, let's say, electing or appointing a hostage negotiator. It's something that would have to arise by some kind of person just wanting to do it. In this case, I will act as that person—just to see if the process works.

The process is that the first person who goes into this process has to make a little bit of an impact. In other words, maybe get a hashtag trending or get some agreement somewhere—just a little bit of an impact.

But in order to be credible as a hostage negotiator, they should have three people named as replacements. In other words, three people who would just have to say, "You know, I could do that better than you. I'll take your job." And they automatically get it.

For example, I'll name Sam Harris as somebody who, if he said hypothetically, "I like this idea of a hostage negotiator, but you're bad at it, or you're not credible, or it's just not going over with the public for some reason"—as soon as he said that, if he wanted to legitimately take over, I would say, “Perfect. That's exactly how the system works. If you want to do it, go ahead.”

But I would ask him to do the same thing: list three credible people that, if they just said, "You're a mess. I'm going to take over," they could do it.

So, what would be Sam Harris? Maybe... I'll come up with a couple more.

Now, just think about that for a moment and roll it around in your head. What can go wrong? How many ways could it go wrong?

Now, if the first thing you're thinking is, "I don't like Sam Harris," you have to wait for the other two names. Right? Because nobody's going to like any one of the names—just like every other form of government, nobody's going to like all of it.

Remember, you have to accept that this is a process in which all of us will find something we don't like. That's not disqualifying—that's the symbol of a good system, actually, if negotiation is involved.

Let me say this: the hostage negotiator would be there to assist the government, not replace it. It would not be a battle. It would be helping the government fill in a capability that it simply doesn't have and can't have in this special circumstance. And that ability is to tell us, "Some of you are going to die, but let's get back to work."

The government just can't say that.

So, it would be greatly aided by somebody else saying it and then simply agreeing with it, or going the way the majority goes.

But I don't think it's a case of just asking something from the government. The public should be willing to offer something as well.

As a negotiator, I would make some specific offers—I'll tell you about them in a minute. The idea would be to negotiate creatively: offers that are not a standard Republican offer or a standard Democrat offer. Just be creative. Throw some extra things in there. Maybe take some things out of there. Just see what you can do that the public would get behind.

But here's the key trigger:
The hostage negotiator would not approve of any deal without getting 75% of the public on board.

So, in other words, the hostage negotiator would have zero power—as it should be. Only the public would have the power.

But the public would have to get up to speed, be well-informed, and then, by a 75% majority, the government is safe.

Why is the government safe?

Because if you can get a majority that big for anything, your politicians are completely safe. They can just say, "Look, there was a 75% majority for this. Nobody went against it." In fact, at that point, you'd probably get something like 100% congressional approval, with a few holdouts.

So, here's what an opening offer would look like would look like this.

Again, this is just a model for how something like this could work, so don't get too caught up on the specifics. The reason I'm showing it to you is to get your opinions, okay?

Nothing happens until you have a target—at least nothing good. Unfortunately, things happen, but they're not good.

Anybody who knows anything about management will agree with the following statement:

If you're not measuring something and have some specific-looking direction, nothing good is going to happen.

You can't just go to work every day and try to be good at your job. That's not anything. You have to have a direction, and you've got to be able to measure whether the things you're doing are working or not. If you're not doing that, it's unmanaged. And the pandemic feels unmanaged to the public.

It's not really unmanaged—but it feels that way to us, because there's no specific thing being measured toward a specific end goal.

Now, suppose somebody said, "All right, we'll measure statistics of infections or deaths or hospitalizations." What do all of you say?

"I don't trust those numbers," right?

So instead of trusting those numbers, I would propose the following:

That we would manage it by saying February 1st is our target. Can we get the government to say yes? The Biden administration? Maybe the governors? Because remember, this is state and federal negotiation.

Can you get everybody to say yes?

But we would hold them not responsible if we have to change that target. You have to have a target, but it's crazy if you don't change it when the data or situation changes.

We’ll talk about systems over goals, but in this specific case—since it’s obvious that we all want to get back to freedom—there’s no ambiguity about what the end state is, right? There’s no ambiguity. If there were, then a system would be better than a goal.

But in this specific case, where everybody knows exactly what they want—which is to get back to normal life safely enough—then that’s a little less of an issue.

So, we would hold our politicians not to blame for any excess deaths that came as a result of this negotiation, and we would say we would not hold them to the decision of February 1st unless by that date a credible polling company of well-informed people—of course, that might be hard to define—but of people who are well-informed, 75% of them agree that Feb 1 still works.

What do you think?

Now, of course, the government would not be bound to any of this. It would simply give them an extra path that’s not available to them now. And that extra path is to follow the lead of the public.

Right now, that’s not an option, because the public is a little too split, and we wouldn’t all agree on an end date.

For this to work, it would require not just the 75% agreeing on the exact terms. Here's an important point:

This would be a little bit like a jury trial.

It’s not that you get 75% on the same page. It’s that you get 75% to say, "It’s time to make a decision."

Which is a little bit different, right?

It’s the people who say, “All right, all right, I get it. You just need a few more votes. We need to get past this.” Maybe they wouldn’t have picked February 1st—maybe they’d have picked March 1st—but they’re not going to be the one to stop it over those 30 days.

So, you need a lot of people who are sort of in the middle to be convinced that we just need decisions.

So, you need a lot of people who are sort of, you know, in the middle—to be convinced that we just need decisions.

All right.

You're forgetting: there's a lot of psychos out there that love this stuff.

Okay, I don't know exactly how that would—how exactly that would work. Now, I'm seeing some stuff on Locals that I won't call out, but I want to emphasize:

If you make it a combative process with the government instead of an additive process, you're not going to get very far.

Because everybody’s first reaction is to bristle and try to maintain power, etc. So it has to be an assistance. Period.

And the first person who starts something going needs to be willing to "George Washington" it.

Does everybody know what that means?

To "George Washington"—whoever goes first has to be willing to get out of there really fast. Because otherwise, the system has no credibility. It requires a flow of credible people through it—some better than others.

Right now, the way our system is designed, it just doesn’t have the ability to get past logjams the way the public would like it to. So we could give it that cover—with a different hostage negotiator for each topic. You wouldn’t want the same one for more than one topic, I would say.

Even to get the ball rolling, I don’t even know if you’d want one person to get the ball rolling more than once, even if they were quickly replaced.

All right.

Yeah, Trump... Trump is too polarizing.

So you want people who—you can’t find anybody who has no connection to politics, because the Trump era ended the days when anybody didn’t have an opinion. We’re done with that.

So you need people who at least have some record of appreciating arguments on both sides. At the very least. And they should have some level of rational, established ability that is obvious to everybody.

So—I heard somebody suggest Naval Ravikant. He would be on my list. All right, you beat me to that one. I doubt he’d do it, which is exactly the kind of person you want. Someone who would be the last person in the world who would agree to something like that—that’s who you want.

All right.

Well, here's the thing—you want people who are not just popular. I'm seeing Joe Rogan being suggested. The trouble with Joe Rogan is that he is great at what he does, but I don't know that the left, in particular, would recognize him as having the, let’s say, intellectual independence or depth. I hate to say that, because he’s one of the smartest guys around, but…

You’re looking for somebody who’s got that sort of statistical—I guess that’s the best way to say it—somebody who has a statistical appreciation of the arguments.

I think you need that, at least.

Shemberger is good.
Yeah, I like Van Jones. He would be good, especially because he's shown appreciation for both sides of arguments.

Tom Brady—that’s funny.
Sting—all right, now we're just doing funny names.

I'm seeing Dr. Drew's name go by, and he was actually one of the first people I thought of. But on second thought—should we include medical professionals at all?

Here's why:

I believe that politicians and the entire medical community have the same problem, which is:

The risk of being wrong at this level is a career-ending problem.

Would it be career-ending for me if I were to negotiate something that was suboptimal? Well, it may haunt me for a long time, but I could put up with that. For me, I don’t really see the downside.

But if you're actually a medical professional, I think it's too dangerous. And I wouldn't recommend it. Because I'm not sure I would trust a medical professional to be free of the constraint of their own professional risk. It would be way out of line with what would be asked of them.

Now, would I expect to get lots of doctors to weigh in—and to agree—and to publicly say yes or no? Let’s say on February 1st? Yes. So, you'd want to really pay attention to medical professional opinion above others, I think.

But you don’t want them to be the ones whose name is attached to it. I think that's just more than you want to ask of a medical professional in these polarized times—and on this polarized question.

So, I would say nobody who's directly associated with politics.

You know, Trump’s a great negotiator, but for this—exactly the wrong person.

Someone said Mike Rowe.
That was one of the first ones I thought of too—but primarily because of his sort of common-sense likability. But I still think you need somebody you feel more comfortable could go a little deeper into the science of it.

I'd want somebody who's got a proven ability to go deeper than I can go. That would be something I'd be looking for.

Neil deGrasse Tyson—oh, there you go.
The perfect trio would be: white, Black, and female, right?

Yeah, if you're going to name three people in today's polarized world—because remember, you're trying to get credibility, and you're trying to get everybody on board—while I can make an argument there are lots of times you don’t want to go all “woke,” this wouldn't be one of them.

This is one of those times where extra wokeness just has utility. Because it’s not like there are only three people in the world who would qualify as good for this position.

Elon Musk would have been my top choice. I’m seeing that suggested over on the Locals network.
Yeah, Elon Musk would be able to look at the science, has the popularity in enough of the world, but—he's a little bit polarizing. Maybe the left has a little bit of a problem with him.

Jordan Peterson—not American.
Not American. I feel like you need an American on this one. Although… do you? I guess I'd be open to that. I made an assumption without thinking about it too hard.

Yeah, Jordan Peterson would have all of the capabilities, plus the communication ability that literally no one has.
By the way, I've never seen a better communicator than Jordan Peterson. I've never seen anything like it.

All right, that’s all I had to say for today.
I was expecting more pushback.

Can I just get a final opinion—what looked good or not in this idea?
Worth a try?
Because we can A/B test it. I mean, we’re testing it right now. If it doesn’t work, nobody will care. The hashtag will die tomorrow.

We’ll give it a try.

Remember:

Everything’s non-binding.
Everything’s negotiable.
Everything’s public.
No negotiating behind closed doors.

I’m mostly getting good responses, which I wasn’t actually expecting.
I shouldn’t be so surprised. Yeah, I wasn’t expecting a good response, frankly.

All right. So we’re off and running then.
Based on your response, we’re live.

So this is the opening offer—opening offer to the Biden administration and all governors that this is applicable to. I realize many of you live in a state where you already have all the freedom you want. But for the rest of us, we would appreciate some backup.

And again, I’ll tell you—in fact, maybe I’ll just say:

If anybody wants to step forward and take over for me—
If they've got basic capabilities, meaning:

They're sure they can see things on both sides of the political aisle,

They have some depth—more depth than I have (and I don’t have enough)—

—then I’d like to get replaced as soon as possible.
If you could do that for me, just replace me as soon as possible.

Anyway—that’s the opening offer:
February 1st.

But it doesn’t count unless 75% of the well-informed people also agree that it’s time.
That’s the opening offer.

And I would hold blameless the government for changing the date if they need to—if the situation changes.
I’d also hold them not responsible for any extra deaths that they could have avoided by being more stringent.

But—75%. Let’s see if we can get there.

All right—now keep in mind:

If we get surprised in January, all bets are off.
Everybody understand that, right?

You all understand: if we get some big surprise, all bets are off.
You’d have to rethink it from the start.

But without any big surprises—Feb 1: The public is done.

By the way—did anybody notice that rhymes?

Feb 1: The public is done.

It’s hard not to say, isn’t it?
About the first time you hear it, you want to roll it around your head:

Feb 1. The public is done.

Yeah, that’s not an accident.

All right, that’s it for today.

And I’ll talk to you later.
