uh good morning everybody and
congratulations on making it to the
highlight of civilization yeah talk
about the last the lost city of Atlantis
well I don't know if that's real or not
but whatever it is it's not as awesome
as this and you found this even if you
can't find Atlantis no matter how hard
you look but if you'd like to take this
experience up to the maximum potential
and I know that's the kind of person you
are would you leave any money on the
table no no you pick up that money and
all you need is a cupboard or a glass of
tanker tells us died at canteen jugular
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's the dopamine you know the
day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous Sip
and it's going to happen now and it's
going to amaze you and make you feel
better all day long go
foreign
yeah yeah that's good
all right let me start with
the funniest bad story of the day now I
don't like to find humor in other
people's misfortune
that's not true I do like finding humor
in other people's Misfortune but not if
they know about it
I think it's very impolite to laugh at
people's misfortune
if they're likely to hear it
but if nobody knows
sometimes other people's Misfortune can
be funny
because
at our base we're very small and
terrible people
but don't let anybody know about that
we'll try to try to keep up a good front
Okay okay but here's the story
do you recall that the Biden
Administration
had an employee who was the first gender
non-binary official
uh
a individual Named Sam Brenton
now Sam
uh is the Deputy assistant secretary for
spend to fuel and waste disposition at
the department of Energy's office of
nuclear energy
now poor Sam can't get any real work
done because he spends all of his time
telling people where he works
he'll come to work and phone a ring and
say
who is this and he'll say hello this is
Sam Brinton deputy secretary Deputy
assistant secretary for spent Fuel and
waste disposition at the department of
Energy's office of nuclear energy hello
hello and then the caller is hung up
because they just don't have that kind
of thing so that's the first problem
first problem is title too long I don't
know how he gets his work done
second problem
he is accused of stealing luggage from a
airport carousel
now you might ask yourself
who who what kind of person who has a
nice job
steals luggage from a carousel what are
you going to find in the luggage get
yourself a really sweet hair dryer
like like I mean he doesn't have any
hair actually but what like what would
be the point of that well it turns out
there's an expensive kind of luggage
which I never heard about uh Vera
Bradley suitcase
which could be worth over two thousand
dollars
would you recognize a two thousand
dollar suitcase if you saw it
I don't I don't feel like I would even
recognize an expensive suitcase
they kind of look kind of similar to me
but
um apparently Sam according to
allegations we only know the allegations
uh stole that suitcase
and not only uh
is they I think I think Sam is a they
not only is they uh on video video
security taking the bag but also on
video using the bag on a few different
occasions
so there doesn't seem to be
too much confusion about what's really
going on
actually stole the bag
now here's the punchline
the punchline doesn't require any any
addition
all right I'm just going to tell you the
story
the actual details that as we know them
and that's the punch line all right I'm
just going to put two facts together
the person who is the Deputy assistant
secretary for spent Fuel and waste
disposition at the department of
Energy's office of nuclear energy
didn't know that the airport has
security cameras
didn't see that coming
probably thought to they self
well they are never going to find they
they will take this bag and they will
never know who took it they will be
walking around with this brand new 2300
bag of
want on everybody who thinks they can
stop me
but it turns out
that the
Deputy assistant secretary for
Smithfield on waste disposition at the
department of Energy's office of nuclear
energy
never saw this coming the whole video
security game didn't see it coming
so that's the punchline
I got nothing else to add to that
didn't see it coming
all right I'm glad we've got people who
can uh not see five minutes in the
future in charge of our nuclear assets
so if you noticed that uh ESG is uh
dying right on schedule
does it seem unusual to you that I
declare that I would kill it before the
end of the year
and it looks like it's limping into
December pretty wounded
now
does it I've asked this before but I'm
going to lead into something here does
it feel like I sometimes control the
simulation
is there anybody here who's actually
like literally thinking are you actually
controlling the simulation
does it ever feel like that
all right sub yeses some no's mostly
no's because you're very rational
I like to think that I've attracted a
hyper rational audience or at least you
are now
so the rational people should say no it
doesn't look like that it's anecdotal
and it's coincidence and I'm also good
at identifying a parade and getting it
in front of it
so you should know that about me
sometimes it's not all about prediction
sometimes it's saying I think I see a
parade what happens if I get in front of
it
then it looks like you predicted it
but sometimes I also wonder myself I
have a very
if you do my actual life
you know you you know the public Parts
but if you do my whole life
you would have to say to yourself what's
going on here it looks like something
weird is happening in my life that I
can't explain
so let me tell you something that's the
weirdest story you might hear this week
and it's a story of weird stories
everything I tell you next I swear to
God is true
now what I say is true I mean it's my
impression of what happened it's my
experience the the actual underlying
truth I don't know I don't know what the
underlying truth is but I can tell you
my experience so I'm not lying about my
experience or my memory of it right that
part I promise you
about uh was it two days ago
I had this overwhelming feeling
that I was being watched
now I've had it before you've had that
right you ever have that feeling you're
being watched even when you're alone
so I was alone at home and I thought I'm
being watched
and I and I had an overwhelming feeling
and again you should not put any stock
in this right it's just feelings just a
feeling
that the creators of the simulation
were online and looking at me at that
moment like I was being observed
now I couldn't I didn't have a feeling
if I was being observed by one entity or
multiple but I had the feeling that
whoever was observing or whatever
was part of a population not not a
single entity
now the the questions that you're going
to ask let me anticipate your questions
Scott were you on drugs
of course I was it was after 9am
but I'm on drugs every day in marijuana
and I know what marijuana feels like
can you can you accept
that if you get high every day for 30
years or so
or more uh you know what it feels like
there are no surprises right it doesn't
sometimes feel like mushrooms right it
doesn't sometimes make me hallucinate
it's always the same
and it doesn't and if you do it every
day it doesn't give you any kind of an
experience like somebody doing it you
know once in a while
the people who do it once in a while
have this profound you know you better
not drive your car you know don't let
don't use any power tools kind of
situation if you do it every day it just
makes you feel normal
you know there are very few things I
couldn't do completely high right I I
could play a sport play an instrument
about the same not much difference but
that's only people who use it every day
Ordinary People would have a profound
effect so you can't compare them to the
so-called chronic users all right so
that's the first question
so I embarked on a uh out loud
conversation with whoever it was and I
swear to God I could feel I was getting
answers
now this must be what people feel when
they they believe they're having a
conversation with a god
I imagine it feels the same way and I
don't imagine that my experience of it
was so outside what people have felt for
millennium right yeah humans have always
felt am I talking to God or you know is
are the gods talking to me right now
it's a very common experience so
remember I'm not trying to claim
that I understand the experience I'm
explaining I'm just saying it happened
and then you could put your own
interpretation on it
and so I had this long conversation
about you know what what this was all
about
and then because I didn't believe my own
experience
and I didn't feel I was necessarily
talking to anybody except my own
imagination I thought well maybe I'll
test it
so I said if this I said out loud
if I'm in a simulation
and I have determined and I've
discovered as a simulation do I get
powers like Neo from The Matrix like if
you know you're in a simulation
do you get power over it in other words
does that give me the ability to change
things in real time and actually change
my reality because I Now understand it
and I can just change it
and so I thought well it's worth the
test
so I said I'll give you a I said out
loud
to the creators of the simulation is
that all right here's a test if you can
make this happen
then I'll believe I'm in a simulation
otherwise just my imagination
although it could be my imagination
either way
and so I said all right my biggest
problem at the moment two days ago was
that my my knees have been hurting me
for well over a month maybe two months
and they heard so much
that although I was still active and
still going to the gym
it was you know sort of hard to walk
upstairs like once once I was back from
the gym and I was really starting to
worry
if my bad knees were going to be forever
because you know sometimes you have
temporary knee problems sometimes it's
forever I thought if it's forever
like I'm I'm starting this downward
spiral where where I'm just going to be
you know unable to exercise for the rest
of my life
yeah I thought well it feels like maybe
it's bone on bone or something I didn't
know what it was so I said all right
simulation if you can make my biggest
problem go away my knee pain
that I will accept that I'm not only in
the simulation but that I have some
control over it
so two months of solid knee pain never
not knee pain right not it wasn't wasn't
good at night wasn't good in the morning
was never good
it went away
as I was talking
didn't come back
it's still not back
two days and my knees have no pain
whatsoever
now
I don't have any explanation for that if
you're saying to me Scott that's like a
perfect Placebo situation because I
talked myself into it and had I had a
profound experience of something that
probably wasn't real right I probably
wasn't talking to anybody but because it
was so profound
hypnosis and Placebo and everything I
know about the Mind suggests that I may
have erased my pain
you know maybe I have the same same
inflammation I had before but I may have
just turned it off
now let me tell you something else
that's related to this
sometime last year I was at a event at a
friend's house and it was an individual
who's who is doing some work in the
backyard and it was super cold it was
like a really cold night
and the individual is a young man and he
wasn't wearing a jacket he just had a
t-shirt on and I was wearing a full
winter jacket and I was pretty cold
I was like and I said to him like how
the hell how are you putting up with
this gold and he told me the following
story
he said that he had an experience with
some psychedelics I think it was
mushrooms and and that during that
experience he had the realization that
his sensation of cold was a manufactured
feeling
and that he wasn't in any real danger at
that temperature temperature was
Maybe 50. right so you can't stay
outside at 50 for too long without being
uncomfortable but it's not really
dangerous is it
I don't think it's dangerous
I mean if you can handle being outside
at 50 degrees with your t-shirt it's not
going to kill you it might even be good
for you right might actually be good for
you
so he had actually separated cold
from
a feeling he just didn't feel cold
anymore and the reason he didn't feel it
is because he chose not to
he simply turned off that he just turned
off that feeling because he realized it
was fake it was a false signal
and so the other day
I was Outdoors without a jacket you know
temporarily just to check my mailbox and
I thought wow I'm going to be out here
way longer than I want to be I'm going
to be and I was super cold
and the cold was starting to hurt
and I said what would happen if I
reframed the cold
so I'll give it a try and you know I
keep hearing about these people who do
the the cryonic chambers where it's like
super cold and they stay in there for a
few minutes and like I'm surprised they
don't die
and I thought wait if you know Joe Rogan
and those people
can get in this super cold thing and
it's actually good for them
wouldn't it probably be good for me to
Simply experience something that's
uncomfortably cold for a few minutes
and as soon as I reframed what I was
doing to a health related process
I said to myself I bet this is actually
good for me
to be like super cold
I know you're laughing let me let me
just pause
I live in California
I used to live in Upstate New York
if you adjust this for what you're used
to when I say I went outside it was 50
degrees and I was super uncomfortable
if I had been in New York that would
have been
roughly zero roughly zero
right so in New York you if if you live
in New York and you live in the cold you
could go outside in your T-shirt
at roughly zero degrees and sort of do
some stuff you know you would wouldn't
like it that much do some stuff and then
come inside you wouldn't be damaged
right would you agree so when you when
you're making fun of me for being a huge
 because I couldn't handle 50
degrees just know that when I grew up in
New York I could have done zero it's
just why you're used to right
so the moment I reframed my experience
as a as a voluntary health related
process I was thinking God I think this
cold is making me healthier
all the pain went away
all of the discomfort it was pretty
pretty big discovered of feeling cold
immediately left my body
because I told myself
if I were Joe Rogan I'd be paying for
this experience this is probably really
good for me
does anybody have a problem with germs
anybody have is anybody a germaphobe
try this reframe
the germs are good for you
that's it
yeah yeah which is true because you need
to have some dogs and some animals and
you know a little bit of Filth around
you or else you're not going to be
strong
so I do a lot of public stuff shake
hands with a lot of strangers you know
if I do a public event I'm not doing any
at the moment but and as soon as I'm
done I go wash my hands right after
right because you got like 100 people's
germs on you
but I used to think oh my God my God
like I'd be running to the bathroom to
wash my hands like a surgeon don't touch
your face don't touch your face but
since I've reframed it
the germs are good for me I still wash
my hands but while I'm when I'm walking
to the bathroom I'm thinking I wonder if
I'm getting stronger
I wonder if my immune system is saying
thank you I needed I needed a little
stress test because that's just what I
needed today so I've reframed even germs
at the low end right nothing disgusting
but germs just sort of the daily germs
of life
I I've just defined them as part of what
makes my immune system stronger
I wasn't planning to talk about any of
this today was any of this fun
I don't know I'll talk about the news
next there's plenty of cool news
I just thought I thought it'd be
interesting because it's something you
can try at home
the next time you're super cold as long
as it's temporary just try the reframe
and say I'm super cold exactly what's
good for me
I'm so I'm so lucky that this is super
cold for a few minutes because this is
this is really going to boost my natural
immunity
just try it let me know how it works
all right I got a new mascot uh Phil
bump who writes for the Washington Post
uh Phil likes to come into my tweets and
say bad things about me or to mock me I
don't know why it may be because I've
mocked him for his writing in the past
it feels personal
but I've I've uh I've promoted him from
Mere critic to mascot that's that's my
highest designation
so now he's with Keith olberman
and uh it's a small group I just have a
few mascots but but Phil's part of the
group now so congratulations Phil
for entering the Scott mascot
committee
well you you make fun of me for living
in California but uh here are a few
things you didn't know
in the past month
oops got a little problem here
in the past month in California where I
live
almost every day the weather has been so
good
at least during the daytime
that it feels like room temperature
I walk outside that the colors are
perfect I've had a month of room
temperature so Sunny perfect weather
It's amazing And wow
so that's good but also California has
made it made Jay without walking legal
so as a
yeah it was already legal to um you know
the the The Pedestrian always had the
right away so that's been true for a
long time in California but you have to
be standing at an obvious Crossing Point
now now the law is extended to you could
basically cross the road anywhere you
want and it's not illegal and the
motorists are going to need to stop
or they're just going to not well I mean
obviously they don't want to kill you so
they're going to stop anyway now it
doesn't seem like
necessarily the obvious best idea in the
world
but we'll find out maybe we'll find out
maybe it's cool so
here's what I can do in California you
can't do in Florida and Texas
you can't jaywalk to go buy some weed
yeah I've been in Florida you'd have to
have a medical card I guess but no in
California I can jaywalk anywhere I walk
I can jaywalk and get an abortion
I can jaywalk to get me some weed
a lot of freedom in the state
got a lot of taxes I'm not sure the
taxes are worth all the freedom but
I don't know I don't think I could move
somewhere where I had less freedom
and by the way that's mostly a
psychological thing
but I can tell you that I feel more free
and in California that I would feel in
Texas or Florida I would just feel less
free
now I think that Florida and Texas have
a lot going for them they're
well-managed States and so I've you know
mostly I've only positive things to say
about both places but it is true I feel
more free here
so for whatever that's worth
um
I saw another mention that there's a
heroin shortage which means that people
are using fentanyl instead of heroin
but I would like to uh I have some
inside information on that I've got the
sources my sources tell me it's not so
much that you can't get heroin it said
nobody wants to buy it
nobody wants to buy the heroin do you
know why
because fentanyl is easily available and
it's a better nod that's that's tweaker
talk and that's attic talk the uh the
quote better nod is the you know sort of
being in and out of sleep you're nodding
out and coming back so that's that's
what the addicts are doing the ones who
are shooting up now here's the thing you
need to know because if you don't
understand Fentanyl
you you can't be part of the productive
um persuasion to maybe make things
better so the thing you need to know is
that the people who know they're buying
Fentanyl and putting it in their arms
they're sort of like uh let's say I
would say they're like scuba divers
there are people who know they're doing
an inherently dangerous thing
so they take extra precautions because
they're not actually trying to die
they're trying to stay alive they just
want a good eye
so
it might be
way for it
it might be fewer overdoses because
they're doing fentanyl instead of heroin
and I'm going to make that a prediction
because it's opposite of whatever
everyone else is predicting
so normies the people were a little who
are not too close to this problem are
going to say wait if you stop using
heroin which is pretty bad
and you start using fentanyl which is
way worse you should have more overdoses
right
I'm going to predict it goes the other
way
I'm going to predict that the scuba
divers know that they need to make sure
that they've got air in their tank
and it's the people who don't know
they're getting the fentanyl the
teenagers who are buying it in pill form
and they don't know what they're getting
they're the ones overdosing because they
can't they can't take the obvious
precautions because they don't know
there's a danger it's a hidden Danger
so that's my prediction my prediction is
overdose deaths
from people who shoot might go down
while overall overdoses might go up
so it's it's a bifurcated situation two
different risk patterns and you have to
know that
and I thought there are people who know
what they're talking about who are
agreeing with me in the comments so it's
not crazy
um
all right
uh yeah one one mother of all bombs
dropped on a fentanyl place would take
care of that wouldn't it
oh this is weird
I've got two different documents that
printed on the same document so I'm
trying to read
apparently there was a piece of paper
that I used twice here
huh
um
I oh my God this is going to be a
challenge because all of my notes are
something written over something else
I have a formula for making uh all poor
kids successful I tweeted this a couple
years ago
but it surfaced again
imagine if you were School taught you
what I was taught as a kid right so what
I'm going to tell you now is basically
how I was raised I was raised to believe
that the following steps would make you
successful
and I knew that since
kindergarten I think I think as early as
kindergarten my mother was telling me
here's your path to success
do these things and you will do well
now I don't know if everybody's parents
do that like do the you know do the poor
kids get the same kind of guidance so
here's basically what it is this is my
version of it uh focus on useful
education
keyword is useful right make sure you
get good grades get into college and
take a useful major major
did does everybody's parents tell them
they got to do something useful or they
won't make money
mine did
I'm pretty sure my mother was quite
clear
that going to college for no purpose was
was a losing proposition you had to go
to college for something
to to be better at something specific
that's useful right does everybody's
parents tell them
I know to me it was obvious by the time
I was in first grade because it was just
drilled in from the first days all right
that's the first thing
uh
number two stay out of trouble stay out
of jail
right stay out of jail stay off of drugs
which I've managed to do until College
don't become a parent too soon you don't
have a kid that you aren't planning on
too soon
right just basic basic stuff
um
you know don't don't get anybody knocked
up too soon
uh build a talent stack now that part
I'm adding you know that that wasn't
exactly added by my mother my mother was
still the generation uh try to be the
best at whatever you're doing
which was kind of a good starter advice
but later you know I developed the
concept of the talent stack that's from
my book back there which is now the
talent stack idea is
now common advice but it wasn't common
until I invented it so that's the one
thing I added here uh you know build a
telestack be useful to others that's the
next point
is it's not good enough just to be good
at something it has to be good as
something that somebody wants to pay for
you have to be useful and so I was
trained to be useful
all the time
like I had to mow the lawn I had to take
the garbage out I had to do something
get good grades but I always had to be
useful that was always just baked into
the operating system
um favorite systems over goals you know
make sure that you're doing all the
right things to give you lots of options
that was never told to me directly so
that's again that's my addition to it
but sort of indirectly I think I'd pick
that up
and then
learn basic risk management
basic risk management which includes
Financial Risk Management but I'm I'm
making it a little bigger now none of
that is hard
every everything on my little list of
how to be successful is pretty
straightforward
pretty straightforward there's nobody
who couldn't do it
right you you could be in a pretty bad
school
but let's say you're a minority student
in the worst school you could you could
not do drugs there are people who do it
you could not get arrested it's possible
right you you could do as good as well
as you could do in that poor school but
because you come from you know minority
disadvantaged situation you might be
able to get a little lift a little maybe
a college scholarship a little extra
consideration and then from there you're
on your own
get yourself a useful major and and you
could probably pay for your student
loans if you have them Etc
Okay so
um I would just say that things would be
really different if we just taught
people the basics
when they're small
all right Rasmussen did a poll to find
out if people uh think that musk is
going to make Twitter better or worse
34 of American adults who regularly use
Twitter believes that musk will make the
site better
so about a third say you'll make it
better
and almost exactly the same
think that musk will make it worse
but how many people this will be a
little test of your uh your psychic
ability
how many people roughly
do you think believe that Elon Musk the
world's greatest entrepreneur
uh paid 44 billion dollars for Twitter
to not change it too much to not change
it too much how many people think they
spend 44 billion dollars do not really
make anything any different
wow you're good wow you're so that's
good this is 24 but your guess is of 25
are are just scarily accurate
how do you do that I don't know I don't
know how you do it
well the Twitter cybernetic brain
uh which fascinates me when I look at
the currently trending section because
to me that's the Consciousness or where
the where Twitter is focusing his brain
and there were four names in my I think
it's different for each person but in my
list these four names Nick Fuentes Will
Smith Alexander vinman and Tim Poole
those are all the trending names today
on my list and I'm thinking poor Tim
pool Tim pool gets thrown on the list
with Fuentes Will Smith and and vinman
but for different reasons except that
they're all being criticized right
they're all being criticized or in some
cases complemented
speaking of Tim Poole you probably know
by now that he got a exclusive kind of a
scoop interview with yay and Milo and
Nick Fuentes that would be the first I
think big
probably the first time they would
appear together since
the dinner at Mar-A-Lago
and if you didn't know
it ended abruptly when Tim very
carefully broached the
anti-Semitism topic and then yay got up
and left without comments
now
who knows what yay is thinking right
it's impossible to imagine but here are
the things we learned number one yay
confirmed that Trump did not know that
Fuentes was coming
and Trump
did not know who Fuentes was
now I believe that's true I believe
that's true because uh axios reported
the same thing before we did so we have
now two sources that are not necessarily
on the same side saying the same thing
and and also Trump said the same thing
so it looks like looks like everybody's
agreed with that now
some people are saying well it looks
like the Tim pool
interview as short as it was about 26
minutes I think it cleared Trump what do
you think is Trump cleared now because
he didn't know Fuentes and did not
invite him no is he cleared
no nothing works like that
you're falling into the Trap of
imagining that imagining that any kind
of common sense or rational thought is
involved here there's none of that it's
purely a narrative that that the left is
never going to let go of
it doesn't matter how true or valid or
anything all you have to know is that
they've chosen it as a narrative that
they're going to ride ride that horse
until it expires and they are and
they're doing a good job of it they're
really nailing it hard
so no Trump is done
in my opinion Trump does not come back
from that I think that was a kill shot
does anybody disagree
how many of you think Trump could come
back from that
because remember it's not even true it's
it's like half Oaks half a little bit
true
so you think you can
now the argument that he can is that our
attention span is too short the trouble
is our attention span is irrelevant if
it's all they talk about
do you remember that Biden ran on the
Charlottesville hoax
we elected a president
on a hoax
it didn't matter that it was a hoax
and it didn't matter that it was the
most easily verifiable hoax
you just have to listen to it and they
go oh okay that was a hoax that didn't
really happen and
but think about it you would you
probably would have said that
Charlottesville thing once it's debunked
as an obvious hoax you probably said
well it's not real
so that's not going to affect anything
in the real world
but it elected Biden it actually changed
the nature of our leadership of the
biggest country in the world or the most
powerful
so yes the the fact that
this happened even though it looks like
an OP to me it wasn't Trump's fault uh
per se
now I want to give you you know I often
compliment Mike Pence for being
a clever politician who avoids getting
in trouble
I want you to hear how cleverly he
criticized Trump
because he's really good at this
he wanted to criticize him clearly
but but not go too far into crazyville
right crazyville says that Trump invited
him like that that's too far so you I
hope you're not going to see any
Republicans
you know buy into the part that that he
got invited so Pence is too smart to
fall into that part but here's how Pence
uh who we believe will run against Trump
for president
uh Penn said
Penn says
um president Trump was wrong to give a
white nationalist an anti-semite and a
holocaust denier a seat at the table
blah blah and I said again a seat at the
table giving him a seat at the table
is that not brilliant
that is brilliant for political
criticism without being technically
incorrect because giving somebody a seat
at the table
is conceptual
it's conceptual
but it's also makes you think of the
real thing
because at the same time there was a
conceptual seat at the table there was
actually a literal seat at the table
Pence is a genius
that is genius
communication wise
I mean
I don't think it's an accident that he
was such a good vice president his
ability to parse words and pick just the
right word that doesn't getting him in
trouble while still saying something is
quite impressive that is quite
impressive I don't I don't prefer him
for president but I just like you know
credit where creditors do that was
really good
now you don't like it if you're if
you're supporting Trump you don't like
it because it's a pretty good hit but a
place at the table that gives them
everything that's just the perfect
perfect criticism
um
now
and I suppose the question is should
Trump have you know gotten up and left
but I don't believe Trump knew exactly
who Fuentes was the entire dinner like I
think if you figured it out later but
that he had a chance to disavow him so
here's my next question
should Trump have disavowed
Nick Fuentes go
should Trump have disavowed Nick Fuentes
I'm seeing mixed messages
here's why this is not an obvious
question
um as a citizen of the United States I
can disavow Nick Fuentes I disavow him
there I just did it so I think you'd all
agree that citizens can disavow anybody
right just an ordinary citizen yeah we
all have free speech we can disavow
anybody we want but here's my question
if there's going to be one exception
there's only one kind of person I want
to not be criticizing citizens and it's
the president
that's the only person I don't want to
criticize a a citizen who's obeying the
law this is an important caveat so given
given that Fuentes is obeying the law as
far as I know
he's not been accused of any law
breaking as far as I know
so as long as he's a law-abiding person
who just has
uh ugly opinions in the opinion of many
people
I'm perfectly okay with a president
whether it's Trump or anybody else
um perfectly okay with the president
criticizing Behavior
and opinions
and ugly you know bad policy ideas
but disavowing a person by name
that's too far
that feels too far
now the the exception would be a Critic
so if a politician goes after somebody
who's just been like dogging them
forever like you know
Rob Reiner or something you know if the
president goes after Rob Reiner it's
because that's somebody's been going
after him personally for a long time
that's fine that's just politics but to
go after somebody who has not been
criticizing you
and only has opinions that you feel are
vile
do you want your president to do that
and I say I do not want my president to
be insulting
any individual citizen
with the obvious exception of Rosie
O'Donnell I think we could all agree
that if it's Rosie O'Donnell that's fine
that's fine
but everybody else
everybody else no no
all right so I I feel like this is a
it's a fine line but I think it's an
important one now I think Trump did not
did not disavow Fuente's opinions
and that's sort of a glaring thing
that's missing but I think he could have
parsed it I think I think Trump could
have said you know what
um if somebody's obeying the law and
they have terrible opinions I'm still
going to eat with them
but I will disavow their opinions if
you'd like to hear that yes I disavow
that opinion that would work for me that
would work
um I say that censorship is the new
voting what do you say
because we've got this big debate over
whether musk is improving Free Speech or
making it worse say his critics But
whichever way it is the
would you agree that the following is
true
that censorship determines what
narrative
is the important one would you agree
if you never see a competing narrative
you latch on to the one that you see
so censorship determines what narrative
Rises to our attention right
and the narrative would determine your
opinion
right so that's how we get opinions we
don't really make opinions on our own
opinions are essentially assigned to us
by the way the narrative is presented to
us
so the the censorship determs The
Narrative The Narrative determines
public opinion public opinion
determines what the vote is because then
we vote our opinions
so you've got the censorship determines
the narrative The Narrative determines
our public opinion our public opinion
determines the vote
and that's it
that's our current system
the current system is it's just a
censorship
game the vote actually becomes a a
somewhat subsidiary Downstream uh
guaranteed effect that is guaranteed by
what happens Upstream
right the vote is Downstream from
censorship
and I'm borrowing Andrew breitbart's
famous saying that politics is
Downstream from culture but
but the vote is Downstream from
censorship
now was this always the case
has this always been our system because
I don't think so it feels like it's
something that could evolve because of
social media and the the media the media
landscape
and just in one comment I think it's I
don't know who it's for but just says
 you it feels like it's for me but
maybe not
might have been for another commenter
but this battle over uh censorship and
Twitter in particular because Twitter
Twitter as you as you know is the the
lever that moves all the other media
because it's the place that the media
professionals go to find out what they
can get away with and if you can get
away with it on Twitter then you can
take it to the rest of the world so this
is the biggest battle
because our our political system is now
basically down to what Twitter will
allow you to see
and I think it has been this way and I
think that's what I think our last
election
came down to what Twitter allowed people
to see
let me let me ask you this
as many times as the Charlottesville
fine people thing
uh I'm gonna get rid of this guy
as many times as the Charlottesville
why why are you on here saying bad
things Eddie
all right Eddie don't do that
um I'm gonna I'm gonna turn off the
locals uh the locals uh I'm Gonna Keep
the locals feed but I'm going to turn
off the uh open part so it's going to be
only for people who are subscribers
because I think I got a troll over here
so when I turn off the uh the open part
it should get rid of the troll so we'll
do that if you're on locals uh and
you're not the troll go over the YouTube
and you can watch it
good
boom all right so locals is now private
for subscribers
um but I'm not wrong right the battle
over Twitter is is our new political
system
because Twitter will determine what we
think or what the journalists can get
away with and back to my earlier point
if if musk had owned Twitter
before could Biden have run on the fine
people hoax and gotten away with it
I'm not sure
I don't think he could have because it
was only because the Democrats were
completely walled off from any hoax
debunking they just never saw it
and even the professionals never saw it
there are plenty of people in the
professional reporting journalist field
who actually believes the fine P that
the you know the Charlottesville fine
people hoax was a real thing that
happened
they literally believe it happened
that's only because Twitter allowed them
not to see the other side
so maybe that'll change I don't know
um and certainly Twitter has completely
changed who is visible My visibility on
Twitter went through the roof recently
I I don't know if anybody's noticed if
you look at my Twitter feed the number
of subscribers is climbing like crazy
faster than ever before and when I do
even a medium quality tweet
I get over a thousand likes
and that would have been 200 before Musk
so it's probably a 5x visibility
difference for me
now you don't think the left was trying
to suppress me
if they were trying to suppress me they
weren't they weren't playing the right
game they should have been they should
have figured out who's making a
difference who could move the needle and
and focus on those people
all right
um
musk this is like the biggest story
I don't know of since the pandemic I
guess or maybe maybe it's not as big as
Ukraine but it's up there
that mosque is going to go full
transparency
he's promised us that the public
deserves to know what quote really
happened at Twitter in terms of the
censorship
they're actually preparing a full report
that will be on Twitter so and this is
fun too Twitter will be the publisher
so that this is something you would
normally expect to be published in some
other place and Twitter would just point
to it
but because it's Elon he's doing it the
smart way it will be published on
Twitter so you have to go to Twitter and
you have to stay there to read it
anybody who says that anybody who says
that musk isn't going to make this a
better product you're really not paying
attention he's already made it a better
product there's no question about it
like everything he's doing even the
mistakes are all heading in the right
direction okay that didn't work all
right that didn't work either but we'll
try this I mean it's all working
um but I would say it is also true that
the uh the worst racist have returned to
the platform
would you agree
is there anybody seen an increase in uh
anti-Semitism and racism I have
seen it but only recently
only the last few days I didn't see it
until the last few days now maybe
because of his amnesty or something
yeah I've seen some super ugly
anti-semitic kind of stuff lately
could be the yeah it's the yay effect
because people are people are using that
as their topic for which to spew yeah
it's probably the yeah effect
um but we'll see if that's a lasting
thing or not now what's interesting
about this is we're going to find out if
Twitter suppressed the laptop story
I hope I don't know if this will happen
but imagine this
I don't think this is going to happen
but imagine if
musk can tell you how individuals were
censored
can you imagine that
could you imagine if I could find out
exactly how I was censored
just imagine that
that would the headset would explode
everywhere
and then let me ask you this
what will the left do when this becomes
public if if it's as bad as we think now
I don't want to get ahead of the Krakens
like I I have a I have a uh unfortunate
history of uh Imagining the Kraken will
be reproduced and then no cracking
happens I'm definitely a a crack in
non-denir and that's on me
yeah I did expect a kraken
not because I thought there was a
problem because I believe the people who
said it was coming and I didn't know
that they were completely non-credible
as it turns out
so that's on me I should have seen I
should have seen that come honestly
but if it happens I was how is the left
going to handle
the fact that all of their Badness has
been revealed here's how I think
and it's already happening and it goes
like this
all of that Badness was really goodness
that's what it'll be
of course we were suppressing Trump
because
he called uh he called neo-nazi's Fine
people of course we suppressed him
obviously of course
yeah it won't even be embarrassing it
won't be embarrassing
because they'll say yeah we want more of
that people are actually calling for
Twitter to return to the rules before
Musk
they're asking to go back
to what they have to know by now was
total censorship
but they believed they were censoring
the right people
now
do you think that musk has changed the
rules on who's censored
I haven't heard of it have you
because I bury people saying I need
Twitter to go back to the old rules
the rules never changed have they did I
miss a story
I believe that that Twitter has always
been anti-hate speech
anti-hate speech
and if there's misinformation they'll
put a tag on it so you've got some
context
it's the same rules
but people are people are going to
imagine a different experience right the
left is going to imagine that Twitter
turned into a hell hole even if it
doesn't
and the right is going to imagine that
the controls were taken off even if the
only thing happening is more
conservatives are joining Twitter so
your traffic is going up and you'll
think oh it's because the censorship
came off so we're deeply in confirmation
bias territory which is affecting me
right you're going to see it in real
time
if you want to see a rational person
who is completely under the spell of
confirmation bias I offer myself
because Twitter is such a confirmation
bias generator
that I I'm pretty sure I'm going to
imagine my experiences changing on
Twitter even if it doesn't
I'm pretty sure I'll imagine it does
don't you agree so you're going to get
to watch me
falling falling victim to confirmation
bias even when I know it even when I
know it's going to happen it's still
going to happen I don't think I have any
defense against it because you feel the
way you feel right and then you report
it
but I'm at least aware that I'll be
wrong
um
all right
so
uh
what what do we think about this yay
Fuentes business now
besides the fact that it'll take Trump
out of the race for good just because
the left will make us never forget
anything else I mean they'll make us
think about it forever
uh whose Fuentes yeah
I know
I mean the the fact that uh these folks
all showed up
and by the way uh somebody says Kanye is
legitimately anti-semite it seems like
it
that you know Kanye's had plenty of time
to soften his soften his opinion or
whatever but at this point I feel like
we can just say he wants us to believe
that he is anti-Semitic wouldn't you say
he's not telling you he's not I mean he
does that thing I can't be anti-semitic
because I'm a Jew but nobody takes that
seriously it looks like he just he's
putting it out there as that's who he is
uh I don't know we'll keep an eye on
this it's fun to watch but do you think
that uh Kanye is operating by the way if
you watched any of the Tim pool uh uh
interview with yay or especially the
aftermath because it continued after yay
left in that sort of a conversation
around the table about what they'd
experienced the funniest part about it
is watching every member of the table
refer to him as Kanye and then have to
correct it
and I thought
that is why yea is yay
and that's why the performer formerly
known as Prince was the performer
formerly known as Prince one of the
things that you can do if you're smart
enough
and you're famous enough
is you can make your name really
inconvenient for other people
and then you have to spend a whole bunch
of time talking about them like extra
time because you got to talk you got to
correct the name so I'm watching this
the the Tim pool group around the table
and every one of them made a point
they're like well Kanye I'm sorry I mean
yay
I'm sorry
I apologize I didn't mean to do that uh
if you're watching uh I meant Yay and
every one of them had to do it on every
comment to the point where it was just
ridiculous
and they were you know noticing it
themselves of course but
that's one of the ways he draws energy
he gets energy because you have to talk
about it more even to refer to him just
the simplest thing you have to put extra
energy into it so he's definitely an
energy monster and he knows how to
attract it and he knows how to use it
but what's going on now
uh does anybody think that what we're
seeing with yay
is some form of Genius or do you think
it's mental illness what would you say
genius or mental illness
or attention like I guess that would be
genius
performance art
if you say his performance art is a
genius
because let's say he let's say he
intended it to be performance art
you'd have to be insane to think this
was going to work
do you think the divorce broke him
it looks like the divorce broke him
actually
that's what I think
yeah I think the divorce actually broke
him I I think that everything he cared
about in life
was his family
and he lost it
and I think he lost everything
and I think that when he gave up his
billions of dollars it's because it
didn't mean a thing to him
and he kind of says that now right
he had he was the richest black guy is
that what he was saying the richest
black guy or something everybody lost
his family
he had nothing
like that I think I think that's the
story of yay
is that it looks like he had everything
because he had riches and multiple
companies and fame and he was Beloved
the other family he loved him and kids
and and then the only party lost
was the family and kids and what did he
have left
nothing
after you after his family and kids were
taken from him or you know you could say
it was his own fault whatever I don't
know the difference but once he lost
that he actually didn't have anything
so he tried God
you know it looked like he moved his
emphasis to religion and it looks like
it wasn't enough
he's trying he's trying politics
and it looks like that's not enough
so to me this all looks like uh mental
illness
but caused by a specific PTSD
you know I'm speaking in my layman terms
I'm using all the wrong words for Mental
Illness but you know what I mean right I
I believe he was maybe
as all Geniuses are you know a little
bit crazy artistic Geniuses anyway the
artistic Geniuses tend to be a little
bit crazy and a little bit genius at the
same time and I think that the divorce
broken and it just pushed them into the
wrong side that's what it looks like
because I don't see anything here that
looks like a good strategy do you
if I did I'd call it out like I'd love
to tell you oh you're all missing the
clever play you know if you do
if you knew as much as I do
you know about persuasion you'd see how
cleverly he's playing you all about I
don't see anything I don't say that
I I see somebody who's working through
some problems
that's all that's what I say now
the the next part is hard
um
you know the
the way he's treated the anti-Semitism
uh issue
it's very
it's very ugly and like I I can't be in
favor of that I can't have any empathy
for that at all but at the same time I
have empathy for him
because I to me I see a victim
and
maybe he was a victim that people ganged
up on him you know maybe his maybe his
trainer who had some kind of
weird background and threatened him we
know maybe he was part of it
I don't know
but he looks like somebody who was
destroyed by people who had an agenda
of some sort
now you could argue that he wasn't
strong enough to avoid that destruction
that's always another way to look at it
but I I have empathy for yay at the same
time I severely disavow his opinions
which I feel like is the way a president
should have approached it
I think a president should say I have a
great empathy it looks like he's going
through a tough time
but you know still I have to disavow
what he said completely
all right
um
I wonder if everything's I can't get off
of this topic but I wonder if
everything's going to be different after
we find out what Twitter actually did
like how how deep does that go
for example
just just as an example here are the
things we might find out
what if we find out uh what organized
groups were organizing trolls
suppose if you found out who the troll
Masters are
like wouldn't you love to know that
what if we found out how much foreign
influence there's been at Twitter
foreign
how much do you want to know that
like a lot
yeah how about our own Intel and FBI how
much influence have they had
has anybody who is not a Twitter
employee
ever had Direct access to cancel people
would you like to know that wouldn't you
like to know if there's any app
that allowed any law enforcement or
anybody to change a Twitter experience
where Twitter didn't even have to
approve it it was just giving somebody
else a button to push would you like to
know
because I'll bet somebody did I'll bet
somebody outside of Twitter had a button
it just feels like that's the type of
thing we'd find out right I have no
evidence of that it just feels like it
what else are we going to find out
will we find out that our user accounts
are completely artificial
and that you know will I find out that
of my almost 800 000 followers what if I
find out that half of them are Bots
for Republicans who thought they liked
boosting my signal
totally possible
totally possible Right
could be
yeah I mean I have no idea how deep this
this hole is but wow am I interested
now apparently Apple has threatened
Twitter
because of this censorship stuff
uh Apple is threatened to take the
Twitter app out of the app store which
would pretty much kill Twitter as a
viable business
do you think that Apple would execute
that do you think that Apple would drop
the the nuclear option on Twitter
because if they do the reason would be
that they say there there are too many
too much Haze speech right so it would
be a hate speech thing
Now isn't this hate speech thing really
subjective
meaning you could say yes that's too
much hate speech or that's not too much
hate speech isn't that kind of just an
opinion how much is too much and how
much is Free Speech
because all free speech has some you
know hate baked into it
yeah
so
my first impression was this that it
would be such a suicide play that Apple
would never do it because if Apple did
it they would lose I don't know 20 of
the customers overnight something like
that I mean I I would I'm totally in the
Apple universe but I'd have to think
really seriously about dumping them
forever if they if they killed Twitter
because to me that would be attack on
the on the Republic
does it feel like that to you and it
wouldn't feel exactly like an attack on
Twitter users
to me that would feel like a direct
attack on the Republic
that's how I take it
to me that wouldn't look like you know
free market that wouldn't look like any
kind of free market thing that would
look like
just the worst thing
and so my first impression was Apple
would never take a risk that big because
they don't take risks like that right
that's just not an apple thing
but here's my second risk
Tim Cook might be the only person in the
world
who leads Democrat
who could stop Musk
from creating free speech
there's only one person who could stop
it now maybe you could argue Google too
good too
one guy
do you know how much pressure Tim Cook
is going to get from everybody he knows
and loves
you don't think the top Democrats have
already talked to Tim Cook and said you
know
you know it would make you awesome
you know what would make us love you
even more
if you could just do this one thing for
us just kill Twitter
yeah
and I think he might actually do it
it's the sort of thing that no rational
business person would do but I don't
think we're in rational business person
territory I think we're in a virtue
signaling territory
and here's what I think might happen
I'm going to make a tentative prediction
that if Tim Cook
removes Twitter from the Apple Store
that the board at Twitter is going to
remove Tim Cook
the Tim Cook would lose his job for that
right because I would certainly never
buy an Apple product while he was still
CEO
I wouldn't know I'd be done
I would say I'll still buy Apple
products but you got to get rid of that
guy because I like the products I don't
want to deny myself a good product
I love Apple I'm a really big Apple fan
I have stock by the way so I'm not
unbiased so I love Apple
but if one person decides to attack the
Republic
I'm going to act on that pretty quickly
all right here is how Twitter can
destroy Apple
I also own some Tesla Tesla stock and
so you know I don't know if I have any
indirect benefit from that but
um
your current phone is a absolute piece
of does anybody ever notice that
does anybody noticed that your phone is
a complete piece of now it's a
technological Wonder
but
may I may I do a skit of me using the
worst interface ever designed okay
here's me I think I'd like to send a
message
step one
find which app to use to send the
message
now
I'm in already my brain's in the wrong
place the messages in my head
I'm forming the message that I want to
send and who I want to send it to and
then I pick up my phone and the first
thing my phone does is make me think
about something else
fail
Ure
my phone should be blank screen
and the you know there should be no apps
there should be no apps there should be
one AI
the guesses what I'm trying to do when I
start doing it I should be able to just
do what I want and have the AI guess
what I want what I intended for example
I would have a blank screen and pick it
up and start saying
um
yes thank you please do buy those
groceries we were talking about
and then as I'm writing the message I
want the AI to look at it and say oh
this person is typing a message
so he doesn't want to consume
information he's in producing mode
so at the top it would produce all the
apps where the the directions the
message could go from you know WhatsApp
to telegram to whatever
and then after I make the message and
I've done all my thinking
then I'm done thinking and now I say
well which app did I want to pick
Boop
here's what's wrong with your phone
it's built for the app makers
your phone is not built for the user
it's built for the App Market it's built
to make it a a viable commercial Market
to do that you need apps
do you need an app
how many of you woke up and said you
know if only I had an app no apps are
 apps are trouble apps are extra
work apps make you have to sign on again
apps make your password go away apps can
kick you off the platform apps are all
the problems
I just want to know what I want to do
and start doing it
now I might have two choices either
producing or consuming
so if I want to consume I was like oh
I'm bored I want to consume and I can
look at look at some Instagram posts and
stuff like that
so I think I think that the entire
interface of phones
somebody and it could be Elon Musk
someday somebody needs to develop the AI
version that just guesses what you want
to do and gives you the options but
makes you think about it after you've
done your work
so you want to work first
and then do the details of where that
work goes does that make sense how many
of you think that the basic model of an
app driven phone I mean look at all my
 apps
this is this is nobody in the world
would have invented this for the
consumer
you you tell me that there's any user
who would say yeah here's what I want I
want to have to go search for a
app and every time I got to sign up and
subscribe and all that here's
what I want to do
I want to I want to open up my blank
screen and say 100 plus 300 and as soon
as I type 100 plus 300 I want the AI on
my phone to say oh he wants a
spreadsheet Boop
and as I'm typing a spreadsheet appears
and and now I can just keep going
because I don't want to pick a
spreadsheet I just want to start working
and have the spreadsheet form around me
because it's obvious I'm in spreadsheet
mode
right
why does a document have to be one for a
spreadsheet and one for typing
who decided that I need a separate app
to put a spreadsheet in the middle of my
word document not me
if you'd asked me I would do there would
be no apps I just do what I want to do
and it all works
so here's here's the problem that Apple
has
Apple and Google are both Legacy user
interfaces and it would be really really
hard for them to change
but if musk decides to compete with them
what if he does it without apps
what if he does it with a super AI
and here's what a phone should be your
phone should have nothing on it but a
password and uh 5G
that's it just a password
and 5G and the minor operating system
but everything else should happen in the
cloud through Ai and then it should
deliver it to you and when I replace my
phone the phone should cost me like a
hundred dollars
because the phone is just a dumb screen
and all the intelligence happens in the
network at 5G speed or or and through
right
how many of you think I'm on to
something because here's the part I can
guarantee
I can guarantee you with a hundred
percent certainty that in a hundred
years there'll be no such thing as a
smartphone with apps
you'd all agree with that right
because there's no way this model is the
one that lasts it's just too stupid
so musk can put apple on a business
he can't
and and the technology to do that only
just came online because you need 5G or
in satellites those are online
uh and you would need uh Superfast chips
so that they could handle a remote
processing
and you'd get rid of apps and AI could
get rid of apps right
I don't even know if AI would need to
build you an app
I think AI could just sort of handle
what you needed
without you ever being aware that
there's something like an app
all right so if you didn't think that
Elon Musk could put apple on a business
he actually can't
well it would be hard
but there is actually a path where Elon
Musk personally could put apple on a
business
with just leapfrogging the technology of
the phone
probably won't happen yes probably won't
happen
um
did you see the uh the Maricopa hearings
about the election
anybody watch the video from that
so in Maricopa there were public
hearings before they certified the
election it was the Kerry Lake versus
Hobbs one where Kerry Lake lost
according to the certification
now they did certify it but not until
listening to the public just rake the
officials for what a bad job they did
and when you when you hear all the
anecdotal reports
of these are unconfirmed things it's
just people talking so it's anecdotal
but the anecdotal reports are just
vicious
if you hear them out of context you know
without the officials responding to why
it's not such a big problem if you're
down a context it just sounds like the
whole election was just totally
totally just screwed the pooch like
nothing about it was credible
but here's the part that that I want to
summarize
if you knew
that the difference between a Republican
and a Democrat victory
was how inconvenient it was to vote on
Election Day because Democrats vote by
mail more often
if you could make voting on on the day
of a little bit inconvenient wouldn't
that be enough to throw the election
that's all it would take right
you simply have to make sure that it
doesn't go smoothly on the day of and
and that's it
now you remember those machines that had
been tested and yet it turned out that
they were poorly calibrated for the ink
that was on the ballots
do you think anybody would be smart
enough to know
that if they tweaked that calibration
ahead of time
just make it a little bit below the
level that it might take hours to figure
out what's wrong and correct it and in
those hours a lot of Republicans would
give up and leave the line
that would be a pretty straightforward
prediction when if we can just make the
lines longer on Election Day that's all
we need
because people don't have infinite time
they vote during the work day and some
of them just need to say it I'm
going home
so
it looks to me
without any proof of this right it looks
to be like the inefficiency was the
feature not the at the accident
and it's being treated like a feature
not an accident because we're not trying
to fix it
right if you saw some big move for a
Maricopa to say my God we've got to
change this system you know we've got to
make sure nothing like this ever happens
so here's what we're going to do to fix
all of this no no as far as I know they
plan to run the next election in the
same way
I'm just going to guess but I'll bet you
the next election has some long lines
and some unexpected technical problems
that don't look like any rigged election
at all it's just hey it's technology
technology sometimes is
is you know a little bit tweaked wrong
no big deal it's sort of normal you'd
expect a few hiccups in exactly the
right place
so we got the most problems
and the place that would actually change
the election
all the other there are other places
that had problems too but
a coincidence wasn't it that the one
place that would definitely change
things
that place had little problems long
lines
and
as many times as they check the machines
the night before how weird that they
didn't work the very next day
how weird
yeah
I don't know here's my take
here's my take on the elections
guilty until proven innocent
guilty until proven innocent that's my
standard
and to me they look guilty
so uh you can let's see if I get kicked
off of of of social media YouTube
and the the whoever is watching me on
YouTube and decides whether to monetize
me
uh is my opinion that The credibility of
the last election
is below the level in which you should
accept it
now I I don't have any specific Claim
about a specific bad Shenanigans I'm
just saying that the overall situation
with which we've been presented
doesn't appear
designed to make us believe it
it doesn't seem designed
for us to believe it it's designed for
us not to believe it which causes more
problems for Republicans right what's
the worst case scenario for Republicans
an election they say they don't believe
right that was the Trap
it's the perfect trap if we can trap
those Republicans into doubting a second
election
everybody's going to think that they're
not good citizens
right
so YouTube I don't know who did what I'm
making no specific uh allegations of bad
behavior I'm simply saying that if you
look at the design which is intentional
the intentional design
is to make it less credible
so I accept what I've Been Told
I've been given the officials have given
me a non-credible election by Design
intentionally
by Design and so I accept what they've
given me it's not credible so I reject
the uh
the
2022 election
in my opinion uh it I don't have a
specific
allegation it was presented to us in a
way that we're being told not to believe
it and so I accept the message
it would be easy to say
here's here's what we're doing to make
you feel more comfortable with the
result
but I don't see that
you know if you had that I'd say oh
you're designing the system to make me
feel comfortable with the result I get
that now I feel I do feel more
comfortable but if you design it in a
way
the design is very clearly to make us
less comfortable with the results
because they know how to do it the other
way right
do you think there's any doubt among the
professionals how to make the election
completely unquestionable
yeah just paper ballots count on the
same day have witnesses it's easy
there's no question about how to do it
so it's a choice
and it's a choice of both sides appear
to be making
so if both sides are making the choice
to have
non-credible looking elections you as a
consumer should take the message and say
oh you're presenting us a non-credible
election we'll accept it as a
non-credible election now
having said that
I agree with certifying it
I agree with certifying it
same reason I agreed with moving on when
Trump allegedly lost in 2020.
because you do have to move on
you do have to move on
and that's a separate question from
fixing the problem you have to fix the
problem but sometimes you just have to
move on to
you can redo the election yeah no but we
would just be redoing it with a system
that's not credible
but do you mind that the vote was
um maybe not as accurate as it could
have been
given that some people may not have
participated
here's why I'm not complaining as much
as I could
it was the first thing I said today
I don't think the vote is what matters
I think it's censorship determined The
Narrative The Narrative determined the
opinions the opinions determined the
vote
and pretty much you know 90 of how we
ended up where we were is from the
censorship
not not from anything else
so the vote was important and it may
have been the you know the last straw
because it was a close close election so
it probably did matter just because it
was close but 90 of it was just that the
censorship determined what people saw
what people saw determined their
opinions and then they voted on the
repentance
so it wasn't actually a
informed the public and then the public
makes opinions and votes for the
representatives sort of the way a
republic should work nothing like that
happened
nothing like that happened the the
brainwashers decided what we would think
and then we acted on that's all
right do a redo yeah we maybe we should
have some kind of a uh
some kind of a standing redo system so
you can redo it quickly now here's what
I'd like to do I would love
to see a survey of how many Republicans
got out of line
and then separately how many of them
didn't vote in the normal way but maybe
you had to put their ballot in the
special Ballot Box that didn't have a
good chain of custody so wouldn't you
like to know
how many Republicans got out of line
because it might be none it might be
none because it could be the Republicans
were just you know screw it I'm here all
day you're not going to make me get
online because you know Republicans are
pretty much
uh tough characters
which is exactly why I like them right
the thing I most I like most about
conservatives is that when they have a
principle
they're really going to stick to it like
they're really sticky on principle and
if the principle is you're not going to
discourage me from voting
maybe every single Republican in the
United States stayed in line as long as
it took
it's possible because because the
Republicans are not like regular people
right they're not they're they're very
stubborn and they don't like to get they
don't like to get beaten you know by a
game you know they're not going to be
they like to be beaten by a magic trick
uh
all right thought experiment
uh why can anyone do that list of things
to succeed but not anyone can avoid
overeating oh
good question so I told you the things
that somebody needs to succeed
and why do I think that somebody has you
know Free Will and they can do that
thing when I don't think that people can
stop overeating because they like to eat
and the thing is that eating is an
addiction
and addictions are a whole different
deal
right so if you have an addiction you
have to be in addiction mode to deal
with that but what I was talking about
was sort of a non-addiction you're just
a kid and you're trying to figure out
your way in the world there's no
addiction involved so if there's no
addiction involved you can you can
certainly brainwash kids in the
direction you want
make a clip of my mom's useful advice
maybe so
yeah maybe so the trouble is that my mom
had that be the best at one thing advice
which is the opposite of what I ended up
doing
to good effect
all right
you need a micro lesson and hoarding oh
yeah maybe I'll do that make a listen to
hoarding
you want to stop hoarding I assume you
don't want to micro listen on how to
horde more
yeah maybe so
that's a good re I can reframe that I
think
uh let's talk about China
let's talk about China
you know there's an interesting thing
when I see the uh the aerial views of
the protests
so the things that are different number
one it's not that unusual to have
protests in China what's unusual is that
they're Country-Wide
uh that's unusual and they they may be
bigger you know in each individual place
than we've seen before
um but here's what here's the thing that
I'm
I'm really taken by when I look at the
crowds
so you see a big crowd from above and
you'll see the uh let's say the uh Riot
police I guess they tend to be dressed
in all white and or police uniforms and
you can see how many police there are
and then you can see the size of the
public crowd
and it looks to me like the crowd is
more powerful than the the law
enforcement
like a lot
and I don't think that the Law
Enforcement wants to open fire
and start massacring people because that
then the public goes to the next level
as well
and I'm watching that and I'm thinking
it looks like the the Indian uh elephant
trainer situation is what it looks like
let me explain that I use this example a
lot if you're an elephant trainer how do
you get this gigantic mammal that could
crush you
if it wants to to follow your orders how
do you make an elephant afraid of you
like I always wondered like why does the
elephant do anything for this little
person like it makes sense why your dog
does what you want because you're bigger
than your dog usually right you feed it
but it seems like the elephant would
just want to crush you if you beat it
with a stick
but the way they do it is they they hurt
the elephant when it's a baby
so when the elephant is a baby and it
doesn't know how to fight back or
anything the elephant trainer you know
hits it until the elephant is afraid of
the human and then the human never
becomes less afraid of the human the
elephant never does so the elephant
becomes a you know big monster but still
thinks that little human can beat it up
so that never changed and I feel like
the the Chinese public
is the elephant
because I watched the number of people
there are protesting and it's a far
bigger Force than the number trying to
stop them it's not even close
now yes if that Force wanted to use
Firearms then then it's not a fair fight
but if they use the firearms then the
crowd gets bigger too
right so here's what I don't think the
Chinese public knows
they have complete control
already
the Chinese public has complete control
and they don't know it
because if you saw the the size of the
crowd they just have to rush they just
have to rush the other people
they just have to say all right we're
just we're going to take you down
and just use numbers and just take them
out
and I feel like the public either the
public doesn't want to escalate
or they think they don't have the power
like like the elephant that was abused
as a baby because they've been abused
since birth to do what they're told
and even as rebellious as they are now
which is impressive to watch I feel like
they still don't know how much power
they have
I I look at it from above and I say this
is a five minute problem
people would die
but it's a five minute problem every one
of those law enforcement people could be
grabbed by a person in in the crowd
brought down
five minutes in five minutes they would
own the city
but they're not doing it now here's the
question
what would have happened in America
forget about guns for a second just
imagine imagine the protesters are
unarmed in America
do you think America would not have
already taken down the law enforcement
I think Americans would have already
taken them down
because we're not trained like the
elephant
we're trained to think we are in control
yeah maybe maybe it's one of the things
that makes Americans such one
of the one of the reasons we're
is we grow up thinking we're in control
right
we think we have all kinds of Power even
if we don't
so if you if you have a crowd of
Americans who are that pissed off
and the and the number of people who are
preventing them from going or doing
whatever they were was that small
this would be so over
the only thing that's keeping China
intact is this psychological thing that
keeps these citizens thinking they're
weaker than the government and they are
not not even close they are the elephant
and they're and they're just they don't
know they can stomp on the government
anytime they want
that's what it looks like
so what this means is
no I did not forget the Chinese military
I did not
because I'm I'm calculating here that if
China was sent in the military and they
started killing massive people which
they'd have to do that the the citizens
would rise up to an even higher level
Now in America that's what would happen
in America if there were more Force
brought against the crowd the crowd
would increase their own force and then
they would be armed after that point
now China can't arm itself so that
they've got a different situation but
they can still take out a small Force
now my understanding is that the Chinese
military is actually smaller than the
local community enforcement
because they need lots of local
community enforcement relative to how
many they need in the military
so
it is possible
that if the psychology of the Chinese
people changes
and it could you you could imagine some
small event that just changes their
psychology the moment they say we have
decided
verses we want
it's all over
the Chinese people have not decided
they have not they simply they're
expressing a desire they're just they're
expressing a a preference a very strong
preference
but if the Chinese people decide it's a
five-minute problem
it's five minutes they will just destroy
the the whoever whoever is stopping them
and they will just do what they need to
do they'll take care of business
so there is there's a very big
possibility
that China is teetering on uh a full
Revolution
and nothing physical is stopping it from
happening there's no physical thing just
that little bit of
mental switch and if that switches
all bets are off now I would bet against
that happening I would better I would
bet in favor of the Chinese government
suppressing them it goes back to normal
and the reason is I think they're so
well they're so well uh trained
I think that the conditioning is so deep
that they they simply will never know
their own power and they won't they
won't express it
now do Iran
Iran is different
than any situation I've I'm aware of
because the women seem to be taking a
lead now maybe I don't have that right
but if there's anybody who has any
Iranian connections can you do me a fact
check
does it still look like the women are
taking the lead and the men are helping
does it look like that
see once that happens
um
then we're in unpredicted unpredictable
territory
because you know the the male female
relationship in Iran is something we
can't fully understand
and we don't really know how much power
women have in Iran
if you listen to anybody who was born
there they'll tell you some version of
this
oh yeah the men are totally in control
the men have all the power
yeah except at home
within the house
the The Matriarch has an unusual amount
of power
but you know outside and if anybody's
looking the men have all the power now I
don't know how much of that's true
that's just sort of a thing you hear but
if they really do control the house
who knows
who knows anything's possible
and if uh if Iran goes ahead and does a
mass hanging
I think I'll bets are off
apparently they're going to or maybe
they already have a public hanging of
one of the leaders
and that is like a bad bad play for Iran
doing that in public seems in 2022 seems
like the dumbest thing the leadership
could do
uh to me it looks like they'd just be
begging for their own
their own demise all right did I miss
any stories
anything that uh I should have talked
about that I didn't
would you sell your Apple stock if they
banned Twitter yes yes I would if if
Apple uh if Apple bans Twitter I'm
selling my Apple stock immediately and
and not just because of politics
but because I think uh musk might take
them down
I think he might take him down if Apple
take if Apple tries to destroy his 44
billion dollar investment
he's not going to leave any weapon
unused
that that is full War
do you think Apple wants a full war
against Elon Musk because that's not
 around right if they take out
his 44 billion dollar investment and and
what he thinks is the only hope for free
speech
there will be no weapon that he won't
use
to fix that situation and you've never
seen Elon unrestrained
I don't even know what that looks like
there's a David sacks tweet
all right there's a David sacks tweet
and that is interesting enough that I'm
going to look at it before we go here
let's let's find that so because if you
don't know there are some people whose
opinions are just a little more
let's say a little more persuasive than
others
let's see David sacks
let's see what he said that you're
uh
uh oh there we go
uh you mean the 23 minutes ago it was 23
minutes ago David sacks tweeted as long
as uh Tech Maga Microsoft Apple Google
and Amazon
Mega
m-a-g-a Microsoft Apple Google and
Amazon
oh my God that's good
Wow have unlimited power to engage in
bundling and to act as Gatekeepers of
competitive products there cannot be a
healthy startup ecosystem
there we go
uh
and then earlier 42 minutes ago David
sack says with the possible exception of
Microsoft in the late 90s there's never
been a tech Monopoly as powerful as
Apple
its power is so fear of the few
applications company will dare to
criticize Apple publicly even though
almost all privately voice similar
concerns as Elon Musk
oh
Glenn Greenwald your David sax retweets
them Glenn Greenwell said there are a
few things more revealing of an
authoritarian mindset than wanting
Google and apple to use their Monopoly
power to act as an internet internet
overlords dictating who can and can't be
heard
yet that's our situation and so many
seem grateful
uh
wow
um
here's what I think
Tim Scott is not going to is not going
to pick a fight with some of the most
powerful people in Silicon Valley
David Sachs is a a wonderfully public
with both his influence and his opinions
I can tell you for sure that there are
powerful people in Silicon Valley who
are less public
who would go after Apple pretty hard for
this if Apple tried to take down Twitter
the there there would be major powers
in Silicon Valley
who would go after Apple pretty
hard and I would be I would be joining
that team immediately
so I think I think Tim Cook is connected
enough and he can read the room well
enough to know that this would not be a
fight with just their users
you know this this wouldn't be just a
Public Relation relations problem this
would be a
existential threat to Apple
there are people big enough who would
just want to wipe them off the map and
probably had the power to do it
so my prediction is that Apple will back
down
if it was real I don't know how real it
was that Apple was really considering
bumping them I I think probably the
truth
probably Apple just did a warning shot
across the bow
because Apple wants to establish that
it's the good person and they're doing
the right things so I think apple is
just positioning
so that people say oh Apple's the good
one they said don't go too far with your
you know your lack of censorship or
we'll have to ban you so I think it's
just a warning shot
which actually is no problem at all
I I think everybody should do warning
shots if there's something to warn about
so I don't mind a warning shot
um
never go to war with a man who owns a
rocket company yeah
yeah never go to war with somebody who
literally owns a spaceship
hahaha
that's good advice and never start a
fight with somebody who owns a spaceship
I might tweet that
maybe one of you could tweet it
[Laughter]
all right that's all I got for today
uh did I miss any uh big stuff
I think I got it all all right
uh YouTube and uh
and Rumble and everybody else I'll say
goodbye to you but I'll talk to locals
for a few minutes
because they're special people bye for
now
