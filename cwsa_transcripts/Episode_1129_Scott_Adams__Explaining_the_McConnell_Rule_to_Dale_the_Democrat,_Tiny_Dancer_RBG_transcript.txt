hey everybody
come on in it's time for
coffee with scott adams the best part of
the day every single time
every now and then you say to yourself
well it can't be the best part of the
day
again but it can it really can
and here it is and all you need to enjoy
the best part of the day is
well i think you know it's a copper
bunker glass a tanker challenger stein a
canteen trigger flash
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite
liquid i like coffee and join me now for
the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day the
thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous step it happens now go
oh that's what i needed that's what we
all needed
so i was just watching a video in
portland of the protesters
and apparently somebody who lived in an
apartment
above where the protesters were thought
it would be funny to
throw eggs at the protesters from above
and i thought to myself how many of
those windows
open because if the protesters are in
areas below
lots of places that have windows that
open
well i think we found a way to solve
this problem sounds like if the police
won't take care of the protesters
there's nothing that chickens plus
residents can't get done together
it might you might break a few eggs as
they say
as the saying goes you got to break a
few eggs to stop a protest
i think that's a saying right all right
let's uh
talk about the news the most impressive
thing that happened
last night is that
of course you all know the news ruth
gate ruth bader ginsburg passed away
last night
and one of her greatest accomplishments
in a life full of accomplishments
is that in 2020
right before a major contentious
election
the most divided we've ever been in this
country
for a period of about one hour
nobody in the country was a dick
did you notice i turned on the tv and i
thought
well how long will it be before people
start being awful
and i thought oh it's actually just
people saying
nice things and caring about her family
and respecting her legacy
respectfully saying that maybe they
disagreed with her own policy but
that she was a you know a great woman
and
it kind of felt good didn't it i don't
know if you uh
if you sampled it but you know obviously
if you went to msnbc
or cnn they would be pro ruth bader
ginsburg and you'd expect it to go that
way
but if you went over to fox very
respectful
very respectful from from hannity all
the way through
and i kind of appreciated it i'm kind of
appreciated
that there was just an hour for the
whole year
there was just like this one hour where
we were not being dicks to each other
felt good um
so here's a rule i would like to
suggest you know generally speaking that
we don't like to talk
business the same day somebody died
you know you don't want to be talking
about so you know who gets the job after
this person died
um you know the moment they've died
but i would like to make an exception in
this case
number one it appears that ruth bader
ginsburg is
universally respected so nobody's going
to be disrespecting her just because
we're talking about what happens
in in the vacancy number two
if somebody's last written statement
on their deathbed talks about
filling their vacancy then you can talk
about it too
you can talk about the moment they pass
because that was their
it was literally their dying wish so her
dying wish
is that we talk about and deal with
her replacement she said it specifically
so i think in this case it is perfectly
respectful to just
jump in and talk about the politics of
it because
that was literally her final wish and
let's talk about all the things
number one did you all see
president trump's masterful
uh reaction when he was told about her
death
there was if he didn't see it he was
leaving his event apparently he did not
hear about it during his speech because
he was on
stage when it happened and it was a long
i don't know two hours on stage
so there was a long period where
everybody in the country except
the president of the united states knew
ruth bader against brigade passed
so he gets off the stage and he goes to
his plane
and there the press pool is there
cameras are on
and it was one of the most remarkable
things
i've ever seen for a political situation
and here's what was remarkable because
of the setup
because it was a plane on a tarmac and
it was just right after an event
most important person in the world the
president of the united states
most important event the the lighting
and the set were perfect for this
it looked just like a movie set just
perfectly lit
in the background quite easily heard
was elton john's tiny dancer
tiny dancer are you kidding me
ruth bader ginsburg is about what was
she
five feet tall or something very small i
mean when you think of her you think of
her as
tiny tiny and female
and tiny dancer is playing in the
background when the president comes up
and
is told you know he says and he says
what
and then he gave what i would say would
be
um very i would say
an an empathy-filled response
that looked genuine and he looked like
just a real human being who was just
expressing his sadness he said he felt
sad
and and that she was an amazing amazing
woman
and he said she had an amazing life etc
now
you don't expect the president to be
empathetic uh to show real concern
and to be respectful you know
you kind of you think he's in rally mode
and
campaign mode and rpg was on the other
side
politically so you'd think that maybe he
wouldn't give a perfect
response but he kind of did and i think
that
i i saw at least one hardcore
anti-trumper
even say okay gotta admit
gotta admit that was very presidential
so let me add the fun part of this
you ready do you believe
that the president walked all the way
from
the stage to the airplane
without anybody telling him that ruth
bader ginsburg had died
really
do you really think somebody said she
was four point four foot six is that
true
do you really think he made it all the
way from the stage
now the stage was really near the
airplane so
you can see the stage and the airplane
it's on the tarmac
literally on the tarmac so you only have
to get down
and walk i don't know maybe
a few plane lengths to get to the plane
but you don't think anybody talk to him
when he got off the stage
nobody shouted it out you know the the
first person he talked to didn't say
i just want to give you a heads up rgb
passed away
because you know everybody else knew it
there was nobody else nobody there
didn't know it
by the time you go out got off the stage
so you have two possibilities
and they're both awesome okay they're
only two possibilities
and and one is just more awesome than
the other
you almost can't tell which is more
awesome one
is that what you saw is exactly what
happened he was surprised
he gave you a genuine reaction that was
very human
and and he account he uh i would say he
acquitted himself
quite well presidentially that would be
awesome
i think we could hope that that happened
the other possibility
is that he knew it was coming and
therefore
he gave the best answer you could give
because he had a little
little heads up if that happened and he
pulled it off
it's also pretty awesome now
you could argue and say well but that's
not fair because
you know he's misleading us by acting as
if he's just hearing it
it's a political campaign he's in the
middle of a political campaign
nobody is telling the truth about
anything from now
who knows until election day at least
but you don't really expect the same
standard
at least i don't in an election you
expect
that everything is political
our system is designed that way it's
fine everything can be political for a
while
you know that doesn't kill anybody you
can be political during a political
season
there could be maybe a little smoke and
mirrors
could be a little bit of shading shading
reality a little bit to get the best
picture
so here's my take on it whether whether
that was
a little bit planned or completely
spontaneous
it was still damn good
right because
first of all even if it was a little bit
planned even if he had
heads up that doesn't mean his reaction
wasn't real
you know his reaction might have been
the actual you know
his genuine feeling he just waited to
give it
so no matter what it was real real or a
little bit
planned it was still awesome it was a
really good job
because we we just expect our president
to act a certain way and i think he
did it um i would like to explain to you
the so-called mcconnell rule you'll be
hearing a lot about this
it has to do with uh the circumstances
in which
you would delay a nomination
or a confirmation of a supreme court
justice and it's based on history
and since it's been done once before
mcconnell
delayed obama's nomination
and the i want to explain it to you but
i'd like to explain it to
dale the democrat uh have you met dale
uh dale dale can you come over here
here i am what can i do for you
dale i'd like to explain to you the
mcconnell rule have you heard of it it's
about
when you do or do not replace uh the
supreme court
justice let me just show you this dale
on the whiteboard
so there are two important elements of
the mcconnell rule
rule number one and these are
these are things that would cause you to
delay a nomination
that normally you wouldn't delay so
delaying is unusual but on these two
conditions
mcconnell says you could or should it's
an election year
like now this is an election year so
that
that fits right the first thing fits
it's an election year
and this is important dale dale are you
listening to this
this is important and not or
not or and both of these have to be true
that the president and the senate are
opposite parties
now the reason for that is if the senate
and the president are opposite parties
you don't quite know what you're going
to get
there's a little more uncertainty but if
they were the same party
well you know just go ahead because
you're going to get what you want anyway
so dale do you understand this it's two
requirements they both have to be
met and because the president and the
senate at the moment
are the same party that this second one
is not met
so the mcconnell rule one of the things
applies
it's an election year but the other
important part
doesn't apply do you understand that
dale
absolutely you're being a hypocrite
okay i'm not sure what that means why am
i being a hypocrite
because mcconnell delayed the
confirmation
for obama but he's not going to do it
for trump that is hypocrites
okay well but there's a rule here you
see
there's a rule and there are two things
and they're not satisfied that's why
it's different dale
you see that it's different right it's
an election year
okay election year election year would
be one
one of the two things you see there are
two things here
that would be one of them i'm gonna burn
down everything
if they nominate somebody and they
approve it
we're to burn down the whole country
whole left in the country
burn it down okay but why are you doing
that
i'm confused is it because
you don't like the mcconnell rule or
you're just you're just gonna ignore the
mcconnell rule
nope i'm using the color rule i'm using
it just like you did
same thing it's an election year bottom
egg
okay but do you see this
this part's here do you see this dale
you're gonna burn down the whole country
gonna burn it down
all right dale and bill
can you come over here we just need to
talk
would you would you give me a minute i
need to talk to dale
dale could you come over here present
dale dale
all right so that is how you explain the
mcconnell rule to a democrat
i've i'd like to think there's another
way to do it
where you just explain it and then they
understand it and then they
act as though they understand it but
that doesn't seem to be an option
in an election year so here's the
question
will mcconnell go ahead and he said he'd
have the vote
but does he have the votes do we know
that yet
i don't think we know if he has the
votes right so if he doesn't have the
votes
maybe not i also don't know
if trump has uh would have an advantage
if he nominated somebody or would he
have more of an advantage
if he didn't it's very hard
it's hard to score this one right
imagine if you will just a thought
experiment
suppose several senators say
because i think lindsey graham has said
he's on record saying that he wouldn't
nominate somebody in this situation
because lindsey graham
is also looking at just the election
year part he's on he's on
video uh saying it at least two
different times
he's promised that he would not be part
of nominating somebody
in an election year so we'll see if he
sticks with that
but if you're president trump would you
be better off
getting the nominee nomination through
or would you be better off
not getting it through it's hard to know
isn't it
because if you were trying to get people
to show up
to the voting booth what would get them
there
more let's say you're a you're a
republican and you're on the fence about
voting
you're like ah i'm busy that day it's
just one vote
and i don't need to vote and you have
two situations one
uh one is that that ginsburg has been
replaced
and that there's somebody in the job and
now there's a commanding conservative
majority in the court do you need to
vote
if you have a commanding conservative
majority and that's what you cared about
well you might say maybe i'll get
another
another judge if if trump gets elected
but you might say to yourself you might
you know to judge advantage
um you know you've got a little
got a little advantage there so yeah
that's good enough
so i don't know how how voters will
react
if they'll be more or less motivated
based on whether there is or is not
somebody filling that
that position i would think if i were
president trump
this is what i would prefer this is just
a preliminary thought
i think there are smarter people like
you know if
if an hour from now you see karl rove
disagree with me
you should probably just take karl
rove's opinion
because i'm a little bit out of my depth
here just a little bit
and here's the thought we have a million
topics that people will be thinking
about from the coronavirus to
the economy to foreign relations and
everything else
but if there's an open supreme court
seat
and and it's being held open for the
next president
under that condition that's the only
thing that matters
coronavirus it's not going to matter
much
if there's an open supreme court seat
all you're going to care about is that
seat
every conservative who might have been
you know angry at the president for
whatever coronavirus stuff is going to
say okay i didn't like that coronavirus
stuff but i really care about this
supreme court seat
so what it would do if you left it open
if trump left it open intentionally
number one he'd look like a good guy
he wouldn't look like a dictator but
i don't think it's his personality to
wait you know
my guess is that trump's personality is
that if something's available he's going
to take it
and so if there's any chance he can get
this through
i think he'd push it but
if he didn't and he just completely
fooled everybody and said
hey let's imagine if he said let's
uh honor let's honor ruth bader ginsburg
by leaving it open well
it would just blow your head off
wouldn't it because number one you
wouldn't feel like
a dictator number two it would seem so
fair that you would be
like who is this but it would also
take every other topic off the table and
it would only be the supreme court
effectively and does the president have
an advantage
if the only thing you're talking about
is the supreme court
maybe i'd have to see the polling on
this
i don't know how you'd really be able to
suss that out
but my feeling is that conservatives
quite care more about the supreme court
than than the democrats do
so i think he'd actually get an
advantage but it'd be a risky play
i know
and it's going to set a precedent either
way here's a question
for you um it seems that
the whole country has this idea in their
head
that ruth bader ginsburg should be
replaced
with a woman to which i say
if that standard becomes something that
although it's not a law it's not a
constitutional requirement
but if it becomes sort of hardened into
a standard
is it constitutional it feels
completely unconstitutional to
decide that at one of the seats or any
of the seats on the supreme court
have to go to a certain gender or a
certain ethnicity
isn't that the opposite of what the
supreme court should be helping us do
shouldn't they be the one place where
they just don't look at that
now i happen to be completely in favor
of
diversity in the supreme court so if he
gave me a choice
of course i would rather have diversity
and you know get a good mix of
male female so you know get some other
ethnicities in there i think that'd be
great
because it gives you more credibility
for your decisions
but even though i would like that
outcome
and even though there's a historical
precedent for
you know holding a seat open for a
certain gender in particular
um isn't it completely against the
constitution to do that
you know if if somebody went into uh
for a job interview at a corporation and
the corporation said
you know you're very qualified but
you're you're a man and we're just not
picking men
would that be legal if somebody went in
for a
job working for the the court
let's say they wanted a job clerking for
one of the supreme court justices
and they go in for the interview and the
supreme whoever's doing the interviewing
says
um you know we really want a woman for
this job
would that be legal it wouldn't would it
so it seems to me that having a gender
requirement for the supreme court
is the most unconstitutional thing you
could possibly
come up with even though as i say
i think you know we'd be better off with
a diverse court
it's just it's kind of creepy that the
only way you can get there is by
violating the constitution
you know no better way to do that all
right
already there are crazy people and by
that i mean people on the left
who are talking about burning down the
country if
that seat gets filled what would happen
if you just took all their energy
out of them and just said you know what
why don't we just wait
all these people who think they're going
to burn down the country and take to the
streets and all that
what if you just said yeah you know you
got a good point we'll just wait
it would take all the energy out it
would be interesting
all right remember i told you that
it would be theoretically possible to do
a gigantic prank
on the protesters in whatever city are
protesting
because they're loosely organized and i
said all you'd have to do
is get a charismatic young black woman
because that would be the highest
credibility within the within the
protester
community a young black woman would just
automatically be sort of the
the top of the the ranks and if that
if that person was a prankster
hypothetically
had a megaphone they could just walk
into the protest
and start getting the protesters to say
or do anything they wanted
no matter how ridiculous and
yesterday i saw a video of a young black
woman
with a megaphone who was leading a bunch
of protesters i forget which city might
have been
i don't know probably portland or
something
and here's what she was getting them to
chant
so the woman with the megaphone was
telling them to chant behind her and
they were
and the chant was this who do we protect
and then th then the callback was black
criminals
who do we protect black criminals
now is that real
now people came in and said scott scott
you think that was a prank but there's
other video of other times when this is
actually one of their
standard this is an actual thing that
they say
it's not a joke they actually say who do
we protect
black criminals and it's both white and
black people who are marching
and they're all black criminals now
do you think that's real
now here's here's the best part
it could be real it could be
but it is identical
it is identical to a joke
the you know i've talked about the
parody crossover
where reality and parity you know merge
and you just can't tell them apart
can you tell this apart you tell me the
truth
if you saw this out of context and you
saw the
you know them doing this chant would you
think that was serious
because i don't think you would
trump tweeted trump tweeted what
did he tweet that very that very clip
anyway whether or not that's real i i
tweeted it like it was not real because
i think it's funnier to treat it like
it's not real
if black lives matter wanted to
completely discredit themselves
yeah and the the woman with the
megaphone who is
leading the chant was laughing but that
alone doesn't mean it's not real
all right um
there's an even funnier story this is
the
this is the best story of 2020 are you
ready
pretty big claim right 2020 is a wild
wild year
i this is my claim the following story
that i'm going to tell you
that is in the news is the best story
of 2020 because it captures 2020 the
best you ready
this this is a winner you're going to be
happy about this
the education department you know the
the government's department of education
they opened an investigation into
princeton university
now do you know why they opened an
investigation into
princeton university it was because the
president
wrote a document some kind of public
document
in which he he said that princeton
has racism embedded in the school
so the president of princeton declared
that his own school had systemic racism
now what's the first thing you say about
that it's like well that's nothing
right doesn't every left-leaning person
believes that every major institution
has systemic racism and the answer is
yeah probably
every left-leaning person does believe
exactly that
so would it be a surprise that the
president of princeton believes that
princeton
still has some systemic racism that it
needs to deal with
and the answer is that's not surprising
here's the surprising part
this couldn't have made me happier that
the uh the department of
the the education department uh is
launching an investigation
because the because they're under
suspicion
that they're racist that's
because the government the government
can't give
federal money to a college unless that
college is non-racist
but princeton just labeled itself racist
and therefore
made them ineligible for federal funds
and the funny part is that the federal
government acted on it
that's the funny part right you'd expect
them just to say just to shake their
heads and say yeah yeah you know
the everybody in the left thinks
everything's racist that just doesn't
mean anything
but the but the department of education
decided to treat it like it was serious
because they treated it seriously
if if the president of princeton is
going to say
publicly and seriously and no joke about
it
princeton is a racist organization
then the federal government is required
to stop
funding them
uh so there's your ivy league education
that's just the best story now you know
i don't have a preference about how that
turns out
but just the mere fact that that even
happened it was great
uh uh andreas backhouse
pointed out that spain is about to
according to the latest
statistics on coronavirus spain is about
to surpass the united states
again in terms of confirmed coven 19
deaths per million population
on a seven-day rolling average so
we're gonna see countries you know
having more infections and trading
places and stuff
so i keep reminding you wait wait until
the uh
the end of the the end of this
coronavirus to know who did a good job
and who didn't
there was oh there's also uh
there was a comparison of countries that
in our world in data countries with the
lowest infections
also had the best economies so there was
a tweet that
pointed out that you know everybody
thought there was going to be a
trade-off
between how many people get infected and
how well the economy
does right that was the the basic
understanding
that you could either have a good
economy
or you could be good on infections but
you couldn't be good on both
and what they found with their data is
that the countries who had the lowest
infections
also had the best economies
so therefore if the ones with the lowest
infections also had the best economies
or the least damage to their economy
wouldn't it be true
that the best thing you can do for your
economy is to reduce the number of
infections
right common sense just
logically if if all the ones with low
infections also have the best
economies then managing your infections
is the way to keep your economy strong
right no
no doesn't make any sense at all here's
what's wrong with it
you can't compare different countries
because the countries that didn't have
many infections
did they need to close their economy
no if you didn't have many infections
you didn't need to close your economy
so doesn't it make sense that countries
that did
either by luck or by skill had low
infections of course they had a good
economy
but the real proper the proper
comparison would be
country to itself which you can't do
what you'd want to see is the united
states with a shutdown
versus the united states without a
shutdown and you can't study that
it can't be studied because you only did
one of them
you didn't do both you only do one of
those things
so you don't know what would the economy
have
been if we shut down more aggressively
you don't know
so this is another example of uh
data that looks like it would be useful
but if you go just a little bit
a little bit down into the detail you
see it's just completely meaningless
it is virtually random data
so it means nothing um
let's see there there's a story
that uh didn't get a lot of plague a
little play yesterday
that the post office was getting ready
to mail out because there was a
government plan
to mail out five masks to each
address in april so that everybody would
have
five masks reusable and
that that got cancelled the reason given
for why it was canceled
is that uh the government didn't want to
panic
people by sending the masks because they
might panic do you believe that
you shouldn't you should not believe
this story
if if you've ever smelled fake news
smell that that post office story has
fake news written all over it and here's
your cue
how do you know it's fake news
well if somebody said the president told
me
we don't want to panic people and that's
why we're not going to mail them out
that might be real especially if you had
two sources that hurt it
if you had one anonymous source then you
wouldn't
trust that but suppose you don't even
have an anonymous source
who's saying that somebody told them to
do it suppose it's just an anonymous
source
who simply speculates that the reason
was they didn't want anybody to panic
who said it where did that come from who
who came up with the idea that the
reason to stop
it was to stop the panic
that's not an evidence this is clearly
fake news
now could it become
real news yes it could it could become
real news
if we found an actual source maybe
somebody went on camera and said yeah
you know i was standing right there the
president said write to me personally
cancel this because we don't want to
panic anybody
and two people heard it that would be
news
but somebody in the post office
speculating about why something happened
that's not news that is fake news
now what would be any other reason
that the post office would plan to to
mail five masks to everybody
and then change their mind can you think
of any reason
that that might have happened i can't
how about the fact that nobody had a
problem getting a mask on their own
have you seen any situation even once
where somebody said i want to wear a
mask
but i can't get one no because it was
permissive you could put a
you know bandana on you or whatever and
you know mass
costs practically nothing and lots of
businesses hand them out
so the more the more likely reason that
they canceled it
yeah was it was expensive and it didn't
buy them much
because everybody had no problems
getting a mask
so somebody says what about knowing
about sizes
oh i think you could do a universal size
you know that
they're the kind that i use would fit
pretty much anybody
all right so i'd call that fake news uh
of course my
my smart democrat friend sent this
article to me
and said well you can't doubt this one
here here's uh
caught caught that trump red-handed this
time
i haven't responded to him yet but no
you did not catch anybody red-handed
it's just fake news
um all right yeah toilet paper would
have been appreciated as somebody says
in the comments there
all right sarah carter is sarah carter
is reporting that there is a
senate homeland security committee is
going to release a report like in about
a week
about uh joe biden's son
and ukraine and barisma i guess
so that might be a bombshell
what do you think do you think that a
report about
joe biden's son and burisma
do you think that that will be a
bombshell report or not a bombshell
report
this will be a test to see how well you
have been following the news the answer
is
it will be a bombshell report
even if even if
there's nothing in it
because that's how we do it now so today
the fact that a report exists makes it a
bombshell
and the people who want it to be a
bombshell will simply go on television
and they'll tweet and they'll say
my god what a bombshell it's a smoke and
gun
it shows that bad things happened with
the bidens
in ukraine right and that
that will happen no matter what's in the
report
the report could say you know we started
to do a report but we got bored and it
didn't seem important
so we're just going to write one page
that says we didn't do anything and
that's the whole report
what would what would half of the
country
report about the report they'd say it's
a bombshell
it's a bombshell yeah we didn't see this
coming
but it's so bad in ukraine they couldn't
even find it all
so they had to give up and they'll just
mischaracterize it
so it doesn't matter who does it it
doesn't matter which side
creates the bombshell report
the the side that wants to interpret it
as a bombshell is just going to go ahead
and do it
it doesn't matter what's in it it's
completely irrelevant
what is in the report it will just be a
bombshell
and will the democrats then
react to this bombshell and say oh you
got us now
you know we didn't believe this barista
stuff but now we've got this bombshell
report
well that changes everything and joe
biden you're going to have to step down
do you think that'll happen no that
won't happen
even if there is a bombshell that report
could say that
joe biden himself was taking a a bribe
and it's on camera it's on video it
wouldn't matter
no matter what it is the entire left of
the country is going to say
that didn't happen and then you'll say
uh it's right here on video and there's
this whole report
and you know there's a whole task force
and you know yeah it happened
we got lots of witnesses and video and
then the left will say
no it didn't that's it
we've reached a point where where one
side can simply say
no that didn't happen what can you do
because once you don't have a
functioning
news in in your country that we don't
have like a
credible news entity
you can make any claim because the news
that agrees with you will back you up
oh yeah no there's nothing in there we
read it all day long there's nothing in
there
and the other side will make up their
version and they'll report it like it's
true
all right
just looking at your comments the biden
barisma bombshell
the three b's build back better
um and i would say that joe biden did
relatively well reading his statement
about
ginsburg when he got off the plane
because you do wonder
can biden spontaneously respond to
questions
that's the question right if he's not
prepared but it looked like somebody
wrote him a prepared speech
and he stood in front of people and he
read it
so it wasn't a very high level of
difficulty
all right um yeah they said that about
strokes text messages they say about
everything
tesla what about tesla
that seems like a question but i don't
know what it is all right that's all i
got for now
i'll talk to you later bye
