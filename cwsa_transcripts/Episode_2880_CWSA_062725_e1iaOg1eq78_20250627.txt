well there you are come on in everybody
come on in it's time for your favorite part of the day
let's check your stocks while everybody flows in
uh Tesla's down a little bit the S&P is up a little bit
snap is up a lot interesting nvidia is up a little bit
all right let's uh get your comments going and then we got something
[Music] come on there we go
[Music]
good morning everyone and welcome to the highlight of human civilization it's
called Coffee with Scott Adams and you've never had a better time but if you'd like to take a chance on
improving the way you feel from levels that are hard to even understand and with our tiny shiny human brains well
what you need for that is a copper mug or a glass a tankered
shell a canteen jug or flask a vessel of any kind and fill it with your favorite
liquid i like coffee and join me now for the unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better it's called the simultaneous sip and it happens now go
so good well I finally found a uh really
satisfying use for AI uh yesterday I was just playing around
with a Grock and I told it to make me a photo of Dilbert riding on a dog it just
you know first thing that popped in my head and so it makes this picture but it
it uh it knew that if a humansized Dilber were riding on a dog that would
be bad for the dog so it turned the Dilbert into a little stuffed look like
you know a stuffed uh stuffed animal and made it small and put it on a big dog
and I posed it because I thought it was just interesting picture and AI wants to give Dilbert a mouth
because everybody in the world except Dilbert has a mouth dilbert has no mouth by the way if you didn't know that and
no eyeballs but it wanted to give him eyeballs with some of the AIS and not others and he had a necktie but it
didn't seem to understand that it would be an upturn necktie so it was definitely Dilbert
but uh yeah the AI version and then uh people saw my version and they tried
different AIs so next thing I know there's more than one Dilbert riding on a dog
and the next thing I know um it starts morphing from Dilbert riding on a dog to
me riding on a dog and then Dilbert riding on God's
shoulders and then there was the baby Jesus Dilbert and then somebody used the
midjourney which takes a static picture and turns it into a video and somebody
improved the background so so the picture started as you know
just a little thing I thought was funny and it it took on a life of its own and
it evolved into all these different directions and uh there was even a dog riding
Dilbert but my favorite was
a picture of me uh the AI created of me riding a giant cat a house cat but it
was a a dog it was a horsesized uh cat
and I came away from the experience thinking "Oh my god do I want a
horse-sized cat would that be awesome one you could you know put a saddle on
and ride." Imagine if you could just say "Hey,"
and call your cat and your cat would run over and you just jump on it like a like a horse and ride around okay maybe it's
just me well I wonder if there's uh any new
research that could have been skipped if they had just asked me oh here's
something from the University of Bath now you probably didn't know there was a
university of bath but a lot of people try to take a bath without any education
whatsoever and they'll be like drowning and you know they won't even get wet
because they've never gone to the University of Bath where I believe everybody majors in ba
bathing I assume anyway but beyond that they've also done a
study in which they determined that people with higher IQs make better
decisions and the reason is
the reason is the people with higher IQs uh can predict the results of their
decisions more accurately uh-huh yeah that would be pretty much
right in the middle of what a person with a high IQ can do predict what's
going to happen next so uh University of Bath you should
stick to your strengths which is teaching people how to bathe and uh next
time you want to know if high IQ people are smarter than low IQ people just ask
me just ask i got answers
all right um according to the Washington Times uh
there's a federal employee who managed to do work at home and get paid for
three different jobs so it was Chrissy Monnique Baker so she
was working at HUD uh as a full-time uh management and program analyst but she also had two
separate jobs beyond that and she was getting paid for three jobs and she's
pleading guilty to fraud now does that seem like fraud to you
do you think people should go to jail for having three jobs at the same time when they sign something that said they
wouldn't do that so I guess that's the fraud part yeah so none of those employers got her
full-time work so I guess it is fraud it reminded me of Wall-E in the Dilbert
comic you know I've heard of people who had two jobs which I think was really common
during the pandemic people having two remote jobs but this is the first one
where somebody had three and made it work i don't know how they caught her probably wasn't based on her work
performance well can you believe it
today is the one-year anniversary from Biden uh debating and showing the world
that his brain was not working does that feel like only one year ago
is it my imagination or does it feel like it was 3 years ago
that the Biden debate with Trump happened does that feel like it could possibly be
only one year ago oh my god how much stuff has happened in
the last year you know just political stuff forget about your life
but one year ago are you having the same the same
impression I have that there's no way that's just one year ago that that had to be at least three years
ago nope one and so that a post from end wokenness
one of my favorite follows according to Ben Weeden who's writing
for just the news um Trump won uh I guess this is based on
new Pew survey who is this uh
yeah Pew Research so according to Pew Research
um and if you don't know what Pew Research is uh they research when you shoot your toy
gun pew pew pew pew and then they research that and then they go to the
University of Bath and wash it all off no no no pew research researches very
serious things and one of the things they found out is that uh Latinos were
the ones who moved the most right during the uh period between 2020 and 2024
or was it possible that 2020 wasn't exactly the most accurate election if
you know what I mean so maybe maybe measuring the change from 2020 where
many people I'm not saying me but many of you believe the results were complete
 of the election itself so I would first of all question the concept
of looking how things changed in the vote from 2020 to 2024
it feels to me like maybe there's a reason those numbers don't look as similar as you thought
they would look maybe but that's not me that's you that's what
you think anyway um and maybe sometimes I think it too but apparently according
to Pew Research I and I don't believe this is true how could this possibly be true um that Trump outright won Hispanic
men does Does that Have you heard it that way before i I've heard a number of
times he did better than you know anybody's ever done with Hispanic voters
but did you know that he won outright uh Hispanic men by 50 to 48% against
Harris that is freaking incredible
if it's real he he lost narrowly with Hispanic women and uh I guess there must
have been more women voting or well no the numbers look right and but overall
he was just close so he had 48% of the Hispanic vote compared to Harris's 51
but the fact that he won outright the male Hispanic vote he won it
outright at the same time that uh the news was
telling us all of his rhetoric was you know racist against exactly that
category of people in that category of people as I've been
telling you for a long time they're way more conservative than maybe you thought
was coming so it doesn't doesn't surprise me that it eventually got there
but it happened faster than I thought well as you know
the uh cover up of Biden's brain um
is was considered worse than Watergate how many of you would agree with that
that the cover up of Biden as president being you know mentally deficient how
many of you think that was worse than Watergate well a lot of people
the news reports like quite a bit that there's one expert after another saying
"Oh that's worse than Watergate." So I would like to propose the following
instead of asking if something is worse than Watergate since Watergate is now no longer the
high high bar mark we should be forced to say "Is it worse than Biden's brain
coverup so the next time there's a gigantic
controversy do not say is it worse than Watergate that is no longer the high high water
mark is it worse than Biden brain cover up and when you add the auto pen part to
it it really is worse than a Watergate by a lot
so as you know um at least one person has admitted to having access to the
auto pen uh I think there were more and we'll learn more about that but Nerra Tandon
said that she uh I guess she told Congress when asked that she would use
the autopipen without actually verifying from Joe Biden
uh that he gave the order now
wait a minute let let me say that again that the person operating the auto pen
apparently would not check directly with Biden but would take it from some other
staff member who was not mentioned would she take the word of anyone who asked
could anyone who had access to the president walk in and say "Hey Nerra
uh Joe Biden totally wants you to pardon this hardened criminal for no reason
that you could tell." Would she then pardon a hardened
criminal because somebody who was not Biden said "Oh yeah Biden's totally
behind this." Uh I got questions i have many questions
but if she was not verifying with Biden himself or at least you know some way
knowing that he had given the order we really don't know who was running the
country you know I suppose that's the most ordinary observation but I have to admit
I was I was holding out some kind of belief that maybe Biden would sign a
little document or give somebody the word in person so they at the very least
the person who operates the auto pen had direct knowledge that the president wanted
something signed but apparently not apparently not so the person doing the
autopen literally did not know if it came from the president does that seem
like a problem yeah that seems like a problem it's
bigger than Watergate anyway according to um Newsmax
uh the gross domestic product did not look good for this quarter but the
special case or reason for it is because people were buying a bunch of foreign goods
um in anticipation of tariffs so you can't really look at the uh GDP for this
quarter this most recent quarter that they're reporting um that would that would be sort of a
you know non-standard number this time but they think it will bounce back to a
good number next time we see it and uh whatever happened in the April to
June quarter is unlikely to be repeated so that's good
um so there's a post on X by uh Constantine
Kissen who if you're on Axis you probably know him so he's uh what would
I call him um he has one of the biggest podcasts Trigonometry he's one of the
two who do that and uh he's often you know debating people on other podcasts
and he's very active on social media but he's very well-informed
and very smart but he's the only person reporting that
there's some kind of maybe deal coming up with Gaza and Israel and the Middle
East so I'm going to say I don't believe this is true but he says that there are
reports that Trump and Netanyahu have made a deal and it hasn't been announced
yet now I'm going to I'll read you what Constantine says is reportedly a deal
but I'll tell you in advance I don't believe any of it so I checked with Grock and Grock could
not find any you know independent reporting that agreed
but um only because Constantine Kesson is a um I'll say a highly credible
you know commentator uh if it were someone else I probably wouldn't even read it but I'll let you
know what he thinks you know based on sources that he has that are unnamed
so he thinks that there might be a deal to end the Gaza war in two weeks
which is possible it's possible because you could certainly imagine that Trump
would want to take the goodwill he's you know he's garnered in the Iran situation
and maybe use it to you know put a little pressure on Israel or you know get something done so that part I doubt
it just because the Gaza situation seems so intractable
but maybe maybe it's entirely possible that they might announce some kind of a
framework you know they would take a long time to implement but maybe next
thing that Constantine reports says is being reported is that Gaza would be
governed by four neighboring countries to which I say maybe
because that does make sense in terms of how in the world would you ever solve this problem you would almost certainly
need some non-Israel non US non Hamas leadership
and it does make sense that having only one of them would create a whole new
problem so if you said uh let's say um Saudi Arabia is going to you know
monitor or uh manage Gaza well immediately that would turn into you
know Saudi Arabia would become a target and you know there'd be bad will there
but suppose you said four of the closest neighbors were all going to jointly be
part of it maybe they would be helping economically um but if there were four of them
you'd feel like oh okay that that really is neighbors helping out a difficult situation now again I'm not predicting
any of this is going to happen but it's possible it's within the realm
of possible uh then the third part if any of this turns out to be true is that
Hamas leaders would be exiled i don't see any anything else you could
do with them right you'd have you'd have to exile them otherwise they stay
underground in Gaza and you can never solve anything so while I don't love the
idea of them staying alive and Israel wouldn't love it either it's entirely
possible it's the only way you could make a deal so is it possible
yeah it's possible again I'm going to bet against it because I'm a little bit pessimistic on
this particular topic but it's possible uh here's the part that I think is the
red flag for this not being real that uh the fourth element would be a two-state
solution that would be agreed by uh Israel and uh for the West Bank
do you believe that do you believe that Netanyahu
would agree to a two-state solution with all of those is Israeli settlements that
are in the West Bank does that sound real so that's the part
that tells me uh maybe but that seems really unlikely to
me you know maybe like a 2% chance something like that and then the last
one is that several new countries would join the Abraham Accords and recognize Israel certainly if there were an agreed
upon reasonable conclusion for Gaza that
would lead to more people joining the Abraham Accords that'd be a big deal so that's possible but um there's no word
about hostages or where do the refugees live for the many years it would take to
make Gaza livable again and do they all get to move back and who exactly is
going to pay for the rebuilding of Gaza and all that so I'm going to say that
there's some details missing that obviously would have to be there if there were a deal such as the hostages
and I don't think the two-stage solution is likely enough that the entire
reporting could be accurate so that's that's my red flag on that one anyway
um it's interesting it it the only thing it does I think is
it helps you understand what what is possible
all right um and CNN is reporting
um I think news banks is reporting on this too that uh the US is kicking
around the idea of helping Iran become a peaceful nuclear energy country without
the ability to make a bomb and that part of that might be making available to
them as much as $30 billion to build a civilian nuclear program that
doesn't have any you know enriched uranium access or anything uh except for
what goes into the uh nuclear energy for domestic use and the that money would
not necessarily come from America but rather from other Middle Eastern
countries does that seem Does that seem like something that might happen i always
like the uh Trump approach of saying you've got two choices we will either
attack you militarily or we'll help you develop your economy so you can make a
lot of money i love that that you know I always tell
you about one of the one of the uh principles of uh persuasion is that you
lay out a really big gap between doing what you want them to do and not doing
what you want them to do and that's a pretty big gap if you try to make your
own nukes again we will bomb your country again very very bad
but if you work with us for domestic nuclear power we'll help you get funding
for $30 billion from your neighbors and that's pretty good so I like that i like
that that's even a conversation well according to Trump the US and China
have quote signed a trade deal do you believe that
do you believe that the US and China have signed a trade deal i don't believe
that there there may be some elements that they've agreed upon or have a
framework for but I don't believe there's an overall China trade deal
uh I'm pretty sure there will be nothing about protecting intellectual property
and probably nothing about fentinol so is there I mean there there might be
you know some crawling forward on some things like you know the rare minerals
there might be a rare mineral deal but no I don't believe there's any signed
comprehensive China trade deal but the market might
and uh we'll see and I guess Lnik says the US is going to drop some some
counter measures against China because China is loosening up uh about rare
earth materials but we'll see if any of that matters but uh Trump's team says
that uh by July 9th which I guess is the new deadline for all the countries to to
make a deal um he said that there will be a tariff hammer coming down for any
nation that doesn't look like they're negotiating in good faith so basically
just more tariffs so they do think that there are a lot of
tariff deals coming now do you remember do you remember when the tariffs were
first announced um this would be a good time to see who
was right and who was wrong and there were some people who said "Oh these
threats of tariffs will never get you anything good it will just all be bad."
And by now the stock market has fully recovered so we're all all the way back before
Trump even announced the uh tariffs which means the people who have the most
money to invest including the professionals believe that the tariff thing will not
be a big destructive force for the economy they might believe it will be additive
um we don't know yet but certainly there's every reason to believe that our
new trade deals will be a little better than the old ones so if you were one of
the people like me who said "Hold on hold on there is no way to know if this
is good or bad but it is certainly a smart way to negotiate."
and all of this uncertainty which you think is bad it is bad but
temporarily if you're objective is to get a trade deal maybe a little bit of uncertainty
and flip-flopping and jumping back and forth and keeping your um your
negotiating partners off balance might be exactly what Trump does for every
negotiation it might be he does it because it works and the persuasion reason that that
would work is that if you get other people frightened that if they don't make a deal there's you know there's
going to be really bad consequences well then they're going to make a deal that they wouldn't have otherwise made
so yes keeping all of our trading partners in a very precarious uncertain
not sure about their own political futures because it'd be such a big deal to their country if they don't get a
trade deal that's exactly where he would want the other leaders to
be and he put him there and now he says that over the summer which is about what
he predicted they'll be uh you know cleaning up these trade deals one at a
time it'll probably take longer than they want longer than you want but it's
all doable so it went from oh my god he's he's a
crazy man who's ruining the economy and in what 4 months
it turned into huh well looks like that's going to work out trump is on the
verge of having the best summer that any president ever had
uh if he if Trump gets the the big trade deals done
and he continues to be you know lauded for his uh you know successful
conclusion to the Iran situation if nothing else happened
that would be the best summer any president ever had basically and if if a
miracle happens and somehow we get something done with Gaza andor Ukraine
and I would bet against both of those but even if he got one of them to go the
way he wants and then and then let's say the Abraham Accords goes to the next level that
could all happen in one summer oh my god oh my god like no no no
president's going to be able to touch that for just sheer
persuasive you know leadership policies
you know and that's not even without the the big beautiful bill which is in trouble at the moment let's talk about
that so remember when I've talked about the
budget process in Congress um I act like I don't understand it and
it's not an act i really don't understand it and I I read the you know
the messages from Steven Miller who's trying to explain oh no this is not a
budget bill it's a recision bill recision is that the way you say it and
they're they're very different if it were a budget bill then you would need
to get u I think 60% of the Senate to agree and nobody
believes that that's possible in today's environment but if it's one of these weird recision
things apparently you can cut the budget on stuff uh with only a 50% majority you
know 51% and so the entire reason that there were
not a lot of Doge cuts in this one is that the the the place you would do that
would be in the larger one but they did have a bunch of cuts and now it turns
out that there's something called a parliamentarian
how many of you knew that Congress even had a parliamentarian
i guess the parliamentarian just makes sure that Congress is following its own its own guidelines
and only and follows the law and guess what the parliamentarian
just told the creators of the big beautiful bill the parliamentarian just explained that
the only thing they could do is some minor budget tweaks they can't have in
the big beautiful bill changes in policy because if you want to change policy
according to something called the the bird rule B yd based on you know uh ex
congressperson bird um that if you follow the rules
you can't change policy with a recision bill and there were a number of things that
were policy changes so I asked uh Grock
you know what the hell what what kind of changes they are and most of them I don't understand
uh but it's stuff like changing the EPA's uh multi-pollutant
vehicle emission standards blah blah blah blah blah so a lot of these budget changes are directly
connected to policy changes and we found out this week
that they can't do that now try to hold that in your head for a
moment does it make sense that you and I did not know that there was a
parliamentarian yeah of course yeah we're we're not that deep into it so
most of us never heard of this parliamentarian thing if you had heard of it would you have
known that the recision process would be different from the budget process and
that if you tried to conflate the two the parliamentarian would would shut you
down well I didn't know that but I'm not a member of Congress who
just spent five months trying to negotiate this thing are you telling me
that nobody behind the big beautiful bill was understanding that the
parliamentarian was going to shoot a bullet through the middle of its heart as soon as it was almost done are you
telling me that nobody involved in that process saw this coming are you telling
me that they never once talked to her in advance and said "We don't want to get
too far with this unless we know that it can get past the parliamentarian because
we're you know mixing some policy with some some funding."
Nobody Nobody knew this was coming are you kidding me
right and again you and I can be excused right you know we we like to be
well-informed citizens who can you know with our opinions maybe help move things
in one direction or another in small ways but we're not supposed to know that
everyone who is going to vote on this big beautiful bill every one of them should have definitely known this was
coming and to suddenly act like they're all surprised and people are calling for
the firing of the parliamentarian no
no don't fire the parliamentarian fire every single person who didn't know
that they should check with the parliamentarian before they got this far all of them every one of them should be
removed from Congress if you don't know this most basic thing about your own  job
how are you how how do we expect you to get anything done so I don't know what the fate is of the
big beautiful bill but it's looking like it's going to be totally gutted
of you know some substantial percentage of the things that the Republicans were
trying to get done somebody says that Vance can override
her vance can override her you mean if
there's a if there's a vote of a majority
all right well I guess there there might be more we'll find out about this i don't know if that's true the part about
Vans but I mean it's just such a head shaker
i definitely do not feel at this point there you know something might change my mind but I definitely don't feel like
the parliamentarian is the bad person it's a woman so I was going to say bad
guy but the bad person i think the parliamentarian is just doing the parliamentarian job
so good luck with the big beautiful bill anyway but it'd be amazing if if Trump
got that through without it being you know totally gutted um his summer would
be looking pretty amazing well there's a Chinese doctor
who fled his home country and uh this is according to just the news
and is doing some whistleblowing on China sorry excuse
me um and says that China makes um makes
the Chinese people who come to America sign a contract not all the Chinese
people but the you know the the scientific people
and uh anybody who's coming to the US and working in science they have to sign a contract with China to help steal US
intellectual property and research and anything else of value and bring it back
to the communist uh Chinese Communist Party now
why is there never a story about Russia doing this have you ever noticed that if
if Russia is our big enemy why is it only the Chinese are stealing
our intellectual property or is Russia doing it too but they're better at it so
we don't catch them like why would it only be China it it's not like Russia
is doing its own Silicon Valley you know aren't they just as much in need of
stealing our intellectual property and do you think that Russia has let's say
some moral or ethical reason not to steal from us why would it
only be China i don't know but uh I guess uh the Trump
administration is launching a vetting process for the hundreds of foreign scientists
so we're going to try to catch them but how weird that China is doing that but
not Iran Venezuela the Mexican cartels um but well
how many how many sleep our cells do we and spies do we have in this country now
is it more than a residence because allegedly Iran has sleeper cells
china has all these spies and sleeper cells and buying them farmland to do god
knows what venezuela is sending us the Trendo Ragua or have
the Mexican cartels have already made you know inroads into the mainland US
and they've all got these sleeper cells and spies and stuff but when was the
last time you heard that Russia was doing any of those things
like trying to put a lot of Russian immigrants into the country so they could become sleeper cells or steal our
IP are they not doing it or do they just not get caught or do we
just not mention them for some reason isn't that weird if it works everybody
would be doing it you know Mexico would be sending their scientists and Venezuela would be I don't know there's
something weird about the fact that only China is doing this thing if it works I
mean if it works they should all be trying it well Laura Loomer has another exclusive
and uh I I have to compliment her for carving out a valuable space in the
internet world um and what she seems the best at in terms of her scoops is
finding out whose uh sibling whose children andor spouses are involved in
things that the politician might be making decisions about and here's
another one so according to Laura Loomer the um John Cornin who's a Texas senator
his daughter lobbies lobbies for China um related to Alibaba
at the same time that um the Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is
targeting Alibaba for privacy violations but so the daughter of the US senator
for Texas is working
working for a Chinese company and not just a Chinese company but you know one
of the biggest or is it the biggest i don't know now does that seem like a problem to you
it does to me yeah does to me so another
Laura Loomer exclusive she's really got that category nailed down
and um according to Blaze Media Carlos Garcia is writing about this um there
was a Democratleaning group called Code Pink that's now threatening
um an internet user named Data Republican i've talked about Data Republican it's a woman who is very good
at data analysis and especially linked to uh political events
so Code Pink is threatening her because she uh apparently suggested that they
got some funding from Chinese sources so Code Bank
um is threatening a lawsuit and they they say that they uh um they do not get
money from China or the Chinese Communist Party or any foreign
government so that's what code banking says they don't get money from China
Chinese Communist Party or any foreign country
so do you think data Republican is wrong what do you think do you think Code Pink
is telling you the truth and Data Republican is wrong
well Data Republican decided that the best approach to this threat of lawsuit
is simply to dump everything she knew and you can make up your own mind so
here's what here's what we've learned uh apparently Code Pink is getting some
significant funding from a rich guy who uh
uh a social activist and businessman Neville Singum um he's a billionaire who is already
under congressional investigation for possibly violating the Foreign Agents
Registration Act that be FAR on behalf of the Chinese government
oh so it didn't come from China the funding
and it didn't come from the Chinese Communist Party and it didn't come from
a foreign country true but it might have come from a
billionaire who likes to do things on behalf of China
so how do you score that one do you score that one as yeah that's Chinese funding
or is it Chinese funding that's deniable because when Code Pink denied it they
did not say and we don't take money from any billionaires who are who are
connected to China's government they left that part out so I don't know
maybe they'll come back um
and then apparently one of the things that Code Pink has done um is push some propaganda saying that
uh the Weaguers um were not the weaguers were basically
dangerous so total Chinese propaganda that nobody would do unless some Chinese
force was giving them money in other China versus US news uh Elon Musk
pointed to a chart on X and said "Remember this chart?" And what it was
was a chart that showed how much electricity uh China is
pulling online you know with new power plants etc versus the US and if you look
at the US's number since the '9s it's up a little bit but it's almost a flat line
we have about as much electricity in the US as we had at the end of the '9s
and that's been a while now you might say "But Scott that's good news because
we've learned to conserve on electricity." But then you look at the uh the China
line and it's it's not quite straight up but it's
pretty close and it has passed us you know by a lot so China is adding
electricity like crazy and the US is still just getting ready
to add electricity you know by making it easier to build nuclear power plants and
reducing regulations and stuff it'll make a difference but we're way behind
if you're trying to predict the future like which countries will succeed
um one of the best ways to predict the future is how much energy they can produce
domestically that is really predictive of how your
country is going to go so China's got a big advantage there uh but they also
have a big country so they need a lot of electricity so you know there there's a
there's a reason that they're just also meeting basic needs but uh that's
worrisome and then the other thing would be uh birth rate
so if you asked Elon Musk what are the big uh risks you know sort of
geopolitical risks and country risks etc He would probably say low birth rate is
a gigantic problem in every developed country apparently and uh not having
enough electricity for AI might be the other gigantic variable
that it would be easy to overlook if you don't follow the news pretty closely so
yeah have more babies and more electricity and you're going to be in good shape
according to the free beacon Hunter Biden is being sued by one of his
probably there were a lot of them uh law firms that work for him and say he owes in excess of $50,000
in fees and interests and uh I guess he has paid them a little bit in
the past but hasn't paid them everything now I don't know about you but I'm
starting to think that Hunter Biden's uh art career was not 100% legit
h cuz I feel like he could have solved that problem by selling just one
painting just one so now I'm starting to suspect
that that painting operation was not exactly what it looked like h
anyway let's talk about uh New York City's
future mayor this is Zoran Mdani who's a who's a overt socialist
uh Republicans were trying to paint him as a communist but more more socialist
than communist I would say and I realized I had not uh evaluated
him on persuasion um I talked about him and his policies
and the fact he's a socialist and he wants things like uh rent control and
government grocery stores and free transportation and stuff bunch of
socialist things and um everybody who knows anything about
economics and history knows that too much socialism will destroy just about
anything so New York City if he wins and it looks like he might probably actually
um New York City is sort of looking doomed because of his socialist policies
but to be fair since I I have in the past reviewed Trump just as how
persuasive he is you know that's how I got started doing this political stuff
and I've done the same with AOC so I've said you know I don't like AOC's
policies i wouldn't want her to be my president but definitely she has some persuasion skills
and so I decided to look at Zoran Mamani just as a persuasion filter
and I don't think there's any question about why he's doing well if you look at him
if you forget policies because voters don't even understand policies for the
most part and you just look at persuasion he does have the whole package for for a Democrat in a Democrat
majority city so he's got charisma like crazy
he's young and good-looking which matters um he is perpetually optimistic
um which is not necessarily what the voters are feeling but he's optimistic
so he's always smiling he's always got this you know we can fix this problem
thing he's a person of color so he's not a generic white guy because Democrats
are not going to put up with that and when he talks about what he's about he
has this little phrase see if this sounds familiar to you or what what does
it remind you of it's not familiar but it it'll remind you of somebody else's
work um he says he's going he's trying to and I quote make the city affordable
make the city affordable what's that sound like
make America great again um if if you're worried that this
socialist is going to be such a good politician that he can't be stopped he
does have the whole package he's got he's got the message he's got policies
that if you're a certain kind of person and a Democrat you'd say "Yeah yeah why
not that?" Um so if if I'm looking at him as only
only for persuasion charisma optimism uh not a generic white
guy and he's got policies that fit easily under the category of make the city affordable everybody understands
that and it touches them directly and it's not about the rich
why is he winning because the people he's running against are not even close
they're not even close to that they don't have that package so you know the other lesson here is
if you imagine that the Democrats are completely destroyed because you know
Trump won everything and the Republicans have the Congress and all that all it
takes is one candidate who's got this entire package
and if you say to yourself "But he can't go that far because his policies are bad
 crazy." Democrat voters don't know that
obviously Democrat voters cannot tell what policies will destroy the country
obviously otherwise they wouldn't have the policies that they have
so could somebody like that win the presidency not necessarily him well he I
guess he was born in another country so he wouldn't be eligible but all it takes
all it's going to take is one candidate who's got the full package
and uh Democrats are going to be right back so that's dangerous
according to uh Lydia Moahan in the New York Post uh luxury real estate brokers
in New York City are already getting people saying the rich people are already saying um maybe I don't want to
live in New York City anymore so just the fact that the socialists might come
into office and raise their taxes and I don't know free the criminals
um it's going to make the real estate people pretty busy moving these people out of New York according to um
Salesforce CEO and founder Mark Beni off
and CNBC is reporting this uh for Salesforce
um he says that AI is doing up to 50% of the work that would have been that had
been done by people does that sound right to you that
Salesforce is already using AI for half you know it might be 30% to 50% but he's
estimating might be up to half of all their work that's being done by AI but
now the question you might ask is oh no how many people have they laid off
because that's a pretty big company and the answer is that he believes that it
just frees people AI is freeing people to do higher level work so he's not
talking in terms of layoffs he's talking in terms of sort of turbo boosting the
power of every existing employee so that they can get all their regular work done
with AI the help of AI and then they can you know that'll free them to do higher level stuff that's valuable
that is not the majority view and I don't know how many companies that
would ever be true for it will definitely be true for some you know
there there's no doubt about it some companies will maybe add employees
because the AI plus an employee is so valuable that you want to add humans to
work with the AI because it's all so good but there will be companies where
they just need fewer people because of the AI so it's going to be a little both
um and maybe Salesforce will have to change their uh staffing um let's say
ideals but uh Betty off estimates that the
software company has reached I don't know exactly what this means 93%
accuracy using AI 93% accuracy
now is that as good as people because people are not too perfect so if AI is
competing with people for these jobs is 93%
is that going to get it done i don't know would you would you spend tens or
hundreds of millions of dollars on a technology that would be wrong seven% of
the time would you i don't know maybe he's betting on improvements in AI but uh
that doesn't sound too great anyway but something that is great
is it over in the UK uh the Dyson you know Dyson the engineering
technology company they built an indoor strawberry farm that is worked by robots
so the robots are checking on stuff and picking the strawberries and they came
up with this really innovative uh method where instead of just putting things in
in an indoor garden and then you know picking them when they're done um they
have these these big rotating drums that allow the strawberries to
essentially get the right amount of light by rotating slowly so that you
know all the strawberries get enough light And what this taught me is that
you know I have this interest in indoor farms i'm just nerdy enough to care about that kind of stuff but I always
imagined that the indoor farms would be growing a variety of food
but I'm now completely convinced that every indoor farm should optimize over
one product like the strawberries because probably you wouldn't grow the potatoes the same way or corn or or
anything else so I think robots plus indoor farms plus only one product per
farm so you can optimize it maybe has a future there there's still there's still
it's tough to get protein from an indoor farm so even if you had a uh indoor I
don't know fish farm uh it'd be hard to maintain that so
all right ladies and gentlemen that's all I had for today that's the news for today it's Friday and I know you're
ready to start your weekends um I'm going to talk privately to my beloved
subscribers on locals and the rest of you i hope you'll come back tomorrow
and we'll do it again same time same place all right 30 seconds we will be
private on locals
