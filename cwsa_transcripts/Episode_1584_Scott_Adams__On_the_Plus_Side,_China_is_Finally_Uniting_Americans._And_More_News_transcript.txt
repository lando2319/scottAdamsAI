well
good morning everybody
what a great day yeah you don't know it
yet but it's it's just getting better
all the time
how about we take it up a notch anybody
anybody want to take it up a notch of
course of course
what does that take well i think you
know
i think you know all you need
is a copper margaret glasses thank you
chelsea's time to canteen joker flask a
vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the double means of the day the thing
makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
and things are going pretty well right
now so
this will make it better go
yeah any kind that's right nick
any kind
well
how many of you have watched the beatles
uh special i think it's only on disney
plus
it's called
get back
oh
my god it's good
now i'm i'm a super beatles fan not only
their music but their process
and so i've been watching this thing i'm
two-thirds done
uh i've been watching this special
and learning how the beatles operated in
terms of systems versus goals
oh my god i'm learning a lot
and i'm compiling it and i'll
share it with you what i'm learning when
i'm done
but watching how they they run things
like a system
as opposed to having a specific goal i
mean you know obviously they have goals
on deadlines and stuff
but the systems that they employed
completely explain their success you
know they're talented of course but the
systems really just describe what makes
them
so great anyway i'll share that more
with
more about that when i finish it
so i asked this question why is the gas
price where i live in california
approaching
six dollars a gallon
i i saw five dollars and 85 cents
in california
not in my town but somebody sent me a
picture from southern california
in my town we're over five dollars well
over five dollars now
and it's it's approaching six dollars a
gallon for the
the high-end gas in southern california
so i asked why is that when it's cheaper
in other states because i couldn't
understand why market forces were not
working
and i have to confess i don't pay too
much attention to
local state anything
so
it didn't take long for people to answer
my question
yeah somebody's saying it's 299 in texas
half the price
and the answer is a combination of two
things number one
we don't have that many sources of gas
because we don't have pipelines
so we don't have oil pipelines
so we have to get it maybe
you know
from limited sources because the gas
line i think would get more competition
but the other is that apparently
we california can only buy
california
special gas
which i just learned today
apparently our gas has to be refined in
some special way
to make it greener i assume
uh so so we don't have market
competition the way other places do
so that probably explains it
so it's been a few days now since that
uh
alleged uh racist group called the
patriot front
staged their
protest at the capitol
now
almost everybody that tweeted about it
that i saw said
that's obviously
fake people said that's that looks like
a bunch of fbi guys pretending
to be a racist group
i'm not even sure if they're a racist
group or what they are they don't call
themselves conservatives
so maybe that's part of the reason we're
not hearing much about them they don't
fit the narrative
but
why is it that both the right and the
left news ignored this
do you know why
because that's still a mystery right
it certainly makes sense
that you know maybe fox news would cover
it and then you know be done with it
because it's not really good for
you know their side of the narrative but
why did why did cnn and msnbc just drop
it
why do you think
is it because it was too obviously fake
because look how we've changed
let me give you a thought experiment
if the charlottesville march happened
today
would you think it was real
would you
in the comments i want to see your
actual answers to that
if the charlottesville march happened
today
is your first instinct that it was real
or fake
your first instinct would be that it was
fake right if it happened today
but that's that's kind of what we
learned um and i'm not making a comment
about charlottesville uh i do think
there was something terribly fake about
it
but it actually happened and i'm sure
that there were members there who were
just as racist as they looked but
there's something about it that we don't
know yet
right
because i still say the lack of
follow-up
with all those people who had no masks
on remember they didn't have masks they
were widely filmed and didn't have masks
and yet it still kind of died
i think there was like some minor
follow-up of a few members who may have
had some subsequent problems or
something
but
why is it that the january 6th crowd is
all being you know hunted down and their
identity is found but the
charlottesville crowd
we have the same tools plus photos of
all of their faces
and nobody's sort of looking into it
was something about that charlottesville
march
that definitely was racist
you know i'm not saying it didn't happen
or that
somehow it you know was completely
misidentified
but there was just something about it
there was a little extra
don't you think
a little extra as in who was backing
them who you know who encouraged it
monetarily anyway
and so now we fast forward to uh this
week and this patriot front does this
march which would have scared the
bejesus out of us in normal times
but i think everybody on the right
anyway
looked at it and said well that doesn't
look real
but why did the left think that
that's a mystery isn't it
why did the left not try to make
uh a daily story out of this because it
would have been so
i think so perfectly fitting their
narrative
a bunch of white people looking scary
there's something going on here isn't
there something very unexplained about
this
don't know what it is
well maybe the news on cnn will get less
fake
and also on msnbc here's why i say that
so chris cuomo as you know famously has
been released for a number of scandals
a number of a variety of scandals who
knows how many of them are true in
today's world
it's hard to know what's true
um but we do know he helped his brother
and if that was enough well i guess that
would be enough
um but he's being replaced at least
temporarily by
now if you watch my live streams you
know that i've called out
uh michael murkonish as being not
not like the rest of the cnn
hosts he's not the the crazy conspiracy
guy who's
you know who's taking every bit of
information and twisting it to be bad
for the right
he's way more down the middle
and
way more down the middle than cuomo was
or is
so i wonder if this will signal the
change now he's temporary
so he may not be the permanent
replacement for that time slot
but if he were
that would signal in my mind
maybe some
intention on cnn's
side to be a little more even-handed
but
does that good get good ratings
if they put somebody in that time slot
who was even-handed or even more
even-handed would that do well for
ratings
i doubt it
because people don't watch cnn for
even-handed treatment do they
or fox for that matter i mean people
people watch the news source that agrees
with them
i don't know that they could make a
business model out of being fair-minded
but maybe we'll try likewise rachel
maddow is out of a job
well i mean she's moving on by her own
accord
and
by her own
preference
but that means her job is up for grabs
who would be more let's say provocative
than rachel maddow at least in terms of
attacking the right
it'd be hard to find somebody who's both
as effective
you know people want to watch that
person
but also that you know biased
so maybe they can find a person who's
like that but maybe things are getting
better
just sort of on their own keith
olbermann that's funny
now this of course is the most
optimistic take they could you know both
these
both these jobs will probably be
replaced
you know the spots will be filled by
people who are just as provocative in
their own way
but i'll be optimistic until something
changes
so i tweeted this today sort of a
thought experiment
imagine a journalist
you know high-end journalist somebody
who would be published in any of the
you know big news publications imagine
if a journalist wrote a great
investigative piece
that outlined all the major hoaxes that
have been in the media left and right
you know don't
don't focus on one side
and just did a real good job of showing
the hoax and how it was perpetrated
and what people believed and what was
true
it could be the greatest investigative
piece
really
making the last five years make sense
for the first time
you know would happen
it would get buried
wouldn't it
i don't think you could publish it or at
least you couldn't publish it with much
success because who's going to talk
about it
is cnn going to have you on to talk
about all the hoaxes that they
perpetuated
they can't
that no news entity would be able to run
the story
about somebody who did an excellent
investigative piece and found all the
hoaxes
so we've developed a system that can't
police itself
great
great a non-self-correcting system
one of the great things about
capitalism and about
about democracy is in many cases they're
self-correcting
right if there's an imperfection
the system will you know get rid of it
over time not as fast as you want but
over time but how do you get rid of the
fact
that a journalist could not write an
honest investigative piece
that's a pretty
that's a pretty big
pretty big deal isn't it
well i'd say that's trouble
so dean obadila obadiah
who who you may recognize his name
because he writes a lot of opinion
pieces for cnn but typically he had been
focusing on anti-trump
hit pieces
but when trump's less in the news he's
got to go after other republicans he
decided to go after thomas massey
who had a family
a humorous i'm gonna call it that's my
interpretation
humorous but also making a point a
serious point
um
christmas card of the family and they're
all holding you know pretty serious
weapons
uh legal
legal weapons but pretty serious looking
ones
and you know they're all smiling holding
their weapons and the caption was
something about hoping santa brought
ammo
now this is
this is what dean obadiah how he
characterizes this because he's
shocked and shocked and
deeply concerned about this horrible
horrible situation here
and he wrote this quote to massey it
seems this is all fun and games
is that vile
yes surprising unfortunately no
massey is displaying a combination of
cruelty heartlessness and extremism that
has come to define today's gop
really is that what you saw
when you saw the christmas card of his
smiling family with their totally legal
second amendment firearms
you saw that you said well there's some
cruelty and heartlessness and extremism
going on there
was that your interpretation
or did you just say to yourself ah
thomas massey knows how to make a point
that's all i thought it's like oh he's
pretty good at making a point
well if that's who they're going after
they're running out of targets speaking
of running out of targets i heard on
some news program yesterday
that at least some smart people are
thinking that
uh pete buttige
is the most likely
person to run against whoever the
republicans run
you know presumably trump but maybe not
what chance would pete buddhijanch have
in the national election
can i point out that he's he's white and
male
now i know you're going to say but he's
gay
but he's gay
how's that going to help him with the
black vote
how's that going to help him
really with anything
do you know what the whole country is
over
genus
gave us
is there anybody let's see in the
comments is there anybody here
who would make a voting decision based
on somebody's gayness or lack of gayness
is there anybody
maybe you would oh i'm seeing some yeses
but you have to talk for yourself don't
talk about other people you have to say
would you personally
vote against him for being gay
all right i'm seeing some yeses
i'm actually seeing some yeses mostly
those
but i imagine the yeses have more to do
with uh some role modeling sort of thing
is that what you're thinking
i can't i can't imagine that being gay
would be an advantage
because i think we're over it right
you know you'll always have your
lingering people who feel it's
going to ruin their children or
something so i don't see how it could be
a positive
because i just don't think enough people
will vote for it
who would not have been voting democrat
tickets straight ticket anyway i mean
isn't the gay population
you know 90 democrat they're just going
to vote that way anyway
but if you throw a a white gay guy into
the election
does he win the black vote
i mean probably by a majority but it's
not going to be enough
i mean that seems like the worst thing
you can do so he's not going to be
bringing in the women
he's not going to be bringing the black
vote
how do you run as a democrat
if you can't win the black vote and the
women vote
or at least you know be the strongest
person for those two votes
i don't know
i don't i don't i don't see him
competitive at all and he's the number
one
choice
and by the way i like him you know a lot
of people give me a hard time
but
i think he's too political
in the sense that he might depart common
sense to do what's right for
democrats i guess
but he's definitely smart enough
can you at least give me that
get
can you at least
let's see let's see if you can do this
in the comments
because i know most of you are you know
lean right so you're anti-buddha judge
but in the comments can you at least
give me this that he is a high
intelligence person
harvard
right
i want to see if anybody disagrees with
that
okay okay most of you are going to give
me that and i would say that's true for
most of our presidents
we don't really
we don't really elect dumb presidents
okay
all right so people at least giving him
intelligence i think that's fair we
should give them that
um meanwhile
another development uh that makes me
very happy jake tapper apparently went
very hard at china
uh the country
in his closing of the uh state of the
union i guess it is the thing he does on
the weekends
and
let me compliment jake tapper here
all right so he and i have disagreed on
a number of topics so you may know my
history about that
but
um
here is somebody i believe he's as
jewish background right jake tapper
is he jewish does he identify that way i
don't know who identifies as one anymore
but i've been saying that anybody who
takes the phrase never again seriously
they can't be okay with china and what's
happening with the uyghurs
now although the uyghurs are obviously
not jewish
it's kind of
similar
i mean at least you'd raise raise some
flags
and so jake tapper uh
remains consistent
and that has to be pointed out he is
consistently obviously wouldn't want the
holocaust to happen again but here it is
happening in china in some form
and he is pressing them hard on it went
really hard at it so good for him
and
what's weird is it looks like china is
the thing that will unite america
isn't that weird
china will unite america because i
couldn't agree more with you know chuck
schumer
he's he's pretty tough on
china couldn't agree more with jake
tapper going tough on china
so you're going to find
that this crosses the aisle like nothing
else does
so good on jake tapper for that
and
um he's also putting some pressure on
the international olympics committee
i mean that's that's going pretty far
right
and i'm going to put a little more
pressure on them a little bit
but i'd like to point out that world war
iii has already begun for all practical
purposes
uh china is already attacking us every
day
in a digital sense in a hacking sense
they're attacking us every day in a
persuasion sense we know that and
they're even hacking our satellites
every day or trying to or trying to jam
them trying to damage them
and of course as we go into space
once that territory is up for grabs
then it's a
territory fight so world war iii is on
looks like it will continue into space i
don't think anything can stop it from
happening
and at least
jake tapper
is uh
is sounding the alarm just as he should
here's a anecdotal story i want to see
if you have any of your own
how many of you know somebody
who's let's say a ceo or in charge of
manufacturing and is manufacturing in
china
so this is for i'm going to ask you for
a comment in a minute to see if you can
match this comment that i heard
but i heard that
of a specific ceo who does have
manufacturing
in china
and the quote is he was quote
desperate
to get manufacturing out of china to get
his own company out of china
desperate
desperate to get out of china
that's an interesting word isn't it
how many of you know a ceo
who is also desperate to get out of
china with their with their
manufacturing
anybody
um
what's preventing him is just
practicality you've got to spin up a new
factory you've got to figure out how to
make it work
he probably has he probably has
long-term leases or long-term agreements
i don't know
um
so you see some disagreements
um
so i don't see anybody agreeing with
that so maybe this is an exception
so most of you know uh ceos who are
compromised
uh tim cook now
oh here we go
i work for a manufacturer and we're
we've moved most of our manufacturing
out of china into india and thailand but
probably not recently right
but tim cook is uh he's not
how hard is he going at this to get out
of china i don't know that he's going
that hard
anyway let's talk about the uh
joe biden's administration is thinking
about having a diplomatic boycott of the
winter olympics will be in beijing
now a diplomatic boycott would still
allow the
athletes to compete
still allow the athletes to compete
is that enough
because i'm imagining this conversation
someday in the future if we imagine that
our athletes american athletes compete
and they usually do pretty well so they
probably win some medals
here's a conversation that will happen
someday in the future
so where'd you win your gold medal
can we change the subject
imagine if you wanted gold medal in
hitler's germany
because somebody did right
somebody won some gold medals in
hitler's germany when they talk about it
do they say yeah i got one of those
hitler or gold medals
or do they just say yeah i did well in
the olympics let's let's move on move on
next topic
yeah yeah i got some medals next topic
next topic yeah jesse owens of course
um so it's going to be a little
embarrassing to get your gold medal in
china
but people probably going to go anyway
i saw some pushback saying it was
terribly terribly unfair
to ask the athletes to suffer who had
you know
prepared their entire life for olympics
and it wasn't their fault that it's in
china right nobody asked them
so why should they suffer
for some political point
to which i say
who said life is fair
was that in the constitution
life needs to be fair
if somebody makes a terrible life choice
and it doesn't work out
what do i owe them some reparations
because i saw the suggestion that maybe
they should be compensated if they don't
get to compete
no
if you make a bad life choice and it
doesn't work out i don't owe you money
because i didn't make a bad life choice
do you know what would have been a good
life choice
preparing for a variety of situations
if all you did is learn some obscure
olympic sport for the last 10 years so
you can get a gold medal
don't care
why should i care about your gold medal
it's not like you're doing something to
help the world
it's not even helping the country i
don't want them to compete in
in beijing it doesn't help me
so if you did something that was
strictly for your own
interests
and it was a bad idea
from the start
and it didn't work out just the way you
would imagine
most of them wouldn't because most
people are not even going to make it to
the olympics much less winter medal
i don't owe you any money for making bad
decisions sorry
all right
uh
rasmussen did a poll on asked this
question
uh do credit cards attempt people to buy
things they cannot afford
how do you think that came out
do credit cards tempt people to buy
things they cannot afford
seventy four percent said yes
and uh
roughly
twenty percent twenty five percent
actually it was twenty six but roughly a
quarter of the people said uh
no or they're not sure
25
25
that's right
25
actually 26
don't understand what a credit card is
even intended to do
the point of a credit card i mean it has
several advantages owning a credit card
but one of the big ones
is buying stuff you can't afford
meaning you can't afford it at the
minute but hopefully you can afford it
over time
yeah 25 a quarter of the public doesn't
think that people are tempted to buy
things because they have a credit card
buy things they can't afford uh yeah
yeah
uh and likewise 33
say they need to cut back on how much
they use credit cards
so
i guess people do spend more than they
can afford
all right let's talk about vaccine
justice
uh dr maria
van kerkov of the world health
organization
is uh concerned because the rich
countries are hogging all the
vaccinations
and she thinks that before we get
boosters to the rich countries
we should give at least the first and
second shot
to the poor countries
the developing countries
what do you think of that is that fair
is it fair that we rich countries would
hog all the good vaccinations
and keep them from the poor countries is
it fair
well what do i say about fairness
anybody
can somebody quote me on the topic of
fairness
anybody
put it in the comments you know what i
often say
life isn't fair that's one thing i often
say
quoting my mother
uh here's what i say yes
fairness is a concept that was invented
so that children and idiots would have
something to talk about
there's no fairness in the universe
fairness isn't a thing
fairness is just something that people
say to argue
because there's no objective standards
for what's fair
take this very question
you can make an argument that is fair to
spread the vaccinations around and you
might even make the argument it's good
for the first world countries
because you know if you vaccinate the
world maybe there's less pandemic risk
for everybody
but
here's another way you can look at it
shouldn't america be vaccinating its
obese people a hundred percent before we
give it to anybody
should we give a vaccination to a 18
year old
african boy
who weighs 110 pounds
and gets plenty of sun and has
ventilation like crazy should that
person get a vaccination over our
60 year old obese people
some of you would say yes
because you know the
obese person brought it on themselves or
whatever
but point is you can't agree on what's
fair
there's no standard for fairness
that's not a thing
shouldn't we save all of our senior
citizens before we give it to you know
young people in another i mean you can
just go on this all day long there's no
fairness standard
so
while i understand what
this representative of the world health
organization is saying
it's just not a standard you can manage
to
um do vaccinations work
i'm going to ask that question here
give me and i won't even define what it
means to work okay
i'll just say do vaccinations work
i just want to see your your answers in
the comments and then i'll tell you
what i think i'll read off the answers
uh i'm seeing some don't know yeses
mostly yeses some maybes
maybes uh
locals is always a little faster i'm
saying no's and yes's kind of yeses nose
well we all agree and so there's no
argument that they're not vaccinations
in the classic sense of just you know
stopping it
so we all know that but given given that
we all know that do they work
all right
here's some information on that did you
know
that the most vaccinated big counties in
america
are having the best outcomes
so the most vaccinated counties
are having the best outcomes with
coronavirus so that means vaccinations
work right
anybody doubt that
so we have good data now
lots of it
they show that the more you're
vaccinated
the better your outcomes and it's very
clear
so therefore vaccinations work right
right
that isn't that science
if the data says that the more
vaccinated you are the better your
outcomes and that correlation is really
clear now
vaccinations work right
well what could possibly be wrong with
that
all right let me tell you what could be
wrong with it
i don't know
but what would vaccinations also
correlate with
income am i right
income
the higher your income the more likely
you're you're highly vaccinated would
you agree
how about whiteness
how about whiteness
don't you think uh there are more
white people and let's say a blue blue
place
don't you think more white people are
vaccinated because that's what the data
says
the black population is less vaccinated
also the republican population is less
vaccinated
but
who is the highest
the who has the most vaccinations
the blue counties right
so you find a blue county with high
vaccinations you're probably finding a
bunch of rich thin white people
what would you expect
would be the relative outcome of thin
rich white people with good health care
and
you know well well informed about
everything how would they do on the
pandemic compared to somebody who was
not
rich and white and thin
not as well
right
so i worry that the correlation of
vaccinations
means good outcome is a could be
at least at least a partial false
correlation
let me give you another one
do you think that vaccination rates in
this country correlate to vitamin d
levels
i'll bet they do
i'll bet they do
i'll bet you somebody who takes the time
to get vaccinated is also supplementing
with vitamin d
i'll betcha
how many of the black citizens of the
united states who don't want
vaccinations
are also in a high enough income group
where buying supplements makes sense
like that's a priority buying
you know vitamin d supplements well
there's a big income difference right so
there should be a big difference
you know you can't buy
optional stuff if you don't have money
so i would bet
that although there's a high correlation
between vaccination rates
and good outcomes that that that the
vaccination rates also follow
vitamin d levels
what do you think
do you think those thin
rich white people who are supplementing
with vitamin d levels do you think that
they have more vitamin d well they have
more vitamin d than black citizens
because apparently you know black people
have trouble getting vitamin d in the
same setting as somebody else
so
although the the data would seem to
overwhelmingly suggest that the vaccines
work and here work means not eliminating
the virus but rather keeping the death
rate really really low
i have questions
i i don't think they've teased down the
vitamin d correlation
and that would be my biggest problem
with it
because we know that vitamin d is highly
correlated with outcomes
i think vaccinations are highly
correlated with vitamin d levels
could it be
could it be
that the vaccines never worked at all
and that wherever you have the highest
rate of vaccinations you have also have
the highest rate of vitamin d it's just
a correlation
i doubt it
because it feels like there are enough
ways to test a vaccination that you
wouldn't be fooled by that correlation
but certainly when you look at the big
picture it's hard to tease out the
vitamin d part
so here's my
uh so those are my questions i'll tell
you my opinion
my opinion is that vaccinations work
in the short term sense that they reduce
problems
if you're asking me do i know what
happens in the long term i'd say nobody
does
so good luck making your decisions
because you don't have the data you need
all right
all right so speaking of that also uh
you i would
refer you to a article on
sub stack that i tweeted so you can find
the link to it in my
twitter feed this morning
uh article by maxim lott who you should
follow on twitter
his last name is spelled l-o-t-t
first name maxim
and you should follow him because he's
one of the better
skeptics
of just looking at the same thing you're
looking at and then telling you why
it's not really what you're looking at
all right that stuff's good stuff
so along with you know uh andres
beckhouse and anatoly
you should follow
maxim lot if you want to understand the
world better now that doesn't mean
everything he says is right right
so so i'm going to tell you something
that you know there may be
a problem with this analysis but it's a
great romp
through the myths of the vaccinations in
the pandemic
maxim is spelled m-a-x-i-m
and then his last name is l-o-t-t give
him a follow
tell him i sent you um anyway
uh you should read the whole article
it's one of the best
maybe the best it might actually be the
best thing i've seen written about the
pandemic looking at the myths and what
and and then the realities but
i will
bring you to one
fact in particular
two facts actually number one maxim
claims that the current
data says that there were not
more suicides in 2020
what do you think didn't all of you
believe there were more suicides in 2020
i believe that
but according to maxim the most current
data says no
i'm not sure that's true
so i'm gonna i'm gonna put an asterisk
next to that i'll just say that
uh i think you know maxim is is credible
so he's probably looking at some good
data but that doesn't mean it's real
right it might come from a good source
but you know don't trust any data these
days
all right here's the other thing he said
that australia and new zealand
are interesting to compare the united
states because
australia new zealand and the united
states have similarly high vaccination
rates
but
australia and new zealand have
practically no
um
no
deaths
because they have such a good i'll say
good but effective job of tamping down
with the lockdowns etc
that is a good comparison and why is
that important that australia and new
zealand have the same vaccination rate
as the u.s
but no actually
you know very little or no
problems with deaths is because
you can compare them
and find out if the lockdowns themselves
are killing people
because in new zealand and australia
you've got the lockdowns
but without the the actual coven messing
up your statistics
so you can look at them and say did your
normal baseline number of deaths go up
with the lockdowns
or down
what do you think
in the two countries australia new
zealand
where they had pretty rigorous
stuff
but no infections did more people die
from the lockdown itself
or fewer
well according to maxim's numbers
uh
fewer people died because of lockdowns
which is what i predicted when we did
our first two weeks
you know the two-week lockdown i was in
favor of that
you know just an a b test and see if
anything was working
then it sort of didn't work
um but so here's the provocative claim
the united states has a
huge increase in
uh deaths
but australia new zealand is actually
below their baseline
not only is there no increase in those
two countries it's below the baseline
so that would strongly suggest
strongly
that it's actually the covet that's
killing people in the united states and
not the lockdowns
what do you think do you buy that
now it's like all data
you got to put an asterisk next to
everything
yeah i don't think i don't think we
could quite
conclude this with certainty but it's
very provocative
it's definitely something to look at
all right um
here's my problem
i think there might be other variables
in here that that we haven't teased now
so maxim only goes to so far as to say
that it suggests
the vaccines are what's helping people
and not a source of death but suggesting
it's not quite certainty
all right
so read that read the whole bunch of uh
myths that he debunks
and uh judge for yourself
see if you think it sounds credible
um in related news there are two doctors
in the uk who say that heart disease is
spiking
because of the lockdowns
not because of the coronavirus
although one might ask how can you tell
the exact source
of a coronary problem
can you tell it's because somebody had
coveted and recovered but they had some
long-term problems
or can you tell that it's really from
the lockdown and the social isolation
itself
i don't think you could tell can you
i don't think you can tell it's only two
doctors and it's in the uk
and they say that up to 300 000 people
in the uk are facing heart related
illness
due to and this is their opinion
post pandemic stress disorder
and research suggests
that patients with symptoms of
depression are 64 percent greater risk
of developing
coronary artery disease
and blah blah blah
so there seems to be existing science to
suggest that depression makes you more
likely to have a
heart attack or a coronary event
uh
depression drops of vitamin d levels
somebody says interesting
um
and so
what do you think
do you think that in the uk there are
300 000 people extra who are going to
die because of the lockdowns
because the new zealand and australia
suggests that that's not a thing
so these are conflicting bits of data
the uk would seem to suggest that
hundreds of thousands of people extra
will die because of the pandemic itself
as opposed to the virus or the pandemic
you know the lockdown
don't you think that you would have seen
that many people
extra dying in the australia and
new zealand examples i think you would
have
right
so
yeah somebody in the comments is saying
it looks like a myocarditis
am i saying it right
myocarditis cover-up
it does look like that
it looks exactly like that doesn't it
how in the world
permission to square
permission to curse i need permission
i'll keep it limited
but permission to curse
okay i have permission
send the children away
um
well i don't know if i want to curse
about this
yeah i'll get a curse about this
how the do you write an article
about
heart related illnesses in the pandemic
and not even mention the possibility
that the vaccinations are one of the
causes or the cause how the
do you leave that out of the article
now i'm not the one who says that
vaccinations are causing any problems
i don't know maybe maybe yes maybe no
i have no way to know independently but
how the
do you leave it out of the conversation
i mean seriously
you're turning somebody who's a skeptic
into a believer
by doing that
because this looks like an obvious
cover-up
to me
or just bad judgment
one or the other and that doesn't give
me any confidence in medicine either if
these doctors simply have terrible
judgment
well that doesn't make me feel like i
need to go get
their advice again
all right here's a question i asked
shouldn't we figure out if the omicron
virus is so mild because that's the
early indications we're getting not
confirmed
so mild
that maybe we should not vaccinate
against it
because if we did we would be
vaccinating against
a vaccination
because if the omicron is this mild and
this spready
it should act as a vaccination it will
still kill people
probably
but it might save more people than it
kills so what are we going to do
follow the money
follow the money
let me say you to the person who
asked that question on youtube because
you're pissing me off so there's
somebody here who's challenging me to
how many shots i'm willing to get
personally
 you
 you for caring about my decision
for my health i don't give a about
your health
i mean your health decisions i do care
about you know people not getting sick
but i'm not going to bother you about
your
health decisions
all right
don't bother me about them
like just just give me the same courtesy
i'm giving you now i'll probably tell
you because i do this publicly
but don't don't ask about it like you're
making some point
right here's the point i want
you to make
leave me the alone
i think i'm channeling
jordan peterson right now i will make my
own decision
and i don't care what you think and i
don't care if you jab yourself a hundred
times and die i don't care if you don't
jab yourself and die i don't give a
about your personal health decision
don't give me trouble about it all right
you can agree and disagree on the data
and you know the arguments and stuff
like that that's all good i like that
stuff
but if you're going to talk to me about
my personal decision you
can i be clear about that just you
hard
if you're if you're going to talk to me
about my personal decision
if i talk about it that's different
all right
so
that's going on
um
here's what i think and uh i saw andre's
backyard saying you know
the the best risk management
would be to prepare the vaccination
which i agree with
we should definitely be preparing a
vaccination for the omni omicron
because maybe it is worse than we think
maybe our data is bad you know maybe has
some long-term whatever who knows
but apparently it'll take at least 100
days before we would have such a
vaccination available
at that point we would have a lot more
information and maybe that would be the
go no go point
let me ask you this
follow the money
do you think there's any chance we won't
have a vaccination that's mandated for
the omicron
here's your test case
maybe
this might be your test case
because it could be that it will be
obvious to every citizen that we should
not vaccinate against the omicron
it's too early to say that
but it could be
and we could know in two months
that vaccinating against the omicron is
the worst decision ever made in any
medical setting
do you think that that would prevent us
from doing it anyway
because we there's like a trillion
dollars at stake
for vaccinating against the omicron
i think we're going to vaccinate against
it
no matter what because that's what the
money says
the money says we're going to vaccinate
against it no matter what
it's just too much money to not do
so
if we know at the same time we shouldn't
vaccinate against it while it's mandated
we're going to know exactly what's going
on
i mean that's that's the point where you
go oh okay now i see it
this has nothing to do with public
health
we could get there we're not there
is very premature to say anything like
that
the omicron could turn out to be
dangerous
you know our data is so sucky
that it could be you know slaying
tens of thousands of people every day
and i don't even know if we'd know it
all right
so let's not have a vaccination against
the vaccinations
please let's not do that
uh any oh any word on taste and smell
with the omicron i haven't heard
anything like that
has anybody heard of even one omicron
death that's under
age 80.
even one
that literally does anybody know of even
one omicron death under 80.
i haven't heard of one
don't you think we would have heard of
that
you know what don't you think that the
the news would have that anecdotal thing
uh
she got two vaccinations
and a booster
but the omicron still took her out
where are all those stories because
we're heard with delta every day right
uh
yes viruses mutate and get weaker that
is true
but that doesn't mean we shouldn't have
vaccinated
all right because vaccination was a
stalling
tactic
until we could come up with a better
idea so if we stalled you know millions
of deaths
until the omicron
you know came around it would have ended
up to be a good play as long as the
vaccines themselves don't kill anybody
um
scott well where's the study on
reinfection
you were talking about yesterday i don't
remember
generally i
uh i don't keep my sources i would
imagine you could google that
but we all know that everybody gets
reinfected right
there's nobody who has any doubts that
you still get infected if you have the
if you have the shots
um
the vaxxed are the super spreaders
the evidence suggests not
do you ever gamble in typical casino
style games well
technically yes
technically i do gamble at a casino if
i'm in town and
i've got some time but i don't see it as
gambling
i see it as uh
throwing my money away
because i don't expect to win it's just
you know
so i don't gamble much
right
relative to my
income level i you know i don't gamble
much
um
it's a skill of john learning to read
and talk at the same time it's actually
something you develop over time
you know it's interesting
most of you know i'm trying to learn
playing drums
and watching the brain separate itself
into four or five sub-brains
which you have to do to play the drums
because all your limbs are operating
independently and you can actually
audit each parts of your brain as as
you're going
you know you can change your
consciousness to your left hand oh my
left hand is doing this oh let's think
about my right hand oh my left hand's
still doing that thing oh let's think
about my foot
um
why do you trust your sources of
information scott you idiot
how can you watch me for 10 minutes i
think i trust any source of information
seriously
come on
did you just turn this on
how in the world
could you look at me and say scott why
do you trust your information
nobody distrusts information more than i
do
seriously
seriously
name one person on the planet
who has less respect for information
than i do if if i tell you that
information agrees with my opinion you
should be playing a recording in your
head the whole time that says but
probably it's not reliable information
just do that for me okay just play that
recording in my in your head every time
you listen to me
so you saw a study that shows you can
get covered twice or more yeah that's
that's a known thing
i didn't see a study i've seen anecdotes
so there are there are known cases of
people getting covered more than once
that is true but
it's not common
uh don't feed the jewels
the trolls are feeding me i'm not
feeding the trolls
they give me energy so here's what
happened uh recently i told you that the
professional trolls have
started bombarding my my stream
or my twitter
and
um
then there was a big purge
so my user account like zoomed up but it
seemed like it was all trolls
and then suddenly like a thousand people
get whacked off
that's not a jeffrey tubin joke
let's say they are whacked
from the service
not whacked off um
and uh
it looks like there's a battle going on
between twitter
and the trolls
and it looks like twitter's got a pretty
good handle on it
because the the trolls would come up but
also my user account would go up
and then as soon as the user count like
drops which looks like a it looks like
some kind of a twitter action
uh the troll action just drops at the
same time
so i think the the the democrats
or maybe foreign countries i don't know
uh and tr and twitter are in this this
pitched battle right now and twitter's
winning
interestingly
so um congratulations to
uh jack
because
you know that that was one of the big
things twitter was trying to do is knock
down the trolls and i i feel like
they've figured out some good tools for
doing that
it does look like they're staying ahead
of it
scott you ask about and criticize our
personal vaccine decisions on the basis
of risk management
no i don't
no i don't
that's never happened you are
hallucinating
i've never challenged any of you
personally
i've talked about the logic of getting
vaccinated or not
but i say as clearly as possible every
situation is different nobody has my
exact situation
oh let me thank uh erica
erica i know you're watching
so
um
i kept wishing i had enough time to put
together the whole
uh the whole drinking bleach hoax
timeline and you know the whole
transcript and everything and erica did
that to put together the transcript so i
had that and then i could put it
together in a thread
etc
so thank you erica um
on locals and and on twitter
so good job on that i think that made a
big difference so now there's a thread
that does a good job of showing your
various sources for debunking that hoax
if you need it uh just
grab that
you can see it in my twitter feed
and you can grab it i think it was from
yesterday all right that's all i got for
now
is that on locals too uh no it's on
twitter only right now
um
scott doesn't understand that erica made
a useful resource for i assume you're
joking i hope that's a
joke
uh how to debunk trump
uh depends what you need
uh rfk junior's no book i don't trust
rfg rfk junior
you know even the left debunks him
so
do you really think trump will win again
50 chance
50
chance
but that's the highest chance of anybody
okay
how do you find proper balance of
doubting yourself uh
of doubting yourself while talking to a
spouse
well i'll tell you what i do is i soften
every statement because i have i have a
big problem of talking in absolutes
which i imagine people understand are
not real absolutes
because it's just faster to talk that
way within all the hedging
and
but i've learned to hedge everything
well i think this is true but i could be
wrong
so i just say i could be wrong about
everything i assert
because as soon as you say you're sure
that's when the fight starts
but as long as you say well i'm not sure
but looks this way to me you know is
there any way to find out
so
so that's my best advice but it's not
good advice all right
uh
and that is all for today goodbye
youtube until tomorrow
