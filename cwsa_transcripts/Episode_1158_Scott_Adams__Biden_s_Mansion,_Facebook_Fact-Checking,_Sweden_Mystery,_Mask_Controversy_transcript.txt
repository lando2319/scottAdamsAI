hey
everybody come on in i didn't see you
there
there's still time to get a good seat
for
the best part of the day yeah how many
of you
are experiencing a peak moment right now
because you just said to yourself
what's the best thing i could be doing
right now and you thought
i could be watching coffee with scott
adams
and it's not just watching it's
participating and in order to
participate
in exactly the right way which is the
only way you want to do it
all you need is a copper mug or glass
attacker gels just die in a canteen
jugger
flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine hit
of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
happens now go
yup just as good as i thought it would
be
i know yours was good too
all right um starting with the most
important news first
i saw a tweet about a product that i
have to have
it's a a pot for a plant
for an indoor plant but it's got an
animated
face on the outside of the pot and the
face
tells you uh how happy the plant is
so if the plant has just the right
amount of water the animated face is
smiling
and if the plant needs a little water
it's droopy or dying and if it's too hot
it does something else
and you have to see the animation of it
because
when you first hear this you think well
that's a
you know that that can't be much more
interesting than that little singing
fish that you put over the fireplace but
i'm here to tell you that faces
have an impact on humans and when you
put
faces on inanimate objects or let's say
non-sentient objects they
do become important to people
so i did this experiment years ago
i did something called the dilbert
ultimate cubicle i worked with a design
company called ido
and for it was just a publicity stunt
but we built and designed
an ultimate cubicle so if you had to
work in a cubicle
what would be the best design so we put
in some cool little features and some of
them were just
funny but one of the features was
that the guest seat was sort of like an
airplane
one of those seats that the flight
attendants use where you just fold it
down from the wall
but as soon as you folded down the guest
seat it would start a timer
and at the end of the timer your phone
would ring into your cubicle
so that you could take the call and say
ah sorry i gotta take this
as a way to get rid of your visitor but
one of the other things we invented
which i still think about because i
liked it so much
was an artificial plant a little flower
that was in a little artificial you know
container and it could sense when you
came in the office
so when you would walk into your cubicle
the flower would be wilted
and it would go to attention like it was
happy that you were there
and when you left it would sense that
there was no motion in the cubicle
and it would wilt again so every time
you came back to your cubicle
it would be like coming home to a your
dog who's always happy to see you
except it's a plant and it would just go
whoop i would be happy to see you
and yeah i know what joke you're making
go ahead make your private jokes at home
okay good i think you're done with it um
but the general the general notion of
animating your environment so that
things respond to you like
people is really strong i have to tell
you
many of you know i have an amazon
digital device
in my office but i also have one in all
of the
the major rooms of the house and
all day long i talk to it i walk into a
room and i ask it about the temperature
i ask at what time it is
you know i ask it where my packages are
i
i ask it to define words i ask it to do
math for me
you know so all day long i'll be
thinking about the news
um i got about 8
000 retweets on this tweet so i thought
it would be worth
sharing it with you here's what i said
if you took away trump's excellent
instincts
he took away his clear policies his
entertainer skills his persuasion powers
you took away his mind you took away his
energy
you'd have joe biden just just leaving
that out there
here's one of the things i think is a
big problem with
coronavirus policy one of the problems
is
people don't have the same risk profile
so you can't have one policy that works
for everybody
but the other problem is
i'm pretty sure that we're all lying
when we talk about the coronavirus
publicly
and here's what i mean if if you say
scott you've got to go make a speech
about the coronavirus
i would say all right i'd better say
what what is
good and proper to say in public so i
would modify
my public comments so they were
appropriate
for public consumption which might be
different from what i'd say privately
but i suspect that we're all doing that
and it's hurting us and it goes like
this publicly
if you say why should what should we do
about the coronavirus scott
i would say something closer to this i'd
say you know
we've got to protect everybody we've got
to do everything to flatten that curve
safety safety wear your masks socially
distance
i would say all the right things because
i certainly know what i'm supposed to
say
it's pretty obvious what the socially
correct thing is
no doubt about it right now i might try
to try to nudge
people toward opening the economy but i
would be
kind of soft about it right i'd be like
well we need to get back to work
but we got to be safe but we need to get
back to work
but what would i say publicly what would
i say privately
maybe i wouldn't even say it to another
person because it's so ugly
but let's go even more private what are
the things you're
thinking that you're not saying out loud
to anybody to anybody
does it sound like this
you know i'd kind of be willing to kill
a few hundred thousand strangers to get
back to work
and get back to regular life
how many of you are having that thought
it goes something like this
yeah it could even be somebody i know
could be somebody i care about
but i'd still do it you know
if if if nobody knew i was the one who
made the decision
let's say there was a lottery and the
the authority to decide what we do with
coronavirus
is uh randomly distributed to a citizen
but it's private only the person who
gets to decide
knows their their this decider nobody
else will
ever know which citizen made the
coronavirus policy
and what would that citizen do there's a
very high likelihood
that they would not do the same thing
they would do if everybody knew their
name and that it was their decision
i feel like we humans are far more
i don't want to say evil because
living is not evil you know just having
a life is not evil
but we certainly would be willing to
kill a lot more people than we will say
out loud
now of course there's no generalization
that that holds for all people
that's what makes it a generalization so
i'm certainly not going to say that
every one of you watching this has that
feeling but there's a lot of you
and here's another way to look at it
which i'll bet you are looking at it
this way privately
but i'll bet you've never said this out
loud and it goes like this
if you kill a young person you have
maybe deprived them of
i don't know 60 or 80 years of life
if you kill a 90 year old you might be
depriving them of
one or two years of life on average
so if you were to look at the coronavira
deaths
from coronavirus given that they skew
heavily toward
old people and you were to count up the
number of
let's say life years deprived
from the total public you would find
that relatively speaking there weren't
that many
years taken away from the public
because they didn't have many it was the
older people dying
now if you go to war and you send your
20 year olds off to war
and a lot of them die that's a that's a
gigantic
difference in years that could have been
lived that were not
so when we've got this locked down
situation which we know is going to have
a big impact
on younger people if one young person
dies because
the lockdown caused them to be sad or
overdosed or
committed suicide or something if one
young person dies
let's say a 10 year old you may you may
have deprived
90 years of life just from that one
person
whereas how many 80 year olds would have
to die
to equal the number of years that one
ten year old lost
you know if you start doing the math by
number of years
i've seen in the comments yeah the a
number of you have had this
some form of this thought but you can't
say it out loud can you
right i mean i can do it because i have
no shame
but you can't say it out loud and i
wonder if our policy would be different
if we could be honest about that
although i'm not sure we should be
because there's part of me that says our
instinct
to be good in public is probably one you
don't want to lose
you know your instinct to be nicer in
public than you are privately
maybe we should keep that right because
i have some other benefits
um all right uh raul davis
on twitter he he's a ceo branding expert
ceo and branding expert or ceo of a
branding expert or something
um but he tweets us is it a tactical
advantage for republicans
to have so many democrats vote early
because if you know what the democrats
who were voting early
are doing does that give you still
enough time
to rush in with your funding and your
rallies and whatever
if there's some place that looks like
it's going to be close and you
and you think oh we can tip that one
because we know enough about the early
votes
to know it's close but we're losing
so you go in and just tip it over the
edge
it's a really good question i i don't
know the answer because
i think you'd have to know more than i
know to know the answers that
but i think it might be an advantage to
to go second
there are so many cases where going
second is an advantage
strategically one of the things that's
not being talked about
and really should is that
i would estimate this is just sort of
you know
top of my head estimate based on uh
no knowledge whatsoever but i think that
this
election no matter which way it goes no
matter who wins
something along the lines of 20 of the
public
will be triggered into a fairly severe
mental health
crisis and that's not a joke
dead serious completely completely
serious
as soon as that election is over and we
know who
who won or who is likely to win it's
going to be
the biggest mental health crisis we've
ever had
and i don't think that's an over claim
do you
i don't think that's hyperbole because
if you see what happened
in the last four years that's a big
mental health crisis um
so i was just reading one of your
comments there about q anon uh
we won't talk about that today so anyway
moving on um we've got a big mental
health crisis coming and
i feel as though we need to prepare for
it somehow
uh now i've said before and
i'm going to follow up on this point
that i don't think it's just the shy
trump supporters you have to worry about
in terms of the polls being somewhat
inaccurate
i think you have to worry about the
pranksters
because i have a really good sense
of trump supporters i think because i
feel like
you know i've lived among them enough
and i am one of them and
i just i just feel like i have a sense
of how
trump supporters on average think now i
could be wrong
i could be very wrong but it's my sense
that they all have this common thought
and call it the zeitgeist if you will
and the common thought is wouldn't it be
funny if we lied to the pollsters
and they had no idea that trump was
going to win again
and the margin that he looked like he
was behind on election day
was even bigger than the margin in which
he overcame and beat hillary clinton now
part of you might say i don't want to
tell this stranger because
nothing is really secure in our digital
world
but i think some people just think it's
sort of
fun to lie to the pollsters
and if you don't believe that's a thing
allow me to read my comments
to uh to asking about that
uh so so i said it isn't the only
it is isn't only the shy trump
supporters blow
up so i made the same point in the tweet
but let me read you
some of the comments now keep in mind
this is just a tweet i just sent out
a few you know a few minutes ago so i
don't know how many people have seen it
but just uh some of the comments about
people who
lied to pollsters
i haven't had the opportunity but i
think i would
this is true talked to some friday that
told me they've been doing it
i've done this these are different
people who just on my
on my comments i've done this in the
last two polls
let's say uh i did my patriotic duty
uh a gent in our social circles
blah blah blah did it uh in fact i
started doing it with this
i'm doing it people are
i was called and surveyed about
i was called and surveyed for about 20
minutes i made up about half of my
opinions
i do that if they ever ask me count me
in the second group in other words they
do it too
my uncle lied to pollsters
that's exactly what i would do they
deserve it
that'd be me this is true i always lie
to this because i can
uh if a poll ever contacted me i'd
definitely lie
uh they called me i hung up i agree 100
i'm a trump supporter who has lied twice
to pollsters
why because i had time
[Laughter]
because i had time that's exactly what
i'm talking about
the this is the dad joke
that they don't see coming because the
dad joke here
is that it's so easy to prank this
if everybody is just sort of thinking in
the same way
wouldn't it be funny and i think there
are enough people who at least had the
idea in their head
of wouldn't it be kind of funny it'd be
kind of funny
if i maybe skewed the polls a little bit
so we'll see if that happens
so um i don't know if you know this
but a lot of conservatives are preparing
for a civil war
are you aware of that um i don't know if
there are
any democrats who are preparing
but i'm hearing whispers and
suggestions and information that
suggests
that some conservatives maybe lots of
them i don't know
are literally preparing for a civil war
now that's not to say they expect it
i think it's just people who like to
prepare
you know republicans are very prepary
probably there are more preppers who are
republican
do you think i don't know i don't know
if that's true
i just feel like i have a sense that
more republicans would be preppers
and there's at least one group who's
organizing
generals by
by geography so in other words they're
already organizing
who the local warlords will be on the
you know conservative side uh i i've
been approached but you don't have to
approach me to be a warlord
because i already am so uh
if you live where i live in northern
california
and the system goes down and the
government fails
i'm and this is literal there's no joke
part of this you should rally around me
only because i'm telling you i'm
available if there's nobody else you
know who's available to be a warlord
and i'm going to avoid violence i mean
i'm not a warlord who likes violence
but if you just want to be organized and
you want to figure out how to survive
a civil war or the breakdown of society
i will be happy to be an organizer in my
northern california area
so if you don't have somebody better i'd
be happy to
happy to hand over that power to
somebody else
because the odds of being assassinated
if you're the warlord or really high
really high i prefer not to be
assassinated
in a civil war but
if you need one i'm a pretty good choice
because i don't have a lust for power of
that type
it's the last thing i'd want would be to
have some kind of government job
um and so i'd probably be a reliable
warlord
just to keep things stable until
we recover from the the breakdown of
society
so that's a real offer by the way 100
serious
if you need somebody to be in charge
temporarily because i definitely don't
want to do it permanently i i will
just automatically assume that role if
anybody wants it
all right uh usa today
did the most fascinating article and if
you've been following the
what i call the very fine people hoax
this is a really good chapter and i
tweeted about this so you can follow it
that way
so usa today i think was yesterday had
an article in which they were fact
checking
the people who said the fine people hoax
is a hoax
so that would be me so they're fact
checking people like me
here is uh now how do you think that
went
because the transcript is very clear
so the find people hoax is a hoax you
can just read the transcript and it's
obvious
so when usa today a major news
organization
goes to fact jacket it's going to be
pretty easy
right here's the transcript boom
we're done is that what they did no
they fact checked the find people hoax
without linking to the transcript i
think now part of what they did
is they wrote a big convoluted article
in which they mixed in stuff about the
proud boys
so you couldn't really tell what they
were talking about it's intentionally
confusing
huh why would they make it intentionally
confusing
when it's as simple as just showing the
transcript
that would be as simple as anything
could be
and yet it's really confusing you read
it and you're
you're not sure if they've debunked it
or they haven't debunked it
but here's my favorite sentence from
this
uh hot steaming pile of called an
article
it says a few days after the rally
trump was asked by reporters about the
protest
to which he responded that there were
very quote very fine people on both
sides
and this is this is in usa today
yesterday this is actually in a major
publication
this next sentence and it says
however some people say they believe
trump
also condemned white supremacist and
neo-nazis
as part of his very fine people's
statement
what some people believe it
it's the transcript i don't
believe it it's the transcript
it's not really a case of a q anon
kind of belief i wouldn't call it
religious belief it's not exactly like
believing that aliens have landed and
have abducted people those i would say
would be in the category of
beliefs this is a news organization
that knows where the transcript is they
can just show it to you
and they lead off by saying that some
people believe
now what is the implication of saying
some people believe it
the only thing you should take away from
some people believe it
is that it's not true and if you say
some people believe it before you get to
the details of
whether it's true or false are you not
trying to tell your reader
that it's not true because otherwise you
would have said something closer to this
some people have pointed out that that's
exactly what the transcript says
how hard would that be see how easily i
wrote that sentence some people have
pointed out
that the transcript shows he clearly
clearly disavowed this group so
you have to if you want to be just
amazed
at what's happening and how corrupt the
media is
and how cognitive dissonance is just
screwing up heads
because there's a little bit of
corruption in the article i think
or maybe it's all just cognitive
dissonance or maybe it's just
bias and they're trying to hide the fact
that the
the hoax is a hoax and they're they're
they're trying to be accurate
while making sure that you didn't
understand the point
it's really it's jaw-dropping when you
see how they handled it
anyway go take a look at that um
interestingly twitter does not make the
same mistake
that facebook makes when they uh
fact checked this hoax over on facebook
there is still a warning
where somebody put the accurate quote
from the actual transcript
and facebook put a fake news warning
on the actual exact accurate quote
in other words you can just look at the
quote
it's exactly the same words and they put
a fake news warning on it
now here's the interesting part
twitter doesn't and i tested it
by tweeting facebook's uh you know
facebook's fake news and
you know said the actual uh fine people
thing is oaks
twitter won't put a but a notice on that
so what does it mean if twitter thinks
it's a hoax
and facebook is banning it as not true
what happens when your social media
platforms don't have the same opinion on
the fact
i guess they can just they can just tell
their audiences
one you know one's of not a fact and the
other one is silent on it
allowing you to believe that maybe it is
it's a weird weird situation we've got
here
um are you following the story about the
joe biden
dupont mansion so apparently back in i
think the 70s
the the bidens bought a mansion that had
been owned by the duponts
and he paid 185 000 for it which back in
the 70s was big money
big money at the time he was earning 42
000 a year
as uh as a government employee
if you own 42 if you're making 42 000 a
year
and the story i read didn't say whether
jill biden was working then
i don't know if she was being a mom or
uh
she was still working but maybe her
teacher's salary was on top of that
i'm not sure but if the
mansion is this big sprawling mansion
that was described as a money pit that
was in disrepair
so the reason he got it for such a low
price
so you should not be so impressed that
he paid millions of dollars for this
mansion
he got it for a really low price but it
was described as a money pit
which he spent 20 years putting money
into
have any of you ever put money into a
home
has anybody ever done a renovation of an
older home
how'd that go do you have
any idea how much it cost
to renovate a mansion
now renovating a normal house is pretty
darn expensive
but maybe you could do some of the work
yourself if it's a regular house
do you think joe biden did any of the
work himself in his
sprawling mansion i doubt it
i feel like he would have to hire
professionals to do that kind of work
the the the debunk on this
the fact check on this is that if you
look at the the price he paid
it's so low and it was such a
fixer-upper that it's not really a case
of he couldn't afford it
and there's evidence that he was
struggling with money at the time
which is more evidence it was a reach
for him but it wasn't that expensive
so it's all okay there's no evidence of
anything that's gone wrong here
right well i believe
that that fact check depends heavily on
people not being good
at math and not being good at finance
if i look at a house that cost 185 000
and probably needed three times that
amount for upgrades although that would
be spread over a number of years
there isn't any way in the world that
joe biden could afford that frickin
house
right so the the way it was reported is
here's the numbers
it's obvious this wasn't so outlandish
but i look at the numbers because i have
a deep
background in looking at numbers i've
told you this before on periscope if
you're
if you have lots of experience analyzing
data and numbers
you get kind of a sixth sense and you
can just look at something like this
and go ah nope and i would like to put
that to
those of you who are watching who have
finance
experience let's say you have experience
in economics
finance maybe you've even had some
experience
fixing up homes and i want you to check
my
intuition my intuition is just looking
at these numbers
there's no way that this is the whole
story not
even close we're not even in the zip
code
of this being debunked not even close
that's my intuition and so i'm looking
at the comments
and i'm seeing the people who have that
kind of experience
apparently uh yeah
i i'm seeing people basically say the
same thing
now you can't trust that because there
are a lot of anti-biden people here
who who want to believe there's a crime
and i wouldn't say i want to believe
that
i don't want to believe that um and
genuinely i don't want any
any bad things to happen to the bidens
or anybody else
but i don't see how these numbers work
it doesn't even look close if you look
at the comments you'll see
pretty much mass agreement with my point
i haven't seen
anybody yet who said oh yeah those
numbers work
yeah yeah they're not even close to
working
now if you say to yourself and i saw
this defense
but scott scott scott scott scott scott
joe biden has been revealing his entire
financial
stuff his tax returns he's been doing
that for decades
if there were any kind of financial
impropriety
it would be right there it'd be there in
the numbers
and by the way in the recent years he
did make a bunch of money but legally
by giving speeches and writing books and
stuff which is true
um
well you know um
here's how people bribe rich people
if you didn't know this this might make
your head spin a little bit
bribery doesn't happen by somebody
writing a check
to a senator that's not a thing
i mean and if it is a thing they usually
get caught that's why you don't do it
here's what it would look like to bribe
somebody
without getting caught hey uh
one of your kids is starting a company
boy did that company get well-funded
totally legal right you could fund you
could you could agree to give a loan or
or to be an investor in in a child's
company child of a senator there's
nothing illegal about that
you might even make an investment where
you would not have ordinarily made an
investment
it might not be in the in the realm
where you usually invest
you could do something that joe biden
is invested in perhaps joe biden has
invested in some small business
and you know it perhaps you could become
the biggest
customer for that small business again
it's completely legal to buy things on
the free market
so you're just a big customer just
happens that the person who's an
investor in that company
might be a senator so there are probably
a million ways
that you can launder bribes to famous
people
so you're not going to find it on tax
returns right
you're just not going to find it there
so i don't have any information that
says joe biden ever took a bribe
but uh i'm telling you how to find it
and what it would look like that's all
i'm saying
um i've got a question about health
i have this this nagging feeling that
the only reason we can't
solve a healthcare and let's call it
healthcare insurance
so the pedantic people don't come after
me and say scott scott
scott there's a difference between
insurance and health care
i know i use them interchangeably
because everybody knows what you're
talking about
but we are talking about insurance and i
wonder if the only reason this hasn't
been solved
is because the wrong people are working
on it and when i say the wrong people
working on it
i feel as though it's a simplification
problem meaning that it's so complicated
the whole field that if anybody tried to
come up with a plan it would also be
really complicated
and if they tried to sell their plan to
the public the public wouldn't be able
to understand it
they and they legitimately couldn't know
if it would be a good idea or not
so i feel as if the problem with
healthcare is that the complexity is sky
high
and nobody yet who is good at handling
complexity
has made that their their main job you
know there are lots of people are good
at handling complexity but they're not
working on that problem
they're working on other stuff i guess
and let me
let me give you a
sense of how simple it would be to solve
conceptually right it's not really
simple
but conceptually it's simple do you
understand that distinction
in the real world it would be terribly
difficult but it shouldn't be
and this is why um in rough in rough
numbers i haven't updated this recently
but i'm guessing somewhere around 10
of the public does not have health
insurance i need a fact check on that
but somewhere in that range about 10
we'll use that for our talking point all
right so if 10
don't have health insurance the other 90
do could you just raise the
cost of health insurance to the 90 who
do
by 10 at the same time you're doing
enough
uh health care cost reduction stuff
that it could lower the price by 10
in other words you lower the cost of
health care by making it more
competitive getting rid of
rules and obstacles and free market
obstacles
just make it a more efficient system you
could probably squeeze ten percent out
of it
don't you think maybe some of it would
come at the
the cost of highly profitable healthcare
providers
some of it might be hospitals who are
doing this service and not getting
reimbursed
you know that they there's some benefit
there if they start getting reimbursed
so you might be able to find a situation
where you say here's the deal
in three years we're going to try to
lower the cost of health care 10 percent
and move that burden onto the people who
have it they will subsidize the people
who don't have it
maybe you make that maybe you make the
subsidized health care
not so good that people don't want
better health care
so maybe they they'll still want to work
to get better health care but they'll
have health care insurance
somebody's saying nine percent as my
fact check
number of people who don't have
insurance so let me summarize this
if the entire health care insurance
problem
is nine percent are you telling me we
can't fix that
because i think our health care
insurance goes up
what five percent a year i need a fact
check on that too that that number just
came out of my butt
but i think your regular health care
insurance probably goes up five percent
a year right
i'm just guessing so
adding a an immediate 10 at the same
time you're saying
the other part of this plan is we're
going to go nuts
on trying to lower the cost so that
so we can get closer to break even there
on those two things
so that's my that's my observation
i feel as though you could simplify this
to the point where it should be solvable
i just don't think the right people are
working on it you take a hillary clinton
who's an
attorney and you say go try to fix
health care
you're not going to get a simple
explanation or a simple solution
you're going to get the complicated one
and if you
if all you have working on it is lawyers
it's just going to be complicated so get
rid of the
lobbyists and lawyers and maybe it's
solvable
all right um
i guess twitter has still locked the new
york post twitter account
because they still have that uh link to
the
biden story uh the hunter biden story
uh so we're watching that um
i'm seeing pundits say that
trump needs a closing argument um
something like what he's planning to do
in the future to excite his base
does that track with you do you feel as
if that's
missing i know it's missing in terms of
pundit talk you know if i were a pundit
on tv
maybe i'd say the same thing by the way
i will be i will be a pundit on tv
tomorrow tomorrow monday so i'm rebooked
for msnbc
at this point it would be sometime in
the
6 to 7 p.m hour uh eastern time
so that so adjust for your time zone by
eastern time sometime in the six
to seven pm monday i'll be on msnbc if
all goes well
but i don't think that trump needs a
closing argument
i don't think he needs to tell us what
new things he's going to do next year
beyond what he's already said because
everything that he's doing
is what i'd call a system
so in other words he's got a philosophy
about not starting wars
overseas does he need to tell us
i'm not going to start any wars in the
next four years
he doesn't need to tell us that's an
objective or a goal
because he has a system of just you know
getting out of any foreign entanglements
so i feel like i know what his plan is
don't do any of those foreign wars i
don't need him to tell
tell me what he's going to do with china
and negotiating
because he's in the middle of doing it
and it probably will take a lot more
time to get it done i don't need him to
tell me what he's doing
about cutting regulations because that's
a system
again it's not something you do and then
you're done it's a regular system
where i don't know if they're still
using it but it was
he'll cut x number of regulations for
every new one that's proposed he's got a
system
i don't need him to tell me what he's
going to do with supreme court
nominations
because he has a system here's my list
from the federal society i'm going to
pick from the list
i get it i get it i don't really need
much more detail than that
i don't need to know what he wants to do
with taxes exactly
because he wants them less if he can get
away with it
i don't know if he can get away with it
but i really need him to tell me more
about that
i know he'll try if he can to lower
taxes
so i feel as though that's a
an empty comment that he needs some kind
of a
you know a new thing he's doing the
difference between
you know in my this is my big picture
view
is that republicans are better with
systems i'm going to create a system
and we're just going to keep running
this system whereas the
the democrats are more about we want
everybody to be equal
but we don't have a system for getting
there that would work
because socialism is a pretty bad system
if you go full socialism that is all
right
um the biggest mystery in the world to
me right now
is still sweden and
why we don't understand sweden now you
are probably under the impression that
sweden is doing great
right that they they didn't close down
they didn't go mask
crazy and although they had a lot of
initial deaths
you believe they reached herd immunity
they did not
not even close and that the current
situation is that they have very low
low infection rate those are both
false sweden is about average
uh they're they're they're not they're
not low on infections and they're not a
hot spot
they're sort of in the middle in order
to reach the middle
they they had far higher deaths but they
also had a freer
society here's what we don't understand
why is it not a hot spot is it
is it just vitamin d because they
supplement in sweden all year round
they take cod oil or something
and so it could be that is it social
distancing i've been told the swedes are
just
natural social distancers maybe
is it luck is it travel patterns what is
it
and why don't we know it if we don't
understand sweden
do we know anything i i feel that's the
problem
if we don't know what's going on in
sweden
we probably don't understand this virus
enough
to know that any of our policies are
good policies or bad policies
it's like we don't understand it
the other thing we don't understand is
and this has been blowing my mind for
months
when i saw some epidemiologist expert on
tv
saying that we don't know why any virus
goes away
did you know that we don't know why any
virus goes away
why is it that the seasonal flu that we
get this year
will not just come back next year do you
know why
because the experts don't know why and
it's not hurt instinct or it's not
it's not herd immunity it's not we know
for sure
that that's not the reason it stops but
we don't know why it stops
and that's what the experts say if we
don't know why
a virus burns out
is trump necessarily crazy for saying
it'll just go away
because that seems to me completely
compatible
with the best expert opinion on viruses
that they do just burn out
and we don't know why now you could
argue that this one's different
maybe it was engineered we still can't
know for sure
but the the trump statement that it will
just go away
i think is completely compatible with
science
the part that he got terribly terribly
wrong is that he was optimistic about it
in terms of the timing i don't think he
has a reason to be optimistic about the
timing of it
but i would say his statement that it
will go away and we won't know why
is probably dead on and would you bet
against it
if you had to take a bet right now would
you bet against
trump who said that the coronavirus will
someday just go away
don't bet against that now it might be a
year from now
it could be two years from now but i
would not take the bet
that the only reason it goes away is
because we reached some herd immunity
with either
with either vaccinations or just people
getting infected
i would bet on trump being right it's
just that his timing was so wrong that
i think it you know that's the big
problem
all right dr scott atlas
who's uh whose name needs to be changed
because every time uh president trump is
on tv
and he says scott ah i go what
and then he goes twis i go oh not me
and then he says it again scada and i go
who it's less
okay still not me still not me
i keep expecting the television to talk
about me and it doesn't
often enough but i guess twitter
banned one of his tweets in which he was
saying
something he said i think this is the
one where he tweeted
masks work no and then he lists la miami
hawaii
alabama and israel i believe he's saying
that they're they use a lot of masks in
those places
but their infections are still high
i don't know is that what he's saying i
don't even know the point of it
and then he says w.h.o world health
organization
colon widespread use not supported
meaning masks so he did this tweet that
people
interpreted as anti-mask
and it got banned by twitter but then he
later
he clarified by saying that what he said
was compatible with current policy
which is current policy is of course you
should use a mask
if you're going to be close to people
but if you're not going to be close to
people
don't go crazy with masks i think he's
walking
he's walking a a pretty murky
line there i'm not sure that dr scott
alice
is is helping with clarity but there is
something he's helping
which is he's a really good bad cop
right because you need a bad cop
and and it works really well in a trump
scenario it was it was good that north
korea
you know knew that there were some bad
cops saying we should go hard at north
korea
because then trump could be the good cop
and i think this is another one of those
cases
as long as there's a doctor who's an
advisor
who's going out there and he's he's i'll
say he's at least
pushing against the dogma of masks
he's not saying don't wear a mask he's
very clear about that
in the right situations wear a mask
but he's he's pushing the boundary of
that and that allows
trump to not necessarily be the one
who's always pushing that boundary
but he does want the economy to open up
so
i feel like maybe uh dr atlas by taking
all the
the heat it might be good might be good
for trump
in terms of persuasion i don't know if
it's good for our health
i don't know if it's good for anything
else i'm not the expert but
persuasion-wise
my work
by the way if you believe that sweden
has achieved herd immunity
and you believe that the herd immunity
is much lower like 10 or 20 percent
the the head expert in sweden doesn't
think they have heard immunity
so sweden itself doesn't believe that's
what happened
so you should probably not believe that
either my best guess
if i had to if i had to look at all of
these different outcomes in different
countries
with all these different policies and
different situations
if i'm trying to find something that
could explain it
the best explanations would be cultural
differences
vitamin d i feel like we're down to that
it feels like vitamin d and cultural
differences about
you know distance might be just that
that's what i'm thinking
if i had to put a bet on it i would bet
on those two things
um somebody says smoking too smoking has
a
uh seems to have some say it's worse
and some say it's protective don't they
so i think that's an unknown and i've
heard also that marijuana smoke could be
a protectant
but i wouldn't recommend it
i know i haven't gotten the coronavirus
yet so let me say this
if marijuana is uh protectant
or they say it protects your lungs
at some level i feel like it's obvious
that it would
because if you put smoke into your lungs
i feel like at least would cover some of
the surface
maybe there's less less for the virus to
stick to
if there's a covering of soot
on your lungs so i can imagine it could
work either way
i can imagine it could make you worse or
make you better i'm no doctor so don't
take any
medical advice from me all right
um somebody says man this guy is really
ignorant
usually when people call me ignorant is
because they know less than i do
so we'll we'll delete him in a moment
here excuse me while i
delete that guy block
all right that's all i got for today and
i will talk to you
tomorrow
all right periscopes off all of you
youtubers you're still with me
i'm just going to look at your comments
somebody says most pneumonias caused by
colds is it
colds
are are you just uh imagining it helps
yes i am just imagining that marijuana
helps
i don't have any information on that
uh clinton foundation charles ortel i
don't know why you're mentioning him is
there some new news about charles
ortel i don't even know who that is
um all right
that's enough for now i'll talk to you
tomorrow
