just do too
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization
that's called coffee with Scott Adams
and you could not be luckier because
today the news is more silly than
serious
I don't think there have been any major
catastrophes in the last minute or so so
I think we're looking good it's all the
funny kind of fake summer news the kind
that you can just go ah don't take it
too seriously but if you'd like to get
in the right mood for this live stream
the best thing you'll ever see in your
life all you need is a cup of mug or a
glass of tank your Chelsea Stein again
teen Joker flaska vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
the end of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called this
simultaneous set but it happens now
ha ha
what a day what a day don't you all feel
great today
who feels good did anybody wake up just
feeling good today
you have your your summer on you're
getting your summer on you're in you're
in this part of the world
all right you're drinking bong water all
right well good for you that's one way
to start
everybody do it your own way I like I
like coffee okay
all right let's talk about this news
alleged news
was at the New York Post that was
reporting that IQ scores in the U.S have
fallen for the first time in decades
IQ scores have fallen for the first time
in decades
in America
well I have lots to say about this
uh maybe this explains why we can't
build
pyramids anymore
have you ever wonder ever wonder how
if you go back thousands of years
people knew how to move gigantic rocks
anywhere they wanted them
anywhere they wanted them
and we don't know how to do that now
I think we're getting Dumber I don't
know I don't know but maybe we've been
getting Dumber for thousands of years
straight it might be an unbroken line
from you know I can imagine can you
imagine going back in time
and finding out that all the ancient
Egyptians were like brilliant
you stop any ancient Egyptian on the
street and they'll they all know algebra
and calculus and stuff maybe I I'm not
saying
I'm not saying I believe it I'm just
looking at all the hypotheses for why
the IQ could be going down
let me let me toss out another
possibility
just maybe
and you may have never heard of this
before this this might be the first time
you're even exposed to this concept but
have you heard and I swear this is true
I am not making this up
sometimes data is not accurate
has any does anybody know that
have you heard this sometimes the
studies that appear in the news
sometimes
some and when I say sometimes I mean
most of the time are actually complete
baloney complete
so I would say at the top of your list
would be the data is bad
would you agree
I didn't read the story because I didn't
need to this is so it's summer news the
the great thing about summer is you
never need to read the story
just read the headline have fun with it
because the story is all made up right
all the stories in the summer are just
made up none of it's true so
here's another possibility
do you think that they measured year
year after year the same people
do you think that there was somebody in
you know sixth grade who used to be
smart but now they're dumb
did people start getting Dumber the same
people
I don't think that's a thing but maybe I
don't know maybe maybe
or or is it possible that a massive
influx of people who don't speak the
language natively but yet take all the
same tests as everybody else because
they sit in the same classes and do the
same things is it possible that people
taking IQ tests who don't speak English
don't do as well don't do as well
possible now I'm not saying that's a
whole explanation
but it can't help
definitely can't help how about
um
about the simple fact that there's a
greater number of walking immigrants
than flying immigrants
I'm going to say this as many times as
it takes until somebody else starts
saying it because it's a kind of obvious
thing
forget about ethnicity for a second
forget about ethnicity because you I
know you're going to want to go there
but I don't go there anymore
if all you did is compare a bunch of
people who flew
to a piece a bunch of people who
couldn't afford to fly but they could
walk
which group would have a higher IQ
I mean it's possible it could go the
other way it's not impossible yeah I
suppose it would depend you know who's
walking from where but generally
speaking the people who can afford a
plane ticket are coming from you know
two professionals who grew up in India
you know one's a doctor one's a lawyer
in India and their kid did well in the
you know one of the University Systems
and send them to America
that's not really going to be the same
thing as somebody who is a you know just
woke up one day starving and wanted to
walk North and make some money
so
yeah and again you could take all
ethnicity at it you compare any group of
people who can afford a plane ticket to
any group who can't
I imagine you'd find a difference
now there would be you know Pockets
where that's not true I'm sure but
generally speaking
so there are probably so many reasons
for it plus the pandemic plus the
teachers union right teachers union is
worthless
uh
plus everything else uh bad food bad
environment lack of motion by the way I
saw yet another
some expert on Instagram saying that uh
motion seems to be one of the biggest
correlations with sickness
people who move a lot in other words
don't sit in the chair all day if you
move a lot you're almost certainly
healthier than people who don't move
I I think that moving thing is going to
be the biggest the biggest thing we're
talking about in five years
within five years movement will be the
number one topic because it'll just be
so obvious that the non-moving people
are the ones who are using up all the
healthcare money
if you could just get the the chair
people moving you'd save money on Health
Care
you would your health care your health
care costs would go down if you could
get other people not to send in shares
as much
huh
all right
so there was a article in the Atlantic
that black Americans are sleeping as
well as whites
so what are we going to do about that
black people in America are now sleeping
as well as whites it's written by Brian
Resnick
as Elon Musk tweeted or replied to the
Tweet about this that black Americans
are sleeping as well as whites
according to the Atlantic he said
completely indistinguishable from The
Babylon bee
completely indistinguishable
and the funny thing is
it is actually literally
indistinguishable you this you could
move this directly to the Babylon Bay
without any change
yeah usually usually that would be an
exaggeration you know sometimes I say
things like that I say oh this looks
exactly like a joke
but usually it's not exactly
it's usually not exactly like a joke
but this one is it's exactly like a joke
now it might be true I'm not saying it's
not true but do we need to hear about it
um I'm kind of done talking about groups
of people talking about groups of people
is for
that's my current opinion yeah if you
think that the right way to think of
anything is to group people up by their
some immutable characteristic well it's
just sort of an thing to do but
if you want to talk about individuals
I'm all on board
if there's an individual who's got a
tough time
I'd like to see if I could help
yeah individuals are maximum importance
groups are just something that
troublemakers and talk about
troublemakers and scientists and
the rest of us we should ignore that
kind of person
stay away from people who group people
that way
right
what all right do you notice that I'm
not going to spend even one minute
talking about the content of that story
you don't want me to right
would there be any reason whatsoever to
talk about the content of the story no
we should mock it the the correct
response is to mock it and move on
mark it up all right so we mock it
all right here's a bubble test news
bubble test
I'm going to start a sentence and then
you you're going to draw on your
knowledge of all things in the news to
fill in the end of the sentence right
get ready in the comments
the experience of the Amish population
in America during the coved
was that compared to the rest of the
people they fared go
I'll say it again while you're filling
in the end the Amish people in America
compared to the normal American
situation they fared
I read your answers better better better
better better better better better
better better better
one worse one worse better better about
the same about the same same better
better
same or unknowable
same
um are you getting a little less
confident as I read your messages
better oh confidence seems to have
waited a little bit
are you expecting I'm gonna do that
thing where I tell you that everything
you've believed in the past was false
is anybody worried about that right now
is anybody having a moment where you're
saying oh
I was positive of my answer
what's he going to say now
have you ever Googled it
all right here's the second question
follow-up question follow-up question
have you ever Googled to search what the
researchers in the news say was the
outcome of the Amish from the covet
pandemic have you ever Googled it
well maybe you should
maybe you should I did it this morning
do you know what I learned
the Amish did not do well during the
covet had a lot of sickness and a lot of
death
because they didn't take the vaccination
well that's the news
stop it stop it stop it are you accusing
me of believing the news right now
in your mind you are right
admit it in your minds you're accusing
me of believing the news
have you met me
all right I'll just put it that way
all right don't accuse me of believing
the news I'm just telling you what it is
I'm just saying what it is it's just in
the news if you Google it the news will
tell you that they did uh worse than the
average
do you believe it
do you believe that the Amish did worse
than the average because they were under
vaccinated
I don't know I have no idea I'm gonna
I'm gonna take a pass on this one
I think it's possible they did better
and I think it's possible they did worse
I have no I would say that the
credibility of the information whichever
way is pointing is zero I would I would
give that no credibility at all now
there probably is an answer
it probably is either yes no or about
the same but I don't know we would ever
know it we're innocent we're in a world
in an environment in which you could
never ever ever
trust any data on that question
because you know the answer to that
question is the answer to everything
let me say it again
if the Amish actually didn't have
problems with covid
everything the public has been told is
false
right
everything
and while that might not pass scientific
you know scrutiny what I just said
that's what you think
it's kind of what I think too wouldn't
you agree with the statement the if the
Amish it's a big enough public and and
they also are not all in one place
so if you found out that no matter where
the Amish were no matter where they were
in the country
that their group did better than
everybody else because they were
unvaccinated
that would mean something
right I mean you'd certainly want to
look into it now it could be because
they had other things going on you know
I was speculating the other day maybe
they have you know a cleaner diet
maybe they'd have less pollution maybe
they spend more time outside and get
more vitamin D maybe they're not
overweight as much
so there could be other reasons that you
know they would have a different outcome
than the public
but wouldn't you agree
that if big Pharma ever learned that the
unvaccinated
and actually that's a by the way that's
over a statement
because even the Amish get some
vaccinations I don't know which ones get
which but they do get some
so
don't you think big Pharma would have to
stop
any any information that said that the
Amish didn't have a problem during
covert
right so there are only two
possibilities
here one is that they had a a worse
outcome than the vaccinated
right I'm not saying you believe it I'm
not saying I believe I'm just you know
listing the possibilities one
possibility is that they
um
did worse
because they weren't vaccinated and then
the news is telling you that and then
that would be accurate right if it were
true that they did worse
that's what the that's what the news is
reporting the news says they did worse
so that would be consistent at least
the other possibility is that they did
better than everybody
do you think you would know that
do you think that the the Pharma
entities would ever allow that to be
news that you could see without it being
squashed immediately because you know I
imagine it may have been published
somewhere and then immediately taken
down
so this is an unknowable question
because there are only two possibilities
either the data agrees with big Pharma
the vaccinations you know would have
helped the or there's no way you'll ever
see it
would you agree those are the only two
states either the data coincidentally or
not coincidentally agrees with big
Pharma or you're not going to know you
will never know
that's what I say now I don't think
that's a conspiracy theory that's the
simplest statement of who is the biggest
funder of mainstream news
that's that's all it is is just follow
the money
follow the money tells you you could
never know if the Amish did well or if
they did poorly
and when is follow the money wrong
so far never never in the history of
human civilization
so that you yeah yeah the third
possibility is there's no difference
that's right
but the no difference would indicate
they should not have been vaccinated
because the vaccination brings with its
own risk of course
all right
um
let's talk about RFK Jr and how he's
being destroyed by mostly the left
so here's something that Michael Shermer
tweeted today
uh he says even if RFK Jr is not an
anti-semite it is good to remember what
he believes and then he lists the things
that in
Michael shermer's opinion
Kennedy believes
now before I read them and bias you let
me tell you I don't think any of these
are true
or maybe some of them but basically
somebody else's description of what RFK
Jr believes
should be considered zero useful
apparently nobody seems to be able to
tell you what he believes with any
accuracy right so here are the things
that Michael Shermer believes the
Kennedy believes right the radiation
from wireless internet causes cancer
the chemicals in water are producing
gender dysphoria
the CIA killed his father and uncle
antidepressants cause mass shootings
George W bush stole the 2004
presidential election
your phone's 5G connection is part of a
plot to quote Harvest our data and
control our Behavior
how many of those do you think are
accurate restatements of Kennedy's
opinion
do those sound accurate
you say all seriously you think those
are his actual opinions
oh my God
they got to all of you
yeah now the CIA opinion uh I'm pretty
sure that's accurate in terms of his
opinion that is his opinion
but don't you think that this other
stuff is just stuff he he worries that
the correlation is high
do you think that he said radiation from
wireless internet does cause cancer and
that we're all in trouble
or did he say there are some studies
that indicate it and we should really
be looking at this more carefully
well what do you think you said
do I have to even research that
do you think that he believes science
do you think he believes science
sufficiently that he's he took some
scientific studies and said oh yeah
here's the answer these this Wireless
internet's causing cancer
I doubt it
I doubt it I suspect he thinks that the
science points that way isn't that the
only thing any of us could say
oh there's a study and it points that
way or there's a study and it doesn't
point that way or there are multiple
studies and they disagree
all right you're wrong all right so
anything I'm wrong on if you can't
produce a quote from him
you you're gonna in order to say that
I'm wrong about any of his opinions you
have to produce a quote
has to be a quote and it has to be
written don't send me a video do not
send me a video put in quotes the actual
sentences that you think would would
support this opinion of his opinions
do you think he says that chemicals in
water are producing gender dysphoria
yeah about frogs
now no I I believe that the answer to
that is just unambiguously no he does
not believe that that's a proven thing
he believes that there's something in
the water that's changed frogs and he
believes it would be silly not to look
at it as an obvious thing to look at to
see if it's affecting our you know
gender or anything
who disagrees with that
now
I don't know just to imagine that he has
like a certainty about any of these
things uh is crazy now he believes the
CIA killed his father and uncle
he wrote didn't he write an extensive
book with all of his evidence for that
I mean
it was there some part of the evidence
that wasn't true I mean maybe say that
um he said antidepressants caused mass
shootings
do you think that RFK Jr said that like
that's that's a fact I know that
antidepressants are causing Shooters you
think he said that no I don't think so I
think he said that there's a strong
correlation
between you know violent tendencies I
believe it even says so on the bottle of
the prescription doesn't it correct me
if I'm wrong but I believe the known
side effects include what he said that
it could make you violent is that not
true known side effects baby violence
so do you think he said oh yeah that's
the the answer it's just that one thing
do you think do you think he's Kennedy
said that of course not
of course he didn't say that
do I have to do any research
I don't have to do research to know he
didn't because nobody would say that
these are things nobody would say right
what have I told you about news about
public figures in the summer
can you repeat back to me it's about a
public figure and it's the summer
it's all
I don't know how many more times I could
tell you if the story is about me it's
 right this is about RFK Jr and
it's the summer
is
pick a name pick a name anybody
is it's about
Kanye West and it's the summer it didn't
happen
right it's really easy it's the baddest
celebrity
and it's the summer no they didn't do
that thing you said they did
all right but here's the thing that I
must condemn Michael Sherman for his
first statement quote even if RFK Jr is
not an anti-semite
 you
 your balls
 you piece of you have to suck
really badly to write that sentence
don't you
this is this is below
just to say this in person like actually
out loud in public even if
even if
 you
 you with your even if how about
there's zero evidence of it
how about zero evidence
there's nobody from his past imagine
this there's nobody from his past RFK
Juniors who is willing to say even once
in any way anything
slightly anti-semitic has ever come out
of his mouth or his actions ever
and you could tweet this even if he's
not anti-semite even if
come on does anybody actually believe
he's an anti-summit
do you think that any of the people
accusing him of it actually believe it
I don't
I believe this is recreational belief
and team play in politics I don't
believe there's a single public figure
who if you got them privately privately
and you know that they would never be
quoted say all right privately
privately do you actually think that
what he was saying was what you think he
said
and more importantly do you think he has
an anti-semitic bone in his body
privately
do you think anybody privately would say
yeah I think he might be no the answer
is no
do you know how many people privately
think I'm a racist even though I'm a
famous canceled racist privately do you
know how many people believe it none
none there's not a single person who
knows me not a single person who knows
me personally even thinks there would be
anything to it at all
and and that's got to mean something
right that literally nobody in your life
nobody
even things are slightly possible
that's what summer news is
summer news is Spearing celebrities all
right or at least public figures
Kennedy's own sister Carrie Kennedy
tweets I strongly I'll link gaps condemn
my brother's deplorable and untruthful
remarks last week about covid being
engineered for ethnic targeting
all right I'm gonna go easy on her
because she's a sister
but there's something very much missing
from her remarks
am I right
something missing
the part where she says my brother is
not anti-Semitic
but I condemn his comments because they
they sounded bad the way he said them
what the hell kind of sister is this
who whose sister does this
my God
and if you're gonna if you're gonna come
out against your own brother
in public
you better you better bring the goods
you've bred you better bring a fact you
better bring a quote he said Acts
here's my proof or my opinion this
different I think this general statement
about strongly condemning him is really
 up
is really really up this is like
the worst family thing you'll ever see
like how about just stay out of it
just stay out of it would be a good idea
but if you're going to get in it you
better bring the goods
you better bring the goods if you're
going to get into the fight and then I
think uh it might have been was it
Carrie Kennedy's son who another Kennedy
also said the same thing also vaguely
also without any details also without
any quote that they're disagreeing with
just gently throw them under the bus
my God
by the way I don't agree with
[Music]
um
you know some substantial part of what
RFK Jr thinks might be true
I think it's unlikely that everything he
thinks might be true
would pan out to be true
but I don't think he says them as
absolutes that's where I differ if he
says them like I've got free speech I've
got some questions you know I'm I'm
looking out for the world which he is
looking out for the world and I have a
concern that I think you guys are in
trouble here's some danger is that a
problem
do we need less of that
do we need less of Patriots warning the
flag that they see a problem for the
rest of us is is Kennedy saying hey
there's a problem for me personally I've
got a personal problem with some
pollution no he's literally trying to
save you
and me
you know obviously anybody gets some
benefit personally if they've saved the
world so it's not you know nobody's
operating without any sense of self
but he is very clearly externally
oriented toward trying to make the world
a better place
is he wrong on some issues
undoubtedly
undoubtedly how could he not be anybody
who says that many things about that
many things is going to have you know a
few misfires that would be normal so the
same with all of us
but man
um I I hope that the way people are
treating them is purely political I hope
they don't actually hold these opinions
this couldn't be real opinions could
they
that makes me wonder
well uh news says that John Kerry who is
President Biden's climate Envoy
is using the fact that Chinese having a
big Heat Wave right now to press his uh
his point about climate change
he says you and I know things are
happening and no things are changing he
told the Premier League one
don't you wonder what Chinese scientists
think privately about climate change
do you think they're laughing at us
or do they think it's just as real as
other scientists believe it is is just
that they can't say it
or do they not study it maybe they're
not allowed to study it I don't know I
would think there would be plenty of
Chinese scientists who are part of the
climate conversation
um yeah so I kind of wonder about that
but I do wonder if they laugh when he
says it's hot outside so we got to do
something about the climate have you
noticed that everybody in the climate
conversation does that same thing
if somebody who's on the other side of
the conversation says oh it's hot or
cold today and that's proof of my
opinion the first thing you say is you
idiot that's the weather
that's just what's happening today that
means nothing
but then 10 minutes later you'll say you
know it's really hot in here it must be
the climate change
or or you'll say it's really cold today
and it should be getting hotter so
therefore climate change
nobody can resist nobody can resist the
anecdote and I'm sure I don't either
like I I try really hard
to say that whatever's happening today
doesn't tell you anything about climate
I try really hard but I don't think I
succeed because I think it's just such a
natural human sucking trap that we want
to talk about the weather today no
matter what I got to talk about the
weather today
by the way it's kind of hot out today so
I think there is climate change
no I'm just kidding I just can't resist
it all right
um
Let's uh
could you on this next story on this
next story
I want to see if you could give me the
answer before I tell you the story go
tell me the answer before I tell you the
story
25 percent that's right 25 percent
all right here's the story
um 68 of likely us voters believe Trump
is likely to end up the Republican
Presidential nominee
but what percentage say Trump is not
likely to be the GOP nominee
according to Rasmussen it's erasmussen
poll 26 26 but if you said 25
genius
genius yeah 25 don't think Trump is
likely to be the GOP nominee and one of
those reasons might be his boxes
oh my God his boxes
yeah he may have done some things you
like with the economy and international
relations and
peace in various places but uh that that
pales in comparison to the fact that he
had boxes oh did he have boxes the boxes
were piled in bathrooms on shelves the
boxes were locked sometimes and
sometimes not locked some of the boxes
had things in them that should not Bend
in those boxes but there were lots of
boxes many many boxes and the Wall
Street Journal says that uh
I guess the first pre-trial hearing is
coming up and Trump has
said in a statement that he thinks this
is
um leading up to an indictment and
arrest
and so
um so it begins
And So It Begins
now
so Trump says he got a letter from
deranged prosecutor as he likes to call
him Jack Smith stating that he's a
target of the uh oh he's the January 6th
I'm sorry I had the wrong scandal
did I have the wrong Scandal oh it's a
January 6th thing
so wait am I confusing two stories
is the Box thing happening but also the
January 6th thing happening or did I
confuse two stories they're both
happening right
at the same time
so the new thing is the January 6th
thing
right
no it's two two different stories right
the pre-trial hearing
is starting today and that's for the
boxes but separately Trump said he got a
letter from the prosecutor about being a
target of the January 6 investigations
you agree legal process has happened to
you because it doesn't to me it looks
like
um
until
so it looks like we lost the comments on
YouTube
something happened on YouTube where
you're coming oh there they are they're
back comments are back comments back and
of course uh as you're expecting uh
prosecutor Jack Smith says he's going to
uh uh indict Ray apps no that's not
gonna happen I'm just kidding I'm just
kidding nobody's going to indict Ray
apps
come on
go and go pull it together pull it
together that's not gonna happen
um
wow
so so
just when it matters the most
you know to the beginning of the primary
season the legal system seems to be
closing the walls in around Trump how
about that
does anybody think this is legitimate
does anyone think that Trump's problems
are caused by Trump's illegal Behavior
and that therefore he brought it upon
himself
even the bidens are not in any legal
trouble
hey even the bidens don't have legal
trouble right now I mean maybe they will
in the future but uh to imagine this is
anything both political
is insane
do you think it makes Trump more likely
or less likely to be supported by uh
Republicans
more likely or less likely
I think they misjudged
I feel like they misjudged
I think more likely
but not everybody believes that and I'll
give you an example
I guess Kara Swisher was talking to
Professor Scott Galloway
on some public event it must have been
yesterday and it was asked about Trump
so Scott Galloway was talking about
Trump and he believes that Trump will
take a plea deal
I don't know on which charges or maybe
it's all of them I don't know what this
means but he'll take a plea deal to stay
in a jail and not run for president
which made uh Kara Swisher uh Double
Take and Gulp and say what did you just
say because nobody's saying that I think
she pointed out nobody's saying that
right are you the only person who's
saying that
so here's what he says Scott Galloway
um you said that uh first of all he says
that Chris Christie said something
similar and then Galloway said quote I
actually think Governor Christie is
going to surpass DeSantis and be the
number two but I don't think it will
matter I I don't understand and can't
empathize with President Trump but I
know how old rich men think he said
there's the fun part he says quote
talking about Trump he has a very nice
life and his life can be going back to
golf and sycophants and having sex with
porn stars which I think is a good thing
I'm not being cynical I would like to do
more of that at some point in my life
hahaha
I would like to do more of that I'd like
to do more of that and support my life
and I I'd love to know
uh if what he meant was literally having
sex with porn stars and golfing and
having sycophants he wants to have more
of that in his life or if he's just
saying you know more free time or
something like that I I think he might
imagine just more free time but the way
it came out is he wants more time for
for porn stars
uh that's funny uh well I think his
credibility may have taken a hit by
thinking that Governor Christie is going
to surpass DeSantis uh I'd like to take
a take the temperature of my viewers how
many how many of you think Chris
Christie is going to overtake DeSantis
to be number two in the polls
yeah I'm gonna go with zero on that
that's going to be a bigger zero right
um so I don't know
um but let's go to uh Professor
Galloway's main point
let's say that the legal system comes up
with a set of charges
that even Trump's attorneys say oh
what's he do
you think that Trump could negotiate a
you know pardon or get on jail free even
if he thinks he's innocent you know
regardless of whether he thinks he would
win the case
would it be smarter to not have the
trial at all because there's some chance
you could lose even if you're innocent
would it be smarter for him to negotiate
away all of his problems and then go you
know quietly into retirement
what if he could do it and be a king
maker at the same time
suppose he could make sure that his
preferred candidate did become president
and then negotiate his way out and then
just went back to Twitter and ran the
country from Twitter because you know
Trump could go back to Twitter and keep
running the country
right he could just reframe things until
until people say well he said let's do
what he said and we had to end up
looking a lot like running the country
that the Galloway hypothesis or
prediction I guess
depends entirely upon whether the Trump
lawyers
say uh oh the other side has a good case
what are the what's what are the chances
that Trump's lawyers will say we're in
trouble they've got a good case
do you think that's going to happen
because I feel that he would just keep
firing any lawyer who did that
I feel like that lawyer would be fired
at the same moment and be a new lawyer
and if they said it they'd be fired
so the problem is that Trump's always
going to have a lawyer that tells him
what he wants to hear
because if he doesn't he gets a new
lawyer so
I don't know
it could be that Trump will never hear a
story that he's in that much trouble
because his lawyers will want to keep
the job and get paid and and they'll
just say yeah we got this we got this
we'll fight it
so it could go this thing could go all
squirrely 100 different ways
now what do you think about the idea
that this close to an election
we should as a public agree to ignore
charges
because it's close to an election
what do you think of that idea we should
ignore it because it's close to an
election
what do you think
yeah that's not a terrible idea you know
you can certainly make an argument this
is one you could argue either side and
not be embarrassed by it but I think he
could go either way
you know I I always put the country
above the person
so my preference would be the benefit of
the country
just that's it what's the benefit of the
country I think the country benefits by
um
president not being charged while he's
trying to be a president
so I can't imagine he's gonna quit
so I'm going to take the other side of
Galloway's prediction and say that he'll
fight it even even if
even if fighting it's the wrong decision
I just feel like he's a fighter
I mean one of the reasons that people
like him
is that you can predict what he'll do
he's predictably unpredictable which is
the weirdest thing isn't it
am I right
Trump is predictably unpredictable
there's lots of stuff you know exactly
where he's going to be forever
but there's other things you can predict
he'll be unpredictable because he knows
that works better such as negotiating
all right
um I saw a tweet by Dr Cindy Watson who
said talk about Andrew Tate she said
it's remarkable how Tate became a voice
for a quote conservatism when he's a
pornographer with degenerate lifestyle
says Dr Sadi Watson who probably has
never been to Romania and
doesn't know what's true and what's not
uh what's the truth for all of us we we
don't know it's true or what's not over
there
um that she says but politics have
become so tribal there's some on the
right will claim anyone with an audience
who even slightly agrees with them on
anything
[Music]
is that fair
would you say that the political right
will Embrace Bad characters as long as
they agree with them on something that
they care about
I think so
I'd say yes
I'd say bingo you nailed it
and and I would go further and support
it
and further say it's a sign of good
mental health
site of good mental health that you can
look at somebody as a complete person
and say oh I like these parts I don't
like these parts
so I'll keep the parts I like and I'll
I'll flush the parts I don't like
what's wrong with that is there any
problem with that
do you do you know why
this exists this very live stream why is
it that I can do a live stream when I I
has almost entirely conservative
audience when I identify as left to
Bernie and I just I just uh I recently
registered as a Democrat more for funny
reasons than real reasons but uh
the reason is simple there isn't a
simple because people like some of the
things I say
they don't agree with all of them but
have decided they would not throw me
under the bus for the things they
disagree about
am I right
so people will say oh I'll retweet this
thing that he said right
I will condemn him for this thing I
disagree with
and then we'll go on with our mutual
lives
whereas whereas the the Democrats are oh
let's let's kill this one
this one is all bad
this one said something I don't like uh
well a whole lifetime of agreeing with
them but there's one thing well they're
they're dead to me now
why is it that the conservatives can
Embrace RFK Jr as a candidate
and fully respect him while also
disagreeing violently
on several of his policies
and the answer is they're looking at the
whole person
they're looking at the whole person I
like these things I don't like these
things
and now our conversation should be done
so
I don't know I you know honestly I don't
know if you can make a sweeping
generalization about the left or the
right because individuals are all over
the place so let me let me not say
everybody's all the same on other sides
but I think I think the key and by the
way Russell Brand Jake Russell Brand
take Glenn Gran Glenn Greenwald
these are people who have like enormous
points of disagreement with the right
take Joe Rogan exactly these are people
that the right have very serious
disagreements with on some issues and
yet
and yet fully appreciate
something about them
that seems so healthy
so
I don't know a single person on the
right
who agrees with Andrew Tate on maybe
some philosophical thing
who doesn't think that the law should
apply
there's no conservative who thinks
there's somebody who broke a serious law
that they should go free because they
have some good opinions on unrelated
points
so I don't know it's a good sign that
conservatives see the whole person I've
always appreciated that
one of my favorite things about
conservatives
all right uh
does it seem to you that the Ukrainian
War has been over for some time now
does anybody think there's still a war
as in somebody's going to capture a
bunch of territory or take over the
control of the country
so some of you think the war is still
happening okay
um you could be right hey yeah maybe
somebody will make a big
a big push get a little land my take is
that the war has been over for a while
I'm going to Define War as
what at least at least one it would only
take one at least one of the leaders
believes that they can conquer the other
and submit make make the other submits
basically
because otherwise there's no point to it
if you're not going to make the other
side submit
why are you doing it
so it's not a war war it's like some
weird negotiation that burns a lot of
weapons
so the basically the it's sort of a
perpetual motion machine for the arms
industry at this point
wouldn't you say yeah we've created a
little engine that burns up weapons and
kills people in the process and it's the
burning up of the weapons that's driving
the military-industrial complex so we've
got this big economic machine that
depends on acting like there's a real
war one really is just a beat grinder at
this point this is the meat grinder with
a map
it's a map and a meat grinder
I like that I just made that up
Ukraine is nothing but a map and a meat
grinder
boom reframe I reframed that bastard
nothing but a map and a meat grinder
and it's pretty good isn't it the the
the visual of that is just insane
it's nothing but a map and a meat
grinder remember when somebody said
you'll have to remind me who said it
first that Russia is a
uh
uh was it a criminal organization with a
gas station or something
it's like a gas station with a gas
station with nuclear weapons that's
right Russia is a gas station with
nuclear weapons
so it's like that it's a meat grinder
and a map
I just see a map and I know there's a
meat grinder and everything else is just
something about profits for the defense
industry
well Trump said that uh
that Putin would either make peace if
Trump were president he'd either make
peace right away or Trump would arm
Ukraine to the teeth
so basically he would just
tell Putin all right you either have to
stop now or I'm going to give them so
many weapons you're going to wish you
did
yeah way more weapons you have now now I
don't even know what that would mean
are there some really good weapons made
out of top secret UFO technology
and we're going to unleash it he's not
going to Nuke them I doubt he would send
you know NATO planes over Russian
territory
so
yeah mother of all bombs but would he
give it to the ukrainians
I don't know Sonic weapons
yeah so here's the beauty of trump
the fact that we have no idea what that
means is why it works
like if you're if you're Putin and and
suddenly you have this new president
who's saying stuff like we're going to
give the like the really good weapons to
Ukraine
and you're Putin you're like what
yeah they're really good stuff you know
just imagine Trump saying this is both
we're getting the good stuff we're going
to give them the stuff that nobody knows
we have
oh that's it
that's it
Putin you either make peace or we're
going to give you Ukraine the weapons
you don't even know you don't even know
exist
is that perfect
because you don't have to prove they
exist
you'll never have to show your hand
you'll just say we have weapons that you
don't even know exist and they're going
to be in Ukrainian hands in 24 hours you
better make peace
what kind of weapons
what are these weapons you speak of oh
never mind Vladimir never mind their
secret and by the way I don't know if
you've noticed how many UFOs we've
captured
just saying just say many many UFOs some
people say we've captured more UFOs than
anybody's ever captured some say we've
already reverse engineered them I'm not
saying we have I'm not saying we have
no I'm just saying that if you don't
make peace now
the ukrainians will have
things we have that I can't mention and
I can't tell you where they came from
baby space but I didn't say that
I'm now saying that advanced alien
technology but I'm not saying that some
people are saying that some people are
saying that it's advanced technology
some people say that
I'm not
W do you wish Trump were here
negotiating right now
don't you wish you could start tomorrow
just to find out what he does
like I don't I don't know what he would
do I don't know if he'd be successful
I know that not negotiating isn't
working that's you know what we're doing
now doesn't work
I would think that his odds of success
would be much higher than everybody else
in the government
would anybody disagree with that I'll
make this statement so I'm not saying he
should necessarily be the president or
anything I'm just saying this one narrow
question
can you think of anybody else in the
world
who would be the right person for
entering Ukraine Russia War anywhere
anywhere in the world any country you
could take the pope you could take
Justin Trudeau to be your champion
who do you want as your champion
on Russia and Ukraine I'm gonna I'm
gonna pick Trump first Trump second
Trump third Trump fourth fifth sixth I'm
just gonna pick Trump all day long
I'm not even going to mention another
day
because it would be dumb
it would kind of be dumb not to have him
do it
all right Paul pot
how do we deal with another stolen
election somebody says well
um I liked uh
I liked Trump's defense of January 6. do
you know what Trump's defense was
you ready for it
you wanna you wanna hear one sentence
that is uh
absolves Trump of all January 6
culpability one sentence
he has freedom of speech
and we're done
we're done
hello
if the only thing you have is that he
talked about it
we're done
do you really think you could get 12
Americans to say that he didn't have
Free Speech but they do
you could get 12 Americans to say that
you know unless he did things you know
he actually gave an order for example
that was illegal as far as I know he
just talked
he talked about things that could incite
violence
but you know so do I
every single day
every day I get on here and I say things
that I'm fully aware
could give somebody worked up and do
something stupid
because all politics is like that right
a strong opinion on politics
is going to have effect on some listener
to you know push them into a more
radical yes I've been right all along
this guy on this guy on my screen agreed
with me I must do something about it so
if I have free speech
I certainly think the President should
so his framing might not be precise
meaning it's not really a free speech
issue right would you agree it's not
being framed as a free speech issue but
when he frames it that way
my mind was quiet
I don't know if you have that like it
there are all these things he did or
might have been can she you know who did
what and when was he fast enough and
shouldn't you have done this and should
you have done that all interesting
questions and then Trump says
I have free speech
and your mind just goes quiet
for all those other things
Because unless you can tell me what he
did that wasn't talking
I don't know how you can make a case out
of it
yeah so
we'll see we shall see and that ladies
and gentlemen brings us to just about
the end of the best live stream you've
ever seen in your whole life I know it's
exciting for you too
but
do you have any questions or any story I
missed
any story I missed at all
it's all good stuff isn't it
you missed the Sip
well for those of you who missed the
simultaneous
I am now going to give you the rare
closing zip
I know lucky you came today right
lucky lucky you
well
I would like to uh sip to you
my audience who has stuck with me
because you are not judging me
on all of my flaws I appreciate that I
will I'll do the same I will not judge
you on your flaws as if you have any you
don't have any sip sip
ah yeah
just as good molten molten salt reactor
10 years away
yeah everything's 10 years away if it's
hard
let me give you this advice
Scott how long will it take you to build
a home entirely and of Legos Ted years
how long Scott will it take you to have
a generation 4 molten salt nuclear
reactor is up and running 10 years 10
years we've got some really good
technology for removing carbon from the
atmosphere
how long before that's converted 10
years
flying cars jet packs
about 10 years
except for Fusion that's 20. yeah right
Fusion is 10 plus 10. all right that's
all we've got YouTube you're all
wonderful oh you know I'm gonna Vamp for
a minute and a half before I turn off
YouTube will you stick with me for 90
seconds do you know why
uh apparently YouTube has an algorithm
that likes a one-hour content
so if you get to like within a minute of
one hour it doesn't make sense to end it
so even though I've completely run out
of news
I'm going to stretch this for another
one minute
all right you've got one minute YouTube
the one minute timer is on is there
anything you want to ask
status on books excellent question
um I had to bail out of making the audio
book I was trying to record the
audiobook for the new book reframe your
brain but I'm gonna have to get a
professional to do it because I couldn't
just physically and mentally I couldn't
do it tried tried my best it just wasn't
going to happen the big problem was uh
uh dyslexia
so I don't know why it seems worse but
no I wasn't stoned I know you're gonna
ask but the dyslexia was so bad I
couldn't read the sentences
and I told my man cave audience last
night
that I don't read sentences in order
like I don't read the the words in the
sentence because they jump around
so I tend to just sort of look at all
the keywords in the sentence you know
sort of like they're all just sending
the clump and then my brain arranges
them in what that must have meant so I'm
not actually reading them in the order
of the written so when I'm forced to
read aloud
it becomes a problem
because when I read I have to look at
the words and then I have to form the
sentence that they must have meant in my
brain and they have to remember the
sentence and say that sentence so I'm
not actually just reading it like other
people well I don't know what other
people think like but I imagine I
imagine other people just literally read
all the words and I I actually my brain
and my eyes can't do that I don't have
the ability to read all of the words in
the order that they're on the page
they're jumping around all the time
so I couldn't get past it yesterday so
I'm going to just hire somebody to read
it but to answer your question
um shooting for first week or so of
August so it might be three weeks the
only thing left to do is some details
like the final
book jacket and getting signed up for
the services that allow you to publish
stuff like that
but we're we're there we've that covers
the text is all done
and I do believe this will be one of the
most impactful books
in the history of human civilization
I actually think that could be true
yeah you'd you'd hate to put a bat on
something like that but it's actually
quite possible and the reason it's
possible is it is written in a form
that's unusually impactful
there are about 160 reframes in there
and the reframes can all be expressed as
one sentence
that's what makes them magic right so
just as president Trump reframed uh his
situation as free speech
there are 160 of them that would get to
every part of your personal life
from your mental to physical health to
your career to your optimism to your
basically everything you know your
ability to survive a tragedy a trauma of
everything so if 160 reframes
doesn't find at least 10 that will
change your life
I'd be amazed it would that would be
really weird if it didn't change your
life most people who read are gonna have
that experience that they're actually
going to walk away thinking they're
different people
and what is extra different about it
uh
is that a hypnotist wrote it
so you know when I'm writing a reframe
I'm putting you know a lot of different
skills into it it's not just does it
make sense when you read it there's
layers of it so there's a lot of
layering going on in this book that
won't be obvious
all right I'll give you examples as we
as we get closer to launch I'll give you
more examples
don't want to give it away too early and
yes I saw you say that Sofia Vergara is
available now
um could you give her my number
because
it just seems obvious doesn't it
when you think of me
and you think of Sofia Vergara
you see it I think you all see it
so it's just sort of an obvious one yeah
she'll probably be calling any minute
now
you know what I'd say
yeah busy I get a busy schedule sorry
no I probably wouldn't
uh Vic says I can convince you to accept
Christ
all right Vic would like to convince me
to accept Christ
are you when I accept
all right and that's all for you uh
YouTube
you win again and I will talk to you
tomorrow
bye for now
