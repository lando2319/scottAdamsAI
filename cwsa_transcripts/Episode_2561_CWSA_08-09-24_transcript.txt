it's going to be a good show
today we got all our technology
working lighting is perfect temperature
[Music]
ideal good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of human civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams and
you've never had a better time if you'd
like to take this experience up to
levels that nobody can understand with
their tiny shiny human brains all you
need is a cuper Mugger glass of tanker
cheler tankered cheler Stein the kanteen
Jugger flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled the
unparalleled what what is it
unparalleled you know there was a
study that showed that it's a brand new
studies it says that coffee and tea are
linked to a lower risk of
dementia two prospective cohort studies
are presented at the El well it's worth
a try it's
the the
unparalleled hold on hold on it's the
unparalleled
waight pleasure pleasure it's the
unparalleled pleasure there we
go I hope you took your sip that was
your opport
opportunity yes it's true another study
says that coffee and tea link your
lowers your risk of dementia so that's
the good news well another one of my
neighbors got burgled probably by the
organized South Central American gangs
so that makes uh three high-end homes in
my very safe California neighborhood who
have had people break in and steal their
 in the middle of the day usually so
here's the creepy part in each of the
burglaries I think there have been
several in the last few years nobody's
ever
home now you say to yourself oh that's
good nobody's home when the burglaries
happen but it also means they're
watching how does anybody know if you're
home what exactly would be the mechanism
by which you could tell of somebody's
home because they've never once been
wrong they've never gone into a home and
found somebody there and then had to run
away so how do they know and it makes me
wonder if they're using
drones because remember I told you there
was a a drone that came down in my pool
area of my backyard you know just it
just came down and looked in my
windows and it it cased the whole
neighborhood and then it went back to
some distant place and it was a pretty
high-end drone and it made me wonder if
the criminals just have a way of
monitoring people
the other thing I wonder is do they just
wait until they see a garage open and
then if the garage is open and there are
no Cars left around the house they
figure there are no adults so that's a
good time to go in I don't know but
here's the other thing that I wonder if
it's a
coincidence so I have uh
unusually uh High diversity in my
neighborhood but it's a it's an
expensive neighborhood so everybody here
is doing well and a lot of my neighbors
are either uh Chinese American or uh
indian-american and you know we've got
everything else too we've got Hispanic
you name it but uh it's a pretty diverse
neighborhood but so far I think only the
Asian and indianamerican
high-end homes have been hit and I don't
have a hypothesis about that but it
could be an assumption of lower gun
ownership maybe I don't know if there's
a relation or not um it could be an
assumption that they're more likely to
have
jewelry because I think the the
criminals all like to just grab what
they can put in a pillow case and then
run out so it's usually just medications
I guess they sell the medications or
they hope they're opioids or something
and
jewelry now I have exactly you know zero
jewelry in my house I literally don't
have I don't don't even have a watch you
know that anybody would want to steal
and I you know I don't have any good
drugs that you couldn't get anywhere
so I don't know I just wonder if I'm
safe because the criminals know too much
about me because I can guarantee this
would be the wrong house to Rob but do
they know that it feels like they do
just makes me
wonder
anyway um
so I guess the National Weather Service
is telling the Washington DC area that
there there's going to be a
tornado a tornado do you think God has
finally had
enough yeah do you ever wonder if God is
just watching this whole show and
just like ah it's time for another flood
but let's just see if the let's see if
the tornado cleans anything up yeah if
that doesn't get it done there's always
a flood option
and of course Japan is bracing for what
they're they're expecting or at least
they think is possible not expecting but
they're they're talking about a
earthquake of an eight or a
nine that they think might happen in
Japan like any moment because there have
been a number of small rumbles that give
them an idea that something big is
coming how in the world could Japan
survive an earthquake of an eight or
nine on the RoR scale is that that
doesn't even seem
survivable it seems like the whole
island would collapse under a tsunami or
something so keep an eye on all that
looks
like um you know this reminds me of why
we're all crazy now you know lots of
reasons social media Etc but I wake up
in the morning and I read the news and I
learn about 10 different you know deadly
situations that if I didn't hear about
them wouldn't affect me so now I'm
worrying about you know people dying in
Washington DC from a tornado and I'm
worried about the you know the neighbors
getting burgled and I'm worried about
Japan sinking into the ocean from an
earthquake I wouldn't know any of that
stuff if I were born in the 1700s and I
just woke up and it was time to do some
farming so how in the world do you not
go crazy in today's world because you're
hearing about everybody's problem
and then it becomes like it's your own
problem yeah yeah and then monkey
pox and that now it looks like uh
Africa's got a monkey pox problem and
it's coming to you and I'm thinking
really if I had never heard about this
monkey pox problem do you think I'd be
happier I do because I don't have to do
anything about it until you know there's
some reason to do something about it and
between now and then it's just one extra
thing to worry about on top of of my 50
other things that were in the news to
worry
about let's talk about the fun stuff uh
this doesn't sound like fun but it might
become fun Jordan Peterson he failed in
his court appeals to avoid being
re-educated so his profession the I
guess the psychologists of Ontario
College of psychologists of Ontario they
want to put him into re-education
training so he can learn how to be a
better Communicator online and not be
insulting people I
guess uh now the interesting thing about
this is that I'm not sure this is true
but it sounds like from Peterson's
lawyer that they've exhausted all the
appeals and he might actually go to
re-education
training now how much would you
pay for as a ticket just to be in the
class with Jordan Peterson being how to
use social
media could that be
better like like honestly if you said
how much would you pay for a ticket to
watch Jordan Peterson give let's say a
speech or presentation i' I'd pay a
pretty good I'd pay a pretty expensive
ticket for that I I would feel quite
confident that if I saw him in person I
would walk away saying wow that was a
good
show but how much would I pay to be in
this re-education camp with him in
Ontario I mean if I
traveled I would pay a lot like if they
said all right it's going to be
,000 you have to pay $1,000 and you have
to S through the training you you have
to do the training too I'd be like and
Jordan Peterson's going to be in the
same class in the same room right and
they' be like yeah that's how it works
and I'd be like here's your $1 thousand
because I don't think that could be more
entertaining anyway we'll find out
I'm sure he'll have some stories the
best stories would be the other people
in the
class giving their their account of how
the class went oh my God that's going to
be good all right are you ready for the
best laugh of the
day does does anybody want to start the
weekend with a good
laugh now this is not my joke this is uh
actor Kevin
Sorbo so this is one of the funniest
things I've ever seen so I'm just going
to read his joke
and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do
he he posted an x quote if kamla really
is black have her say the nword let the
people decide for
themselves okay that's just
perfect I I would like to add to it and
add some commentary about it but you
can't do that when something's perfect
no you can't say it could be better cuz
it couldn't
you can't criticize it because it's
perfect so I have nothing to add to it
just take a moment to fully enjoy Kevin
sorbo's best post on X in a long time I
mean best post of anybody in a long time
that is just so
clever well the rasmuson uh polling
company continues to be
provocative um and they're insisting
that based on their expertise
pollsters that they can tell that the
other polls are the ones that
say k Harris has pulled ahead um
rasmuson just says
nope we're I'm paraphrasing but
basically they're saying we're in this
business too and I can tell you that
Comm Harris is not ahead and we can also
tell you how the other pollsters do
their fake polls now that's interesting
it has something to do with a timing
difference of how they how they do it
but I don't know the details but
rasmuson is quite adamant that the uh
that Trump still has a
lead I think this is part of my larger
um theme today that all data is
suspect some of it might be right but
you have no way of knowing because you
can't tell by the source you can't tell
by how many scientists agree none of
that means anything so just treat all
data like it's fake
because you can't tell what's real so
you're going to have to you know make
sure you're covering all your
risks um some of you may have seen a uh
a video that purported to show
president's president mrrone of France
making out with a man at some uh Beach
swimming situation where they're wearing
trunks now I looked at that and I said
to myself I don't think I'm going to
retweet that
because we are in the age of AI and in
the age of AI it seemed to me that
somebody could have faked that
video and so I said to myself I'm just
going to send it to a friend and say I
think it looks like an AI
fake turns out it's an AI fake it's
exactly what I thought now I could not
tell by looking at it so if you want a
preview of what's to come I looked at it
pretty hard
and I said I don't know there there's no
obvious tell in the video itself it just
looks like a Perfect Video somebody took
of him making out with a
guy but it didn't happen it was Ai and
here's the only way I knew that it was
fake two on the
nose remember the two on the nose trick
I teach you this you practically once a
week um if you see a story in the news
that fits your bias or your your let's
say your darker
expectations and it fits into perfectly
it's probably not real it means that
somebody created something because they
knew they could get you to believe it
because you were already biased in that
direction so as soon as you see a story
that's just so right on the
nose you should automatically say
probably not let's wait a little bit on
that one so my instinct to say that was
too on the nose and wait a little bit
was the right Instinct it's not going to
work every time but certainly in the age
of AI if you see something that just so
perfectly on the nose tells a
story automatically put that in your
maybe not
box um there is a story about a chess
champion uh Amina
bakova she was caught on video in a um
smearing Mercury on her rival's chest
pieces um causing her to be
hospitalized so apparently you can
sabotage your chest partner by
rubbing um Mercury on their chest pieces
so if they touch it with her hand
they'll get sick and go to the hospital
but anyway she was uh stripped of her
title uh I do I do appreciate that she
thinks ch is bigger than the board you
know she is the big game but uh
apparently you can be a chess master and
not know that rooms typically have
security cameras which was probably
entirely visible and pointing right at
her when she did it so uh can I give you
this advice should you plan to murder
anybody be at your chess rival or
anybody else and you go into a space and
this space could be indoors or Outdoors
there's a thing you should do before you
do the murdery thing all right it goes
like this if you're watch if you're just
listening on audio I will now be moving
my head in many
directions do do some of
this okay looking for video
cameras all right now that doesn't mean
you're going to see
them uh if you were at my house you
would not be able to see all of my video
cameras because some of them are
intentionally
hidden but others are intentionally
obvious so that you know I have video
security so I can get you both
ways but don't do things in a space that
has a high likelihood of having a camera
looking at you when you're doing it
that's my advice for you
criminals there's another uh video of
Comm Harris looking drunk in my opinion
we're all just going to ignore this
right so we just went through four years
ignoring that uh Biden was obviously
cognitively
declined and now we we just put kamla
Harris there who looks obviously drunk
in a lot of situations and we're just
not going to talk about it right so only
on social media you get to say it
because we can't prove it or something
so will the news just never acknowledge
that whether or not she's actually drunk
that that would be a separate question
she acts drunk quite often
now do you want somebody whose natural
personality is indistinguishable from
drunk how is this not a big issue
because I don't think it's just
me right okay let me ask in the comments
how many of you think that there are
multiple videos of K Harris obviously
being inebriated you could disagree on
whether it's alcohol or something else
but how many think it's obvious she's
inebriated a lot in public how many of
you would say that's a a fair
statement we we'll wait and see in the
comments anyway so Eric abinanti has
this H Post in which he's summarizing
her um K Harris's interview it was over
over video with somebody named Angela Ry
I'm not sure when this
happened uh 2020 I think it was but uh
she was asked by Angela Ry who she
thought was the best rapper alive and
remember this was asked in 2020 and her
answer was
Tupac now if you know the history of KLA
Harris and questions about music she has
said before that she smoked pot and
listened to Tupac in college but Tupac
hadn't done any hadn't done any work
when she was in
college so she's lied about Tupac before
and then an Angela Ry said he's not
alive because she asked best rapper
alive and kamla says I keep doing that
and Angela says keep going and Hara says
who would I say there there's so many I
mean you know uh there are some that I
would mention right now because they
should stay in their Lane and Angela Ry
says I want to know who one of those are
and Comm haris says keep moving keep
moving in other words she wouldn't
answer the question now I ask you
this how many black women who really
enjoy dancing andic music as k Harris
very she dances in public all the time
sort of like Ellen which I don't mind by
the way you know that's a that's sort of
an interesting fun element she adds to
the the mix I'm okay with that uh I mean
I'm okay it's not it's not like it's up
to me to be okay with it I just think
that as a technique it's not bad I I
think it does show some energy and I
know women in particular like it shows
she's Lively so who do you know who is
black and loves music so much that she's
always dancing to it and can't name one
artist in that
domain isn't that weird it makes you
wonder if she actually has even one
black uh rapper artist who's still alive
that she would listen to I'm guessing
maybe no no there's nothing wrong with
that of course that's not a criticism
except she keeps putting
herself in positions where she can't
answer easy
questions how hard would it be to give a
satisfying answer to the question even
if you had been lying about it you could
say something like you know honestly I
don't I don't want to give a favorite
because then it'll just become a thing
but uh it's not so much that I have
favorites I just like the genre I turn
on my I turn on my uh let's say my
streaming service and I just hit hip hop
and I listen to it I'm not too obsessed
with who's making the music I just like
it so when you ask me who's my favorite
honestly I just blank but I like the you
know I sort of like the genre I'm not so
into following the the details of who's
doing it how hard would it be to answer
that question it would be the easiest
and she couldn't handle that she
couldn't handle who's your favorite
musician I don't think you could get an
easier
question so can't wait to see her deal
with the hard
questions well apparently a debate will
happen I believe three have been
proposed but only one has been agreed by
both camps and I think that's the NBC
hosted one on September 10th if I'm
correct so that would leave to that
Trump says yes to that Harris has not
yet said yes to but might if I had to
recommend the Harris team strategy I
would recommend one
debate what would you recommend if you
were on Harris's team and you were
recommending you can't recommend
zero zero is too hard and three is just
giving you three ways to
lose I think one is their best play
because if you do one you can't be said
that you didn't do one and she might get
lucky you know she just might have a
good day so if she has one good day it
would be a mistake to have another one
planned
and if she fails in her one she probably
was going to fail on all
three so I think one is the right
number we'll
see all right CNN the company is uh in
bad financial Straits parent company
just took a $ 9.1 billion write off uh
apparently they lost $1 billion this
quarter is that even possible
how do you lose how do you lose1 billion
in one quarter from a little news site
that nobody
watches I don't I don't even think that
data could be correct that can't be
right 10 billion and a
quarter how could they possibly spend
$10 billion in one
quarter
that that makes no sense at all does it
all right there's something about this
story that's not adding up but one thing
we can tell for sure is a CNN is not
a is not for
profit just hold that in your head for a
moment
CNN doesn't run for a
profit and it looks like it never
could if you were the owner of the
company who owned a money losing just
huge money losing entity what would you
do would you continue M Los money
forever with no no real hope that it's
going to change around because it's
Legacy Media and it's going to decline
until it
disappears wouldn't you cut your
losses
unless unless there were some other
reason that you own CNN maybe it's so
you can have some control over the
narrative maybe there's some shady
government entity that's saying to you
you know if you just suck it up and take
these losses and keep CNN on the air
because it says things we like it to say
well maybe in other domains your
business would start doing really well
because the government would suddenly be
flexible about those things you need
that you keep asking for that they keep
saying no to but we could get them to
say
yes so it makes you
wonder what is up with
CNN if it's not being uh kept alive as a
pure propaganda brainwashing tool which
is what it looks
like why is it being kept alive it's not
for
money if you're not doing it for money
and you're not doing it because it's a
government mandate you know if the
government said you have to keep it
alive well that'd be something but it's
not a mandate and there's no profit
incentive so you tell me why it
exists I can only think of one reason is
because somebody wants to control the
propaganda and the Brain
Washington can you come up with another
reason I mean I'm I'm flexible I'm open
to another
explanation what would be another
explanation that that they're optimistic
that they can turn the ship around no
nobody thinks that nobody you know
nobody experienced enough to be an
executive at the parent company no
nobody would think
that
so we are left with the obvious
conclusion
that it's a brainwashing tool and that's
why it
exists um here's some fun do you
remember smart Maddox that's the
software company that uh the software
that operates in a lot of voting
machines around the country and around
the world actually around the world as
well as
America so uh I wonder if anything is
suspicious about that company lately
well uh the founder and president of the
whole company along with three other
Executives have been indicted by a
Federal grand jury in Florida huh turns
out they're being charged with bribery
and money laundering over some kind of
deal to get their to get their product
into the
Philippines now apparently there was a
million allegedly there was a million
dollar bribe and these Executives were
all you know part of it and uh and
they're also calling it money laundering
but I think maybe the bribe might have
been more important than the money
laundering I'm not sure um but the idea
was to gain the business of the
Philippines
now here's where it gets
interesting first of all how common is
it for a multinational company to
bribe uh locals in another country to
get the business how common is that I
assume it's kind of common because as
soon as you leave the United States your
odds of having to bribe somebody to do
business in another country go really
high right I would assume that Central
America is you know largely a blackmail
situation or a bribery situation where
you know there all these indirect ways
to get money to people that need to be
bribed so I do think that big business
in a international sense is probably
pretty brisk Ling with bribery now it's
illegal in America but it's also the
only way to get business in a lot of
countries for a lot of Industries it's
probably the only way because whoever
does the best bribe probably gets that
business so now now let's go back to the
cia's interest in controlling the
elections in other countries does the
CIA have an interest in influencing
elections in other countries such as the
Philippines
and the answer is well yeah that's
pretty much their business that's what
they do so do you think that maybe
somebody in the CIA would be perfectly
happy with an some entity bribing the
Philippines to bring in software that
maybe they could have some impact on now
I'm not alleging any of these are the
case I'm not I'm not alleging that the
CIA has any control or
uh or influence over this smart medic
company but it would be quite a
dereliction of Duty if they
don't if I were the boss of the CIA and
I called my Spooks in I'd say all right
guys and gals what are you doing to
influence the uh government in the
Philippines and if they said well
nothing well I'd find better Spooks but
if they said to me hey we we've got an
end with this voting machine software
company and uh if we if we let them buy
this business which would require some
bribery but uh if we let them buy the
business then we'll have the software of
our choice running the machines in the
Philippines and then I'm the boss of the
CIA and I say oh very good very good I'm
going to give you a
promotion now I'm not saying that the
CIA has anything to do with anything I'm
not saying that there's anything wrong
with this software
I'm just saying that if you know the
players and you know the incentives the
question you'd want to ask is um did
smart madx just want to buy some extra
business or did they have somebody who
might be a silent partner who might
really want them to buy that
business and so here's what I would look
for could it be that one entity of the
government uh just sees the crime and
then is going after it and that's why
there's an indictment because there's
some entities that are just fighting
crime but if there's another entity
let's say a shadowy entity within the
United States who is happy that the
software company would have some uh
let's say uh let's say some influence on
the elections of Another
Country what you should expect is that
these cases would go nowhere meaning
that the CIA would intervene and say you
know we kind of need these guys to stay
in a jail so find a way that they don't
go to
jail so here's what I'd look for look
for anything that looks like a
suspicious reason that this case doesn't
go
forward that would be the prediction so
if you think that this is darker and
deeper than it looks on the
surface well let's see if the case
proceeds like a normal
case now the other possibility
would be if the CIA was trying to
influence the company but
failing they might have thrown the
executive under the
bus as in how did anybody know how did
anybody in America know that this
company was bribing a Philippines
company how would you know that unless
it was a whistleblower well you might
know it if the CIA was watching him and
they decided they didn't like that
executive because he wasn't playing
along with them anymore so I don't think
this is the kind of story that you can
really know anything about it it seems
to me that whatever there is about this
story though you know it's true of every
story that's big and complicated there's
something we don't know about this story
and probably never will not that my
speculations are accurate um I'm just
putting it out there so you can see what
the whole world looks like and what to
expect so keep an eye on this and see if
they suspiciously and magically don't go
to jail for anything that looks like a
clear CR
that that's what I'd be looking
for all right there's a website called
The Ballad
assure uh website and uh they're listing
a number of things that this group The
Cyber ninjas group of analysts who did a
they did an analysis of the voting
systems in one County in
Michigan and they uncovered a number of
problems which I assume in context that
What's Happening Here is the problems
that they found in one County
they believe are
generalized so the findings are from one
County but I guess they they they have
reason to believe that the same mistakes
would apply to other places that use
same equipment I guess here are some of
the things they
found these are
vulnerabilities in that one County just
in Michigan that may be
General hardcoded
passwords the discovery of hardcoded
password passwords that have been
unchanged in the system since
2010 the password is embedded directly
in multiple points in the source code
making it easily exploitable by anyone
with access to the
code okay well that that sounds less
than
ideal high level access
vulnerability uh let's see accounts with
high level
privileges um are inadequately
protected um so it looks like they could
be compromised why spread use of global
passwords that sounds as bad as it uh oh
the same password in multiple systems in
different states so they alleg that the
same passwords are on these
machines everywhere including Georgia
Arizona New Mexico and
Michigan meaning that if you could get
into one of them you could get into all
of
them uh weak password management
practices and lack of salting in the
hashing well I don't know about you but
I like a lot of salt in my hash but this
is a te technical
term um it just means salting is adding
a unique random value to each password
before before hashing
it and the absence of it allows for
reverse lookups of hashed passwords
significantly weakening security so let
me ask you
this does any of this sound like our
election system are at the highest level
of cyber
security doesn't really sound like that
does it so if you were to say where does
this
rank uh let's say compared to big
corporate systems that are sensitive or
infrastructure systems well I'm thinking
that a big corporate important
infrastructure system would have really
good cyber
security and they still get hacked still
get
hacked basically every system is
hackable it seems so you know how the
the FBI thinks that China has already
gotten into our infrastructure
systems if China can get into all of our
major infrastructure systems and by the
way I think the FBI would only say that
if they knew that the United States has
already gotten into everybody else's
infrastructure right because if nobody
in the United States knew how to hack
into somebody's highly protected cyber
security in another country we probably
wouldn't assume that they're already
doing it to us and not being
detected one has to assume that we're
already doing
it or else we wouldn't assume anybody's
doing it to us because they don't leave
doesn't leave
evidence
so you look at these allegations of low
security in the elections and you say to
yourself if the highest security things
are routinely hacked that would be what
the FBI says what would happen to the
lowest security things because this
description sounds more
like something in the
lower at least 50% I would say the lower
half of security maybe the lower 10% I
mean this is pretty bad
um doesn't it look like it's designed to
fail do do you think this is looks like
it's designed to give you a a credible
and reliable unhacked result or does it
look like it's designed so you can never
tell what the actual vote
was uh let me give you a little more
background on that uh I saw a
interesting post by fisher
king uh who's a good follow on X fisher
king one word Fisher is spelled f i c h
e r King one word anyway he says uh a
realistic scenario for the election is
that kamla wins over 90 million votes
and then parenthetically he says
harvested mailed in made up and we are
then told ad noi that we just had the
quote fairest most free election in
American
history and a lot of people on the right
will insist we go along with this I
remember Andrew Sullivan demanding that
Michael Anton agreed to his proposition
to this proposition in 2020 and getting
angry when Anton
wouldn't does that sound likely that
Harris will get an unbelievably High
number of votes and we won't think there
possibly a chance that that could have
happened naturally and we'll all just go
oh
well I think that's very
possible yep and that brings me to my
conclusion the creators of our election
system did not choose a
design that could be regarded by an
objective
Observer as
secure there's no objective Observer of
our elections who could say that these
are secure because we don't know where
the mailin ballots are coming we don't
have everybody watching every stage we
don't know what happens when the
software in the machine is doing its
thing we don't know how many ways there
are to cheat we don't know how many
hackers can get in we don't know how
many passwords are compromised we don't
know how many insiders are in on it we
don't know how many people are hiding
things deleting things we have no waya
to know now given that we have 100%
certainty of knowing how to create an
election process that is faster cheaper
and more secure and the country would
say yeah that's credible I believe that
which would be paper ballots with more
than one person watching them getting
counted simple right now you might say
no no Scott too many people in the
country no there
isn't we don't have too many people in
the country if we need more people to
count votes we can get
volunteers we can get as many vote
counters as you need that's not a
problem so the fact that we have a
system that's designed with not just a
problem but massive systemic problems to
the point where nobody would ever know
for sure if an election was fair that's
a that's a
decision right and I'll say this this is
very important point if you design
something and it doesn't work the way
you wanted it to in the short run that
design doesn't mean anything because you
tried something it didn't work and then
ideally you would pull it back and try
again with a new design until you got
something that worked now if you saw
that process happen you'd say oh these
are people who are trying to design a
system that is secure and the public
trusts it
but if you've been doing this for
decades and the public has been
complaining for decades and nothing's
really
different you have to assume that the
current design is
intentional because it wouldn't be that
hard to change it back to paper
ballots so if it's
intentional and the design really
removes any hope that you would know if
an election is real or
rigged what are you supposed to make of
that what kind of conclusion would a
reasonable person
make my conclusion is that given this
much time and the number of complaints
we've had and the number of obvious
vulnerabilities that if you leave the
system like this for decades it's
because you want it that way so whoever
is running the
country doesn't want you to know what
the vote is that's for
sure well Peli did an interview and
talked a little bit more about about
removing
Biden and uh she did sound like she was
taking credit for pushing him out and
she said her the most important thing
was quote not letting Trump back in
office now imagine that one of the most
important politicians in the United
States was going to tell you their top
interest and the top interest was not
letting Trump back in
office what does that sound like to you
to
me if there was something that Trump was
going to do specifically that would
destroy the country you'd have to see a
little of it happening in his first four
years and then you could say oh did you
see what he did in those four years he's
going to do that
again well that could be a a thing that
you'd be afraid of or they might say
he's proposing to do X or Y such as when
they say um we think he might do this
this or that well that would be an
argument might be silly but it' be an
argument but you know what's not an
argument that her most important
priority over everything was not letting
Trump back in
office shouldn't she be talking about
the
country wh why is her objective
Trump to me that sounds
personal to me that sounds like she's
trying to keep her buddies on a
jail to me that sounds like has nothing
to do with the good of the country who
words it that way the highest priority
my highest priority is keeping Trump out
of office
forever that is just not the way you
talk if you're trying to do what's good
for the country it just you wouldn't
choose those words this sounds very much
like somebody who's afraid of going to
jail that's how I read
it well Tim wals the VP choice for k
Harris we're continuing to get all the
opposition research and part of it is is
that in 2023 he signed a measure to give
free college to illegal immigrants in
the State uh that would be free State
College and uh also to give them so it'd
be free
tuition and uh they'd be able to get
driers licenses I guess too
so I don't think that's terribly popular
but I understand you know in a left
leaning way why you do such a thing
because you know if they're going to be
here and you're not going to Shi sh them
home it's probably better if they're
educated you know so they can get a job
and get a skill so it's not crazy but
it's going to be unpopular with voters I
think in other countries in other um
States um there's another attack on Tim
wals saying that he's lying when he says
he was a head coach because other people
are saying he wasn't a head coach but
apparently he's called himself a head
coach a number of times so here's the
question I ask about that
if somebody said that they were a tennis
coach I would say tennis coach that's
somebody who coaches you how to play
tennis got it if somebody is a baseball
hitting coach it's say baseball hitting
coach okay that would be somebody who
coaches somebody at a hit in baseball
got it got
it uh but he said he was a head coach
all right next
story
um the FTX company that fake crypto
company um of Sam bankman freed
apparently the court is ordering him to
pay almost $13 billion back to
customers
um which could be 100% recovery on
customer claims now I didn't think that
was a thing
I'm kind of I'm kind of
impressed that there could be 100%
recovery of all the people who were
victimized by this fake company but
apparently they do have that many
billions of dollars so the company was
sitting on billions of dollars and now
the customers are going to get it back
so that's a happy ending sort of except
for Sam bankman
freed um so I was watching a uh video of
uh Harris answering a question and I
noticed have you noticed that
75% of democrat messaging during
election is their
face so Democrat messaging is mostly
about making a disgusted face while
talking about uh what Republicans
do because they don't have
policies so I think they're selling
disgusted face
so instead of saying well you know I'd
like to uh make these changes to taxes
of the government and my opponent has a
different policy and here's why his
won't work and and mine will I'd love to
hear that here's what I don't want to
see is a face he's going to do
Trump things in bad person
or and it's just
literally the whole message is the face
they're making because the words that
are coming out of their mouth have all
these
generic you know things like he's going
to steal your democracy and his
character and blah blah my face and I
thought to
myself that is such female
messaging that's female messaging now
she's a woman so not a big surprise but
it seems to be the primary method of the
Democrats is face making and I always
say this on MSNBC especially their hosts
are mostly about the face they're making
when they're saying ridiculous things so
watch for the face
persuasion what are you talking about
jump and when I talk about my side
here's my face when I talk about my team
look at my happy face I am so happy
about this old white guy oh man I'll
tell you what we really needed I know
it's a surprise but we really needed an
old white guy
yeah yeah I love it look at my face look
at my face how happy I
am I don't think Republicans do that do
they you know Republicans like to be you
know annoyed and pissed off and you know
and disgusted by things as well but they
don't make the
face and I think it's a difference
between male and female messaging women
want you to feel what they feel
men want you to think about what you're
thinking about and you know obviously
that's a giant generality and they
plenty of people who are on either side
and mixtures and everybody's unique and
I say that just in case there are any
NPCs here who who want to say but I know
somebody who's not like that that's
usually what happens at this
point
anyway um over in England 3,300 people
have been arrested so far for things
that they said on social media that
somebody deemed hate
speech and here's my question does that
mean I could be arrested if I travel to
England for business or
pleasure because that's my current
reading of it here here's why I say it
if it if there's a law that you can't do
something in a
country but you do it in another country
where it's not illegal you're
fine but if you go to that country
where you can be put in jail for that
behavior even in the
past even in the
past could they not look at my social
media and could they not say you know
what I think on this one post you did
four years ago looks like you a little
bit of hate speech there so we're going
to put you in
jail are you telling me they can't do
that to me to me it looks like I could
never go to
England my my current read is that I
can't go
there am I wrong and and by the way if
I'm right why isn't that the big story
that we have to there should be an
advisory should not the United States
government give a travel advisory that
if you go to Great Britain you could be
put in jail for free speech and that you
should think twice about traveling to
Great Britain am I wrong there should be
a travel
advisory right because I can't believe
that I could be an American and travel
over to Great Britain uh let's say I
attend a protest and I'm like tweeden
things that they think are hay speech
while I'm standing in
England are they going to say oh you're
not you're not British so you can say
anything you
want I don't believe that they would
make that distinction I believe they'd
say if you're standing in England and
you're doing these things we're going to
put you in jail but I also believe that
they would put me in jail if I'd ever
done it before I was in England that's
how I read
it so I need the United States to do a
travel advisory or a travel
clarification telling me that Great
Britain assures us we will not be put in
jail if we if we visit there without
that insurance Assurance you should
cancel every trip you should
never go there as long as that's a
thing and I'm just sort of amazed that
we're not talking about the travel risk
because we would talk about it in every
other context you know when uh when
China had a pandemic we said hey maybe
don't travel there right when uh when
terrorism kicks up in some
country we say don't travel there it's
the most basic it's just a basic thing
the government does why aren't they
doing it in this case this is really
dangerous you could be put in jail for
things you've already done that were
totally legal it's just that when you go
to England they say it's illegal here so
you're going to
jail I don't know we need some
answers um Mike Ben I saw was uh
commenting on some reports that I don't
know how much credibility to put on any
data that came from the pandemic so
here's my basic thing you've got some
data that says that uh the VAC Vines did
this or that I don't believe it you got
some data that says the pandemic did
this or that I don't believe it because
none of the data is credible because
everybody has an interest it's all
motivated data and people are bad at
collecting data and bad at analyzing it
and bad at making sure they have the
right data and bad bad at collecting it
in the right way so my experience as a
person who used to collect data and do
analyses for a living for 16 years in my
corporate jobs data is never real you
just settle for whatever is available
and you sell it the best you can so it's
a settling and selling is what you do
with data what you don't do is collect
accurate data and then report it nobody
ever has in the history of humanity it's
just not a thing now that's really hard
to accept if you've never been in those
jobs if you've never been in the job
where it's your job to collect accurate
data and then report it you wouldn't
know that it's not real ever really ever
for all practical purposes you could
just assume it's never happened but
there's certainly data you can sell and
you can settle for it being good enough
and you can convince other people that's
good enough that's real but the data
itself is never credible in our world
that unfortunately our world doesn't
have credible data and I don't know if
there's any way to fix that it's always
been that way but here's the give given
all of my setup that no data can be
trusted there's an allegation that the
thing that killed so many people in
American hospitals was a combination of
REM REM Desir and
ventilation you've heard people say the
ventilators killed people um but now
there's also allegations that the rim
Des AE might have been the real killer
and if you added the ventilation to the
rim dese you had basically a double
whammo and you know you're were going to
get killed
now
um I guess I would explain a few things
now according to Mike Ben R Desir was
developed by one of Donald rumsfeld's
companies so that would that would put
REM Desir sort of in that you know deep
state connected world that that makes it
a little suspicious I don't know how
much of any of that's
true but um it would explain a
lot if it turned out that REM Desir and
ventilation was really the cause of the
high covid deaths it would explain a lot
but I do think that other countries had
uh a lot of deaths and they were
treating them differently so uh this is
like every other pandemic information
don't believe it I don't rule it out I
don't rule it out but it's not credible
to me at this stage it could
doesn't mean it's wrong I'm just saying
it doesn't yet reach my level of
something I automatically believe could
be more
complicated um all right so the monkey
pox as I mentioned the Africa CDC is
going to declared a an Emergency next
week and the the viral infection rate of
spreading is
alarming again I would be so much
happier if I had never heard that
all right let's talk about Iran unless
Iran has attacked uh Israel in a major
way since I started the show they're so
far holding
back now the Iranian decision is really
kind of hard they're in quite a pickle
because if they do a forceful
attack which seems like it would be
called for in you know the normal tit
tat of these situations if they do
something
forceful um
Israel is just going to have a free pass
to take out the leadership of
Iran which I think would be their next
move
and I think Iran probably knows that or
at the very least it would be a free
pass to do some serious damage to
Hezbollah at least
so uh and then some people are saying
I'm not so sure the current leadership
of Israel wants to avoid war which is my
opinion I think that you know every body
wants less war if they can get it but if
you're in Israel you have to do the
calculation that a little war now might
might avoid a bigger War
later so for Israel the no war ever is
going to be a bad idea because then
you'd be taken advantage of you got to
be willing and everybody has to know
you're willing to do a little bit of war
and if you make it easy for them to do
more than a little bit by some you know
attack that other countries would say oh
that's bad
okay I guess Israel's got to hit you
back I think Israel is going to hit
back harder than anybody's ever seen
anybody hit back because war is in their
advantage right now to me Israel from
let's say a government perspective not
from not necessarily from the citizen
perspective because they they might just
want peace peace peace but from a
government strategic playing chess kind
of a way to look at it maybe the very
best thing for Israel would be a heart
attack from Iran because then they can
do what they feel like they need to do
sooner or later which is take out the
risk so if they're if they're just
itching for an excuse to go hard at Iran
why would Iran just give them that
excuse you know it seems like Iran would
do better doing what they've been doing
forever which is slowly building up and
you know doing a lot of pin Pricks and
you know just bothering them forever but
if Iran wants to go for like a a kill
shot to maybe you know wound Israel
deeply Israel's going to
just who knows but they're not going to
stop so uh to me it appears Iran has no
winning play they can look weak by not
attacking or they can attack and get
greed I don't think there's a third
choice is there has anybody suggested
there's the third choice well the third
choice is to just sort of keep
threatening but never really do anything
of
substance so if I had to guess I'm going
to guess that Iran does something
small or they keep kicking the can down
the road saying any minute now guys you
better clear your airspace any minute
but just don't do anything or don't do
anything of scale anyway
anyway just the news website is
reporting and others are reporting as
well there's something super sketchy
about that uh alleged terrorist guy who
got into the country and was planning to
kill some important people including
Trump if he could uh the story is now
that the FBI interviewed him
fingerprinted him um and then gave him
special permission to enter the country
back in April now what does any of that
mean what does special permission mean
I think what it means is that he was on
a list of people who should not be
allowed in the country either because
the country or we just didn't know
enough about him or some combination of
that but what does it mean to give him
special permission to enter the country
so the context I would need to know is
this is it a routine process by which
people who trip the uh they trip the no
fly zone kind of list if there's
somebody who's on a a list from a
sketchy country maybe they all get
looked at and maybe most of them get
approved as in well you came from a
sketchy country but we don't see
anything specifically bad about you in
particular so we're going to give you
special privilege to stay here so
without knowing how ordinary that
is uh I have questions but I wouldn't I
wouldn't jump to the conclusion that it
was non
AR it sounds
non-ordinary but it might not be so I'd
wait for a little little extra
information on this
one well there's a report that uh NASA
who was hired or is contracted with
Boeing to build them some rockety stuff
um is saying there's a new study saying
that uh Boeing's quality control is
terrible basically and there there's a
report that says
uh the lack of trained and qualified
Workforce increases the risk so they're
saying that Boeing has
a an undertrained and underqualified
Workforce for building these
NASA
parts now what do you think I'm going to
say do you know me well enough to
suspect that I might have something to
say about the untrained and an
unqualified
Workforce what could be the cause of
that huh now this is where the people on
the left are saying oh you you you
racist oh you bigot I know where you're
going to go with this Scott you're going
to say this is caused by Dei nope nope
I'm not do you know why I'm not going to
say that I I have no information to
suggest that's the
problem but it's the first question
would you
agree I I don't have any information
that would say that's the reason for the
problem
none but my first question would be
how's your Dei
going now is that a bigoted thing to ask
no because the Dei system by its design
should cause Mass incompetence
eventually for every company that goes
harded Dei why is it because some people
have bad genes no you is it because
some people have uh a culture that you
have to worry about no you and
don't that's not even part of the
conversation stop bringing that into the
conversation has nothing to do with your
race nothing to do with your gender
nothing to do with anything except are
you qualified for the job and did you
get it for the right reason now if Dei
is the system and if the pool of
qualified people is not big enough what
happens in every company every time when
they have to satisfy Dei but they can't
get enough people that they're happy
with they hire them anyway because
that's the way the manager keeps his job
or her job of course there's no other
way that goes there's not one company
big company anywhere ever who just said
we're oh gosh we can't find enough
qualified people for diversity so we'll
just keep our keep our bad situations
nope they will continue to lower the
standard until they' met their Dei goal
and they'll hope that it all works
out in many cases it might so let me let
me say it again there's no information
that Dei has anything to do with the low
quality of the workforce training at
boing it is however the number one
question to ask and it is however
completely
predicted by Dei as a system and not by
anybody's genes and not by anybody's
chromosomes and not by anybody's gender
and not by anybody's culture you could
take all of that out of the conversation
and you still end up with incompetent
workplace over time because it's
designed that way design is
Destiny all right there's a uh study
that says you're not indecisive you're
you might be
unbiased so people who are biased are
the fastest as making decis
decisions you know who do you want to
vote for the Democrat or the Republican
Republican well you might be a little
biased there that makes sense but is the
bias wrong well it depends who you ask
right so bias doesn't mean you're
wrong um but apparently people have a
hard time making a decision is because
they don't have a strong
bias now I'm not so sure I trust any of
this interpretation or science but it's
s sort of an interesting angle that when
you see somebody who can't decide do you
say to yourself oh there's an unbiased
person but here's how I would decide
whether whether what you're seeing is
somebody who can't make a decision or
somebody who's unusually
unbiased take him to the Cheesecake
Factory do I need to finish that have
have you ever eaten with somebody at the
Cheesecake Factory who is not good at
decision- making
and they open the menu It's Like War and
Peace and not only is the menu the
biggest menu I've ever seen in my
life but it's all pretty
good the Cheesecake Factory does a
really good job of making their food
delicious you know so you've got you've
got like an encyclopedia of menu choices
and they're all pretty good do you know
what I do
oh that looks good and I'm done now is
that because I'm uh I'm
biased well a little bit because you
know there's lots of foods I don't eat
so I can skip them but mostly it's
because I don't like sitting there and
not
eating so the reason that I pick quickly
is that my odds of being disappointed by
what I get are pretty low because like I
said Cheesecake Factory is really good
at producing food that tastes great you
know I I can't speak for the health
benefits or lack thereof but their food
tastes great pretty much everything so
am I
decisive no I'm a person who hates
sitting there not eating I'm hungry I'm
not
biased so if somebody can't make a
decision between Harris and Trump take
him to the Cheesecake Factory and find
out if the lack of bias is the problem
or maybe they're just not so great at
making decisions in complicated
situations the FDA approved a new drug
called
xer that with an auto injector to help
people with a suspected opioid
overdose so that would work on either
natural or synthetic opioids it works
about 90% of the time so 90% of the time
if it looks like somebody
is uh dying from an overdose you can
stick this thing into them and uh
apparently even if it's not the problem
it's not going to kill
him I think you know that I don't think
it would be legal if somebody gave it to
you and it killed you for other
reasons so I suspect it's fairly safe I
mean I don't know the details but it's
got to be fairly safe for somebody who
doesn't have an overdose problem because
otherwise it couldn't be approved I
assume
so that's interesting who's the company
that made this Purdue
Pharma
wait have I heard that name before
Purdue
Pharma sounds familiar have they ever
done anything in this field
before interesting
question that doesn't sound real does it
that's real by the way it's Purdue
Pharma so I guess it was a topic they
knew about but who knows maybe the
weirdest thing in the world just
happened maybe Purdue
Pharma uh just came up with the solution
for the fentel crisis and that would be
awesome that would be
awesome maybe you know any we live in
such a weird world that maybe Purdue
Pharma solve this problem which some
would say they were part of the the
cause but um if it's the same Purdue I
don't know how many Purdue Farmers there
are our own soil is under attack you
say all right war is
failure totally
agree yeah yeah war is
failure but there are times when you
don't have a path to success you know if
a if a dictator is rolling up on your
Shores and wants to conquer your country
because it's good for the
dictator maybe there's no winning play
here you got to go to
war wait till Iran has a nuclear bomb
well see that's why I think uh Netanyahu
may be just itching for a fight because
if they do something now and they do it
big it could make a difference to Iran's
nuclear ambition but they'd have to it'd
have to be a pretty
aggressive strike I mean I don't know if
taking it the leadership would be enough
you'd probably have to take out all of
their nuclear facilities and I don't
know but here's the thing I
wonder do you believe that Israel is
always aware where the Iranian supreme
leader is
at don't you think they always know
don't you think that Iran has found
somebody
who would be in the vast network of
people who would know where the supreme
leader is cuz right he's got a cook he's
going to have drivers he's going to have
cleaners right there should be this
giant Universe of people who do know
where the supreme leader is that could
be bribed for a million dollars all
right if if your entire life looks like
you're going to be cleaning the toilet
in the Supreme Leader uh many
mansions and somebody says how about I
give you a million dollars and a uh and
a visa to the United States would you
keep us informed where the supreme
leader is it seems like it would be the
easiest thing in the world for Israel to
eventually you know maybe not in day one
but eventually find somebody who's
willing to take a bribe to keep them
informed where the supreme leader is and
I would think that the taking out the
head of
Hamas and before that the United States
taking that
Solomon if I said that right should send
the strong
signal that the leadership of Iran is
not off the table and I think if after
October
7th if they follow that up with some
other brutal attack on Israel whether it
comes from the air or anywhere
else I feel like Israel would finally
and for the first time have a free pass
to take out the leadership of Iran
because I think everybody was objective
and looked at it would say you know what
this is never going to end unless one of
them just
wins so let's get it over with let's
just have one of them win maybe maybe we
can have shipping
again at a low cost all right that's all
I got for you today thanks for joining
I'm going to say uh few words to the
private people on locals my beloved
subscribers but to you on X and Rumble
and YouTube thanks for joining and I
will see you again tomorrow for more
fun have a great
day all
