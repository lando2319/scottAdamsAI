good morning everybody and welcome to
the best thing that's ever happened
better than christmas yeah
yeah and christmas was pretty good for a
lot of you
uh not for everybody
that's
that's funnier to the people who saw me
a minute ago on locals i always give the
locals people a little extra time
so they always have a little more
backstory than you do on youtube
but anyway if you'd like to take your
peak experience up to a new level and i
think you do
yeah i think you do all you need is a
couple of mugger glasses tanker chelsea
stein a canteen jugger flask a vessel of
any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
i'm trying to ignore a meme that's
playing on the locals platform because
they they can plug memes into their
comments i'm trying not to see that
santa claus
but it is funny anyway
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine the other day the thing
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous step and it happens now go
jack you finally made it for the live
sip
it's about damn time
everybody say hi to jack bosovic
over on
youtube uh
jack you you saved me yesterday i was in
i was in the middle of a uh
a pitched troll battle
and uh
jack sent me some information jack
bassamic sent me some information that
helped me in my
helped me in my struggle
so we'll talk about that in a minute
so y'all you're all following i know the
story of the
the dad
who said let's go brandon on the phone
call to biden right everybody knows that
story i don't have to give any more
background on it
and uh now the the man who said it
jared schmeck which is just the best
name
if there had to be somebody in this
story
you know who's basically just an
ordinary guy
so it's a story about an ordinary guy
doing something that made national
attention and if you're going to do a
story about an ordinary guy
his name should be jared schmick
that's the most ordinary guy
name i've ever heard
anyway he said that
although he believes biden could be
doing a better job he did not intend any
disrespect
he did not intend any disrespect
have we reached
have we reached a point
where it doesn't matter what you see
with your own eyes
people could just say anything
no i'm not sitting here talking to you
right now
i know it seems like it
but i'm not
i know i know you hear me you see me
it's a live stream
you would naturally think that i'm here
talking to you
but no i'm actually elsewhere
you can just you can literally say
anything now
there is no limitation to what you can
say in public with a straight face
yeah i'm actually a lizard man from the
planet caleb
sure
can't prove it isn't true
so yes uh he uh he actually said fu
uh joe biden
in in the clever let's go brandon way uh
on a phone call that was publicized and
uh i didn't intend any disrespect
there was no no disrespect
intended there at all
[Laughter]
well
as other people have noted this is the
least important story in the world but
there's not much else going on
so we might as well talk about this
um
i don't think there's any importance to
this story whatsoever it was a prank it
would be to me it would be boring if
other people did it in the future
the the fact that one guy did it once in
in this rather clever way
that's a good story
it doesn't mean anything you know and it
was disrespectful but you know
in a funny way it was disrespectful but
it was disrespectful
um
anyway there's nothing to say about it
so there's a
you you've heard about these 3d printed
homes where they bring in a big 3d
printer that's got a big arm and the arm
will
go around and print you up a home
apparently you can make a home in 12
hours
compared to months for construction
and now there's a 1200 square foot home
that was just built
two full baths
and was built from concrete with a 3d
printer and it's a habitat for a
humanity
home i think it's the first one that
they've done with 3d printing now i
guess they 3d print it but then they you
know they have to run in and add a few
things
but
i'm not so sure that this is a story
about 3d printing
because the 3d printing is really a
simplifier right
what it does is simplify but what
happens
when you want to change a wall
how do you do that when it's concrete
can you do that
chat
chuck haney over on youtube is yelling
at me in caps
there is a lot to say about that phone
call that's how you pronounce caps
either they keep biding in the dark or
his memory is really bad stop showing
scott
stop shilling so now there's somebody on
youtube who thinks i'm shilling for
biden
really
does anybody else think that
uh
and and chuck says in all caps you saw
it didn't you question mark question
mark question mark question mark
question mark
yes chuck i saw it
is it news that president biden
sometimes says confusing things in
public
is that what i missed brand new
it's like first time we've been exposed
to this concept
that the president sometimes will be
confused in public
is that why you're shouting at me chuck
in all caps
my
mic certain
i wake up bro
all right yes we all know uh i think
everybody knows that uh biden is a bit
degraded i'm not sure that that's a real
story
anyway uh
these 3d printed houses here's what
houses should be are you ready for this
all of your parts should be one square
foot or something that is divisible you
know evenly into one foot
components why
because
because if you could build a house
without having to cut anything
you could probably build it in 12 hours
don't you think you could build a house
in 12 hours if you didn't have to cut
anything
you just snapped it together
the reason that modern homes are so
expensive is that everything's made
like even even when they're building a
bunch of models
each model still requires a lot of
cutting
for no particular reason
i don't to make make work for carpenters
or something if you just shipped the
components the size that they ought to
be in one square you know they're one
square foot you want to build a wall
put up one square foot tiles until
you've got a wall that's exactly
nine or ten feet tall
so you should never have to cut anything
and you also shouldn't have to worry
about your building codes
if you build you know to a kit
specification
so i think the real story here is that
if you make homes that can be built
quickly
then you will build them quickly
if you make them so that they can be
built quickly meaning you have to cut
every piece of wood and you've got it
also anything that requires you to add a
liquid
such as a concrete
you're already harder than it needs to
be
anyway
um
so i think homes will be customized and
turned into kits that people can make
their own home in 12 hours without a 3d
printer it'll be much more flexible
because then you can
unassemble it and move a wall if you
need to because it's just a kit
someday
um do this here's an experiment click on
the first story about covet you see just
do a search engine doesn't matter which
search engine and search for covid
and then look at the stories that come
up on the front page
and then read them
and see if they mention death rates
they don't
the the stories about covet completely
ignore death rates now they might
mention them like they're going up or
down but they don't report it anymore
what what was the current death rate uh
per day of cova deaths in the united
states yesterday
used to be on used to be on the
right on cnn's page there all the time
right
um
yeah
so
here's the related story apparently
south africa has dropped quarantine for
people who have tested positive
i need to say that again because because
that's such a big statement
that you're going to think you misheard
it
south africa which has already gone
through its omicron wave
south africa
just officially
dropped quarantines
for people who who even test positive
you can go to work
tested positive in south africa
it's over it's over
in south africa
and you know we're we're probably three
weeks away from being at a place where
we can make that decision
what would three weeks put us
pretty close to february first
february 1st is actually
i don't know if you realize that that's
a well chosen date
as in feb 1 the the public is done done
with the
the limitations and the quarantines and
stuff
and
i feel like that date is well chosen
don't you
and i feel like we could be helpful we
the public
i believe that we could be helpful
in helping our government just focus
on a time specific because if you don't
focus on a time specific you just don't
ever do anything it's the most
the most well-known management concept
is if you don't have a specific
direction that everybody knows you're
not going to go there yeah everybody has
to know where you're going or you don't
get there so if we're not picking a date
and trying to manage to it
now it's okay if you change the date
if you have reasons
then you just change the new date but
then you're always managing to a date
you know the the government's a terrible
tool for this stuff because if they get
embarrassed once they can't do it that
way again
so if the government ever picks a day
for anything you know like two weeks to
slow the spread
and they become embarrassed by it
they can't do it again
but a corporation is just going to do
what made sense
right they're not going to worry that it
was embarrassing last time either it
either makes sense or it doesn't right
so in a corporation it would get done
um
all right
so sort of a weird uh low news day here
today so we'll talk about a few things
that
uh so south africa is not not doing
quarantines not doing contact tracing
and they're not even doing
uh covet tests for asymptomatic people
why
in other words if you don't have obvious
symptoms
don't even you don't even get a test so
they're not preemptively testing people
just in case
it's over
now for those of you who believe that
we're entering some kind of a permanent
i don't know what authoritarian control
situation
i've always predicted that when it was
over it would be over
it just isn't over yet
in south africa it looks like it's over
and i think they're three three weeks
ahead of us
i think we're in really good shape
really good shape
what about australia you say well
australia will have to deal with the
same omnicron situation
you know if omicron sweeps through
australia they're going to be just like
south africa i would think
so everybody who thought that these
things were permanent i've always
thought that was
just a fear-based opinion
i don't think there's any history of
anything that would suggest this stuff
would be permanent now there may be
permanent elements of policy i suppose
but you're not going to be wearing a
mask forever or you're not going to be
quarantining because you have a virus
so all that stuff's going to go away we
just
don't know the exact date yet
so
edward snowden tweeted
that this christmas may well be the last
that wikileaks founder julian assange
will spend outside the pit of an
american dungeon
how many of you agree with that then so
now that assange is being
what's the legal word whatever he is
he's being
brought to america to face
charges
do you think this is the beginning of
the end of assange
extradition and is it rendition or
expedition
extradition is the word i was looking
for
yes there was actually i did i
i don't know if this is the um
the genetic optimist in me
there's something about this story
that we don't know
well first of all would you agree with
that would you agree with the statement
there's something big about the
julian assange story that the public
doesn't know
right there there's some other variable
here
that's making this hard to understand
from the outside
we might find that out when he gets on
american soil
in other words it might change
incentives and
focus and how people are thinking about
it so we might learn about it but i'm
going to give you a surprising
prediction
i think assange is going to go free
and
i can't give you a reason for it
and i'm aware of that
there's something in my intuition that
is just
it's just kicking me in the brain
that says this is the beginning of a
process in which he ends up free
i don't i'll try to explain maybe why
i'm thinking it but this sounds like a
rationalization even when it comes out
of my mind it may be just that i'm an
optimist and
you know so i tend to lean in that
direction
but
i feel as if when
assange gets to america
what's the best way to say it
when assange was in another country
it felt like that other country's
responsibility
right because he was
literally um you know in the embrace of
a foreign country
so that didn't feel like my problem
so much
even even though it is all of our
problems it didn't feel like it
but when you bring assange onto american
soil
suddenly all of my instincts about what
it is to be american
just gets triggered in a way that him
being in another country didn't because
he's he's from another country and he
was in yet another country it just felt
like somebody else's problem
but you bring it into my house
which is what's happening right
assange is being brought into your house
now
and
in my house the rules are different
do you feel it
if he's in somebody else's house
then maybe somebody else
has some responsibilities and some
rights etc but you bring them into my
house
you're bringing them into my house now
at your house if you're american
if you bring them into my house my rules
apply
right or at least i'm going to try to
make them apply
and my rules say i'm not so sure this
guy needs to be in jail
those are my rules
and i feel like
americans are going to get activated
in a way that they weren't when it was a
foreigner in some other country's prison
there's going to be some activation
going on here there's also going to be a
lot of attention
that wasn't the case before so this
could go from a b story because it was
in another country to an a story very
quickly
now how much do you want to see a trial
do you want to see a trial
you do don't you
what would happen if they uh close the
trial to the public
is that going to happen
feels like it could because you've got
all this secret stuff going on
i feel like the american public
is maybe less willing to listen to
corrupt officials than at any time in
our history
america is kind of fed up
with being told what we must do that is
against our
let's say um our sense of freedom and
our sense of who we are
right
well one of the things about living in
america is it makes you american
it sort of turns you into a creature
same for other countries i'm sure
but part of the american experience is
it it
brainwashes us or persuades us or or
puts us in a frame of mind
and we're in a frame of mind right now
america is definitely in a frame of mind
and that frame of mind is
we don't trust our politicians we don't
trust our experts we don't trust our
intelligence agencies
but we do trust each other a little bit
more than we trust
that the people in charge
and assange
is a special case
because you could certainly make the
argument that what he was doing was for
the benefit of the american public
whether there was some crime involved
that's the question for the courts
but was he acting in what was clearly in
the best interest of the american public
certainly not in the best interest of
the intelligence agencies who presumably
are behind
the tough stance on him
but
you put this guy on trial in america
and he tells his story about what he did
for the american people and for the
people of the world
and
my intuition says
he doesn't he doesn't go to jail at the
end of the process
how do you feel
am i am i being irrational because i i
feel irrational it doesn't feel like
it's a any kind of a
logical opinion
it just feels like you get him in the
american embrace
and our rules start to apply
and that's going to change everything
might not change the final outcome
but it's going to change everything
about how we feel about it
i think
so so let me say that again
once julian assange is in
our house
the our rules apply
and remember your government doesn't own
you
this is america for those of you who are
american i know there are a lot of
people watching from other countries
but
americans we run this country
and if we decide that the legal system
is
not doing what we wanted to do with
julian assange
i feel like the people will have to have
an opinion on this
and the system doesn't want to
go against the people
too far or too long you can't handle
that
all right so we'll keep keep an eye on
that
i see a lot of people say that belief in
science is like a religion
how many of you would agree with that
that faith and science is basically like
a religion i'm hearing this opinion
see some yeses some not at all yeah i
would say it's the opposite
if you do it right if you do it wrong
it's exactly like a religion
here's how to do it wrong
dr fauci told me it's true
is that doing it right
i know that's doing it wrong that would
be like a religion that would be fouchy
is jesus kind of thing
so so if you're doing it wrong yeah it's
exactly like a religion
if you're doing it right the only thing
you would ever trust
is what
what's the only thing you would trust
if you were doing it right
the third randomized controlled trial on
the same topic
maybe not even the first one
second one well you're a little bit you
know reasonably feeling certain
but by the third one you can get some
confidence that maybe the system itself
has taken the bias out
but
certainly if you're not waiting for the
randomized controlled trial
and you're making a positive decision
based on
something less than that
you might be closer to a religion
than you want to be
all right
i saw a good framing here from dr
interracial
who's a real good follow on on twitter
just a google
doctor as in dr period
interracial and you'll get a lot of good
political commentary from that account
so dr interracial it's a couple i
believe an interracial couple
um
said about me he said
you all know that politico did a little
minor hit piece on me as part of a
worst predictions of 2021
so they had me on the list of worst
predictions but of course they
misinterpret the prediction to make it
look bad
now uh dr interracial knows this in the
tweet politico and leftist media is
trying to queue on
scott adams
because they know he's right about
republicans being hunted and need to
make scott look like a crazy conspiracy
theorist
scott is now being haunted
so do you remember i told you that as we
approached the election cycle 2022 and
2024 you could guarantee that i will be
targeted by
the media
and the reason that they would need to
target me is so that from now on
everybody can look at that article and
say oh oh your new opinion is useless
because you once said and then they'll
fill it in with something i never said
but politico reported i said it
so they'll say well politico said he
said it it's right there
but of course it was misinterpreted
like most stories
so
um
watch this develop this won't be the end
of it because there's a weird thing
happening on the republican side if you
were to make a list of all the
sort of uh
unprofessional you know pundit
social media voices in 2016 for trump
how many of the voices for trump
in 2016
still
exist
have not been canceled
or have not become you know more
anti-trump
er the number of people is shrunk and
shrunk and shrunk right now i'm not all
in on trump
for 2024.
he's got to make his case just like
everybody else right i would not
automatically say oh if trump comes back
i'm on the trump train and everything he
does is good nothing like that
i live in a country where it's a
competitive process
and so i'm gonna wait for the
competitive process to play out a little
bit
and if and if
i'll tell you directly if desantis runs
in the primaries
it would be really hard not to pick him
over trump
because you get a lot of the goodness
what the hell
oh
i got a russian
comment i thought it was dollars but
it's red rubles so somebody gave me uh
4690 rubles at first i thought it was a
dollar denominations i was like what the
hell but i'll read your comments since
you gave me that many rubles
thanks for the amazing losers who think
book from russia your perception of
russia's interests are good but our
government and our people often look
differently on the us
best wishes any new projects blah blah
simulation is winking so from russia
interesting he says my perceptions of
russia's interests are good meaning that
russia and the united states i think
this is what it means
that russia and the united states need
to be allies in the long run
it's just inevitable
russia and the united states will be
allies it's just going to happen and you
can put it off as long as you want but
it's just going to happen
so
at least military allies
anyway
so i think
dr interracial is is right i will be
targeted to decrease the number of
voices that could make a difference
um
let me ask you this
if a forget who the republican is a
republican runs for office it could be
trump could be desantis could be tom
cotton whoever it
is who are the influential
key word is influential who are the
influential public voices on social
media
for the next republican
name names
somebody says mike cernovich
but is he gonna support trump
at the moment he says no
glenn beck
uh you know glenn beck seems to stay
within a universe
i i don't see much glenn beck content if
you're not you know watching his content
uh
tucker
jack possabic
dave rubin
yeah dave
dave rubin's he's a special case because
he talks i mean that's his job is to be
in the middle of all that stuff
um larry elder
tim poole's technically uh independent
right dan bongino yeah so there there
are still people on the media so i'm not
talking about people who have a show
all right so it's not so much about
somebody who has i mean a network show
i'm talking about people who might have
a live stream or are on social media
and then all right so who is the most
influential person on the right
right now
it's gotta be talker right
tucker carlson
some people are saying joe rogan but
i think that's unfair for us to classify
him as being on the right
wouldn't you say
because
he's got some opinions that don't map
to the parties that well but does that
mean you can call him on the right
i don't think so
i think he's just following what makes
sense and some people think that puts
him on the right
um candace owens
yes
yeah
but you know candace also has a show
so i i guess i have a show
so
so i guess i'm in the same category but
i see the people who are only doing
their own thing they're not part of any
entity so i'm not part of a larger
entity
anybody who's part of a larger entity is
going to be influenced by their boss
right everybody's getting a paycheck or
at least is getting access to something
uh but i don't get a paycheck
from a person
you mean the only money i would make is
from having a big audience
the babylon b yeah
govfeld yes yeah i mean it's easy to
pick out the fox news stars
and you know the blaze stars and say
that they'll be the most uh effective
but
having but you notice who's missing
right
um
thank you so much i wish i could
pronounce your name i'm getting some
more rubles from russia there
um
yeah so alex jones is
sort of
you know ben shapiro yeah
um
he's a special case too because his
platform
is
at least partly or largely owned by him
yeah rush limbaugh's office
so it's uh there's an interesting
situation everybody's trying to
neutralize the effective voices on the
other side to sort of prime the field
for the actual contest and
you should expect there will be more
fake news about me
so watch for the additional fake news
about me it's coming
um
and so specifically the fake news about
me is this uh
a tweet by bernie belvedere
he says that i did this
which of course i did not
but it's in a tweet
so now lots of people with blue checks
like liked it
so all those blue czech people think i
actually said this
so so he so uh bernie says
that i prophesied
prophesied
that biden would pursue the mass
extermination of republics of
republicans
now do you think that i ever prophesied
that biden would pursue the mass
extermination of republicans
no but nobody ever said that
the the way that you can know that that
never happened is just by reading it
do you
yeah karina is saying how do you manage
that well the way i manage it is i
try to put as much counter factual stuff
into the tweets and comments as i can
but that's all you can do
the truth is that the very next time i
say something smart
in public
the left will say in this and say oh why
should we believe you because you
thought there would be a mass
extermination of republicans
which of course i never said
because that would be dumb
but i did say that republicans would be
hunted
and i did a poll and 80 percent of the
people who answered the poll very
unscientific poll
uh 80 percent of them said that
republicans are indeed being hunted
so
am i right
was i right the republicans are being
hunted 80 of people who answered the
polls said yes
so they see it too
and yet i was on a list of worst
predictions
do you think it would be fair to do a
list of best predictions and put me on
that list
because when i said that
you know you would be hunted or
republicans would be
i figure i think that's one of the best
predictions that was made
so why can't i be on somebody's list of
best predictions for the year
somebody's going to make a best
predictions list
and you better put me on it
if you do that
all right um and then a lot of people
thought that good chance means a high
chance which it doesn't so a lot of
people didn't know what words mean but
they got pretty bad
all right um
here is my newest list which i will make
available to you as i build it and still
work in progress
and it's called how to know you won an
internet debate
so it's a it's a list of items numbered
items
so that when you're in an internet
debate and if anybody triggers one of
these items you can just say ah that's
number four i claim victory
and then you're done
so here are the things
which if you see your
your troll who's arguing with you on the
other side if they do any of these
things
just say ah lesson number two
i win
all right so the title is how to know
you won an internet debate number one
the quote so you're saying
right i these are all ones i got
yesterday so every one of these
literally happened to me yesterday
somebody's saying so you're saying and
then they fill it in with something you
didn't say and nobody would say it would
be ridiculous
so if you see that it says you just say
no there's number one the so you're
saying tell
number two escaping to an irrelevant
analogy
analogies can have a limited use
explaining a new concept
but the way people use them on the
internet
is if they can't defend their point
they will make up an imaginary point
which they call an analogy and they'll
try to get you to argue the imaginary
one that's different
and the reason they do that is that the
actual situation can't be defended so
they have to come up with an imaginary
situation that they'll call an analogy
and say well defend this analogy but
it'll always be different it won't
relate to the original thing
so if they escape to an irrelevant
analogy that's number two number three
changing the argument to something else
um you could call that moving the goal
post but you'll see the people say well
what i really meant was
and then you could just leave because
that's a whole new argument
um
the other one is acting as if a tiny
minority defines the majority
so that would be uh on the right it
would be people saying that the left are
all antifa or the left are all aoc which
of course they're not
but the other way would be imagining
that everybody who protested at the
capitol on january 6 was a criminal
yeah that might be technically criminals
because they were unaware that they were
uh trespassing if you've read the
background a lot of people didn't know
that there was even a perimeter that had
been set they didn't know they were even
trespassing they thought they were
protesting but anyway if you
act as if the tiny minority defines the
majority
just just say oh okay we're done i
didn't realize you were doing a
a number four
number five telling me what i think the
mind reading thing but you think
anybody who tells me what i think
and is wrong
that's the end of the conversation
how about
the one variable thinking where they
talk about the cost of something but not
the benefits
or not the trade-off
if somebody can't mention both the costs
and the benefits
that's a that's a one variable thinking
number six number seven if they turn it
into a personal insult
it's like oh cartoon boy says whatever
just say ah there you go there's number
eight i'm out and number nine word
thinking if they they try to make the
debate about the definition of a word
there's nothing to talk about there
so so just get out
john says you're being anti-semitic oh
as a as one of the tells maybe so
so um
now whenever somebody's doing one of
these things i just i'm just going to be
pasting this into my response
um a similar thing would be
if somebody says that here's another
tell for cognitive dissonance
people who say the vaccination doesn't
work
that's cognitive dissonance
anybody want to fight with me
then anybody who says
the vaccinations don't work with no
explainer to that just the vaccinations
don't work
that is cognitive dissonance
yeah they don't last they don't give you
immunity that's true
but it's not true they don't work
i mean if you want to change the
definition of work to something specific
you can
but
in the normal world where we talk about
things if it makes a difference it works
and nobody a hundred percent of all
a hundred percent
of all data says it makes a difference
we don't know if long term you'll grow a
second head
but we can say that it's doing what it
was meant to do which is keep you from
dying
i mean that's the primary thing it was
meant to do the ultimate thing it's
meant to do is keep you from dying
it would be great if it kept you from
getting infected too but it doesn't so
we have to just deal with that
tom says in all caps it's not a vaccine
that is cognitive dissonance
is anybody else who wants to shout at me
that i'm using the word wrong
because if i'm using the word wrong that
would be number nine
word thinking replacing debate with
definition
if we know that it keeps you from dying
and all the evidence says that all of it
100 of it says that
and every expert would agree that it
keeps you from dying
in the short term maybe long term who
knows
uh why doesn't anyone prove how well
they work
well they have
and a hundred percent of the data
so that's just cognitive dissonance so
there are a lot of people who uh i think
made a public stand the vaccinations
wouldn't work or it would be a
disaster
and you can certainly say that they
don't keep you from
spreading
that's true
unfortunately
but
uh is there anybody else who wants to
say that the vaccines don't work
are you willing to say it in public
define work
well the goal of a vaccine should be to
keep you alive
i'd say that works
in the short term
if you're if you want to argue that we
don't know about the long term
that is true
why would you trust the data i didn't
say i trusted the data i said 100 of it
is in the same direction
uh where do you get your info
everywhere just google it it's i'm
telling you it's 100
if it were 99 i'll tell you where i got
the 99. but i'm telling you you can look
anywhere any search engine any article
there's no article that says the
opposite
that
vaccines do keep you from dying there's
there's no argument about that by any
expert
so by that definition ivermectin is a
vaccine okay that's a stupid argument
because again it's just word thinking
you're not wrong it just doesn't add
anything
you should be skeptical of the experts
i'll message scott later about the j6
pressure campaign
okay
words do matter they do
you're worth thinking too buddy am i
yeah if i said that something uh
if the goal of something is to keep you
alive
and that it does that
is is it irrelevant that i say it works
that that seems like just exactly the
definition everybody uses for that word
if i were using my own like weird
special definition then i would be worth
thinking
but if i use it the way everyone uses it
that's the opposite
you don't know it does that did i say i
know i said 100 of the data says it does
that
you are missing the word vaccine
i
i feel like i'm not getting through
and i don't want to do this with
swearing but sometimes that's the only
times you can make a thing
does everybody understand
that i understand
that they're calling the things vaccines
but everybody understands including the
people using the words that it doesn't
immunize you from getting infected
we wish it had it didn't
but
here's what you don't need to tell me
that they called them vaccines
but they don't do what you expect a
vaccine to do
we all know that
why did you think that telling me that
would be
additive
what do you think is going on
you think i didn't know that the word
vaccine
you know implies very strongly that
it'll keep you from getting something
and that that's not the case
you changed the definition of work
no i didn't
i didn't change the definition of work
there's no other definition it either
does what it was intended to do
keep you alive
or it didn't now as a sub
as a sub task to keeping you alive it
was intended
to keep you from getting infected but it
doesn't how can we not get past that
how are you still living in the past
the past
it mattered
that they said it would immunize you but
it doesn't
but we're not in the past we're now in
the in the present where everybody knows
that fact
you don't need to keep saying it
it doesn't add anything
israel showed that it worked less than
anticipated
yes
we're all not happy
that it's not 100 effect
uh the reduction in death rate is less
than the margin of error somebody says
absolutely not that is
there's not any data that shows that
none
you changed the definition of the now
you're now you're talking
takes 14 days from shot to immunization
all right
yeah next topic
all right
well it turns out that that was my last
topic
how many people have you seen today
telling you about their one experience
and how that one experience should tell
you something
how many people did that today it's all
over the internet today
i had this one experience and so my one
experience should tell you something
no
no
no your one experience doesn't tell me
anything
if it did
we wouldn't need science
so
i i know that we're all we all think the
world
sort of is informed by our own
experience but it really isn't
um
why lower the bar for vaccines i don't
know what that means
ah
rude dude
all right um
aids and the fouchy history
my understanding of the aids
strategy
was to make it seem scarier than it was
for non-gay people
because if you really wanted attention
and funding you had to get the non-gay
public on board
so my understanding is that that was a
well-known intentional strategy to make
it look
riskier to non-gay people than it was
now do we also see the government
scaring us in the same way to try to get
us to do what maybe somebody thinks is a
good idea i'd say so
i'd say so
all right
um
you are the all coveted channel you know
the the problem is that there's nothing
else interesting going on and the
interesting thing about the covent is
why people can't think about it
correctly
it would be one thing if you had a
different opinion
that's fine people have lots of
different opinions
but our inability to think about it
clearly is continually fascinating to me
so so to me um
i'm gonna
i'll delete you for saying all coveted
channel over and over again
let's see if we can get somebody who's
not an npc to make some comments
all right um i have this problem all the
time i use a word that's 90 accurate for
my point everyone knows what i mean
but because it is not 100 the right word
i'm wrong yeah
well just remember that the word
thinkers are not engaging in anything
that's a rational process
and so that's why i came up with the
with the term word thinking
because once you have a word for it then
you can dismiss it more easily
the imprisoned j6 americans
um
i don't feel like like i know enough
about that which is a big enough problem
itself yeah i mean i did spend a lot of
uh yesterday defending the fact that
it's clear that republicans are being
put in jail with
um
in a circumstance that doesn't look
normal to me
it looks it looks like they got hunted
yeah and uh where is rayapps i keep
seeing that question
mail-in ballots
are boring
publish your list in a micro lesson oh
yeah maybe i should
uh the executive order on fentanyl
trafficking i've never seen that
somebody says there's an executive order
on fentanyl trafficking what does the
executive order say
what's i say
oh
okay somebody sent me a
link let's see what that says about
fentanyl
imposing sanctions on foreign persons
involved in the global illicit drug
trade oh december 15th
um so they're going to sanction
people who are involved in it well
how is that different i thought we were
always doing that
authorized to impose sanctions blah blah
anybody engaged in activities
for illicit drugs
so it looks like financial and maybe
trade sections
i don't know is that even
i i guess i'm open to the question of
whether that'll make a difference you
know we told china who their main
dealer was and didn't make any
difference
so as long as china is producing the
precursors and they don't care about
policing themselves
as long as they're sending it to the
cartels and the cartels of course don't
care about policing themselves why would
it make a difference if biden was
sanctioning
people for illicit drugs
like i don't know exactly who
would even be there
who
do you can you sanction the politicians
do you believe anything liz warren says
that's an interesting question
uh let's do it the question is too
absolute
why not go hard on mexico because mexico
doesn't have any control over the
cartels
and the the reality is the cartels
control the government it doesn't work
the other way around
um
if i
well i'm done with that topic
um
did trump ditch rudy i haven't heard
about rudy lately
how do we know the ruble guy is an
estate actor well he probably wouldn't
say he is russian and pay me a tip in
rubles
i think if he were
i mean i don't know that but
he says adam curry and john devorak are
right shark jump let me tell you about
john devorak and adam curry i i talked
to john devorak after hearing what they
said about me and john admitted he
didn't know what i'd said
and and is aware that his comments had
nothing to do with my actual opinions
so you being the idiot that you
are
listened to one podcast without hearing
the other side and came to a decision do
you know why you came to a decision
hearing one side
do you know why you did that
because you're a idiot
that's why
you should have at least
you should have at least
said to yourself
if these people are saying that scott
said something ridiculous
maybe i should check that
because maybe people say people said
things that are ridiculous
and then it turns out they didn't say
that at all
they actually were misinterpreted
so if you really think that i
jumped the shark
which is a sign of that you're an npc
you're a idiot
go listen to it again
and then you tell me one thing that they
said that you think is true
and challenge me on it i'll tell you it
didn't happen
oh kim potter yeah kim partner was uh
racism against white people
so if you watch the kim potter
or if you know about the outcome she's
she's the one who thought she had a
taser but she had her gun and she shot
the guy that she thought she was tasing
now
apparently she could have shot him if
she had intended to shoot him and there
would be no charges
because he was reaching for a weapon
and there was enough reason to believe
he would use it
so
uh
so kim potter
goes to jail
for what was obviously a mistake
now
you can go to jail for making a mistake
you know manslaughter is you know you
should have known better you know
anybody would have known this was a
problem
you know
any realistic
sense of taking care of other people who
would have
made this not a problem right that sort
of thing but when you see what she did
the the sheer
let's say the
it looks like it's stupid
but it wasn't
it looks like um the excitement of the
moment
scrambled her brain
now i'll go further than that it's
obviously that's what happened it's
obvious that the
the emotions of the moment scrambles her
brain
and she didn't have the ability in that
moment to discern
what she was doing
and that's obvious now how she got
convicted
for something that was an obvious error
that ended in the shooting of somebody
who deserved to get shot at that very
moment
somebody says poor training but i don't
think so
i mean it could be
but i don't think you can train somebody
for a specific situation
you can train people for
lots of things
but this was so specific
do you think that they trained people
um well
remember that she said
she's
she was reported to said taser taser
taser
which means that at that moment she
thought she was holding a taser
that would to be that would be the end
of the trial
if you knew that she yelled taser taser
taser then the only thing you know for
sure is that she believed she had that
in her hand because she probably thought
to herself gone gunner taser gunner
taser gunner taser
right
before she pulled her taser don't you
think she was thinking to herself gun or
taser gun or taser gunner taser then she
picked up something that had a handle
and a trigger just like a gun
but also just like a taser
and then yell taser taser taser because
her brain was still in taser but she
picked the wrong thing
so to me that was an obvious case of
white people throwing a white person
under the bus
so they did not look like racists and
didn't have to deal with it so i would
say that there's a good chance it'll be
overturned
because to me i don't think there could
be a more obvious case of
injustice that one was pretty obvious
but the public would not allow a white
cop tissue to black person
who wasn't actually pointing a weapon
right at them so the public can't handle
that so i think the jurors just said
well i'm not going to make this my
problem
the public can't handle this we'll throw
this cop under the bus
so i believe that it was a massive
injustice
and obviously so
but
white people always throw white people
under the bus
to protect themselves
it's the most common thing you'll see
it's the reason i lost two careers
i lost two careers
for being white and male
because the white male people in senior
management
didn't want to look like they were a
bunch of races
so they just stopped
stopped promoting white males for a
while that's when i left twice two
different careers so in both cases it's
white people throwing white people under
the bus so when white people are
discriminated against for race
it's often from white people we're just
saying i'm going to throw this white
person under a bus to protect myself
we do it all the time
not proud of it
all right let's see your comments here
uh what do i predict will happen with
alec baldwin i think probably there will
be uh
private cases against them that might
succeed but i don't think he has a legal
risk
yeah because uh alec baldwin shot a
white person
shooting a white person isn't especially
illegal in this country
if it looked accidental
if it was accidental and he had shot a
black person i think he'd go to jail
if the
if the situation were exactly the same i
think he'd go to jail
um
is jump the shark an example of name
calling or bad analogy well it's
definitely a
a tell for cognitive dissonance if
there's not also an argument
uh what's the most interesting way a
simulation could go in 2022
let's see what's the most interesting
thing well trump running for president
would be pretty interesting uh well
that's 2024.
um the most interesting thing this
simulation could bring us
look what has brought us so far
we can build a house in 12 hours
3d printing
we we may have developed platforms that
can cure cancer because of the pandemic
stuff
we certainly know how to handle the next
pandemic better
right we took the one of the biggest
risks in the public which was a pandemic
and because we actually have it
we're probably in a lot better shape the
next time because nuclear power is
popular again and fusion looks like it's
happening climate change is probably
solved
so this year alone we probably are on
our way to solve climate change housing
employment's good
cancer maybe
near
treatment
for everything
now a trump speaker of the house would
be fun
but i don't think the republicans would
go for that
uh
cure cancer by inducing heart attacks
maybe but i think the the question is
that the platform could be used more
generally that mrna platform if it
doesn't kill us
sounds like a golden age exactly
was jesus a programmer that entered the
simulation
baby
all right that's all i got for now and i
will talk to you all tomorrow maybe
it'll be more news but i doubt it
