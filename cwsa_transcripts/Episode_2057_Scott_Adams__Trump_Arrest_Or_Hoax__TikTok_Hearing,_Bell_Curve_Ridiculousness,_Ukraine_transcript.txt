bum
good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams where all
the controversy and good opinions happen
it's a good thing you hear because
anything can happen today we're going to
be flying even closer to the Sun than
ever before and if you'd like to enjoy
this trip it'll be quite a quite an
experience all you need is a cup or a
mug or a glass of tanker cells or style
the canteen yoga flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine of
the day I think it makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous sip
it happens now go
ah
all right we're going to take locals
private
and uh
so I just saw a story before I uh Came
live here that
there's some talk in the Biden
Administration that although Kamala
Harris is highly qualified
highly qualified
some people in the administration maybe
Biden thinks that she hasn't exactly
risen to the occasion as often as she
should or ever
so I guess the
The Whisper campaign is starting Kamala
she will not last I don't think that's a
good sign for her being vice
presidential candidate
well Rasmussen did a poll on trusting
experts
and uh
half of the uh 50 percent
of likely U.S voters say that the
government handled the the way the
government handled covet
makes them uh less trustful in public
health officials
does that sound right
after watching the pandemic
do you think that does it sound right
that only half of the country is less
trusted
only half
how could it be only half
what what pandemic were they watching
all right well let's
let's see uh
how about the media yeah 53 of people
said they trust the media less
that makes sense but only 53 percent
is that because people already didn't
trust the media completely so there was
no place to to make it worse
all right
um
but let's see if I can pull the smartest
people
who have ever watched
a live stream
uh what percentage of the Bold people
who say the pandemic coverage made them
trust the media more
who became more oh wow you're good yeah
very close 23 23 of the public said you
know
after watching how the media performed
in the pandemic
I trust them a lot more yeah yeah they
nailed it wow I was sitting at home not
knowing what to do and the news just
kept hitting it and hitting it and I
mean they could not have been more
accurate in their reporting
well that's consistent
um well in the news today uh either
Trump was arrested or none of that was
ever real
uh what do you think
how many are going to vote for there was
never going to be an arrest
and how many vote for well there might
be maybe later where they changed their
mind
well thank you I don't think he was
totally hoax
or a prank or a play
my best guess
is that it's delayed while they're
trying to make up their mind
there's probably some infighting so I
would say delayed
but potentially canceled
I don't think it's canceled yet
we probably know but I got a feeling
that the public pressure made a
difference
it feels like it maybe not you know
maybe it's just an ordinary delay things
things get delayed for ordinary reasons
in fact if I had to gas
the most likely explanation for the
delay
would be that
there was just an ordinary problem
you know because everything gets delayed
in what world do things happen on time
never really so the fact that it didn't
happen on time or even that it could be
a week or a month late
that's just like everything else in the
world so I'm not going to say that it
looks like a hoax I'm just going to say
it looks delayed I don't think the
Costello letter makes any difference
honestly
yeah I think people saw the uh the new
document that it came out which was uh
Michael Cohen's own lawyer
uh saying that Michael Cohen said that
it was he painted out of his own pocket
or something but I don't think that's
going to make a difference
because that's still just a claim by a
liar
it doesn't matter it doesn't matter how
many additional claims are made by the
same liar
there's no credibility so it doesn't
matter how many things he says or when
all right
Wall Street Journal reporting on the
Ukraine what do I say before I talk
about Ukraine everything coming out of
Ukraine is undependable and non-credible
so if I say one day it looks like Russia
is winning that doesn't mean anything
because the very next day I might say
well looks like Ukraine is winning just
based on the news we have no idea what's
happening over there you and I have no
idea but
it's interesting to know what the news
is reporting because you can tell who's
you know lying to you or who is bad at
reporting the news
but the latest is that uh surprise
surprise Ukraine is also facing
challenges according to Wall Street
Journal in raising troops
so it looks like it might be a human
attrition problem even more than
equipment
so Russia seems to have an Equipment
Plus
human problem Ukraine has at least a
human problem probably equipment
problems so
it looks like they're just going to
fight until it's too Monty Python
Knights facing each other with no arms
and no legs and then anybody who wants
to can just go push him over
I I feel they just have to punch
themselves out
and unfortunately
it will probably end when there's no
humans left to
shoot stuff
or there's so few that they can the the
weirdest thing about Ukraine is that
they're fighting over this uh city
called bakamut am I saying it right
Bach boot and here's what we know about
it the City was destroyed
and then some people control that and
then some other people controlled it but
it's still destroyed what exactly is the
whole point
of conquering a city that doesn't exist
anymore
is it strategic
I mean the things they're fighting over
are just ridiculous I mean territory
sure but
it's such a ridiculous fight they're
fighting over scraps there weren't
scraps until they were fighting it the
absurdity level is just I suppose war is
always absurd on some level but
this is a pretty high absurdity level
well how many of you saw any of the
clips from The Tick Tock CEO testifying
to Congress
it's the first time I've ever felt good
about Congress
because I have to say
that both the Democrats and the
Republicans
number one they were unified in their
criticisms of of tick tock
good to see that you know when there's a
external threat America can still come
together you kind of Wonder Don't You
you wonder if we could come together
over anything and sure enough
we did second thing I'd like to
compliment the people who participated
in Congress they looked very prepared
did you notice that
I thought everybody came you know loaded
for
the hunt Democrats Republicans I and
honestly I couldn't even tell who was
who I could not tell who was the
Democrat and who was Republican unless I
already knew them they all looked well
prepared
really strong on the issue
seem to know all the details pushed in
exactly the right places and what I saw
was a massacre that CEO just got
massacred in public I mean he did the
best he could
but there wasn't much you could do
because the facts were just not on his
side
and he used the uh well uh thank you uh
representative I'll have my team look
into that I don't know
well is it true that you do X well I I
can't speak to that but I'll research
that and get back to you
do you think that he got back to anybody
with anything
do you think that's going to happen and
why would he really I mean why doesn't
he just promise he'll get back to him
and just not get back to him
I feel like that's what's going to
happen
um
Glenn Greenwald says the government
wants to control Tick Tock because they
can't control it like they can control
the other stuff
maybe it might be part of it that's not
the whole story though
um here's what I saw I thought I thought
of all the people who asked Tick Tock
questions I thought Dan Crenshaw was uh
the standout
because the difference between when Dan
Crenshaw was talking to the CEO of tick
tock versus a lot of the others he was
very clear on the risk not simply being
data security
the real risk is that they can they can
influence American opinions now Crenshaw
did that really well in other words he
understood the big risk
and he put it in context the others less
good at that but they all had good
points so so I'm not sure everybody had
to make the entire case like he did but
they all made individual good points
about problems
um well I I guess I have
this is the one time I can look at a
congressional performance
and say I don't have any complaints
about it
did you have the same experience
like every once in a while you have to
pause
you have to pause and say okay that they
did that well
that was just good solid patriotic
America First stuff now that's not every
member of Congress right so there's
always some crazy person
that the lobbyist got to or something
but uh good job what do you think is
going to happen
do you think Congress will act on it in
a way that is consistent with
no I don't think so
I think they put out a good show
and then they're not gonna
they're not going to do much at all
I suspect that they will not ban it or
they'll
put it to another committee to talk
about it some more
or they'll try to get you know Tick Tock
solution where you know there's some
American control and act like that's
good enough
something like that I I I just uh I
don't have confidence
that they can execute
I do have confidence that they ask the
right questions so they're good at you
know showboating in front of the public
they did that pretty well
um
I'm still seeing people say in response
to the tick tock thing you see it on
social media people are still saying
what's the problem Tick Tock is
gathering information but that's what
they all do
have you seen that
how could you be more confused about
what's the problem
yeah
somebody said what's the difference
between Facebook and Tick Tock what's
the difference they both collect all
your data
and
I think the fact that China owns one of
them
seems like how could you miss that
important part
yeah it's almost like a willful
ignorance like I don't want to know the
argument against Tick Tock because I
really like tick tock
all right and and then the other bad
argument is that uh small businesses
depend on tick tock
all of those functions would just move
over to somewhere else like Instagram or
SnapChat or something so it's not like
it goes away they would just use they
would just move their spending dollars
from a Chinese company to an American
company
I mean I can't imagine it would be that
different in the short run it might be a
little different
but in the long run not so much
um
and that I saw a semi-defense of tick
tock if you could call it that on CNN
now to their credit CNN seems to be
covering the risk of tick tock
accurately
so I'm gonna I'm gonna give CNN a little
credit too they are treating Tick-Tock
like a danger
so good for them they're not they're not
just automatically taking the opposite
position of Fox News so I'm happy about
that but they did let a an opinion
person go on to say that there's no
evidence whatsoever
that China has done anything bad
regarding tick tock
just so so really your concerns about
Tick Tock are really
they're about future problems
don't you understand that
there's no evidence that China has done
something bad you're really you're just
worrying about non-proven
potential speculative future problems
is that the dumbest argument you've ever
heard
the entire argument about climate change
is not about what's happening today
it's not about today
it's never about today
it's always about if you don't take care
of something something worse will happen
in the future how do people say that in
public
act like you can discount the obvious
danger for tomorrow because it hasn't
happened today we see exactly the same
thing with the election Integrity stuff
when somebody says there's no evidence
that anything was rigged I say
uh are you saying it can't happen next
time well there's no evidence that
happened last time uh did you look
everywhere that you could look well we
didn't find anything but did you look
everywhere you could have looked
well we didn't find any no but did you
look everywhere you could have looked
can you actually audit everything that
happens
Scott how many times do I have to tell
you
you extreme Mega people
there was nothing found
is that that's how the conversation goes
right
it's always
let me make a very extreme Point that's
off
that's off the topic a little bit
that's all we see anyway
uh we'll see if tick tock
gets uh
gets bantered on take a your guess is
not right that's also my guess my guess
is it won't be banned
because I don't think they can execute
all right uh well as I tweet by Eugene
Scott I think he writes for axios
he was talking about there are three
members of Congress
who were sort of you know unavailable at
the time and he reported it this way
said uh Mitch McConnell he was
undergoing therapy after a fall
there's John fetterman who is being
treated for depression
and there's Dianne Feinstein who is has
battled shingles has battled shingles
so
McConnell undergoing therapy for fall
Federal been treated for depression and
Feinstein battling shingles I'm
wondering if those are euphemisms
so from Mitch McConnell is undergoing
therapy after a fall
and that sounds a little bit like he
rolled on his back
and because shell he can't get up and
nobody's helping him does it sound like
that a little bit
yeah maybe he just accidentally rolled
on his back
and John fetterman is being treated for
depression
uh
which might mean he's
already reincarnated
already reincarnated
I don't know
it just has that feel about it and then
where they said where the Tweet says
that Feinstein battled shingles I
thought to myself battle jingles
if you have shingles usually you say you
have shingles
she had shingles she's recovering but
battling shingles that sounds like a
euphemism for the cat is on the roof
where the shingles are where the
shingles are
so yeah I think it's uh Mitch McConnell
rolled on his back can't get up
fetterman has already reincarnated and
Dianne Feinstein she's she's the cat on
the roof so that's how you read between
the lines
so you can't just read the headlines the
way they're written you have to read
between the lines that's how you know
what's happening
all right uh
here's my favorite uh story of racist
being uh people complaining about racism
being racist so you have to see this
video that's going around today
apparently uh Michael Knowles you might
know him from daily wire
um is going to give a speech it was
giving a speech at uh Purdue University
and there was a very large protest
in which they were uh
chanting uh F off Nazis or Nazi so they
were suggesting that Michael Knowles is
sort of a Nazi
um based on the fact that he likes uh
talking about his opinions
so that's that's enough to get you
labeled of Nazi in America
so you should see you should see how big
the protest was like the hallways were
just lined with people and well you know
well you're calling you a small protest
I would say on by college standards it
would be a biggish biggish and then I
looked at the video
and there wasn't a single black person
in the protest
looked like there might have been some
Asian Americans there a few but
basically it was the biggest Gathering
of white people I've ever seen in
America
I can't think of another gathering of
that many white people I've ever seen in
one place
you know even that even a trump rally
has more black people in it that was the
widest bunch of people who ever argued
Against Racism
because I've Got a Feeling maybe they
should have taken a little look in the
mirror because they seem to have all
self-selected the whitest place on Earth
huh
so maybe they should fix their own
diversity problem before they
complain about Michael Knowles Maybe
just say it
well
um before I talk about the minority
leader for the uh for the house
um how many people in ordinary America
would even be able to identify Hakeem
Jeffries
how well known is he
outside of people who talk about
politics all the time
yeah who
so for those of you who don't know who
he is
I'd like to give you just a brief
overview just to summarize them a little
bit so that you can understand who he is
imagine if you were
if you started with uh Obama imagine
Obama
and think of all the good things about
Obama now I know this is a political
group so you're going to be like I don't
like his policies blah blah but forget
about that for a moment forget about the
things you don't like about Obama
but just think of some of the things you
do like some of his best political
qualities the fact that he could get
elected in a federal race with an
unprecedented number of white votes it'd
be very impressive as a politician so if
you imagine all the best parts of Obama
and then imagine somebody who doesn't
have any of those
just none of them
and that would be Hakeem Jeffries
so that's the best way to understand him
is everything good about Obama he
somehow doesn't have not any of those
things
so he only wants to show us that we're
racist no matter what we do
and he's decided that uh that
people who want school choice
are really extreme Mega Republicans who
don't want the Children of America to
learn about the Holocaust
yeah yeah that's what school choice is
about
according to the person who has none of
the good qualities of Obama
school choice is about extreme Mega
Republicans not wanting America to learn
about the Holocaust
that is the dumbest
that's just the dumbest thing anybody
ever said
like at what point can you start saying
well this isn't about politics
is that about politics or is that just
like one guy being so dumb
that you can't even believe it
like that's his that's his argument
amazing
um
secondly may I point out that the only
reason that he's rallying against these
what he calls these extreme Mega
Republicans is because they're white
can we can we be honest you wouldn't be
saying it if they weren't mostly White
is basically just a racist statement
from a racist who is pretending to be
the anti-racist by being super racist
right that's everything that that Obama
didn't do
yeah I always say Obama was so smart
because he ran for president as not
necessarily a black guy just somebody
who had some good ideas
that's the smartest thing you ever did
now it didn't work out because the
country became more divided
but that part certainly played right
and I've always appreciated that about
his approach
so the hypocrisy is screaming in
hilarious today
um
and I guess if we're gonna if we were to
embrace and amplify the fact that the
Democrats only have one note
it's like uh so what do you think about
the banking situation racist
what do you think about Ukraine you're
racist
what do you I mean I only have that one
thing
that's all they have but you would think
that with all of that they would have
noticed that the number one biggest
racist thing the country is doing is
When anybody like jump in what's the
number one biggest racist thing
that the United States is engaged in
right now
uh Public Schools CRT
close yeah those are racist ESG CRT
those are all racist things dies races
teachers unions no you're not even close
reparations no those are all small
things
they're all small I mean they're very
important
but they're small compared to what I'm
going to mention
climate change
climate change
climate change is Dollar Wise and in
terms of number of people that would be
impacted
is enormous compared to all these things
and if you fight climate change the way
the Democrats would like to
it will hold back
third world countries from developing
the way we have in other words they
won't be able to have 200 years of you
know coal development
so and mostly those are non-white
populations how in the world is the
single biggest racist thing that's ever
happened in the history of the world
that's not even the topic
it's the biggest racist event in the
world of all time it's bigger than uh
slavery
it's bigger than slavery not worse you
know if you're looking at how any
individual is being treated slavery is
much worse but if you look at the
overall impact on non-white people
it's the worst that's ever happened and
I'm not talking about the climate change
I'm talking the response to it the
response to it is what would any
population that has not yet fully
developed
so how would the world do the
Republicans let the Democrats get away
with being the major part of the biggest
racist
economic move of all time by a factor of
a thousand we're not talking about
things that are in the same neighborhood
right like even as horrible as let's say
the public school systems are and all
that there is nowhere near the scale
of what the entire climate changing the
economy and banning carbon fuels and
stuff like that
now that's just and that's just caring
about people in other countries
because we're supposed to care about
them right if they're humans we should
care about them but if you just said oh
I'm America first
well don't you think that the the uh the
low income part of America is suffering
more than the high income part because
of our energy policies
if Trump were president gas would be
cheap
and I'm pretty sure black people buy gas
I mean how in the world are we ignoring
the only thing that is massively
massively racist massively racist
and that's the one thing they ignore
in fact they're telling the story that
not doing it would be racist
ridiculous the most ridiculous racist
thing of all time so you can tell that
they're not as serious in any way about
racism it's just they have this one note
and the only time they don't use it was
when it's super true
super true
that's more than regular show
well
um let's see what else is crazy
speaking about affirmative action
uh Vivek ramaswambi who's tweeting this
he says there's a reason why I'm the
only candidate willing to talk about
ending affirmative action
um
and that uh
Trump's team he's indicating that
Trump's people at some point said it was
not a political Hill they wanted to die
on and then ramaswamy says you could
drag my dead body out of the white house
before I finished taking on this issue
well to be fair
The Wider you are the less you can take
on this issue
I mean if we're being honest for
political reasons it was hard to be
Trump supporters and take this on but
Vivek can do it
yeah Vivid can do it and he has you know
at least the the cover of not being the
whitest guy in the race
so
um
and again he's picking up the free money
from the Republican side and I think
that his argument has legs
um on the left if he plays it right
which he probably does yeah we're
private
all right remember I was telling you I
was trying to come up with a a funny
alternative to what the letters ESG mean
because people don't know what it means
in reality
but they're sure they like it
you know it means environmental social
and governance so basically it means uh
green Fuel
and more diversity running companies
so
Vivek has come up with a new meeting for
ESG
export Sophia gas
how do you like that export Sofia gas
the argument would be that on the
environmental side if we restrict our
our own energy all we're doing is
increasing the energy that Russia can
sell now that's just true
right
I mean it's not the only the only
variable in the argument but it's
completely true the ESG means export
more Soviet gas
that's literally true so
I'm going to endorse that export Soviet
gas
that that works it doesn't cover the you
know the social and governance part of
it
but it but I don't know that you should
I think if you just pick out the
stupidest part of it maybe that's the
best way to attack it so I think he's
making a lot of smart attacks
all right
um
how many of you would like to see me
talk about the so-called the bell curve
setting anybody up for trouble
please no
well then I'm going to talk about the
bell curve
in the 90s there was a book called the
bell curve
in which there there were let's say two
major themes that people got out of it
now when I say what people got out of it
that doesn't mean that the authors put
it into it it means that's how it was
interpreted okay so the author said uh
looked at research and said IQ is
definitely and strongly correlated with
success
is anybody surprised
is anybody surprised that IQ is highly
correlated with making money and being
successful no so that part of it was
probably not surprising at all the
second part of it is where all the
trouble happened
where they measure the differences by
ethnicities by race
now they did not say that there's some
genetic reason for it they were silent
on why the difference in other words it
could be that they measured it wrong it
could be you know it's environmental it
could be you know poverty related
something like that could be more lead
in the could be more lead in the paint
in some areas and other places
so they were sort of Silent on it but
a reasonable reading of the book would
suggest
that they wouldn't have mentioned that
unless they thought it was sort of
important
and so to interpret it people thought oh
uh some people said
I think we found out why there's a
difference in performance among the
races because they would say it's in
this book this book says IQ is related
different races have different IQs there
it is we've explained everything away
here is my debunking of that point of
view
I'm going to use myself as an example
and a hypothetical might be true I don't
know but it's hypothetical doesn't
matter if it's true I'm just using it as
an example
suppose I found out
that my group of white people had lower
IQ on average than Vietnamese Americans
I don't know if that's true I have no
idea if it's true or not but let's say
it was true
let's say that and there was a big
difference like 10 15 points
so what do I do when I wake up
how do I act differently now that I know
that in my example if I know that
Vietnamese Americans had to hire
academic performance
and higher IQs what would I do about it
would I would I give up because I can't
do as well as I can do I don't think I
would
I think all I would do is incorporate it
into my
strategy
and I'd say oh well you might be able to
beat me on a test but maybe I could
outwork you well good luck with that
and maybe maybe I can form a strategy by
putting together let's say a talent
stack
that my combined skills maybe none of
them are as good as the person I'm
competing against but when I combine
them I'm a more more capable full
package
I'll just adjust my strategy
for the fact that somebody can beat me
as something on average now of course I
would know
that if I were applying for a job and
there were another
Vietnamese American
applying for the same job would I say to
myself no I'll never get that job
because of the average
no of course not
uh I would apply for the job because the
average doesn't tell me that that person
is smarter than me
it doesn't tell me anything about that
one situation so if you ask yourself how
would you use the information
it turns out there's no way to use it
all you would do is do the things you
should have been doing anyway
you should have been
having your maximum strategy doing
whatever is the best thing you can do
independent of what anybody else is
doing
or what would you what would the law do
well would the government do differently
if it found out that I had a lower if I
were a member of a group there's nothing
to do with me but I'm a member of a
group with lower IQ than some other
group what what does my government do
or nothing I hope
I would hope they do nothing
because if you help all of the
individuals in all of the groups do the
best they can you get the best outcome
it's very clear that helping everybody
who needs help
gets you a good outcome but what would
you do if you found some like average
difference
there's nothing you can do with it
except
be a freaking racist
the only thing you can do with that
information about differences in IQs
because it's an average
if it spoke to every single person in
the group
well then you could be a racist and use
it for some useful purpose but as long
as it doesn't tell you anything about an
individual and everything you and I do
is with individuals we're not going to
do anything differently
we're still going to judge people
individually and the reason you would
judge people individually is that it's
for your benefit
it's not that you're such an open-minded
great person if you didn't trust people
if you didn't treat individuals
individually you would miss out
on some vast number of people who have
you know a lot to contribute
so you'd be hurting yourself to take a
strategy of assuming you know where
somebody is by an average
by an average and suppose you're suppose
you're white
and oh let's say let's say you're a
Vietnamese American
I suppose you're Vietnamese American you
found out that your group had on average
higher IQ than another group
uh do you feel good about yourself
well if you did
why
why
you're not the average you can feel good
about yourself if you individually were
smarter than most people
maybe you could feel good about that
but if you're not if you're not the
smartest person in your group why do you
get credit for the fact that somebody
else is
how do I get credit
for the fact that Einstein was smart
I'm not even related how do I get credit
for that
what because he's you know
he's white too
so the whole idea that the average of
anything is something you can use is
ridiculous
now let me give you one good way you
could use it I think
let's say if you found one ethnic group
had
higher or lower IQ
it might be a flag that there's
something they're doing environmentally
that's different
that's possibility so I'd look at for
example
one of the issues that I agree with with
black lives matter
is about a nutritional equality
nutritional equality that might be one
place where Equity makes more sense than
equality
because it shouldn't be equality of you
know potentially having good food it
should be do we all have a decent diet
like that that is one area where
Equity makes a lot more sense than in
other areas
so how much does uh nutrition
contribute to
um IQ I don't know it but it could be a
lot it could be a lot so if you found
out for example that one group
uh had a difference either higher than
lower than the average the first thing
I'd ask is what do they eat
what do they eat
because if it turned out that let's say
this is just ridiculous speculation but
suppose it turned out that Rice was
really way better for you than you
thought
and you say Well everybody's rice but
I'd say well not as much
you know Asian Americans probably
probably I've never studied it but I'm
guessing might eat more rice
what if it turns out that Rice was
really good for your brain I'm not
saying it is I'm just speculating that
would be the only good use
for knowing that there was any kind of
ethnic difference in IQ otherwise
there's nothing you can do with it
because it doesn't speak to a person
if it doesn't speak to individuals it
doesn't work in our system our system is
about
or should be maximizing individual
happiness not not group average
that would be the dumbest way to manage
a country is to is to try to get the
group average up of any group
makes no sense at all
uh
a troll asked me are Jewish people
Superior Scott
did you listen to anything I just
 said
did you listen to anything I just said
as soon as you say the average of any
group
and compared to the average of any group
you're an idiot
you're just a idiot you're
looking for trouble
the only thing that's good for is being
a troublemaker right
yeah what was that question for other
than to demonstrate your obviously
anti-semitic was there anything else
that that question could possibly do
that makes the world a better place no
no every time you say the average of
this group to the advocacy of the group
you're just being stupid or racist
right now if what you're arguing is
let's say four or against affirmative
action
I mean that's that's a separate argument
and I've been in favor of affirmative
action historically but I think it's
time to re-look at it and so I agree
with uh Vivek that it's a it's a good
time to be having the
the conversation about pivoting
because it might be creating more
problems than it's solving right now
if we fixed I think if we fixed uh
education
then it would be much less important to
have
um
any kind of affirmative action because
every there's such a shortage of skilled
workers and it looks like that will
continue that I would imagine business
would hire everybody they could of any
type if they demonstrated you know the
skills required for the job so I think
that training would eliminate
affirmative action has even it wouldn't
even make sense you wouldn't even think
about it
um David said you can't fix education
for a low IQ David
I don't believe you heard anything I
just said
low IQ is an average
most people are just ordinary
there are very few people who excel at
anything
right so
I'm not talking about fixing IQ with
education I'm talking about taking every
individual and making them the best
version of themselves do you disagree
that education
helps people become better versions of
themselves if you do it right is there
any argument on that
like I mean I I think some people are so
wed to their racism that you just can't
release on this even though all the all
of the logic says it's useless
all of the logic says it's a good way to
tag yourself as a racist and then you're
done
all right so let me tell you how to tag
yourself as a racist who doesn't have
any good ideas about the world
oh that bell curve is telling us what we
need to do end the story
it is a useless bit of information
that it just causes trouble
it's not good for any individual except
in that weird case where it might tell
you to look at environmental factors but
that's about it
all right
yeah it's a red herring
facts exists for a reason all right is
there anybody else who let's say if I've
made a dent in this audience because I
know this is a hard one if you believe
that this was your main
and I would say a lot of racists believe
this if your main filter on life is IQ
difference and you're like I'm done I'm
done you know once you've said that it's
everything you need to say
what are you going to do with it
like what policy do you change because
of that
wouldn't you still treat everybody as a
human being who you'd like to give the
best opportunity for them
it just doesn't make any sense to divide
people and then do that average and
think you know something about how to
run things it doesn't tell you that
it just doesn't give you that
information
it's a useless concept that your common
sense
food which is always flaky you know your
common sense is what
drives you in the wrong direction every
time
the reason that we have statistics is
that your common sense gives you the
wrong answer do you know that there
would be no point in having the the
field of Statistics if your common sense
could give you the same answer
the fact that it doesn't
is why you need the statistics
all right
um there's a higher odds of smart people
among higher IQ groups right now do
something with that
so so there's the comment if there if a
group has a higher IQ and average would
it be true that there's a greater chance
that a person in that group has a higher
IQ
what are you going to do with that
what are you going to do with that
suppose it's true
how are you going to act differently
it's still everything depends on the
individual the person who walks into
your office for a job isn't an average
that doesn't tell you anything about
them now if you say Well it tells me the
odds no it doesn't
no it doesn't
that person is still
entirely individual person they are not
influenced by the odds
only your mind is influenced by it not
the person the person is just the person
um
thank you clown man
all right I feel like I've introduced
enough doubt let me let me say this if
you're mentioning IQ in a conversation
about race you're just not being a
serious person
and and your claim that it's a fact
can be true it can be true that it's a
fact but if you can't connect it to what
you would do about it or how you would
treat the next person that walks in the
door
yeah I say now Jay boss all right Jay
boss is calling me a coward I believe
I I believe I'm being a coward called a
coward for not speaking
um frankly about race
uh are you new here
I paid in advance
right the the thing that you think that
I don't want to pay the price you think
I don't want to pay I paid in advance
that's how willing I am to pay the price
I paid in advance for this conversation
and any other conversation I have on
Race I already paid
yeah are you a coward are you afraid to
speak to to to make a point on this
because you should be a coward
because you don't have a useful argument
if I were you I'd be afraid to speak in
public if that's the best I could do
is like oh you're afraid you're a coward
I'm gonna I'll get it by the way I've
updated the NPC spotting list
this is sort of a running list I like to
keep if you're looking for who's like a
serious person versus who's just a
non-player character
um so so my list is getting pretty long
of things that the NPCs say look for
these words to identify an NPC you're an
apologist you fem sitter racist
why do you keep obsessing over
keep digging
oh you're walking it back now
flip-flopper
oh you must be afraid of or calling you
a coward you must be afraid of it was
actually on my list of NPC sputters uh
you think
that's the mind-reading one you think
all goldfish can fly
that's the crazy one
I saw it on the video there's no way
there's no other way to I saw the video
Don't tell me it didn't happen don't
tell me you can interpret it differently
don't tell me there's other contacts I
saw the video I saw the video I saw the
video
NBC
um
you said all of the people in that group
when nobody ever means all of the people
in that group
that's an NPC how about you're only
doing this for clicks
said to somebody whose business depends
on online traffic
you're only doing it for clicks educate
yourself there's a good one and and I
like this one this ain't it chief
this ain't no chief
um why don't you just blow him you love
him so much that's that's a fan favorite
and by one that I just added today no
one is above the law
if you ever find yourself saying in a
conversation no one is above the law the
one thing that everybody agrees on with
no with no disagreement
yeah if that's the best you can do no
one is above the law you're not a player
you might be a non-player character
just saying
all right now
let me ask you this because I like to
check in with you everyone now and then
um
did my discussion of the uh
would you call it the bell curve did my
bell curve discussion
add anything to the conversation
I'm not saying you have to agree with
that I'm saying did it did it deep in
the conversation
now I'm going to really have to talk to
somebody individually
I'm going to have to talk to somebody
individually to see what the pushback is
on that
I got a lot of yeses but a lot of no's
as well what would be the counter
argument
oh here okay here's the counter argument
from Craig
who says the uh he paid for this so uh
the average snake is non-venomous if you
tell your child to assume all snakes in
the woods are venomous you could be
robbing them of a wonderful reptilian
encounter
so so the the idea here would be that
you could act on the average
which I would agree with if you're
talking about physical Danger
I would agree that you could act on the
averages to say all right if I'm going
into an area with uh lots of poverty
probably more crime
would you agree that would be reasonable
if you're going into a low-income high
density area
and that's the only thing you know about
it it's it's a real low income and it's
high density
would you tell your child to go there or
would you say you might be okay but it
looks like it's dangerous
no you could say it's dangerous
so there are definitely lots of logical
times you can use the average
if you were a black American and you
wanted to avoid White supremacists
would you think that there would be more
white supremacists among a population of
white people
or a population of black people who
would have the most White supremacists
yeah so you using using statistics to
avoid populations
is not crazy
there's nothing crazy about that you're
using statistics to treat an individual
difference different would be
inappropriate now is that why the other
people were disagreeing with me
because I wasn't talking about physical
safety when it comes to physical safety
you can ignore everything
physical safety is just about statistics
so you can ignore all the niceties you
can ignore polite Behavior you can
ignore looking good to other people you
can ignore all of that when it comes to
physical safety it'd be stupid
to not pay attention to the statistics
when it comes to physical safety but if
you're meeting one person
you know somebody walks into your office
wearing a suit
If somebody walks into your office
wearing a suit
you get to say I think I'll judge them
by the average
who would do that
no the suit should give you the
statistics you need somebody somebody
can get a suit put on a suit tie their
neckties show up on time for you know a
lot that tells you a lot about the
person
based on statistics right most people
who could put on a suit and show up on
time for an interview
are at least in the top 50 percent of
competent human beings you know that
automatically puts them in the top half
they get to work to get in the top you
know 10 but walking in the door you're
in the top half yeah everything we do is
based on statistics in terms of that
sort of stuff
all right
so uh
yeah the good scammers would still wear
a suit that's why I decided to put you
in the top 50 percent
it doesn't tell you more than that
um
to go with the average and snakes you're
selling them up from uh and venomo what
is it
Mensa people are not the richest
that's true
yeah I you know when I was in Mensa I
hosted some events at my place
and it was the least successful group of
people
who had the highest IQs
now part of it was they were the ones
available to go to meetings to talk
about how they're smart
it was actually a filtering thing the
people who are smart know they're smart
and have used their smartness to you
know build companies and succeed they
didn't need to go to a meeting of people
who needed to
to you know basically reassure each
other that they're smart
if you've actually done something
successful you're going to say
that's all I need if you haven't done
something successful but you score well
on IQ tests you get together with other
people in that same situation
so you can remind yourself you're the
Smart Ones who for some reason didn't
succeed
yeah
the the moment my life started going
well you know I started succeeding I
immediately gave up going to Mensa
meetings
because I I actually was there to find
out if I was wrong
that I was smart
I actually didn't know I was trying to
find out
so it was part of that part of a
personal Journey you could say
all right
um ladies and gentlemen that's all for
YouTube I will see you tomorrow and I'm
going to talk to the locals people
privately
and
glad you came
