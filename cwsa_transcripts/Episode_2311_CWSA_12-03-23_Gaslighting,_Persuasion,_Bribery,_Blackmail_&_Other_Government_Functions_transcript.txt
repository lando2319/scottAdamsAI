good morning everybody and you're
probably thinking to yourself you don't
know if you should colonize or Gaslight
should I colonize should I Gaslight well
those questions will be answered and
many more but if you'd like to take your
experience up to levels where
gaslighters can't even get you all you
need is a copper muger glass a tanker
chells or a Cen juger flask a vess of
any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like
coffee so join me now in the unparallel
pleasure the dope me the other day the
thing that makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous Sip and it
happens now savor
it
yeah well there's some shocking news you
heard about the big Tesla cyber truck
roll out big event but there's some news
that there was some crazy guy who was
planning a mass casualty attack on the
event it didn't happen he got picked up
by the fuzz so to speak uh they caught
him so he did not do any any anything
like that but I would like you to
imagine for a
moment what could have been the coolest
thing that ever happened it didn't
happen this did not happen
but it could
have imagine imagine this Mass shooter
showing up at the Tesla truck roll out
you Bunch the whole bunch of trucks
because it's a roll out so you're not
going to have one right you have lots of
lots of Tesla trucks and lots of
people and suddenly somebody yells
gun and everybody immediately jumps
inside a Tesla
truck and the gunman starts opening
fire and then finally you know law
enforcement takes him
down everybody
lives there's just like bullet holes in
all the cars but but every all the
trucks but everybody got in they
lived best marketing campaign of all
time but instead they just caught him
before he shot any any bullets or did
anything so that was good too that was
good too better
600 people jumping
into cyber trucks and being totally safe
from gunfire would have been better
would have been
better uh by the way I I heard a little
clip of uh Elan musk when he was
introducing the Cyber truck and he he
had this great line he said uh if you're
in the Cyber truck and you ever get in
an argument with another vehicle you
will win
if you get in an argument with another
vehicle you will
win perfect that's just like a perfect
uh line all right let's talk about
George
Santos uh as you know he's going to be
expelled voted to be expelled by his
former colleagues from Congress but now
he says he's going to drop the dime on
four of his colleagues for ethics
complaints and he's got he's got charges
and he's got accusations he's got
allocations I don't know if any of them
are good but he's going scorched Earth
and uh that's fun but the thing that
caught my attention was he was referred
to in the New York Post in the opening
line to the story as a disgraced serial
liar disgraced serial
liar I feel like I want to form a
club well everybody was disgraced cuz
you know I'm a disgraced cartoonist
and you know I didn't really care too
much about the George S Santos Story one
way or another frankly I just wasn't
interested in it but now that I know
he's a he's a fellow disgraced uh person
I feel like we should have some kind of
a club or you know informal organization
a party a Christmas party perhaps
wouldn't you love to see me have a host
a Christmas party of everyone who was
disgraced during 2023
like the class of
2023 all the people got canceled in
disgraced would be a big
party well V
ramaswami uh said this in a post he said
I want I went to a racially diverse
public schools to Public Schools until
8th grade I've never met a single black
kid who couldn't achieve everything I
have if he had the same true quote
privilege that I enjoyed not being born
into money by having a stable family
with two parents who emphasized
education that's the answer to Black
empowerment in America not affirmative
action
okay
um but as one uh one Observer who calls
himself free speech is expensive on the
xplatform had this to say uh that that
is the ideal situation I think we'd all
agree don't you think that would be
ideal to have
two parents who are really strong about
education and you know may whether the
whether they had money or not they were
just really strong about education and
probably character and that sort of
thing yeah that would be ideal how many
people can get that
situation in a perfect
world well as uh free speech is
expensive says uh this is the ideal
situation if you assume 50% odds for
having a good versus a bad parent for
any one parent you have about 50% odds
but you have two parents so to get both
of them to be you know capable
pro-education
parents uh the odds are
25% that's just you know 50% time
50% um what system works for the other
75% now that has always been the
question um I think V is 100%
right you know everything he said I
agree
with
um
but he didn't have any control over that
so V had no control over his parents who
he just got lucky did his parents have
control over it well I don't know a
little bit well I I think they had less
control than maybe you think because
what were the odds that you know they
they both had the same uh let's say
philosophy they had the same philosophy
of you know Pro
education and they met each other and
they got along and they had a child
that's a lot of things to go right and
I'm not sure they controlled all those
things they might have gotten lucky you
know they may have fallen in love and
wow good luck how lucky I am I that my
my mate has the same philosophy and
parenting so there's all lot of luck
involved right you you'd prefer a system
where the luck is removed and the system
itself can give you wins that that's the
trouble with the trouble with the
parenting
situation is that you can't choose them
and it's not a manageable process you
know you you can hope for it and you
could advise people what to do but you
really just is wishful
thinking and um unfortunately way if you
ever introduced a an
alternative it would be politically
impossible because if what you're trying
to sell as Republicans is the the family
unit because the family unit works so
well if it's done right you know if you
got a little religious stuff you got
attention to education as V says um
that's that's your ideal
situation but it's just not achievable
by probably at least half of the public
so what about the other half do do we
just ignore them because the thing we
want them to do is unavailable to them
and then you just let them die like I
feel like we could do better and here's
what I
suggest I think we absolutely need to
start forming
nonfamily uh support structures
non-government non-government that's the
important part nothing about about the
government but you know individually
privately finding ways to support each
other for example let's say you were two
parents who never went to college and
you had a vague idea that college is
good but you're not really the ones to
sell it but suppose you had in your
social network people who are there all
the time who were very Pro colge and
could sell it to your own children
better than you could I mean it could be
an uncle could you know could be as a
family member could be a cousin but just
somebody in your extended family who
could sell sell to your children what
you're not good at selling because not
everybody's good at everything so you
need an extended structure just to cover
all your um your your um black holes all
the things that you can't do
yourself so I think that that's what's
coming um just take the most the the
simplest example
Child Care Child Care is this big
nightmare because it's just so hard if
you're lowincome how do you afford child
care and also go to a job you can't do
both too expensive but suppose you had a
network of people and some of them were
like well you know what you always mow
my lawn and I like kids and I'm you know
I'm retired how about how about I let
the kids come over to my house while
you're working right so you could
imagine an informal I don't want to say
tribe cuz then I think you get other
other implications but I think it's some
kind of voluntary virtual tribal
situation would be what you'd
get so I think that's where it's going
to end up yeah I don't want to say
Clan that's kind of bad connotation but
I know what you're saying all right so I
think there's a something the
Republicans are missing and it's really
big because I think the Democrats are
saying that the traditional family unit
just doesn't work for enough people it's
ideal it just doesn't work for enough
people so they look to the
government so now so now Republicans are
offering an impractical
solution uh an your option we don't want
the government to help you too much
either that's not really much of a
offer a good offer would be we're really
really going to sell this family thing
hard but if that isn't working for you
we suggest that you self-organize in
ways you can support each
other some version of that I don't know
I don't know what it looks like but it
it's not addressed
anyway uh Wall Street Journal reports uh
and I quote the US companies have lost
momentum in promoting black
professionals into
management huh I wonder if there's an
alternative way that headline could have
expressed that that would be equally
true
I'll take a stab at it instead of saying
us companies have lost momentum in
promoting black professionals the
management would that be identical
to um anti-white racism has
peaked are those the
same because because what is it that was
promoting you know
black uh applicants into upper
management if you were working hard on
it
who who is not being promoted to because
it's you know it's not like they created
more jobs just so they could promote
black applicants same number of jobs who
who was not being promoted while while
there were a higher percentage of black
people being
promoted I don't know looks like a good
sign to me I would say the healthiest
thing for black professionals and black
Americans is that we become honest and
practical about what works and what
doesn't everybody is better off in a
system that's
honest if you do these things go to
college stay out a jail don't do drugs
you'll probably do fine that's
honest if if they tell you that the
reason you're being held back is
systemic
racism well there is systemic racism I
very much agree that it exists but it's
not what's holding you
back right systemic racism has held back
literally zero
people because there's such an easy
workaround do you know what the work
around is to systemic
racism it's not really hard look around
you the people around you are largely
terribly incompetent whoever they are
doesn't matter you know forget their
race
gender uh ethnicity the people around
you are largely incompetent
how hard is it to stand out when your
competition is largely incompetent it's
the easiest thing in the world do you
know how much I would care about
systemic racism if somebody came to me
and was clearly a good applicant for a
job and that that's all I
saw am I going to say you know you're
clearly the best applicant you show so
much serious attention to learning and
character and staying in a jail and you
don't do drugs and you're nice you got a
nice religious base you know it's not
necessary but it's nice that you've got
that structure in your life am I going
to say to myself you know but you know a
little systemic racism I can't give you
the job that just never happens anywhere
ever there there are so few qualified
people who do just the basics right just
the basics show up on time you know
don't be drunk when you go to work
basics you're not really competing
against you know the best of the
best you want to hear the uh advice I
gave one of my step kids
recently look around
you do you see who you're competing
with right what one one of my step kids
is very dependable you know very high
character just naturally just born that
way had nothing to do with you know I'd
love to say I had an influence just born
you know with strong
character um does you know tells the
truth and just all the basics
immediately went off and got herself a
job without any prompting as soon as she
was old enough to do it to help you know
help pay her expenses CU you know she
doesn't get everything for free and just
total High character
individual High initiative the whole
package and and of course being you know
a certain age you're worried about how
you'll do in the world and and about
once every two weeks I have to have this
conversation look around you just look
around there are very few people who
have anything you have you in terms of
character you know good
education the whole
package so that's the story I'd be
telling uh a black teenager
if there was one in my life that needed
some advice just look around you you're
not competing with much you know it has
nothing to do with black or white or
male or female there's just not much
competition in 2013 so if you want to be
the best one in whatever
category uh your odds are basically 100%
all you have to do is want it well you
have to decide now wanting it is it's
not enough you have to decide that
you'll do the things that put you in
that top 20% but it's not
hard all
right I saw a uh there some data out uh
there's a very clever and
persuasive moving video of the
percentage of uh military suicides and
it starts out as a py graph and then
it's animated over time so you see as
the years go by the part of the that's
the suicides you know seems to keep
getting bigger and you're like what why
why are suicides in the military so high
and worse why are they getting
bigger
and I unfortunately I couldn't let that
stay I couldn't let that go because
nowhere on the pie chart did they have
the raw
numbers it was just percentages now do
you remember remember the rule here's
the data rule if you're looking at data
in the news if they show you the
percentage of something without the raw
numbers is
propaganda and the reverse if they show
you raw numbers but they very clearly
leave out percentages of you know how
important this is as a percentage that's
propaganda so if you see either one of
them without the other percentages
without raw or raw data without the
percentages
that's propaganda that's
brainwashing and that's what this was
now was it also telling you that there's
a problem absolutely right I'm not I'm
not arguing with the general statement
that suicides are alarmingly high in the
military that's a given but whether or
not they've moved into alarming
territory is hard to say now I don't
want to mock a specific person so I'll
only tell you their um their job title
so in in response to me saying this that
the that either the percentages of the
raw data if you leave it down its
propaganda um somebody who is a medical
doctor according to their
profile um suggested that maybe the
reason that the suicides go up after a
period of battle is that because the
PTSD is
high so that you know you've got a
battle you expect maybe there's High
suicides when there's a war going on but
when a War Winds down suicides are high
and the doctor speculated that maybe PT
PTSD is part of
it
maybe yeah maybe do you know what the
other reason that uh there would be
higher percentage of suicides when the
war is
over what what would be what would be
another reason that there be a higher
percentage of of deaths and suicide not
raw numbers but
percentage when the fighting is
over okay am I really going to have to
explain this to
you oh my
God I'm
sorry oh God I really have to explain
this don't
I no it's by
math when the war is over something like
zero people people die from getting shot
so that part of the pi shrinks to
zero but the suicides are relatively
constant no matter what's going on
because that has more to do with
individuals than what they're
doing so your percentage of suicides
looks like it's high only because the
number of people getting shot went to
zero now are there other things going on
such as PTSD
probably probably
um you know guilt from the war maybe
yeah there there's all kinds of things
going on but if you don't understand the
most basic math that if you take out a
whole bunch of data from the pie the pie
will change even if the data on the
thing that looks like it's now a big
part of the pie was exactly the
same I
shouldn't now here here's the lesson
from this look at the comments that you
saw from your your fellow citizens
and how many of them immediately knew oh
it's just cuz fewer people are shot how
many of you knew that immediately and
how many of you missed
it do you see how easy it is to fool the
public yeah a lot of people were fooled
and we're talking about some the most
well-informed in my opinion this in my
opinion my live stream crowd is the most
well-informed about spotting in
the news because it's all we do we talk
about how to spot it every day if you
miss this one just just keep in your
mind it's not because you're
dumb right th this is intentionally
misleading because it works I mean there
they know what
works so it's easy to fool people even
people who are well informed and fairly
savy about how they get fooled so this
one should be shocking to you if it
fooled
because it's such a basic trick always
look for percentages without raw data
and vice versa all
right um but that said are there not a
hundred reasons why military suicides
should be higher than the
average you'd expect it right here are
some obvious
reasons there's more suicide in general
everywhere so it's just a subset of of
everywhere there is more fenel
maybe fenel maybe it looks like suicide
sometimes I don't know could be in the
in the
numbers um what about the selection
process it's a volunteer
army volunteer military if you have a
volunteer
military what would you expect about the
mix of people who are joining number one
males have more suicide than women
is that that's correct right men have
like way more suicide than women so to
the extent that the military is mostly
men the percentage of suicide in the
military should be five times the
average or whatever whatever it is but
it's a lot like men are way more
suicidal than women uh what else as you
said
PTSD uh BTSD I I can tell you for sure
that although I can consider myself
mentally tough I don't consider myself
mentally tough for something would
happen in an actual military conflict
like I I think I know myself well enough
to know I would be permanently damaged
by that even if I even if I survive
physically very much like the you know
the October 7th attacks the the people
who are you know near the violence but
not maybe didn't personally get hurt
they're still PTS
forever right so I know it would affect
me so that's no surprise and uh and then
how about the more the more obvious
thing military members have ready access
to
weapons right even even after being in
the military it's there's a pretty high
gun ownership rate because they they're
comfortable around guns so if you if you
have guns readily available and you're
having that bad day that's a pretty bad
combination so you would expect them to
be higher um and let me let me be very
careful about what I say next so I want
to make sure this part doesn't get lost
I do think it's a
crisis it's super
alarming I'm just saying that when
you're looking at it make sure that you
have you know all the all the moving
Parts in your
head all right
um uh
biomics so we're watching as uh so the
latest
attack on the country I guess from the
Democrats is that misinformation about
the economy is the is the latest threat
to
democracy and so the Democrats the Biden
supporters specifically are trying to
tell us that um the economy is good we
just don't realize it because we're
poorly informed and once we're well
informed we would understand that we're
not paying pay more oh I guess we are
paying more at the store so I guess it
looks like biomics is trying to make a
distinction between do you have a job
yes that's good got a
job now now to be fair I've told you for
a long time that as long as employment
is good you're going to be okay and I
stand by
that
but everybody can see that the prices
are way higher 100% of human beings eat
food we all eat food and food is wildly
higher and it's obvious you could not
miss it we all use gas yeah maybe it
came down a little but not as much as it
you know it could have been so I'm
pretty sure everybody feels it pretty
sure everybody does but the bomic just
no no you don't see it it's
fine so now we have uh at least three
different things that Democrats are
gaslighting us with now remember I used
to complain all the time when people
said that uh they would complain about
gaslighting from Republicans or Trump
and I would say that's not gaslighting
you know that's just persuasion
persuasion is not
gaslighting and and propaganda is not
gaslighting not not necessarily one to
one you know they could be connected but
gaslighting is very specific gaslighting
is telling you that you can't believe
your own eyes and your own
experience that's completely different
it's a subset but it's different than
persuasion which is you know people are
persuading you and you know you
understand the concept but telling you
that you don't see something you see is
gaslighting it's not just persuasion
it's persuasion with almost the
intention of making you in saying and
not believe what you see about anything
so now we're seeing that Biden and his
his gang are making us believe the
economy is better than it is
gaslighting uh that the border is
secure we're literally watching people
streaming across the border into the
cities and they're like border secure
yep all good no problems at
all now some of that is is based on a a
trick of
language here here's how mayorcas can
say the border is
secure there there is an argument for it
it's just a argument here's the
argument the people who come in and then
we process them and then we give you
know we say come back for your court
hearing and then we release them into
the
country that is a secure
system do you know why because because
he's oper it's operating exactly as
designed he's operating within the
existing rules of the country that if
you say here you're here for
Asylum we don't know how to check it
right away so we give you this court
date this way in the
future and then you get in the country
and you probably stay now to most
Ordinary People we would call that an
insecure border but if you're a
bureaucrat you say oh wait a minute
Congress gave me the rules of how to
secure a border and then I followed the
rules for securing the Border I didn't
make the rules Congress told me what to
do to secure the
border and then I secured the Border
exactly as I was asked to do so it's a
secure
border but if you say are millions of
people getting across the border that
you wish would not well that's a
different question oh yes millions of
people are coming into the Border who
are now citizens and and they do stay
and we can't get them out but it's a
secure border because the process by
which they come in is the actual process
the country has
approved I I feel like that's what
they're trying to do now suppose you say
but Scott Scott Scott you're only
talking about the ones who apply for as
Asylum we still have video of people
screaming across the border in the
insecure places how can you say that's
secure here's how if you're a
bureaucrat oh the illegal part is about
the same as it has always been even
under
Trump and under
Trump you said you had a secure border
didn't you didn't you I mean Trump keeps
saying that when he was in charge he
secured the border so if we have the
same
situation you know there there's a bunch
of there's a legal part that that's not
insecure because that's legally
following the law and then there's this
other part that's completely illegal we
agree it's completely illegal but no
more than when Trump was in charge and
you called it a secure border so so I I
guess that's
secure now I think that's the
argument but they don't they don't even
give you the
respect of explaining why they say it's
secure they just say it's secure when
you're watching people stream across the
border and it obviously
isn't and then the third area besides
the economy and the border is Biden's
age his age they're actually telling us
he's fine who who was it Nome said he
would take Biden at age 100
over over Trump or something right now
that's clearly that's the most clear
gaslighting you'll ever see him what do
you mean he's fine
I don't really see the problem his brain
is working like a a well oiled
clock okay now I asked the following
question do Republicans do something
like
that now I know Republicans will
lie I know Republicans can be incorrect
I know that they can be you know
sometimes crazy I know that sometimes
they can be George Santos
right I'm not I'm not defending
Republican
politicians but do they do this do do
they ever say the thing you can
obviously see doesn't
exist I don't know you I suppose if
you're a Democrat you'd say well what
about January 6 they say that wasn't an
Insurrection because it
wasn't because it
wasn't yeah all right
all right I'm just going to say
something out loud because I think I can
now say it there's something I've been
holding back because you don't want to
say things that
are that would incite violence because I
never want to do that right I do not
want to incite violence so I'm going to
Simply observe a situation there's
nothing in what I'm going to say that's
a recommendation or encouragement right
you you you can note that something is
danger
without encouraging it so I'm not going
to encourage it just going to note
it
and it's just three
words Trump is UN
jailable just let that sink
in regardless of what the legal system
decides
on Trump is UN
jailable now can we all agree on
something I don't need to
explain
that
agreed nothing nothing else needs to be
said right nothing else needs to be
said that
glitched YouTube Just
glitched
wow now let me say it again because I
don't want to be I don't want to be
kicked off of any social media I don't
encourage violence under any conditions
you know short of IMM media
self-defense so I don't recommend
anything I'm just describing a
situation he is UN
jailable that's
done you unless they find something on
him that doesn't look like like absolute
political
 now could they could they
 his business
probably I don't know that the public
would have the same reaction to a a
business
issue but if you put his physical body
in
jail not going to
happen just not going to
happen that's all I'm going to say just
not going to
happen all
right that had to be
said
um Bill Maher talking about uh Elon said
this
um he said uh what was
his he
said he he said uh that Elon Musk was
testing his patient
uh because he may not be an anti-semite
anti-semite but when someone tweets what
they tweeted and he tweets quote You'
spoken the actual truth it looks really
anti-semitic I mean come
on say Bill Mah saying that um he might
not be
anti-semitic but what he said looks
anti-semitic so come
on what's going on
here now my take on this is that you got
two people in this
situation uh Elon Musk and Bill Maher
and I'd like to point out that one of
those two people uh is a idiot
and the other one is building Rockets to
Mars you know just just in case you want
to get the the lay of the
land kind of a useful
distinction
um but literally no one and by the way
Dave Rubin you know tried to correct uh
Mah on this on the show but literally no
one including Bill Mah believes that
musk was talking about all Jewish people
when he was complaining and he later
clarified it was about the ADL and the
ADL has been the subject of much of his
criticisms it's obvious that he was
talking about the ADL and maybe maybe
some other folks who were like-minded in
no way was he making a sweeping
statement about Jewish Americans are
Jewish people in general 100% of
everybody knows that we all know it why
why pretend it why pretend something
else is
happening you what what is the point of
pretending when you know it's not
true it's just the weirdest thing and we
don't really expect uh Bill Mah of all
of all people to complain about
something that was wait for it
Politically
Incorrect
what what Elon mus said was not
technically untrue there are groups
within the Jewish Community who had a
certain point of view just as there are
groups within the Jewish Community who
had the opposite point of view everybody
understands what he
meant it was just politically incorrect
because he said it in a in a way that
could be interpreted in the worst
possible way so of all people Bill mAh
complaining about political
incorrectness like what's up with
that what is up with
that it's it's
amazing well uh Gall f pole finds that
uh although Americans Americans in
general approve of Israel's action in
Gaza that there is much disagreement
among the younger
Americans so there's a big difference
between older and younger Americans on
Israel
and you know that's Tick Tock right what
else would it
be I mean it could be also uh college
education but I don't think this effect
is limited to
college right you're saying young people
so it's probably you know pre-ol as well
so do you think Tik
Tock is the main reason for this I
where where do young people get their
news it's not from ABC News it must be
Tik Tok so I'm pretty sure this is a Tik
Tock effect but you know what's the
great
thing I I finally figured out why they
named at Tick
Tock hey
America Tick Tock
ticktock
ticktock do you get it
yet
yeah Tik Tok is a time
bomb if since they're destroying your
country and you don't know it until it's
too late and it all blows up in your
face Tik Tock is named exactly
right looks like the comments stopped on
locals might be a
bug I can't
tell anyway yeah so Bill Amman was a
noting that uh on the xplatform that one
of the most respected technology
investors in the world he calls them guy
named David
Frankle um is talking about the Tik Tock
risk and you know he's basically saying
if David Frankle thinks there's a Tik
Tock risk then you should take that
seriously and I say in addition if Bill
Amman says there's a risk you should
take that
seriously because now you have two non
political people they have no no contact
with politics directly Bill Amman and
David Frankle who would be two of the
most respected business Minds who are
saying you know pretty directly I think
Tik Tock you know and inappropriate alze
risk so I use a little persuasion of my
own here's a little persuasion lesson
for
you if you say Tik Tok is super
dangerous do people get excited enough
to act on it no
no cuz something's dangerous never gets
us to move you need more than it's
dangerous because we're in a world where
everything's dangerous so it's hard to
differentiate you know what do you work
on you got limited time so just being
dangerous according to smart people
isn't going to make anybody do anything
it's not
enough but I ramped it up a little bit
and this won't be enough either but it's
in the right direction and I said that
Congress must be owned by China to some
degree um because the case for Banning
tiktock is both obvious and critical to
the survival of the United States so the
first thing I'm doing is is ramping up
the perceived risk because Tik Tock is
an existential risk it's not a risk of
oh some people will get the wrong idea
no we're not talking about that we're
talking about the end of the Republic it
is absolutely that much of a risk and so
I said it's a bigger Tic Tac is a bigger
risk to America than Russia climate
change Iran and the next pandemic
combined now if there's an actual
nuclear
war that could be worse but the actual
risk or the chances of a nuclear war are
really
low the odds that Tik Tock will destroy
America are 100%
% let me say that again the odds of us
starting a nuclear war are really really
low but I I would agree if it ever
happened that would be the worst outcome
it's just that the odds of it are almost
ADV vanishingly small there's no way
Russia wants to Nuke us when the end of
the Ukraine conflict is kind of obvious
at this point everybody knows how that
ends so if you know how the war ends the
risk of nuclear conflict is completely
off the table
and it's obvious that the Middle East is
not heading toward a nuclear
confrontation it's obvious that the next
pandemic will probably be
right and what else I say oh climate
change and climate change is likely
something will mitigate and and figure
out how to handle just fine but Tick
Tock is in in motion it's not like a
potential thing it's in motion it's it's
got a you know Pitbull grip on America
and it's killing
us it's slow it's a time bomb ticktock
ticktock but it's ticking you can't you
can't say it's not ticking it's
literally ticktock so if you don't
understand that it's worse than climate
change Russia Iran and the next
pandemic then you don't understand
what's going on and the only reason
Congress hasn't banned it that I can
think of is that that too many members
are bought off by China
money there's no other explanation and
not only is there no other
explanation but nobody's offered one
think about that it's not that there's
no other
explanation nobody's even
tried because they say things like oh
data security is not such a big problem
that's not that's not an explanation
because the the influence is the big
problem not the data security so if
you're arguing about the data security
you're avoiding the problem you're not
arguing it that's what avoiding the
problem looks like so there's not even
anybody who actually addresses the
problem and says we should keep it
anyway the closest you can get to that
is vake who says all right I'm going to
use it because you know it's the only
way to reach young people but he also
thinks you know I believe he thinks we
might be better off without it I assume
that that's true right like he's going
to use it because he can't kill it which
actually does make
sense but he should kill it as soon as
he's president if he gets a
chance I think he would by the way just
a
guess um there's some information now
that says that Google was serving up
brand search ads through porn sites and
other uh you know races and everything
so apparently Google search is doing a
worse job than x for keeping their
brands away from Bad
content
um what's going
on it's exactly what you think it is
it's exactly what you think it is there
was never a problem with content and ads
being matched on X it was always an
attack on Free
Speech it was always an attack on Free
Speech it was never
about it's not even about Elon Musk
except that he's you know a powerful
force for Free Speech but it's about
Free Speech they just can't stand
it all right
um uh a user on X called maze ma a a
good account to follow by the way
um tells us that the ADL once had no no
problem with Twitter back when it was
Twitter so in
2018 just five years ago a little bit
more uh the ADL analyzed a year of
Twitter um when it was Twitter for
anti-semitic tweets and they found a lot
they found a lot they found 4.2 million
anti-semitic tweets by 3 million unique
Handles in the English
language
but they said this report is not about
bashing
Twitter they suggested no
boycotts they just wanted you to know
it's out there yeah just want you to
know about
it does that does that seem a little
different now in 2018 what did we know
about Twitter we knew that it was a
cesspool of FBI and Democrat um you know
finger on the scale and that it was the
opposite of free speech it was the
opposite of free speech it was literally
controlled speech and and one group was
being highly censored but under that
conditions you know a little bit of
anti-Semitism ah you know ah there's a
little bit everywhere really I mean you
who doesn't have a little bit of
anti-Semitism yeah that's the
ADL so the ADL trying to trying to
pretend to be a credible organization as
opposed to obviously just a an attack
dog for the Democrats who also do some
good stuff by the way you know the the
adl's main mission excellent yeah
protect Jewish people from unfair
discrimination good job but it's
obviously more than that as
well all
right speaking of Israel uh Israel's un
ambassador
is slamming Soros for donating to Pro
Hamas
groups
huh the UN
ambassador from
Israel is slamming Soros for being
anti-israel you know when people say
that George
Soros is doing bad things don't we
usually call that
anti-semitic yeah if if you criticize
George
Soros aren't you you sort of
automatically anti-semitic aren't you
I've been I've been told that for a long
time so I'm wondering if M MSNBC will
cover the story and will they accuse
Israel of being
anti-semitic because they just accused
um now I I'm sure it wasn't long ago
that if you criticize the ADL or George
Soros you are automat ially
anti-semitic do you know who else
criticizes the ADL and George
Soros Israel
Israel right now Israel doesn't
criticize everything the ADL does but
they've there are members in Israel who
have been quite critical of the
organization so are they
anti-semitic against themselves probably
not probably not now I ask you this
question
when the UN
ambassador to Israel criticizes George
Soros for funding H pramas
entities what should that trigger in the
news that should trigger a story right
I'm I saw the story but do you think
MSNBC will uh get Alex
soran to explain why his money is going
to pramas
organizations let me take a
guess how about no how about he will not
be invited on to explain why his money
is going toward uh you know prosecutors
who are letting people out in jail for
the minor crimes and destroying the
cities and uh pro-immigration uh beyond
what we want and uh and pramas
organizations there will here's my
prediction there will not be one news
entity that successfully gets them on
air to ask him tough questions and he's
the most important person in the country
because his funding has the most impact
because they're really good at funding
things that make a difference they're
very capable whatever it is they're
doing
yeah so that's all you need to do that
that's the dog not barking working if
you never see the
Press interview Alex
Soros you don't have a free press and if
they interview him and they don't ask
him any important questions you know
it's going to be more like so what do
you think about the Ukraine war and
he'll be like I think they should settle
it you know it's going to be something
like that you know just complete
 but now I understand why Fox
News or breit
Bart can't get Alex sorus to sit down
for an interview presumably he would
just say no cuz it would feel like a
hitpiece
but why can't the left get him to sit
down why can't see and then get to sit
down for an interview and ask real
questions so here here's a here's a good
uh Jake Tapper
question Jake
Tapper um I'm pretty sure Jake Tapper is
not anti-israel or
anti-semitic say what you will about
your Jake Tapper he's not
anti-semitic yeah I pretty sure of that
don't you think he would have a personal
interest which would match the N
National interest which is ideal to get
Alex Soros to explain why he's acting in
a way that even Israel doesn't
like you don't think Jake Tapper should
do that do you think he would be allowed
e even if he had the instinct to do that
do you think he'd be allowed to put that
on TV
and and actually asked the really hard
questions I think not allowed I don't
know I mean this would be a baseless
accusation I'm making because it's just
pure speculation but the fact that we've
never seen it and it's been the most
obvious thing that should be on the news
for now years for years it's the most
obvious thing you should
do get the sorosis on the air ask them
what the hell's going
on so we'll
see um and then we have a report that
Israel has destroyed 500 of estimated
800 tunnels in
Gaza let me ask you
this how would we know how many people
were in those 800 tunnels or the 500 so
they blew up 500
tunnels how many of them were
empty and and do they make sure there's
no let's say hostages in them
first
is it possible they've already
killed most or all of the remaining
hostages because that yeah that's the
obvious risk of
War yeah there's no way to know because
the Hamas would still say they were
alive you know to use them as a
bargaining chip even if they weren't but
how do you do how do you do a death
estimate and Hamas if you're blowing up
tunnels if you don't know who's in the
tunnel or or do they clear them all
before they blow them up and all they're
doing is making sure the tunnel can't be
used or are they blowing them up with
people inside them because that's the
safest way to kill
them I don't
know but if they blew up 500 tunnels I
would I would say that there's no way
we'll ever have anything like a an
accurate death
count how could you I mean I'm not even
sure that Hamas knows who was
underground and who escaped and you know
who's hiding in southern Gaza and who
dressed as a woman and got out how would
they
know I can imagine that Hamas does not
have good communication among its
various parts at this point because the
communication would be too easily
discovered they're chopping up and
burying cars yeah I saw
that all
right ladies and gentlemen are there any
sto stories I have not covered in my
amazing one hour of the tour of the news
and everything you needed to see
persuasion and
propaganda
yeah you know I do have I do have a lot
of curiosity about um how Israel always
agrees to give up like 10 of their
people for one of their people you know
cuz there are lots of Hostage
negotiations that happened why why does
Israel always do
that like I I have a
hypothesis one is that it works one is
that maybe they arrest for more people
than they really needed to just so they
have people to bargain with that would
be terrible
but value signaling it might be that it
it might be that they legitimately
think you you know their people are
worth certainly certainly their people
are worth more to
them than their enemies are
worth
yeah
um Hamas leader is called sin
War the the leader of hamas's name is
literally sin
War
really um
Tucker on Gutfeld yeah I did notice that
uh
Greg is uh pushing the envelope a little
bit
lately I hope that works out for him
Conor McGregor we've talked about
him have we done it
all give us more of the lay of the land
like with Bill Mah and musk well that's
a big question I don't know if I can do
that on
demand
um how long before Greg gets the boot at
Fox I don't think he will because here's
the
thing Tucker knew that he was saying
things that would get you know could get
him fired and so he wasn't surprised
when happens when I when I observe Greg
I think he chooses his he chooses his
spots better
he says provocative
things but not they don't seem to cross
the line you know and and also you can
tell when he's he's just pushing buttons
because that's part of his job you know
tweaking people pushing buttons and that
looks different than you know what
Tucker was
doing um ask me if I'd buy a cyber
truck well here's the the thing what one
of the things that I keep hearing is
that the cybertruck looks way more
amazing in person than it does in
pictures you've heard that too right
that you can't appreciate it in a
picture now if that's the case um I
haven't been close to one in person so I
don't yet have an opinion because I'd
want to be close to one and I'd want to
drive one my external opinion goes like
this um to me it feels uh this is
terrible analogy but it feels a little
like the hmer used to be you know before
gas prices were too high if somebody
would get a Hummer it was because it was
just so
cool and I think the Cyber truck has
that it's like if you're a vehicle
person you know if you're really a car
person this would be the one to have I
mean if you were going to add one
vehicle to your you know three sport car
collection you would would have to add
this because it beat a Porsche it beat a
911 911 or 911 what do you call the
Porsche um it beat it in a a test so if
you're a car person you just have to own
this vehicle I think but I'm not a car
person you know I a I want one vehicle
that does what I need to do now when I
look at
it uh it looks like there's poor
visibility and that's number one on my
list my my number one Things Are easy to
park and good visibility with at least
cameras and ideally through Windows
because those tend to be the things that
bother you most in the dayto day can you
park it you know is it too wide I don't
know how wide it
is
um yeah so I generally would not buy the
first uh the first production run of a
car that
radical but if I a collector I would you
know I mean if I had the money and I
really cared about cars I probably would
I I'd strongly be biased toward getting
one but uh for
me it would be a little too
showy so let me tell you what public
figures have to worry
about um when I first made money doing
Dilbert uh I I been driving you know
used cars for a while but when I got my
first good car like an expensive car it
was a BMW M3 and it was brand
new and in the first day somebody keyed
the entire side of the car
you from the back bumper across both
doors and the front fender now at the
time that happened I was working like
three jobs you know I was writing a book
doing dilber doing my day job I couldn't
get it fixed so imagine this experience
I'd waited all my life to for the first
time to be able to buy a car that I
really wanted I'd never done that before
yeah I did what everybody else does I
bought the car I could afford that was
good enough and that was usually used
car so the first time I could buy a car
that like you know you could feel it
it's like oh you sit in the car you're
like oh man like this is good the
experience was completely ruined because
for the
first two months that's how long it took
me to find time to take it to the shop
for two months everywhere I went feeling
good about my car people would pull up
to me on on the uh on the other lane and
they'd be like and they'd be pointing to
the like I didn't know you
know and I'd be
like I know I know I'm sad about it but
I can't do anything about it right now I
know as I'm driving my expensive sport
car
but uh time goes by and number of years
later I got um a new car it was also an
M3 and so I got a redo
I finally got a redo so I could
experience you know the the first week
of owning a car that really means
something to you that really speaks to
your your whole body so I finally get my
new M3 I'm still like I got PTSD from
getting keyed on my very first day and I
take it to the gas station park it at
the gas station go to fill
it and I got rear
ended
at the gas
station
parked in front of a
pump has that ever happened to
you have you ever been rear ended at a
gas
station it's only happened to me
once was the first day I had that
car first
day so that's two BMW M3s in a row they
were affected L physically destroyed the
first
day so I never really got that sports
car anyway the point of it was you asked
that would I get a cyber truck if you're
a public figure you don't want to get a
cyber truck unless you're going to drive
it around your neighborhood and hide it
in your garage you don't want to take
the Cyber truck to buy
groceries right it's it it based
basically unless you just want people to
hate you and and to think about how they
can destroy your stuff yeah it it's just
basically it paints a Target on your
back so my
criteria for buying a car is it has to
be safe you know Safety First has to
have
function but on top of safety and
function I don't go for thrill safety
function and
nondescript those are the three things
safety function nondescript I want I
want to park in the parking lot and
nobody notices so the my X5 does that
because where I live there's a lot of
there's a lot of cars in that in that
category your car has to align with your
neighborhood correct your car should
align with your neighborhood but I I
can't imagine taking a cyber truck and
parking it at an
airport that I don't know and I get that
it's hard to key it but there must be
something you can do to it this
bad all
right by the time you get your
cybertruck there will be many on the
road I wouldn't rule it out I'd say it's
on my short list but I'd have to know a
lot more about it and I'll have to see
how people like it the first year I I'm
just assuming there will be a number of
you know minor recalls and stuff because
it's a new vehicle so we'll wait for
that
all
right
um cameras have I assume it has uh 360
cameras right cameras all
around it needs that doesn't it yeah it
would have cameras all around all right
uh YouTube thanks for joining we'll see
if uh we'll see if this episode gets
suppressed it's looking like it and I'll
talk to you tomorrow thanks for joining
