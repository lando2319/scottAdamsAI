Uh, don't check your stocks. Do not
check your stocks today. It wouldn't be
a good day to do that. But let's get the
comments
working. All right.
[Music]
Good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization.
It's called Coffee with Scott Adams and
you've never had a better time. But if
you'd like to take a chance on taking it
up to another level, all you need is a
copper. You'd think I would have
memorized this by now. A cup or a mug or
a glass of tank or chelis a canteen jug
or flask vessel of any kind. Fill it
with your favorite liquid. I like
coffee. And join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine of
the day thing that makes everything
better. It's called the simultaneous sip
and it happens right now.
Go. Tremendous.
Incredible. All right. Well, big story
of the day. You may have heard that Joe
Biden has a prostate cancer, but it's
not the good kind. It's the bad kind.
There there's something you need to know
about prostate
cancer. If it's localized and it hasn't
left your prostate, it's 100% curable.
But if it leaves your prostate and
spreads to other parts of your body, in
this case, Joe Biden has it in his
bones, it is 100% not curable. So, it's
not curable at all. So, um I'd like to
extend my respect and compassion and
sympathy for the ex-president and his
family because they're going to be going
through an especially tough time.
It's a terrible disease. It's going to
get very painful for the president if
you know if something else doesn't take
him out first because he's a certain
age.
Um there one of the things I've been
watching is how terrible the public
is. And I'll tell you, uh there's no
sympathy for Joe Biden for a lot of
people. And it's hard to watch.
um especially because the public has all
decided to become uh prostate
experts. The the number of people who
have said things that I'm pretty sure
are not right is kind of shocking. So,
and and I have to say that even some of
the doctors who have appeared on social
media and on the
TV, I don't think they're right either.
I'll tell you why in a little bit.
Um, but the big question is how long
does it take to go from a clean bill of
health to stage 4 prostate cancer? So, I
heard some one doctor say uh it would
take 7 to 10 years or something like
that. Um, I don't think that's right. I
think there's actually a tremendous
variability of how long it takes to go
from localized in the prostate and your
PSA spikes to uhoh, it is spread to your
bones. Um, I'll give you some more
information about that in a
minute. I guess his doctor Kevin Oconor
uh Biden's doctor said in back in August
of
2024 said that uh he had a clean bill of
health and he was just looking good. So,
is it, you might ask yourself, is it
possible that he was not showing signs
in August of
2024, but that between then and now that
he not only showed
signs, but that it had spread to his
bones. And the answer is, yeah, that's
possible.
Yeah, I don't think it would be too
common, but it's probably possible
because I think I spend some time on
Grock. There's a very wide a very wide
um variability.
Now, one of the things that you might
not be aware of is that sometimes the
biopsy itself can be the cause of the
spread in cancers in general because
sometimes if the cancer is in the
prostate, I think there's like a 5%
chance or something like that that just
messing around taking a taking a sample
might be what releases it into your
blood. No reason to believe that's what
happened with Biden, but you never know.
Um, but arguing that it has been
something that he's known about for a
long time would be a gaff he made three
years ago where he said in public that
he has
cancer, but it I think he was just
misspeaking, but maybe not. You know,
may maybe he accidentally said the
truth. I don't know.
And then his brother Frank Biden has
admitted that uh in his opinion that Joe
Biden withdrew from the presidential
race due to serious health
concerns, but he wasn't specific about
which health
concerns. Um I would think that his
cognitive concerns would be enough not
to run for president, but he may have
had more concerns than that.
Um, so we don't know
exactly what was happening with him and
I'm not sure we will, but the political
implications because everything has a
political implication with these guys.
Is that does it seem to you like a
coincidence that that this news dropped
just as the Tapper book is going to come
out and everybody's talking about his
his cognitive abilities?
I feel like that's a pretty big
coincidence, but it but it could be it
could be a coincidence. Um, but it does
have the effect of turning his
attention, you know, turning our
attention away from his cognitive stuff
to a more sympathetic take of his
cancer. All right. Well, I've decided
that today is a day I'm going to take
the
opportunity since a lot of you are here
to make an announcement of my own. Um,
some of you have already
guessed, so this won't surprise you at
all, but uh I have the same cancer that
Joe Biden has. Uh, so I also have
prostate cancer that has also spread to
my bones, but I've had it longer than
he's had it. Well, longer than he's
admitted having it. So, my life
expectancy
is maybe this summer. Uh I'd expect I
expect to be checking out from this uh
domain sometime this summer. Now, uh in
California, I've got an option that he
doesn't have. Um and I was actually an
activist when California was considering
this. And in California, once you get to
the point where you're uh you're
definitely going to die, you're
terminal, there is a very civilized
process where you can get some uh juice
that you drink that makes you fall
asleep and then you pass away. So you do
that when the when the disease becomes
intolerable. Now the disease is already
intolerable. Uh, I can tell you that I
don't have good
days. So, if you're wondering, hey,
Scott, do you have any good days? Nope.
Nope. Every day is a nightmare and
evening is even worse. So, if you're
wondering, uh those of you who are
subscribers to my locals channel, if
you're wondering why I had to stop the
uh the evening uh man caves, part of it
was because of the behavior of the uh
the people on it, but a lot of it was
because I don't really function too well
after the show. So, I do have the
ability to kind of get up for this part
of the day. Um, but I'm in pain and I'm
always in pain and the pain moves around
to different parts of my body. I've been
using a walker to walk for months now.
Um, so, you know, it's basically
intolerable. Uh, I'm glad I was part of
the activism that got the uh the law
passed in California so you can take
yourself out. Now, I realize that for
some of you, this is hitting you kind of
hard because you're hearing it for the
first time. Uh,
weirdly, since it's it's old news to me,
um, I've just sort of processed it, so
it just sort of is what it is. And I
have to say that, you know, everybody
has to die as far as I know. And it's
kind of
civilized that you know about how long
you have so you can put your affairs
together and make sure you've said your
goodbyes and done all the things you
need to do. So if you had to if you had
to pick a way to die, this one's really
painful. Like really really painful. Um,
but it's also kind of good that it gives
you enough time while your brain is
still working to wrap things
up. Um, do you remember last year I was
making a big deal
online about the claims that I
fenazol are a cure for this exact
condition?
Well, in case you're wondering, I did
try that and I did try it with the
assistance of the doctor who was the the
famous doctor, Dr.
Mackis. And it wasn't that I believed it
would work, it was just that wasn't much
downside risk. So, with my doctor's, you
know, blessing, um, he didn't think it
would work, of course, and it didn't
work at all. So I did it for a few
months. My PSA probably went up by a
factor of 10 during that time. So what I
was hoping was that it would work and
then I could be, you know, part of the
solution. Wouldn't that have been cool?
And so I was teasing you that I was
working on something that that could be
like
life-changing, but it didn't work. Um,
so I can't say that it never worked for
anybody with some different cancer or
some different situation, but I can tell
you it didn't work at all for me. So,
uh, that's all I know about
that. You might wonder why it took me so
long to tell you, and I think I owe you
an answer to that. Number
one, it would change my life because
everybody would start treating me like
the cancer guy. You can't really back
like there's no there's no second way
that
goes. Once you go public, you're just
the dying cancer guy. And I didn't want
you to have to think about it. And I
didn't want to have to think about it.
Now, I wasn't lying when I told you that
my my walking and my mobility problems
were arthritis and problem with my
discs. That is true. But it turns out
that as bad luck would have it. Um, I
have arthritis in the same place that,
you know, my discs are bad um in my
back, but also a tumor. So, one of my
tumors is in the same place. So, I got
the sort of triple whammy. So, oh my
god, does it hurt most days. You know, I
do painkillers when I
can. But, uh, most of the day I just veg
out. I become sort of a zombie and I
just slip in and out of sleep and wait
for the next
day. So, th this is actually the only
thing I do.
um you know the morning show and I'll
keep doing it as long as I can long as I
can tolerate it. But uh if you're
wondering if I'll get better, the answer
is no. It will only get worse. There's
only one direction this goes. Now, the
reason that I'm telling you now um is I
was I was getting ready to tell you, but
I was looking for, you know, the right
time, etc. Uh, I wanted to get past my
step-daughter's wedding, which is over.
So, I got past
that.
Um, but, uh, when Joe Biden went public
with his
situation, I thought to myself, you know
what? I'm going to slide under his
story and he's going to take away a lot
of the a lot of the attention because,
you know, ex-president.
So, I thought I would uh you know, it
would just be a little bit easier for me
to to tag on to that. And, you know, if
you're thinking about prostate cancer,
you're going to be thinking about him as
much as me. So, it just takes a little
of the energy away. That's my that's my
thought anyway. Now, having watched how
people treated Joe Biden,
um, when the diagnosis came, people are
really
cruel. They're really bad. And I was
expecting, and of course, this can
happen. Um, people are going to say it's
because I got the the COVID shot.
There's no indication that that makes a
difference. People are going to say,
um, it's something I brought on myself.
They're going to say it's because I
lived a bad life. I don't know. But
people are going to be really really
terrible. So, I wanted to reduce the
number of months or weeks. I don't know
what what I have left, weeks or months.
um wanted to reduce the time that people
were being terrible to me online because
it's going to be going to be kind of
hard to spend any time online. Uh all of
my
enemies, in other
words, people who are Democrats mostly
are going to come after me pretty
hard.
So, you know, I have to put up with
that. But I'm ready for that.
Um, you should know, well, if you didn't
already know, I am unusually mentally
tough. So, while this could be much
worse, you know, for some people, I
suppose I'm handling it quite well. Uh,
the the
pain is tough. I mean, really tough. But
the mental
part, you know, I got that under
control. And I can see in the comments
that some of you are having a tough time
with it. But remember, nothing lasts
forever. Nothing lasts
forever. So, I hope you don't mind that
I hid it from
you. Um, I wanted as uh I wanted as many
normal months as I could
get. Now, many of you are going to ask
me a lot of questions. you're going to
say, you know, what did you what did you
do to treat it and when did you know and
you know when did you know your PSA was
high and all that and I'm not going to
answer those questions because
um you could imagine right what a
problem that would be if I started
answering questions about all of my
medical
decisions. But
um so now you know by the way there
there were some people who guessed
correctly. I think Owen
guessed. Owen you you totally knew,
didn't you? Not necessarily which
specific answer, but you totally knew.
So you got that right. And uh yesterday
on uh on X, somebody I didn't know um
said it was obvious. And I thought to
myself, yeah, it's kind of obvious. You
know, the the one good
thing about having having this
particular cancer is that it's
impossible to gain
weight. So, I can eat as much as I want
of
anything and and I'll still lose weight.
Yeah, I don't have the option of gaining
weight even if I wanted
to. All right. So, a lot of things will
start making sense now as you remember
things I said or decisions I made or
things I did. You now you have the right
context. You can put it all in there.
Um, speaking of
which, according to Corwell Health,
there's a breakthrough therapy for rare
cancers. They use something called
proton therapy, and it's not FDA
approved. it'll be approved next next
year, but apparently it's highly
effective at getting hard to treat
cancers and it can zap your tumors all
over your body and uh with almost no
side
effects. So, what the other reason that
I wanted to um keep my announcement
about my own situation
um and then I saw that you know Biden
had made it a story. I thought to
myself, you know what? There will
probably be people who have things in
the lab that are a maybe that that they
think are a cure for metastatic
uh prostate cancer. And because an
ex-president has it, they might think
this is the time to mention it. Um, and
so that would work for my favor, too.
So, I suppose there's still a nonzero
chance. Proton therapy has been around
for many, many years. H well, they don't
have FDA approval for the way they're
doing it in this particular
case. All
right. So, I'm going to give you a
little bit of news that's not about
me, and we'll see how close we can get
to
normal. And I know it's going to be
hard, but if you don't mind, I'd like to
um be as normal as possible for as long
as I
can. And so that requires me now to tell
you about the news if you don't
mind. Time for Yeah, that that's the
reason I was looking into AI Scott.
By the way, there's there's something
else
that was a mystery that maybe now makes
sense. Do you remember that I was doing
a live stream and one of you asked,
um, what do I see in
Trump's once Trump gets
elected? And I told you I only saw
black. That's before I knew that this
was terminal.
So, I knew before I knew because I've
always seen my future. Uh, since I was a
little kid, I I could see my future and
I could see very specific parts of it.
You know, even the house I lived in, the
job I got, uh,
everything. And when you asked me what
do I see for the coming year, I just saw
black. I've never seen that before.
And uh I tried to play it off, but I
knew what it was. I didn't know the
specifics, but I knew my my time was
over. So anyway, I'm going to talk about
some stories in the
news. Uh I don't know if it'll get your
mind off it, but that's why we're here,
right? Talking about stories in the
news. So let's see what
happens. Uh, so Christopher Rufo noticed
that Harvard had a hiring guide
online and the hiring guide actually
specifically had instructions for not
hiring white
men and and it wasn't
subtle. It said we're not hiring white
men and that they should just avoid
hiring white men. Well, after Chris
Verufo
um went public with that, Harvard got
rid of that page, but I don't think they
got rid of the
practice. Harvard is just a terrible
piece of
 Um I went from, you know,
respecting Harvard and thinking, "Oh, I
wish I'd gone there." to thinking it's
completely ruined. They're they are
really just a racist
organization and that's the primary way
I see them. I see them as racists at
least the
administration. So that's all extremely
illegal and uh the more pressure that
Trump puts on him the
better. Well, let's check in with Mayor
Brandon Johnson, Chicago.
um he was in an interview recently and
he said, "The reason I hire so many
blacks to run Chicago is because we're
the we're planet Earth's most generous
race." Now, that's super
racist. It's super
racist. What What do you say about that
other than it's just super racist? My
god.
But he gets away with it, of
course. Well, you may have heard that
the big beautiful bill, the budget bill,
uh, as advanced down of the budget
committee and, uh, I guess David
Freriededberg of, uh, you know, I'm from
the All-In Pod podcast podcast. He said
that, uh, Americans should be ashamed of
this
bill. And I agree. You said if you're an
American, you should feel shame that
your elected officials are proposing
that this is the bill that gets passed.
Um that we vaporize this much money,
that we put ourselves this much further
in debt, that we do not treat the
situation as a fiscal emergency than it
is. We're now burning an additional 2.5
trillion a year added to our debt load.
Now, what did uh Mike Johnson say about
it? Mike Johnson said they cut 900
billion. Do you think they cut 900
billion?
No. They're aiming at cutting 900
billion over 10 years. Do you know what
that means? It means they're not going
to cut 900 billion. If they cut anything
at all. If they cut anything, they'll
just replace it with a tax break or some
damn thing.
So, as uh Freedberg says, we are in a
fiscal crisis and we're not willing to
admit
it. Now, that's what I see that I see a
fiscal crisis that we're just acting
like it isn't and it's the damnest
thing.
But I saw Scott Basent, he was on the
NBC Meet the Press and he was talking
about it, but he's got a he's got a
different way he approaches it uh
numbers wise and he's really smart, but
I wonder if he's lying, meaning that I
wonder if what he says is is persuasive
to him or if he just thinks he can get
away with saying it. But what he says is
he inherited a 6.7% deficit in
GDP which was the highest deficit when
we're not at war and not on recession.
So he basically says we have to grow the
economy
faster so that our GDP is um a bigger
percentage compared to our
debt now compared to our deficit.
Now, do you think we could grow our
economy fast enough to get out of this
fiscal problem while we're still
spending $2
trillion or 2.5 maybe uh more than we
make? I don't think so. And I think if
we got to the point where we're growing
that fast, wouldn't we have
inflation? And wouldn't the Fed need to
raise the interest rates to stop the
growth? Because if the growth is too
fast, you get inflation. I don't know if
it's
possible to grow our way
uh out of this, but I also don't know if
Scott Bent thinks it's possible or he
just needs to say something and it
sounds good and people are like, "Oh,
okay. I don't know much about economics,
but if you say so, we'll just grow our
way out of it. Now,
um, now Trump uh keeps upping the number
of invest for the investments he brought
into the country from his Middle East
trip. Now he's saying 10 trillion.
But, you know, as as you might imagine,
some of it was going to happen anyway.
So, it's not as new as you think. And
um and and some of it would be, you
know, spread over 10 years and it's
going to take a while for them to build
any facilities that anybody's going to
work at. So, it's better than
nothing, but uh I don't know if it's
fast enough.
Meanwhile, over in Japan, the prime
minister said that Japan's financial
situation is worse than Greece. Do you
remember when Greece completely fell
apart and they had, you know, their
economy was just completely broken?
Well, they they seem to have
somehow writed the ship. I don't know
how they did it, but uh Japan's numbers
are worse.
you know their their debt to GDP or
whatever it is is actually worse than
Greece and Greece was a disaster. Now
there are some people who are saying
that the uh the demographic collapse
because they're just not having babies
over there. The demographic collapse may
be part of it but I think almost every
country is experiencing some kind of a
debt problem.
So, whatever it is that we need, we're
going to need it
fast. Um, in other news, TechCrunch is
reporting that uh so Apple is got an AI
that's built into it for the Chinese
market and the AI is China's AI.
Alibaba, Alibaba is powering the AI.
So if you if you buy a uh iPhone sold in
China,
um you're you're going to have
Alibaba AI. Do you trust it? What kind
of information is it going to collect
about you? Apple is a little bit quiet
about
that. Real quiet as according according
to
TechCrunch. Well, Dan Bonino and Cash
Patel were on uh Maria Bartermo's show
on Fox News
recently and made some
news. Bonino says that Epstein did kill
himself and he said, "I've seen the
whole
file." Uh Cash Patel said the same
thing. And they both said it with
confidence. Now, here's the thing.
Uh Dan Bonino is not a
liar. So this would be clearly what he
believes to be true. And he's seen more
than we've seen. He's seen the whole
file. But is the whole
file
real? How would we know the file is is
accurate and includes
everything? Well, Alex Jones is not
having any of it. and uh although he's a
big fan of Cash Patel and Dan Bunino,
um he gives his own argument for why it
couldn't possibly be anything but a
murder and he makes a pretty good case.
Makes a good case. So, there are a lot
of coincidences like the technical
problem that deleted the video.
really technical problem that deleted
the video and uh number of the number of
other big coincidences you know like the
two people who were watching him for
suicide watch they both took a nap at
the same
time
okay so I don't know what to think but I
do think that Bino and Cash Patel are
telling the truth as they say
it.
Um, you know, unless unless they got
somehow turned by some powerful forces,
but I feel like I feel like they're
strange shooters. So, uh, I'm going to
I'm going to believe that they believe
it, but I'm not going to believe it yet
because there just too many sketchy
things happening there.
They also made news saying that that
they've discovered some more revolution
revelations, things we hadn't heard
before about Russia collusion, which was
the Crossfire Hurricane project within
the FBI. Now, we don't know what that
is, but
apparently we're going to our eyes are
going to go boing when we find out
because it's apparently going to make
news.
Um, so Patel said that the FBI has
uncovered a quote trench. A
trench. Only the government uses that
word, right? Have you ever used
trench for
anything? A trench of hidden Russia gate
documents related to Crossfire
Hurricane.
Um, and I guess Cash Patel was the lead
Russia gate investigator for the House
Intelligence Committee, and it's stuff
he's never seen before, and apparently
some of it is pretty
damning.
Um, and it's about u well, it's just
people were hiding things. Now, if you
say to yourself,
um, wow, those those people involved
with that are in a lot of trouble, like
Comey and Mabe and Stro. It turns out
they're
not because there's a a
five-year statute of limitation on those
alleged
crimes. So, even if we found out that
they did everything that you thought
they
did, there would be no legal recourse.
just because enough time's gone by.
[Music]
Unfreakingbelievable. Well, meanwhile,
Trump Trump wants to investigate uh how
Kla Harris uh may have bought
um endorsements from Beyonce Bono and
Oprah and Bruce Springsteen. So, you're
not supposed to buy
endorsements, but
uh what Harris and her campaign did was
they paid these people to show up and
they paid them to perform in some cases
and then they endorsed
her. But I don't think that's a crime if
the people who did the endorsing were
clearly going to endorse her anyway or
or were already big fans. So, I can't
imagine that Beyonce,
Bono, Oprah, and Springsteen were going
to support Trump. So, I don't really
think you're going to find any crime
there. But, I love the fact that Trump
finds a new mundane way to make us think
of stuff.
The the other thing that Trump said was
um he said some nice words about the the
Biden family, you know, and and Joe
Biden's medical problem. And he wished
him a uh a speedy
recovery except it's fatal. There's no
recovery. So, I wonder if he knew that
when he said it. I don't know. So, it
was a little bit
trollish. All right. Here, here's a big
story that's almost impossible to
understand. It is one of these Mike Benz
kind of stories where there's a
threeletter agency that did something
with another threeletter agency that did
something with another agency until
something bad happened. Let's see if I
can summarize this. So, there was a
nonprofit, they got federal funding
uh to develop censorship strategies
uh that they boasted about in their
progress reports. Now, I got this from
Just the News, the the outlet Just the
News.
Um, so they boasted in a progress report
to the NE, which is the National
Endowment for Democracy, that their
early tactics had suppressed the reach
of Donald Trump's messaging and reduced
advertising by 100 million to news
outlets it deemed to be disinformation
spreaders.
Now they they were bragging about
it while I'm I feel like it should be
illegal or it is
illegal. So our tax dollars were going
to somebody who was
suppressing
Trump. Like it's almost so mindboggling
you you can't even understand it. And I
guess the Global Disinformation Index,
the
GDI were got grants through some u other
US-based
affiliate and and
uh the grants were paid to develop
strategies on how to fight perceived
disinformation in foreign countries.
But then they apparently they turned
that against the United States against
Trump and uh any Trump friendly
publications. So that's scary. And they
relied heavily on research from the
Southern Poverty Law Center.
[Music]
Uh, I'm just looking at somebody's long
message
about Okay. Yeah, we're I'm not going to
take any medical
advice. So, I appre I appreciate it, but
don't give me any medical advice,
please. It it it won't be helpful.
Um, there's a story that says the
European Union is going to freeze the
Nordstream pipeline for good. They're
not going to let it be repaired. So,
that would be part of sanctioning
Russia because Russia thought it was
going to rebuild the Nordstream pipeline
that mysteriously blew up. But, uh, now
the European Union says, "Nope, it's not
going to be rebuilt." and uh they're
putting together a package of other
um of of other sanctions. I guess we'll
see if that makes a difference.
Meanwhile, over in Gaza,
uh Netanyahu has said that the military
will take control of all of
Gaza. Now, who didn't know that was
going to happen?
I I think I told you on practically day
one when they attack Gaza that they were
going to completely control it. And so
now they're they're just saying it
directly that the military will take
control of all of Gaza and they will get
rid of all the terrorists and you know
they're going to say it'll help him uh
rescue the hostages but that part will
be tough.
Well, Trump keeps saying that uh Iran
had sort of agreed to terms and, you
know, was close to something like a
deal, but uh Iran's foreign minister
said, "Deal or no deal, we're still
going to be doing our nuclear
thing." Me, meaning that it wouldn't
matter what they signed, they're still
going to be enriching uranium and
getting closer to a bomb.
Um and
uh anyway, so the source of this is uh
Fox News and uh Secretary Robert Gates
was on uh Face the Nation and he said
Iran's in a very weak place now and if
there's an opportunity to do a deal on
nuclear, this is
it. Are they? Is Iran in a really weak
place now?
I don't know. So, I don't think they're
so weak that they're going to give up
their uranium
enrichment. So, I don't see any path for
a deal because it can't be true that
they don't do uranium enrichment, which
is what we want. At the same time, they
definitely do uranium
enrichment. What would be the middle
ground between doing it and not doing
it?
I know that the United States has said,
"Oh, well, you know, we'll provide it
for you." But would Iran trust its
mortal enemy to provide it with the
enriched uranium it
needs? I don't think so. So, they're
being somewhat
rational. Um, even though I don't like
it. All right.
Um, that's all I got for today. going to
keep it short. I know I shocked you
earlier with my little announcement. If
you're uh just joining, I was telling
people that I have the same cancer that
uh Joe Biden has. Um it's metastasized
to my bones. It's fatal and uh I don't
have too much too much longer. Maybe a
few months, probably this summer, I'll
be checking out. But
uh that's all I got for today.
And uh I don't think I'm going to talk
to the locals people
privately because you're just going to
feel
bad.
Um so if you don't mind, I think I'll
take a pass on
that. All right,
everybody.
Um say goodbye.
Well, I mean, for
today and I'll talk to the rest of you
tomorrow. I mean, I'll be here tomorrow.
So, we don't have to plan too far in
advance. All right. Stop crying, all of
you. If I'm not crying, you can't
cry. You You can't be sadder than I am
about my
cancer. All right. Bye for now.
