about
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization the
thing that's better than everything else
it's gold coffee with Scott Adams and if
you'd like to take this experience up to
levels that could only be described as
stratospheric well all you need is a cup
of glass a tanker chalices dying the
canteen jogger flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine end
of the day I think it makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous sip
it happens now go
oh
delightful
well we got some news today today's
theme for my
live stream will be
science
and everything it does right
because science is perfect
you know what's funny science has never
made a mistake
no no no that's not the message uh it
might be a little closer to the opposite
of that all right here's the story from
the Wall Street Journal
that shows that people who eat a bunch
of processed foods
they die sooner
if the more processed foods you eat
the more likely you are to get cancer
and other stuff and die
now do you believe that that's good
science
that they found that people who eat the
processed foods are the most likely to
die sooner
do you see any problem with that science
just on the surface you don't know
anything about it do you see any problem
there
I do
yeah let me ask you something if you
were to take all the people who eat
processed foods put them in one group
and then you took all the people who
never reprocessed Foods or avoided as
much as they can put them in another
group
what would be different about those
groups
in addition to
their diets
what would be different about them well
the Obesity would be caused in part by
the processed foods so that's true but
that's not what I'm looking for
don't you think that the people who
avoid processed foods intentionally
just bear with me
if you're a person who would
intentionally avoid processed foods
isn't it likely that you would also
intentionally do everything else that's
good for you
intentionally you'd probably exercise
you'd probably watch how much protein to
carbs you eat you'd probably brush your
teeth
you'd probably do every single thing
you'd probably not smoke yeah you
probably not Smoked Cigarettes you'd
probably do everything that's good for
you and nothing that's bad for you and
are you surprised that those people live
longer
all right now
I've been doing some personal
experimentation with trying to avoid
processed foods because I have some kind
of weird allergy to something that's in
a lot of processed foods sulfites
and I discovered that when I stopped
eating processed foods exactly as the
Wall Street Journal article says
I lost my Hunger
isn't that weird
I lost hunger
just wasn't hungry I had plenty of food
but I just ate you know you know like a
salmon and a
piece of broccoli or something so
basically no processed foods and I was
not hungry ever I I would have to eat
dinner just because it was time to eat
dinner
think about that
think about going from Hungary all the
time which was I guess that was by
default for my entire life
most of my life I don't remember not
being hungry
I'm just always hungry
but as soon as you stop eating the
processed foods it just just lose it
leaves your mind you just don't even
think of hunger
until you're really really hungry then
you do of course
so I would say my experience with
processed foods and avoiding them is I
had an immediate immediate
healthier feeling
and you know my sinuses cleared up and
so last night I experimented
with some soy sauce on some
Sushi and I had swelled up and it was
exactly like I remembered as soon as I
added just a little bit of processed
stuff the soy sauce
um my head swelled up and it was hard to
breathe
that's it so I would I would give you
this following recommendation
you know I'm not a doctor so I don't
give you health recommendations per se
but I will give you experimenting
recommendations
you should experiment with your diet
all the time you just never stop because
you're always learning new things and
finding out new things so you should
always be saying all right let me try a
week and I'll take Dairy out of my diet
just to say take a week and take a wheat
out of my diet
just find out
I also experimented eating a Subway
subs do you remember when they had the
commercials and said you could lose
weight eating Subway
and I thought
that can't possibly be true
because it's mostly this big piece of
bread
and eat all the sauces and stuff how in
the world could you lose weight in a
safe way
so I've actually done this experiment
where I'd say all right I will I'll
replace two meals a week with my
favorite 12-inch Subway so it's not even
a small one it's 12 incher and I would
absolutely lose weight
I I've tried that experiments several
times if the only thing I do is replace
two meals a week with a Subway I
actually lost weight I didn't do
anything else different
so
that's that's an example of an
experiment that could change your whole
life
experimenting with your diet
is probably one of the most effective
things you can do for your happiness
and success
all right but I'm not sure this uh this
this specific study was necessarily
telling you what you needed to know all
right here's another one loneliness
kills so there's studies saying there's
a very high correlation
that Lonely People the most socially
isolated have a much higher risk of diet
early
is that good science the people who are
who don't have friends and are isolated
are the ones who die soonest
all right now let's do the experiment
again
we're gonna take two groups of people
and they're going to be standing in a
public square one group has no friends
but we'll make them Stand Together
anyway because it's funny and another
group has lots of friends you're going
to look at those two groups do you
notice anything different about them
anything different
yes the people with lots of friends will
look attractive and healthy
that's why they have lots of friends
people like to be around attractive
healthy people
who've you know got something going on
people who have energy
but basically all the things that
signaled good health are exactly the
things that draw people to you
that's what makes you a magnet for other
people because they go oh here's
somebody who has no problems they're
always in a good mood seem healthy I
think I like to hang around with that
person
so again while I do believe that
loneliness is dangerous just like I do
believe that processed foods are bad for
you
I don't believe in science
because the science has too many other
things that could cause
this bad health
you know do you want to hang around with
somebody here's two people in your life
hey Scott how's it how's it going that's
great it's great I just went for a long
run hey do you want to get together and
play some tennis tomorrow
all right that's one person now now I'm
going to be another person hey Scott
how's it going
oh
I'll tell you I just came back from the
doctors and looks like I'll have another
week in bed uh who am I going to hang
around with more which one of them gets
more friends
right it's the correlation causation
problem again but I do think they got
the right answer
I just don't know that the science was
valid
all right let's talk about the uh
the worst prediction I ever made that
was close to the best
so here's a prediction I got a hundred
percent wrong
but it turns out it was so close to
being an amazing right prediction
it has to do with my prediction that
even though Putin had amassed a war a
war machine on the border of Ukraine
I said until the day they until the day
they crossed the border I said he wasn't
going to do it
now it looks pretty stupid by today's
perspective right I mean everybody else
said everybody everybody said he's
obviously gonna attack he's got his army
on the border and then he attacked just
like you do when you put your Army on
the border so Boy Egg on my face right
stupid stupid Scott got that one so
wrong how could I get that so wrong
so today we find out or yesterday
RFK Jr was tweeting about it that in
March of 2022 before The Invasion
Israel's prime minister Bennett uh went
to Moscow to work out a deal
and he made a deal to avoid the war
so he made a deal that zielinski and
Putin were both willing to accept
to end the war
and in Broad Strokes it looked like
zielinski wouldn't would agree to not
join NATO
um Putin would agree to not murder
zielinski
they would have some stability about
where the current border was I guess
Crimea would go to Russia
and
basically they had a deal
so
I was this close to having one of the
most amazing predictions because I said
it wasn't going to happen and turns out
that neither zielinski nor Putin wanted
it to happen even when the Army was on
the border neither of them wanted it
and they both had a deal to avoid it
do you know how the deal got ruined
because the United States and maybe some
other countries at least Great Britain
decided they wanted the war more than
they wanted the peace
they actually wanted the war
they wanted the war to degrade Russia's
capabilities
and and one of the U.S generals said
that directly
I forget which one
said it directly you know we the war is
good because it degrades Russia
so
I was so close
to getting that right but what I did not
anticipate is that there would be
legitimate countries with
seemingly legitimate countries that
wanted War
for the benefit of the war
the benefit of the war
like those words should even go together
the benefit of a war
like it's just like crazy talk
and
this sounds like it's pretty well
documented now here's here's what I
tweeted to be provocative but useful
in my opinion that's a war that Trump
would have avoided who disagrees
Trump would have avoided that war
because he didn't want a war
apparently the United States wanted a
war our government wanted War he didn't
want one
do you think he could have stopped it I
say yes
all right your second question
do you think that any of the GOP
candidates who are currently running any
of them do you think that any of them
would have allowed that war to happen
any of them
I say no
I say there's not one Republican
candidate who would have allowed that
war to happen and we have the power to
stop it
we did have the power to stop it that
seems to be in evidence
now I'm going to make it even more
provocative you ready you're going to
take it one level further
almost any Democratic president could
have stopped that war
RFK JR could have stopped it
almost anybody that you could imagine
who was running for president could have
stopped the war simply by not wanting it
that's all it took
all it took was not wanting it that's it
there were no other obstacles you just
had to say I don't want a war and then
agree to the deal that zalesky and Putin
looked like they were agreeing to
that's all it took
and we couldn't get it done now you're
ready for the next level of provocation
all right I told you Trump could have
avoided that war I told you any
Republican could have avoided this war
and I told you just about any Democrat
probably would have avoided that war
do you know what the conclusion is
do you know what the conclusion is
that during that time
we did not have a president
that's the only logical conclusion
because any functioning president of the
United States would have easily stopped
the war
just just hold that in your head for a
moment any president
any president of the United States would
have stopped that war we didn't have one
we actually didn't have a president
I feel like that's an Evidence now that
we didn't have a present which would
indicate we don't have one now
right in other words Biden was just
wasn't he didn't have the faculties to
be a real president
we we acted exactly like we didn't have
a president am I wrong
I'm looking at your comments to see if
there's any pushback we acted exactly
like we didn't have a president we
didn't have a commander-in-chief there
just wasn't one
because the military-industrial complex
apparently got everything they wanted
and that's not what happens when you
have an actual president unless the
president's so deeply in their pockets
of course
so if I were Trump and I wanted to make
that point
that's the way I would say it I would
say I would have stopped that war but
you know what so would everybody running
against me
so would any Democratic president we
didn't have a president
we didn't have one
if you'd like a president after four
years of not having one
I'm offering that to you
what do you think
pretty good right
yeah Brazil's Brzezinski yeah and then
his his daughter on MSNBC
all right
um all right so Trump did an interview
on Fox news with Brett Bear
and everybody who hates Fox News is
hopping mad and uh Brit Hume made things
worse
by mocking Trump's performance in the
interview
and what what Brit said was Trump's
defense of why he took the classified
documents
um was sort of basically seemed to Verge
on incoherent
that's what Brett said and he said he
was not altogether clear what he was
saying
so I went back and listened
when you hear something like oh a
president
is saying something incoherent
my mind goes to God Save the Queen and
you know everything that Biden does
where he's just incoherent
but I thought Trump was incoherent
really
so I thought I'm gonna have to hear that
myself because that would be big news if
Trump if Trump sudden suddenly started
acting incoherent
that would be big news
to me I mean that would certainly change
a lot about my opinion if he started
acting incoherent and here's a big news
guy trusted you know I have a lot of
respect for Brit Hume if he says he
watched it looked incoherent
that sounds credible to me
but I wanted to see it for myself
and I didn't see anything incoherence
did you did anybody watch the interview
and
to me it seemed maybe maybe not passing
the fact checking but that's normal
but he said something very clear I
didn't have time to look through the
boxes
so it wasn't that I was resisting I just
didn't have time to look through all the
boxes and sort it out we were still
negotiating now again I'm not saying
it's true
I'm saying it was perfectly easy to
understand
uh yeah he was going you didn't have
time to go through the boxes
and that it was all Declassified by the
act of taking him with him
how is that confusing
I I don't under I'm confused about why
that's confusing it's exactly what he's
been saying and we all understand it it
might not be all of the story and you
know it doesn't mean it passes legal
muster I'm just saying it's an easy
under easy to understand story
pretty straightforward
so I'm a little puzzled
by the the pushback on how bad he was
um the only thing I saw that was clearly
a mistake was his haircut
did you see I mean he needs to fire
whoever let him go on camera with that
with the way his hair was combed
I mean it you know it's always
interesting but it was just a disaster
like I couldn't not look at it I was
like what happened to your hair who did
that to you
all right
so that was a sort of a story non-story
um
here's something that's blowing me away
oh I guess the one thing that brizz said
he did it was a mistake I didn't see the
clip on that but it sounds like a
mistake that when asked how he would win
back women I guess Suburban women or
something uh
he complained that he didn't really lose
the 2020 election
I don't think that was the right play
yeah I I think he's going to need more
to you know more future looking stuff to
to get it done
but uh
According to some polls
Trump is trailing Biden in the general
election
and I asked myself how in the world is
that possible
how in the world could Biden be beating
Trump in a poll right now
like you know obviously we're all
watching our own little biased news
sources so if if that's not the news
source you're watching
but
it seems to me that if you were to look
at the things that Biden did from you
know blowing the uh the the removal of
horses from Afghanistan nobody thinks he
did that right
uh if you look at the severity of the
lockdowns and the rights that he took
away from people nobody thinks he got
that right I don't think
um
and if you look at the Ukraine war
I think people would reasonably think
that Biden was the problem there and
that the war itself wouldn't have even
happened without him being degraded
which is what I believe
yeah it's inflation you'd be directly
involved in that and I just don't
understand
well I do understand so I'm saying that
with hyperbole
um
I think what it does is it shows you the
power of the press
that people have been propagandized to
the point and brainwashed that they
think he did a good job because there
was a um
what did he get past a
infrastructure bill
has anybody uh anybody gotten any
business benefits from the
infrastructure bill yet
is anybody aware of any even one thing
that's been built because of the
infrastructure bill
I'm not
do you know of anything that got built
because of the infrastructure now
presumably there will be lots of things
that get built it's just that you know
budgets will be bigger than they were
and it's sort of invisible
so
um
hold on hold on we gotta hold on stop
everything
uh on YouTube there's somebody who just
joined who missed the Sip
we're going to give you a special
interstitial sip this is just for the
people who missed it hurry hurry grab
your cup grab it grab it grab it now get
it get it get it
ah
that was just for you who came in late
I like to take care of everybody
you're all my special people
all right
um
so the Oscars have gone awoke I saw a
tweet by Catherine Brodsky
so the Oscars have introduced three new
eligibility rules so you can't get them
up you will not get an Oscar unless you
satisfy these new rules number one
the lead or key supporting character
must be from an underrepresented racial
or ethnic group
two main storyline needs to focus on an
underrepresentative group
underrepresented group
and then or so this one's an or so you
can do that or at least 30 percent of
the cast must come from underrepresented
groups
funny they'd say underrepresented
represent an interesting interesting
choice of words
now let me ask you a question
four years I've been using the Oscars as
a guide to what movies to watch have you
been doing that
if if a movie won an Oscar I'd say oh
I'm not going to watch that
right
am I right if it wanted an Oscar you're
going to say I'm not going near that
 thing that's like a badge of
Shame
if you were an Oscar it just means that
you were woke
that's all it's meant for years for
years it just meant you were super woke
and you made a movie about somebody who
had a physical disability
uh or some problem with being gay
that was about it
that was about it couldn't win otherwise
so I'm not sure that these rules of
formalizing it make much difference to
an irrelevant thing but I have been
using it as a reliable guide to what not
to watch and I think it served me well
so the Oscars as a guide to what not to
watch
keep on going
I find that a valuable service
all right the big story on the Internet
is this Joe Rogan wants Dr Hotes who's a
pro-vaccination kind of a expert to get
on there and debate RFK Jr
and Dr hotez is acting
a little cagey
I don't believe he said flat out no I
saw a clip where somebody asked him
about it and he said he he had received
the offer
so all he was saying is he'd received
the offer which suggested he was at
least considering it at least consider
you and then there was a whole bunch of
talk on the internet
that the worst way to
um to find the truth would be to have
one expert scientist
talk to somebody who was not an expert
scientist
and so all the all the smart people have
you heard of them they're Highly
Educated Highly Educated yeah all of the
smart people who watch CNN and MSNBC
they weighed in and said oh well you so
you anti-science idiots you idiots
how much are you going to learn by
having a famous expert
talk to somebody who has no training in
the field
oh the low educated or so entertaining
with their little ideas about Joe Rogan
ah come on come on get out of here you
you pass just get out of here
isn't that what you heard it was like
this immense level it was like this
layer of arrogance you know descended
from the clouds and just covered us for
a little bit I was like am I covered by
arrogance right now
that there's nobody who can talk to a
scientist because that wouldn't be good
let me tell you
what you smart educated people
I'm not sure if that applies to anybody
here or not but
let me tell you what you're missing on
this
I would rather have a qualified
scientist
talk to somebody who's good at
identifying
then I would have two qualified
scientists debate and then when they're
done I don't know who did the better job
how would I know
two two qualified scientists
I claim this science this study is good
I claim this other study is better
how do you know
what good is that going to do
they're they're going to both say they
have studies and then you're going to
say well what's a good one then one will
say well yours is weak and the other one
says well yours is weak what do you do
I don't think that the two experts are
going to give you exactly what you hope
for maybe they would I'd still like to
see it if I could get that I would very
much like to see the two experts so
absolutely but if you give me one expert
and one person is really really good and
has a track record
of spotting
that's the one I want first
first give me the versus the
scientist and if the guy wins
the scientist needs to go back and
examine his life or her life
right or their life
uh uh yeah and if the scientist is
afraid of the spotter which is
what RFK Jr is he's a spotter
doesn't mean he's right
yeah right I'm not saying that he's
always right I don't even have a good
opinion on all of his vaccination claims
and whether he's mostly right or mostly
not right I don't even know
that's why I'd like to see him debate an
actual expert
so that maybe I could learn for the
first time is RFK Jr fullashet or is he
the most valuable resource in the
country right now
I don't know I actually literally don't
know I'm not even leading in One
Direction at this point I'm so so I'm so
non-informed even though I try to be
um
now part of the uh part of the pushback
here is that scientists are not
persuasive
they don't learn to be persuasive
necessarily whereas you put them on next
to some professional politician or a
talking head pundit type and that that's
going to be a persuasive person who
communicates really well
so the scientists are like oh it'll only
make things worse
because the persuasive person will it
will look like they won the argument
even when they didn't because I had all
the science they had all the
but their was so good it looked
better than my science
so they're afraid to get in the ring
with you know somebody who might be good
at
to which I say science without
persuasion is useless
I don't care how much science you have
in your head
you you got to tell us
you know you got to share that stuff you
got to get other people involved right
to build stuff it doesn't matter how
much you know privately in your own
little private head you got to get that
 out of your head you gotta you
gotta spread it out there
writing a paper
that helps
but if writing a paper doesn't get it
done as in The public's opinion about uh
vaccinations the the scientific papers
aren't going to convince the public and
it's the public you need to act
differently
so if you don't learn persuasion and you
don't get somebody who has the skills
and the ability to communicate
your science is wasted
so I offer today to Dr Hotes just on a
tweet who knows if you'll see it he's
probably checking Twitter lately but uh
I offer that I would help him
um
persuade I'll give them a little
persuasion lesson because he needs to
know how to handle the laundry list to
persuasion and also the potential that
he's worried about the RFK will move the
goal posts I can tell him how to solve
both problems in advance and I've told
you how to do it here's how you do it
RFK Jr has lots of claims
if you if you debunked one the worry is
he just moves to the next one
and you're like okay all right here's
another half hour I debunked that one
and then I'll just move to the next one
and then you run out of time
and the audience is going to say well he
had a lot of claims and you only had to
debunk for a few of them so right so I
can see why you wouldn't want to walk
into that trap so I've suggested on
Twitter and elsewhere that he not take
the don't do the debate unless RFK Jr
can reduce it to three claims three just
because it's more than one but it's not
too many
just three claims
and let I'll give you an example a claim
might be
this set of shots were not sufficiently
tested
right we didn't do enough testing that
would be a claim
uh it's either true or false
and that would be very useful for me to
hear debated
because I think the expert would say
something well we didn't do the usual
kind but the kind we did is good enough
something like that that would be the
argument
[Music]
um maybe another one would be that more
people died
from the vaccination than the covid
I don't I don't know if if RFK Jr makes
that claim I'm just making up claims so
but that's very specific right
yeah I mean you would look at the data
and they would probably have competing
data I don't know if that's a claim I'm
just making up claims now so don't don't
uh don't assume that RFK Jr believes any
of this stuff I'm just making up stuff
so if you take it down to three claims
and then you say to Joe Rogan
Joe Rogan it's your job to not let him
move the goal post
he's made three claims the moment he
starts to stray from those three claims
indeed you Joe Rogan to say stop come
back to the claim
under those conditions I will debate
that Joe Rogan guarantees and says it
publicly I will keep you on topic so no
goal post moving I'll keep you on these
three things and you'll both get as much
time as you want there won't be a time
limit
you give me those three things and and
maybe Dr Hotes would want me to help him
with persuasion or somebody else
to just you know give some tips how to
handle this scenario
because those few little rules in
advance I think would go a long way to
answering his concerns because by the
way his concerns are completely valid
can we say that are you willing to agree
with me that Dr Hotes his his objections
the ones he stated are completely valid
that he could get into a situation where
the the argument just churns and churns
and nothing happens and it looks like
the other guy won
I wouldn't go into that situation
so I agree with him
that the situation as first described
would not be good
but what I don't agree is how it would
be quite easily easy to negotiate it
into something that works I would also
insist on a follow-up
so that once you both argue it out yes
you both have some time to settle on you
know the other person's argument and
stuff maybe give it two weeks
I agree with you or whatever something
like that
all right
but scientists need to learn to persuade
uh Tate Brothers have been charged
now Andrew Taylor's brother charged with
a rape and human trafficking
uh there are seven alleged victims who
say they're recruited by the Tate
brothers
and there were false promises of love
and marriage but then allegedly they had
turned into
sex workers or something
was charged with raping one of the
victims
and his brother is charged with
instigating instigating others to
violence
now do you remember what the original
rumors were about what they were going
to be charged with
do you remember there's money laundering
right and money laundering kind of
disappeared
you know what's interesting is that
money laundering is a I think usually if
somewhat objective charge
you if you find the evidence
there was money laundering
but have you noticed that the things
that are being charged with are in those
ambiguous categories
like I'll bet you the question of
whether whether this alleged victim was
raped
or whether the alleged victim just liked
rough sex and wasn't complaining enough
for or maybe the communication wasn't
right or something and
so one of them is
charged with rape that probably is going
to be closer to
what do you call a date rape
now day rape's still rape all right I'm
not I'm not trying to soften the crime
I'm just saying that there are two
categories probably this is going to be
closer to a little closer to a date
rapey situation than a held her down at
gunpoint and raped her
don't you assume don't you assume it's
going to be a little unclear whether
there was consent
I'm sure I'm sure it'll be unclear or at
least it'll be a defense
and then how about this other charge for
his brother charged with instigating
others to violence
do you think instigating others to
violence is an objective thing where you
just look at the facts well there it is
or is it subjective
do you think knowing whether somebody
was instigated to violence
I mean was he like a Crime Boss did he
say your assignment is to go do some
violence
what does it mean to instigate it is it
like is it like Trump instigated an
Insurrection on January 6. as in the
thing that really never happened
is it that kind of instigated
so
I'm going to double down on my original
opinion
there's something about this that stinks
I don't know what it is and I I
absolutely am not defending the Tate
brothers
from anything they've done
I don't know what they have done I don't
know what they haven't done I just know
that from you know thirty thousand feet
looking at this
it looks it looks sketchy as hell
it looks like somebody is trying to
bring him down and look for whatever
they could do you know however they can
do it it looks like it started
either personal or political
and then they're just looking for the
reasons
that's what it feels like
so
just to be super clear again I do not
support the Tates or anything they've
done I I dislike Andrew Tate
specifically
um
but this doesn't look like an actual
legal process
there's something wrong with it I just
don't know what
and I think we should care about that
even if they're even if you don't like
those two individuals you should care
about something like this because it
doesn't look right to me
all right
uh Rasmussen did a little polling about
how people feel about the Wuhan Lake and
here's one of the questions do you agree
with the statement that China lied fauci
lied and people died
60 percent agreed with that
sixty percent of the country thinks
China lied fauci lied and people died
because of the virus and the Wuhan
connection
32 percent disagree so wasn't even 25
percent
all right
now
uh given that Dr hotez is in the news
and
vaccinations and stuff are in the news
and it probably is important to figure
out
who are the bad guys and who got things
right and who got things wrong I decided
to do a
not a deep dive but just a little
searching
to find out what the let's say the
mainstream media opinion is about
vaccinations as of today because I
wasn't really sure
you know if if you watch the
right-leaning you know Twitter sphere
you would think that every piece of new
information has come out in the last
year
shows that the vaccinations totally
didn't work and they just hurt people
how many of you would say that's your
experience in the past year a hundred
percent of any any news you saw about
the vaccinations suggested that they
were bad and ineffective everybody knew
it and it killed more people than it
saved
how many of you believe you saw that and
it looked credible to you
because I've seen a bunch of them I'm
not saying they're true I'm saying I've
seen it
right now the problem with science is I
don't believe any of it
science is just not a credible field
anymore I hate to say it it's just not a
credible field now it can find
credibility over time with things that
people don't care about right if if
science finds a new battery that works
better that probably is a good thing
because nobody had an opinion about the
battery
as long as there's no human opinions or
politics involved it probably works fine
you know eventually even though half of
all the studies that are peer reviewed
or that's the actual number of
half half of all the peer-reviewed
studies are that's known from
another study that may itself have been
um
anyway so I so I wanted to take a look
to see what is the most current news now
I need to ask you a favor here so it
doesn't drive me crazy
would it be possible for me to Simply
describe what other people think is true
Without You attacking me
could you do that
just for today just don't attack me
because I'm not going to give you my
opinion on anything
I'll just telling you what other people
are saying all right I just need that
agreement I'm looking at the I'm looking
at you YouTube
all right
so
um there's a study that says that
there's no increase in Strokes after
your vaccination
foreign
stay away do do not go after me I'm just
reading it I'm just the messenger
just the messenger
so it's a newish study from March of
this year and uh showed that within I
think 28 days of the of the shot no
increase in stroke
um how about clots how about clots
again this is not my opinion
because I don't believe science
I'm telling you that if you Google it
the first things will come up would be
that there's no increase in clots blood
clots from the vaccinations
don't I'm not saying I believe it
I'm not there you go goodbye Angela
I knew you couldn't do it
um
so that's what the mainstream media is
telling you so if you didn't know
anything and you went and Googled it and
you ask yourself hey did those
vaccinations cause clots
the Google will give you an answer that
says no the sign says no if you ask it
if it's causing people to have strokes
and you Google it
the answer will be no
now again I don't believe any studies
about covet none of them because they're
all motivated
but that's what the study says
now what about
um
long coveted
a so-called Long Cove in which which I
know you don't have to tell me I know
many of you believe does not exist or
it's actually just vaccination injury in
disguise
all right crew goes away
I knew you couldn't handle it
I knew you couldn't do it
all right let me just get rid of the
other people who are who just can't
handle this discussion
anybody else want to be deleted
all right
um
the if you Google it this is not Scott
saying is true I'm just saying this is
Google giving you a result
it would tell you that um the people my
age let's say over 60.
who got vaccinated had about a one-tenth
of the odds of going in the hospital
one tenth
I'm not saying it's true
I'm saying that's what result you'll get
if you Google it
that there were you had a 10 times
greater chance of being hospitalized if
you were unvaccinated
do you believe it
I don't believe it because it's coveted
information and I don't believe any
covert data
doesn't matter if it agrees with me or
doesn't
none of it's credible unfortunately
might be right I'm not saying it's wrong
I'm saying that if you just believe it
because science said so that doesn't
make sense in 2023 not about the
pandemic
so
um then I also asked if the vaccination
would based on our best current
knowledge would protect against
long-covered symptoms
now those of you who believe that the
vaccination itself is causing the
long-covered symptoms
would then you'd have to explain why
these studies
show that the unvaccinated people had
worse long covet
so if you're unvaccinated totally
according to the studies which I don't
believe because I don't believe any
covet studies uh
there's a big difference
so the unvaccinated out way worse long
coven
if long covert is real and if the study
is real and I don't believe either one
of them
all right so here's the bottom line
if the mainstream media you know they
let's say the consensus that still
exists out there is correct
then every decision I made during the
pandemic is also correct
but it might tell you I made the right
decisions
is that what you just heard
yeah I hope not I hope not
it's just that my decisions were exactly
compatible with the current consensus of
science
doesn't mean the right
can can we agree on one thing
they're agreeing with the science the
scientists uncovered does not make you
the right one
can we agree on that you're not correct
just because the science is on your side
on covet
all right
we did pretty good you did pretty good
actually I thought this was going to be
a little bit rougher
but as long as you know I don't believe
the science you're okay with me being on
the same side of it right
you're okay with that nuance
I think so
all right um and I I always said from
the start I was largely guessing it
wasn't like I had some insight about the
science I was just sort of guessing
doing what I needed for myself
now a number of people in the last two
days
have been brutal in their criticism of
me because I got vaccinated
is there anybody here who thinks that my
personal medical decisions are any of
your business
anybody
does anybody think my personal medical
decisions are any of your
business
that you need to comment about it on
social media let me be clear
anything I suggested for other people is
fair game
if I told you to take vitamin D which I
did and it turns out it kills you well
that's on me you should definitely
criticize that
if I gave you any bad recommendations
about vaccinations or masks and it was
wrong and I said you should do this you
should totally criticize me
but I didn't do any of that
I didn't tell you to get a vaccination
I didn't tell you to be safe I didn't
tell you to work I never told you that
but I don't want to hear from anybody
about my personal decisions because do
you think you know all my variables
how would you I'm not going to criticize
your personal decisions not your
personal health decisions
Scott said to drink bleach
all right
uh Jordan Peterson's video in which he
interviewed RFK Jr
has been banned on YouTube
um I have a mixed feeling about that
a mixed feeling
I I'm almost on this I'm very close to
agreeing that it should be banned
like the free speech is still the better
argument but I'm so close to agreeing
with YouTube on this do you know why
because every time you show one side of
an argument you make things worse
and that's what that was Jordan Peterson
talking to RFK Jr about his vaccination
opinions
without the benefit of the Counterpoint
makes the world the worst place
in a way that's dangerous in my opinion
in a way that's very dangerous
now if he'd had so here's my open
question if Jordan Peterson had had RFK
Jr on but also somebody who had a
different opinion
showed both opinions
do you think he'd be banned by YouTube
if both opinions have been there
I don't think so
I I think I think YouTube would allow a
discussion of both sides
I think they would not allow which is
obviously what happened a discussion of
confidence in something that's not let's
say the mainstream media doesn't agree
with
now that's not to say RFK Jr is wrong
this is Peter you piece of
Peter Adams has fallen even further no
respect really what the did I just
say that you don't agree with she had
one thing just one thing just just state
it just one thing that I said
that you don't agree with go ahead
we'll see it
you you've got a comment go ahead just
tell me one thing I said that you don't
agree with
yeah you silent
you know I have a real a genuine
curiosity about trolls
have you ever met a troll or have you
ever been one
like this kind of troll who just comes
in and insults people
have you ever been that kind of troll
because I don't know I don't understand
the uh the mental part of it like is
there a dopamine hit that you get just
from being evil I guess it must be a
dopamine hit right so are these people
who are literally masochists not maso
sadists are they literally sadists
and narcissists
is that what is that what's going on
with the trolls
I mean I I've never even seen a theory
except that they're narcissists
but I feel like it's it's worse than
that
yeah the the trolls are sociopaths
that's probably the whole thing isn't it
but even the sociopaths
did they do that stuff for entertainment
they must get some get a hit or
something
I don't know well you're all worthless
and uh
you add nothing to the world
um
so uh Andres backhaus one of my favorite
uh the Skeptics
got a PhD in economics so I often go to
him to debunk studies that look like
they need to get debunked he does an
amazing job of you know quickly picking
out what's wrong with studies
uh but he was he was mocking me a little
bit on Twitter
by noting that the
vaccination status is correlated with
higher education
so the more education you have the more
likely you got vaccinated
now he was just joking around
but the implication is that smart people
know to get vaccinated
So I responded to his claim that the
more education you have the more likely
you are to get vaccinated that uh that's
because uh
I said higher education used to be
correlated with better opinions about
the world
right
like when I was a kid
a high a person with a higher education
probably had a more sophisticated and
nuanced
complete understanding of topics
so you would want to pay attention to
educated people
but you know what changed
it turns out that the news turned into a
pure propaganda
and the educated people kept watching it
and they didn't know they didn't know
what they were watching
so the the so-called dumb people said
hey that looks like propaganda to me I
think I'll go do something else
and all the smart people are like
what
I've got to wear a mask or else I'm
going to die tomorrow sounds good
so all the the the most educated people
are the ones who watch the news who's
reading the New York Times the
uneducated I mean some I suppose right
so we have this situation where the
smarter you are well let's say the more
educated you are the more educated you
are the more likely you're drinking from
the fire hose of uh propaganda
so you should expect that the more
educated you are the more hypnotized you
will be by the brainwashing so the the
more educated you are ironically
the less you should trust their opinions
because it's not their opinions they're
assigned opinions
and the people who didn't watch the news
and and said basically I didn't watch
any news and like
uh are you telling me you created a
vaccination in six months
what's it usually take
five years five years five to ten years
wait what
usually takes five to ten years but this
time they mysteriously got it done in
six months yeah it's totally legit and
then all the uneducated people said no
thanks
and all the educated people listen to
the scientists they go ah science
must be true
that's the science
so we have this weird situation where
the more educated you are the more
likely you've just been brainwashed into
something ridiculous that some political
person wants or somebody's trying to
make money and you don't know the
difference
because you're educated and that it's
worse because you say all the stupid
people why can't they know as much as I
do
now again I'm not making an opinion of
whether vaccinations helped or hurt I
honestly can't tell
my my current
best opinion about vaccinations whether
they helped or hurt even me like even in
my you know specific situation no no I
really don't know
and I also don't know how to find out
because I wouldn't trust any study
and what else am I going to rely on
right
I feel fine if I feel healthy
then can I conclude that the vaccination
didn't hurt me not really
because you never feel perfect
and you never know if your your organs
are slowly rotting from the inside
how would I know I mean until it reaches
some level I wouldn't know
yeah maybe I dodged a bullet
so at the moment if I were to go by
mainstream media if you believed it
which I don't
it would say that every decision I made
about when to get vaccinated and how was
exactly right
and even I don't think that's true
because if I was exactly right it was
from guessing
it would have been from guessing it
would definitely would not have been
from all my smart scientific knowledge
but I think maybe there's at least a
possibility I got everything right but
just by chance Pure Luck
all right
did they vaccinate me with processed
foods
oh why are all the excess deaths in all
vaccinated populations and all
countries and the answer is that um
do I want to get into this
let's see I gotta check my uh
my desire for conflict this morning
sure yeah I guess I'm ready for some
conflict
do you do you think that the mainstream
media's data about excess deaths looks
anything like the stuff you're saying
does it look anything like it no no no
if you're if you're a right-leaning
person who uses social media you've seen
tons of excess death claims
the people who read regular media they
don't haven't seen any of them
to them that doesn't exist
the mainstream media doesn't recognize
that as even existing now they do
recognize that there is excess deaths
but if you looked at the you know the
stated reasons for them it all looks
like just normal stuff
like that the vaccination is not even
listed as a potential reason
it's just oh ordinary stuff
yeah unreliable data whatever I don't
know
I don't know yeah my personal view is
that I don't have any idea if there are
actually excess deaths or what caused
them
because I don't believe that can be
determined by science or data in a way
that's credible it could be it's
probably possible that you could do it
but even if somebody did it and they
have the right answer how would they
ever communicate that to me
how would anybody ever convince me that
they had the right answer on excess
deaths
I've seen I've probably seen 40 or 50
claims I didn't believe any of them
I didn't believe they were necessarily
wrong it's just I didn't have a reason
to believe them just because it's
science and its data and somebody
incredible did it not good enough
doesn't mean anything to me has no value
at all just absolute just noise
I wish that were not the case I wish
science were you know credible enough
that if enough scientists were on the
same side that would mean something but
it really doesn't nothing more
all right
yeah apparently uh a big part of the
excess deaths is self-harm were you
aware of that
so I saw one claim that said oh yeah
excess deaths are up in the United
States but if you take out the self-harm
categories like more suicide more
drinking yourself to death
more drug dose more drug overdoses if
you take that stuff out it ends up that
the excess shrinks quite a bit
and I don't know that vaccinations would
cause more suicides
I don't know that it doesn't either
all right
let me read to you today the Dilbert
reborn comic that's running today
now you can only see this if you're a
subscriber on the locals platform Scott
adams.locals.com or if you're a
subscriber to the Twitter special
subscription site that has a Dilbert
comic but in it uh I've got a character
who was introduced in recent years
called Dave the engineer so Dave is
black
although he identifies as white because
he's a prankster
so so Dave just likes to cause trouble
but he likes to do it while acting like
he's not
so Dave is actually based on a real
co-worker I had it was not black but he
was hilarious it's funny his name was
red
that's funny but he would go into
meetings and he would he would use
corporate talk
just sound like he was really saying
stuff but it wasn't really saying
anything and in his Co and all the
co-workers knew that he was just full of
 and we would laugh so hard when he
did his yeah you do it you do a status
report like this
well we've got our teamwork up and this
energy is good you know he and it would
just be a whole bunch of uh buzzwords
put together and what he was done the
boss would just look at him because we'd
be just screaming crying we would just
be crying we're laughing so hard because
he did it really well he just like put
on a little act where he'd say corporate
stuff and none of it meant that they
think and none of us really cared about
these status report from the other
departments anyway like so the meeting
wasn't even useful
but uh he would add lack of usefulness
to a useless meeting which was just so
much fun you couldn't even believe it
anyway so he became the inspiration for
the day of character
so Dave who has been put in charge of
the Dei project the diversity equity and
uh
uh diversity equity and inclusion
and so Dave is giving you his progress
report he says I've only been in charge
of the Dei group for one day and already
I've increased our diversity
for example today we hired a one-eyed
ham radio operator and a woman who hates
every kind of cheese
and the third penalty says and I have my
eye on a Belgium
and the boss looks at him and says we
need to talk
I have my eye on a Belgian
I am more proud of that punchline than
any punch line I've ever ridden
I have my eye on a Belgian I don't know
to me that's funny
so so I remind you that although the
Dilbert reborn comic is
would be fully unacceptable in
newspapers because they have such a
tight standard I'm not making fun of any
people
I don't do that so I'm not going to mock
any group I just want to be clear about
that I I'm not behind a subscription
wall so I can say shitty stuff about
people
I don't do that that's not my thing
uh but I'm definitely going to do things
that would get me in trouble
if I did them in the Free World you know
the non-free world I guess
so I put it behind the subscription
layer and then anybody wants to see I
can see it nobody will be offended
all is good no complaints by the way
from anybody who subscribed
so that's all good
Chris you're a Belgian
good to know
um YouTube thanks for joining
hope I wasn't too cranky today
and uh I'll talk to you tomorrow
thanks
