looks like stocks are up nicely
today and that means it's going to be a
good
day and uh as you're streaming in here
and getting
ready oh
hello there we go
[Music]
[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
coffee with Scott Adams it's the finest
time you've ever had in your whole darn
life and if you'd like to take this
experience up to levels that nobody can
understand with their tiny shiny human
brains all you need is a CER mugger
glass a tankered shell Stein a canteen
jugar flask a vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparallel
pleasure the dopamine of the day the
thing that makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous it happens now
go oh that was a little extra good
today starting off just
right well if you heard of something
called a coffee nap researchers have
found that if you take a nap for too
long you'll get into deep sleep and
that's no good if you drink coffee when
you're exhausted well that's not ideal
because you really needed an NA so they
say that you can game the system by
drinking your coffee but before it kicks
in you immediately take a nap so
apparently if you wake up in 20 minutes
the coffee the caffeine will live kicked
in you have your nap
Boom the only thing I find problematic
about that is how long does it take you
to drink your coffee because it takes me
at least 20 minutes to finish my coffee
and by then it's kicked in how the hell
am I going to take a nap so obviously
you have to chug the coffee otherwise
all the whole thing falls apart so chug
that coffee take a nap you'll feel
great well there's a Cleveland Ohio
based uh company making robot dogs with
a
flamethrower and apparently ukra has 30
robot dogs now I don't think they have
flamethrowers uh but they could and they
they're already deploying them so if
Ukraine lasts another year the war it's
going to be all robots I think Ukraine
is going to be the testing ground for
robot
Warfare because they're clearly running
out of humans there's no doubt about
that and yet they don't seem to want to
stop
fighting and they're getting delivery of
advanced robots that probably the United
States is very eager to test an actual
combat so one year from it being largely
robots on the front line and you don't
need as many robots as you need humans
because one robot could kill you know
dozens of humans so it's sort of not a
fair
fight so I'm going to say one year until
the the war is primarily a robot and
drone
War that's my prediction so for a little
over $99,000 you can get yourself a
flame-throwing robot
dog I think I'm going to get one um I
heard from a neighbor who used to work
for the police that in my neighborhood
it's uh unheard of for a home to be
burgled if there's a dog there now my
dog's a little weak and small and she
limps and and she's older than dirt so I
don't know if my dog would scare anybody
but if I got me a robot dog and I just
sat in the living room and had a
flamethrower oh yeah imagine being a
burglar and running into a robot dog I
would scare the hell out of you because
you wouldn't know what kind of Weaponry
the dog had or could have hurt you so
robot dogs get one AI is or not or meta
is rolling out their uh new
glasses that are AR or VR so they're
they're basically AI driven
um and it can do all these things like
set reminders and do all kinds of things
that if you wanted to wear nerdy glasses
that would be
great but um I'm going to use my
indicator of when to know a a new
product will succeed it goes like this
a product will
succeed if people are wildly
enthusiastic about it while it's in its
terrible initial
form now that I often use cell phones
and personal computers and even before
that faxes so there are lots of
examples where people really really
wanted a product cars even cars were bad
before they were good um way before the
products were good there's just
something about it that you knew you had
needed to have
it
but um do you feel that with the AR and
VR
glasses because it feels the opposite to
me it feels like even though the product
keeps improving and there's probably no
limit to how much better they can get I
think that they keep thinking if we make
it a little bit better people are going
to buy
it but I think they're missing the
biggest indicator which is if people
don't want it when it's
bad they just don't have enthusiasm for
it so they're they're not going to want
it that much better when it when it
works well so that's my
prediction that unless you see
excitement in the it's not quite great
yet it's never going to be exciting so
improving the product doesn't make
people
excited we'll see maybe this is an
exception so we'll we'll be testing that
theory
it actually could be an exception but
it's a good way to test the
idea all right well there was a uh
scientific study according to science
publication uh in which they uh were
talking about how to get better
scientific rigor in your papers your
scientific papers because you know a lot
of the scientific papers that get
published even peer reviewed turn out to
get
retracted and so somebody did a big old
study
on the best way to improve the you know
credibility and reliability of the
system so they wrote a scientific paper
on how to improve scientific paper
credibility uh they have since had to
withdraw it because they had Elemental
errors in the paper that told you how to
how to trust scientific
papers so that's what you call not
succeeding
that's not
succeeding
well according to Bray Bart consumer
confidence in the economy has
plunged uh not only business enthusiasm
but personal
too
and the plunging seems to be most
correlated with Harris becoming the
candidate now there might be other
stuff but things aren't really that
different than they were 6 months ago
are they in terms of the economy I mean
the prices haven't gone up much in 6
months there's not much difference you
know employment's about the same stock
market's
up but why would the consumer confidence
be
plunging the only reason I can think of
is that they're looking at Harris and
saying oh my God if she becomes
president we're all in trouble is there
something else going on that I don't
know about I think it's really that
simple and so ladies and gentlemen I'm
going to call
it I'm going to call the race for
Trump but only the
vote because I think we're in
unfortunately a terrible mode in this
country in that whoever wins the vote
isn't necessarily going to be the
president if you know what I mean so if
you consider all the potential
Shenanigans from assassination to
lawfare to who knows I mean who knows
what kind of weird October surprise
hoaxes are coming there's probably at
least one gigantic Trump
hoax that's Brewing that we'll see any
minute now but here's what I think I
think if consumer confidence drops and
the only thing that you can see that is
related to it is
Harris and now that we've seen her
interviews we'll talk about that she's
so clearly
incompetent that I don't think it's
possible to be an informed consumer and
think a little KL Harris could fix the
economy that's what we need I think just
about no people think that they might
like her for a variety of reasons but I
don't think they think she's going to
fix the economy that doesn't seem like
something you would attribute to
her so
uh I'm calling it I think if you hold
the election without some new gigantic
thing happening and by the way October
is coming so something new and gigantic
is probably going to happen maybe
multiple things but at the moment uh
Trump is a sure winner in the
vote that doesn't make him president
like I said you know they could laware
him they could there's just million
things they could do that are just
weasly
Shenanigans so 100% chance he's going to
win the vote unless something big
changes but remember remember the part
where I said unless something big
changes there's going to be some big
stuff
coming yeah I don't know what it is I
mean I don't know what all of it is I
know some of it but
uh yeah Trump has a control of the vote
at this point
well did you know that black rock has
acquired now enough Bitcoin that they
have $23 billion worth of bitcoin now if
Black Rock the biggest Financial entity
around thinks that they need to own 30
or 23 billion dollar worth of
uh uh Bitcoin that certainly suggests
that they have confidence in it or at
the very least they're diversifying
now it occurred to me that since I talk
about big companies all the time and uh
stuff like this that I should do a full
disclosure of which assets I own so if
so if it looks like I'm pumping up
something you can say oh you own that
stock which you should say by the way
that would be I I don't actually think
that way like I don't come on here and
say I own a stock I think I'll say some
good stock stuff about it
but uh I do say good stuff about some of
them so let me just mention these are
not recommendations because I don't do
recommendations but I do own
Bitcoin as a diversification
play um and when I see black rock buying
it I think H okay it's probably smart on
it I do own um some Tesla stock some
Nvidia stock and and one um Index Fund
of nuclear power
stuff uh the other ones would not be
relevant to talking about the news so
I've got some
Ulta and some Camping World those are
really just for fun I don't recommend
any of the things I have for anybody
else so the generally speaking you
should not be investing in individual
stocks just as a rule uh you should
diversify and get index funds but if you
have enough money that you have
something you can play around with
sometimes it's fun to play around with
individual stocks so Ulta and Camping
World are are literally just
recreational Investments for me uh
but I'm trying to Future prooof my
portfolio oh I also have Microsoft that
I got when the pandemic came I got lucky
because I introduced AI
so I'm future proofing as much as I can
with Microsoft NV
video
Tesla and a Index Fund of nuclear power
plants nlr I think is the fund um so
again not recommending any of that don't
make recommendations but when you see me
talk about any of those things you can
know that I put my money behind them and
if you want to be um skeptical
and you want to sayi think he's saying
that just because he thinks it'll make
his stock go up you should do that yeah
I I can tell you uh I promise you that
I'm not thinking that way consciously
but am I subconsciously favoring the
things that I invested in
probably that would be a normal thing
that a normal brain would do I'm just
not conscious of it so don't listen to
me on that
Stu well open AI the uh chat GPT people
um they're going
to trans uh what would you call it trans
mography into a for-profit entity
because they started as a not for-profit
part of that will be allocating Sam
Alman 7% of the company which would be
over10 billion so that's a pretty good
payday
and of course you might know the story
that Elon Musk uh got that Venture going
with $50 million that he put in with the
understanding that it would be a not for
profit entity to benefit the world with
AI but then it turned into a for-profit
kind of thing and a Microsoft kind of
thing and and Elon got squeezed
out um but he's not too crazy about
uh what's happening there and he and he
even said in a post that you can't
convert a nonprofit into a for-profit
it's illegal
I don't know if that's true but it
sounds
true I mean I'm not a lawyer but it does
seem to me that there would be something
illegitimate about that transfer if you
had been set up with the intention of
being
nonprofit well of course there were I
think three Executives from open AI quit
just
recently and so there's there's probably
some internal drama going in there going
on in the place about whether they
should be for profit whether they're
moving too fast or not fast enough and
it's dangerous so they're probably
working on all that but musk actually
referred to Sam Alman as little
finger how many of you recognize that
reference little
finger is from Game of Thrones and
Little Finger was like the the Weasley
backstabber you know guy in the
shadows he was always the Weasley
backstabber
so we call Sam mman little finger all
right I I'm am very entertained by
whenever they get personal on the
post speaking of
Tesla um I saw an announcement which has
been
interpreted as Tesla's going to roll out
the robo taxis so I assume that means a
driverless taxi that you could call with
an app and they're going to do that on
October 10th in Los Angeles
now I didn't know that that was imminent
so maybe they're going to demonstrate a
prototype as opposed to a finished car I
don't know but how amazing is
that how amazing is it that you're
alive when driverless car car taxis are
going to become your thing that's kind
of cool just that we could be here to
watch that
happen well anyway you you heard that
the mayor of New York City mayor Adams
um no relationship to me I know we we
look a lot alike but uh he's been
indicted the uh news is saying it's
something about far um violations far
would be the foreign something blah blah
blah it means they accepted
money um from a foreign
entity now turkey is mentioned as a
company that a country that may have
given some money to his campaign or
something else but we don't know the
details but there may be more than one
country involved
allegedly now uh a number of his staff
is also being indicted or investigated
and you know they're losing their
devices
Etc
and what do you think is
happening so here's my take uh as I've
said before I believe that all City
governments at least of large cities are
all corrupt I don't think there's an
exception I I think that they people
actually go into those jobs because the
the corruption is what the payoff is so
while I don't rule out the fact or rule
out the possibility that there's some
city where the the mayor and all the
employees are totally legit and they
never try to do Kickbacks to their um
campaign uh donators or anything like
that but I don't think so I think
they're 100%
crooked
and you know that's just just my
assumption now there may be like I said
there might be a mayor here or there who
passes through and they're not crooked
but in general I feel like you could
pick any mayor and put a little muscle
on it and you could find something they
did illegally
so what do you make of the fact that one
specific mayor is being targeted hard as
well as presumably some
staffers and what do you make of the
fact that it happened right after mayor
Adams got real vocal about too many
immigrants coming into New
York is it connected is he being
punished for not being a team player on
immigration
well if he were being punished for not
being a team player with the Democrats
it would look exactly like
this but if he' simply done some crimes
and it's been brewing for a while and
and just people doing their job it would
look exactly like this so we have a
situation that looks exactly like two
completely different situations one is
he's really guilty it's really bad
they've had the goods on him for a while
but they had to do investigate it and
this is just when everything came
together totally possible that is
nothing but a real crime and they found
it but it does look exactly like he's
being punished for his views on
immigration so what do you make of that
I don't think we'll ever know the answer
but I hate living uh where I don't know
that answer that you can watch a fellow
citizen go down he's definitely going
down and you say to yourself I don't
even know if that was
legitimate now like I said the whether
or not he's being punished is a separate
question from whether or not there was
anything that was a
crime so I'm just assuming that it was
an easy target once they decided they
wanted to go after it so it's the
deciding to go after him that's the
critical
part the the fact that they could find
something probably applies to most of
the
Mayors all right
so we'll keep an eye on
that um Thomas Massie was
uh uh what would you say interviewing or
talking to um Horowitz the uh the guy
who did the report on uh well he was
doing a report on January 6 to figure
out you know what really happened and
who did what and who's the blame and all
that other stuff and that report after
three and a half years is not
ready
why I don't know not ready but one of
the big questions is how
many uh federal agents were present on
January 6 and Massie tried to get him to
give a number but he said well you know
uh lots of people have to approve it
it's in draft form it might change I
can't say and just avoided
it but here's my my question to
you what number would be the wrong
number cuz I have no idea suppose they
came back and they said there were
three what would you say about that
would you say oh well if there were only
three probably didn't make much
difference what if they said there were
20 20 and of I think there were over
100,000 people who were in the general
area 20
could 20 move the needle could 20 do an
op and cause the the uh the people to do
something they wouldn't have
done
maybe it depends what those 20 people
were doing because you you definitely
have people who are leaders even Ray EPs
and I'm not saying he was a Fed but Ray
EPS was encouraging people to do
specific
things uh there were other people one
one person with the bullhorn I think
that day who was in encouraging people
to do specific things so yes
2020 could probably make a gigantic
difference if one of the 20 pulled down
a barrier and then the rest of the
people said oh the barrier's down they
just walked through that would be one
person who could basically cause the
whole thing so I don't know that it
matters how many were there because I'd
be kind of
amazed um if it's not at least
a dozen would you would you agree with
that I'm going to say 20 as the floor I
think it's more than 20 but if there
were 20 that would be plenty
enough to turn a mostly peaceful thing
into way more dangerous than it should
have been it wouldn't take many people
but what if they come back and they say
it's 80 or
100 at that point wouldn't you lose all
skepticism about whether or not there
was an OP going
on there's some number where all of us
would say uh that doesn't look like the
normal law
enforcement situation it looks like
you're trying to make something happen
as opposed to monitoring it so we'll see
but apparently we're not going to know
about that until after the
election uh I'm going to say what you're
going to say which is I to me this all
looks crooked so even though Horowitz is
not you know not suspected of anything
specific like you know nobody thinks
he's done a crime or anything I'm saying
that it feels like way way too
coincidental and
unusual to explain just by being
slow they would at least tell us what
they know about how many feds were there
Etc so now to me there's something
crooked about this so I'm not buying
into the uh it has you we're not going
to have it done before the election you
can do anything in 30 days you just have
to want
to so we'll
see well you may have seen the sit down
interview with keris and msnbc's
Stephanie rule same person who was
recently on U Real Time with Bill Mah
Stephanie rule
now if you don't watch MSNBC I do it so
you don't have to and Stephanie rule
would be sort of a joy readed uh Rachel
madow level batshit crazy Trump
derangement syndrome you know no no
pretense of trying to be fair whatsoever
so she was the perfect choice for KL
Harris because KL Harris knew there
wouldn't be much push
back but there was a little bit of push
back and oh my god did Harris blow that
it was a totally bungled her her answers
were just laughably ridiculous and
people are just laughing at them today
they didn't it didn't even look like a
professional honestly I could I could
pick somebody randomly from a crowd and
they would have beat that performance
without practice they could have beat
her performance I give you anidea idea
now first of all in my opinion she
looked
inebriated now I would like to point out
that while I do say that a lot about
Harris I'm very careful to point out
that there are clearly times she's not
such as the debate there was no signs
whatsoever of any kind of inebriation at
the debate and other times as well no
sign of it at all but when she sat down
with Stephanie rule she looked drunk as
a how do you not how do you not see
it it doesn't even look a little bit not
drunk now I'm using drunk as a catchall
for whatever inebriation or combination
of things were there but there's no way
that that was
straight is there anybody who disagrees
is there even one person watching who is
going to go out on Limb and say you know
I think that's just your personality
from one day to the next it's quite
different sometimes she's more serious
sometimes she's more relaxed this time
she was just more relaxed she laughs a
lot big deal does anybody have that
opinion because to me it's just
overwhelmingly obviously drug
related overwhelmingly obvious just like
exactly like um Biden's mental Decline
and and I feel like it's just that all
over
again where you know for years
three years I think I was saying Biden
is clearly mentally declining is you
know am I what's going on why do I keep
saying it out loud but other people are
acting like they don't see it like
what's going on now obviously the
Republicans saw it first but same thing
why is it not the only thing we're
talking about that a major candidate for
presidency just gave an interview
clearly
inebriated is it because the the
mainstream news believe she was not
inebriated I'm actually a little
confused or do they know it it's kind of
obvious and they're just pretending they
don't see it so that you won't
notice and think how much they primed
You by treating it like it was just
normal don't you doubt your own um your
own
interpretation because I'm watching it
and I'm thinking okay you're talking to
a drunk you're not going to say anything
about that and she doesn't and then when
it's done I think to myself huh well if
it were so
obvious but she didn't say the
interviewer didn't say anything about it
then maybe I'm just wrong so it
basically gaslights you into thinking oh
I guess I guess I can't tell an
inebriated person anymore I guess that's
just normal so it's total gaslighting
anyway here's some
uh so she did she was asked if she
worked at McDonald's and I would like to
give you my impression of her saying
that she did work at McDonald's because
Trump is saying and Republicans are
saying there's no evidence she ever
worked there but uh here's her
confirming that she
did I did the fries
so if you missed it that's what you
missed it was really weird really
weird um what else did she
say you said U let's see uh when asked
about how she would pay for the program
she wants to implement it would cost
more money since we're already in a
deficit she pivoted to corporations and
billionaires have to pay their
fair
share uh I just their fair share they
got to pay the fair share for the fair
share um now what's this fair
share how in the world does that
work what is the fair share how do you
determine what it's fair now I always
like to bring out my famous quote that
fairness was invented so children and
idiots would have something to argue
about if you were a serious person and
you were talking about taxes you would
never use the words
fairness because it's IL defined it's
subjective and you can't have an IL
Define subjective tax
policy here's what you could do you
could decide whether a tax change either
up or down is for the greater
good without too much attention into you
know how it's
allocated you could you can pretty much
pick out the greater good it would be a
tax level where we don't discourage
business but maybe we get a little
closer to paying off our our debts now
ideally you'd rather bring your expenses
down to do that instead of raising taxes
but my point is fairness is not what
economists talk about she has 400
economists who just backed her ask one
of the EC IST to Define fairness for you
it's not a
thing there's not one of the 400
economists who backer who would back her
on fairness being the standard for
anything now certainly you want to pick
a standard that people won't complain
about too much so that they have they
have to feel like all right well I don't
want to pay this much taxes but I can
see other people are paying taxes and
well you know it's just not the hill I'm
going to die on
so maybe you can get that you can get
people to say
well you know I don't have a better idea
that's as good as you can do fairness is
for idiots so if she she was drunk or
she is an idiot we don't know but it
looks like a drunken idiot statement to
BR L for
arst but Stephan rule to her credit she
said directly that she's uh on her on
MSN see that Harris doesn't answer the
question where she'll get the money from
which means she's not answering the
question on the most important parts of
her policy because if her policies were
free I don't think anybody would have a
problem with it I'd like to give a
$6,000 tax credit to people what's that
cost me nothing oh okay yeah go ahead
I'd like to make $50,000 tax deductible
available to new businesses well what's
that cost me nothing it's free all right
yeah sounds good to me make it a 100,000
if it's
free but if you leave out the part about
what it costs or what it does to
inflation you're not really a serious
candidate uh Stephanie rule also to her
credit pointed out to haris that the
Biden Administration has tariffs so what
the hell are you talking about with
tariffs not being a good idea so then
because all the viewers of M MSNBC are
uninformed idiots Harris got to say well
well you just don't want to throw out
like Trump does uh the across the board
Terrace which nobody is
recommending literally
nobody on the whole planet
including Trump there's not one person
who thinks tariffs should be applied to
everything not one
not a single person and yet she
can say this on TV because it's
MSNBC so gets away with it but to her
credit Stephanie rule did point out that
Biden uses some tariffs when it makes
sense might he even said he might add
some more or add to them where they make
sense now if you watch a you know
useful political show such as the five
you'll see Greg geld explain at least
every other day that if you put tariffs
on an industry you're trying to protect
it makes perfect sense because you don't
want some other country destroying your
entire industry like the car industry
for example but if all it is is
something that nobody in America makes
and you're getting a good deal on it of
course you're not going to put a tariff
on that that would just be what just a
tax so this is one of those situations
where people are in 100%
agreement Democrats and Republicans 100%
agreement on tariffs that there's some
spe special cases they make sense but
the general case you you'd be better off
not doing it both sides 100% agreement
and that's why Biden didn't remove any
of Trump's tariffs he so the Biden
Administration got rid of what 94
executive orders just about the Border
and that was like on day one so it's
obvious that they don't have any problem
at all reversing stuff that Trump does
that doesn't make
sense but they didn't reverse his
tariffs and then they send out idiot
Harris to say the tariffs are it's bad
the way he does them just throwing them
all over the place you know I was just I
got those he's he's just got tariffs on
everything which he doesn't that would
be
stupid then uh she was asked about uh
housing cuz housing costs is too much
and what would she do about that and
instead of answering anything about
housing because she didn't have an
answer she tried to make the case that
if you did things that um made life in
general more
affordable that people would have extra
money from just an affordable life that
they could afford or better afford
housing or buying house
but the way she tried to explain it is
with a keyword that obviously had been
given to her and you'd see that she
lights up whenever she hits the
keyword so you can you can tell when
she's clicked in because she's operating
on some set pieces where if they say
this make sure you put this keyword in
there so watching her light up when she
hits the keyword and then repeats it is
kind of just creepy so the keyword was
holistic so our argument being that even
if you don't
directly give financial support to the
housing part if you financially support
the life in general they'll have a
little extra money for housing now
that's
not an illogical
argument that's not illogical if somehow
they made our gas prices go down to $1
people would have a lot more money to
pay the rent or the pay the mortgage so
I'm on board here's how she explained it
uh looking holistically at the
connection between that and the housing
and looking holistically and then she
would light up every time she said
holistically
holistically at the incentives we are in
the federal government can create for
local and state governments to actually
engage in planning in a
holistic manner that includes
prioritizing affordable housing
holistically it was a a total train
wreck so it's very clear that the more
we see of
her the more obvious it is that they had
to hide
her uh they just put her with the
easiest interviewer in the world and she
didn't even have setpiece answers for
the most obvious
questions do you know how incompetent
that is it would be one thing to have
answers that people don't like Trump
does that a lot it's a completely
different game to not even have a
sensible sounding
answer besides I grew up in a middle
class home I me that's a whole different
level of incompetence if you can't do a
friendly let me give you an
example um an equivalent would be Trump
talking to Hannity which they've done a
number of times Hannity is literally
good friends with Trump literally hanity
is the most you know biased Republican
you could even think of if you tried to
make a list of the most biased
Republicans now two is credit Hannity
makes no pretense of trying to be a
middle ground show both sides kind of
guy he's an opinion guy and his opinion
is Republicans are better and you know
he hammers it hard he does it very well
so if it sounds like I'm criticizing
Hannity I'm not because he's completely
transparent you know it's my opinion I'm
I'm just a supporter of Republicans and
I love Trump he's a good friend once all
that's said then I'm okay you know if it
were the only interviews Trump did that
would be a disaster you know I wouldn't
like that but yeah you can do some
friendlies no problem with that at all
when you see Trump talking to Hannity
and you know it's a friendly and it's
going to be softballs and stuff Trump
kills it he Nails it he said sounds you
know you he communicates clearly you
know what he wants even though it's a
friendly Kim K Harris couldn't even pull
off a friendly the friendliest of
friendlies couldn't pull it off how in
the world are we comparing these two
candidates they are so far from
equivalence it's ridiculous it's like a
bicycle to a jet I mean it's not even
it's not even close all right
um Mark Cuban was on Fox and he was
asked if he would take a any kind of
important role in a Harris
Administration if she wins and he
said the SEC that he'd want to be head
of the
SEC now I didn't see that coming I don't
know if any of you did and I don't know
how completely serious he is about it
because it sounds like the most boring
terrible job for somebody who's had a
lot of fun in their life
on the other hand anytime I see somebody
with his
capability wanting to be part of the
government I'm a little bit interested
I'm a little bit interested I it's hard
for me to imagine what trouble he could
cause at the SEC he probably just has
some specific ideas of how that's not
working and thinks he could fix it and
maybe he could you know
uh I don't automatically hate it because
when it comes to of business I think
he's more about what
works you know when he talks about
politics or Elon Musk he he gets into
the Hyperbole and the trolling and the
arguments and stuff
but I'm pretty sure that he's a
legitimate American patriot who wants
the SEC to work the way it was supposed
to work so I'm not even entirely sure I
wouldn't want him there under Republican
ad
Administration I'm not going to commit
to that opinion but I do like the fact
that Trump can work with people from you
know historically the other team if
they're offering something specific
which they have a strengthen you know
like Elon Musk reducing the government
waste um like RFK Jr working on the food
and
Pharma um I'd like to hear I'd like to
hear more about that argument
because I'm not sure that anybody would
have a problem with somebody like a Mark
Cuban a strong personality who knows how
to get things done going in and fixing
something that maybe would be good for
all of us I don't know because when you
watch you know Kennedy whatever he's
going to do with the food supply it's
not going to look like a demograph plan
it's going to look like what works
period it's just going to be what what
what makes sense what works if he could
pull that off in the
C maybe maybe he's on the pirate ship
you never know now he might not want to
be any part of a trump Administration
so um that may may not be a real
possibility but um my take if you're
kind of wondering what the hell is Mark
cubin doing with all of his uh
interaction on
X
um and um my take I can't read his mind
so this is just one person's take he
says directly in public when he talks
about uh trolling um with musk that he
just enjoys getting under people's skin
and you know he's having fun with it I
think that's probably the primary
motivation but the secondary motivation
is um Cuban may have found a way to
LeapFrog all the political stuff and get
into a position of power maybe the SC
maybe something else but by being very
prominent on social media arguing for
the
Democrats uh Democrats probably just
start seeing him as one of their leaders
so he may have found a way to hack hack
social media to hack the
Democrats by you know agreeing with them
more than they agree with themselves and
arguing better than they argue until
they say you know what this guy's good
why don't we put him in charge
he may have found this clever play which
honestly looks like it's working which
is if he's in the conversation for being
the head of some cabinet
position it
worked he he basically just mixed it up
on social media did all the interviews
and podcasts that people asked them for
didn't matter at all whether his
arguments were good or bad because
nobody can tell honestly we can't tell
whether his arguments are good or bad in
general we can't tell so if he creates
all kinds of energy you start to see him
as the the guy who used to be doing you
know the the tech company and used to be
doing the basketball stuff and I think
he retired from Shark Tank so you see
somebody who's still in his prime has
all these
capabilities you associate him with
politics and he's looking for
work he may have hacked the system
he he may come out like at the top of
some entity when this is all done and it
could be like I say I'm not I wouldn't
predict it but he could easily be have
some important job in a republican
Administration if he negotiated you know
where the uh where the guard rails are
so
anyway uh you know you have to be
careful of the energy monsters because
Cuban has a little bit of the Trump
Magic
which is as long as you're paying
attention he's
winning and he knows that oh by the way
he said that pretty directly in in his
own ways he's talked about how getting
attention Trump's good at it and it
works so if he just learned something
forand he's doing it and he's just
trolling until all the energy is pointed
at him and then he can pick his job it's
kind of brilliant so that's my best
guess of what's going on
um Fox News says there's a study that uh
Google search is favoring Harris over
Trump I guess you don't see Trump's uh
uh web page for the campaign as easily
as you see Harris's and we've already
talked about how the um searches are
hacked but here's my
question does this matter as much as it
did even a few years ago because I I
have the experience of I do way less
search ing on Google than I used to I
used to do it multiple times every day
now when I'm searching on Google I'm
usually looking for maybe a product I
heard of I'm not really looking for any
Politics on
Google and if I were looking for a
campaign um web page it would still come
up where I could find it you know I
wouldn't even search for it unless I was
willing to really look for it and go
there so if it's not optimally placed on
the page but I knew I wanted to go there
I'm still going to find
it and when I want to see the news I go
to
x uh if I were a different person I
might be going to Tik Tok but you can
search for the news on X which I'm far
more likely to do and you can search for
things with your AI you know using it as
the interface to the
search I'm going to say that Google has
the potential for changing election but
that potential may be shrinking as
Google search is becoming less uh a
reflex we have other ways to
search
anyway uh CNN was talking about the
gender gap that you know Harris has more
of the women Trump has more of the men
and here's what I wanted to add about
that do you remember in
2016 um I was somewhat famous for saying
that there would be a shy Trump
supporter effect now I didn't invent the
idea didn't invent it but I was probably
one of the biggest carriers of that
message at the time and the the theory
was that people wouldn't want to admit
they were supporting him because he had
been so maligned by the press that you
just didn't want to be on a
list now
2016 it allegedly a lot of people
believe it caught the Democrats by
surprise you know maybe they would have
done more some say they would have
cheated harder some say maybe Hillary
would have campaigned differently if she
thought that it was going to be that
close so the most people think that 2016
surprised the Democrats in one way or
another and that's why Trump won now in
2020 this the surprise was gone so in
2020 apparently you know they just did a
better ground game whatever it was and
some people say the election was rigged
that's not my point today my point today
is that in
2024 you would have a an effect on top
of the shy Trump
supporters so there will still be some
people who don't want to be on a list of
trump supporters so there'll still be a
little bit of the shy Trump supporter
but there's something else going on
which is Trump
supporters almost to a person
at least the ones who pay attention to
to the news fully understand that their
best strategic bet as a citizen are to
do two things one is to make sure they
vote and maybe get other people to vote
too so
vote but the other is the lie to the
pollsters so that the Democrats are
caught off guard again and here's why I
think that the lying to pollsters is
going to be greater than
2016 because he lost in
2020 and I think the people who saw that
remember that the surprise and lying to
the pollsters was key to
2016 people were sort of onto it by
2020 and that they're going to need to
make that surprise bigger or the
surprise doesn't work and the way you do
that is everybody's heard the strategy
by now most Republicans have at least
heard the idea don't tell the truth to a
pollster and then if it's true that
Democrats are planning to cheat but only
just enough to win they won't be ready
for the margin of Victory and that Trump
could steal another one so here's what
I'm adding I think there's a whole
different motivation for Republicans to
lie upholsters in 2024 that did not
exist at this level any time before
which would suggest when you combine
this with the fact that the consumer
confidence dropped Like a Rock when
Harris got into the into the thick of it
those two factors suggest that Trump's
already
won the vote I'm not predicting he will
get into office that's a separate thing
I think he's going to win the vote maybe
the you know maybe the national vote to
give him a mandate but at the very least
the Electoral College votes so I think
the the vote in question is now answered
in my opinion there's no way no other
way it could go now that I don't know
how to account for sketchy mail-in
ballots from other countries and all
that that's going to be a real problem
so I think the only chance that Trump
has is that the security does their
job that's iffy at the moment keep them
alive and if the Watchers the the Lara
Trump Army of election observers um can
catch things or prevent things on the
day it's going to be dicey I'm still
saying that we're not going to have a
official certified result well not
certified but an official result by the
end of the year we'll figure down
eventually but uh apparently the poly
markets have flipped to to Trump in
Pennsylvania and we'll probably flip
more because Trump is going back to
Butler the place that he was almost
killed once and he's going to have
another rally in the same freaking place
now no matter what you say about that
you have to admit that that sends a good
message doesn't it you can shoot me and
I'll come
back that's a hell of a message and you
could pretend oh that's just being
political oh that's just an obvious
political play yes one that
works it's totally going to work will it
make a difference in Pennsylvania well
let me tell you if if I lived in
Pennsylvania and I knew that a candidate
got shot in my state and they came back
and they stood in the same place they
got shot and they said I'm
back I'd vote for him I mean that would
just that would tear me apart honestly
I'd vote for
him so and then Scott presler is doing
uh incredible work getting people
registered so now there's actually a
republican registration advantage in
some key key places we'll see if that's
enough in the meantime uh Commerce
Secretary Gina Rondo used the word
extinguish when talking about Trump the
that the
Trump you know the the Trump threat I
guess has to be extinguished for good
now that's those are words that somebody
chose to use in public on a candidate
who had two assassination attempts and
there are five assassination teams
allegedly trying to get them maybe there
were three not a little
unclear and you would go on a national
broadcast and use the word
extinguish extinguish for good the for
good is the one that tells you you know
they don't want any arguments from him
while he's
alive so that's
terrible all right I'm going to do a
little bit of
bragging you'll love that do you
remember that when the first
assassination attempt happened in Butler
and we heard that uh the Secret Service
should have done a better job and then
all of the experts came on and said whoa
one thing we know for sure is this must
have been intentional because there's no
way these trained professionals would
make all of these mistakes because there
were a lot of them all at the same day
and then do you remember I alone in the
entire world this is the important part
I alone in the entire planet
said I think it's far more likely that
it's a dilber situation because we've
observed that every single entity in the
United States has become incompetent
lately why would the Secret Service be
immune from the thing that has infected
every other entity
including things sending things into
space including the militaries I mean
really important entities are just
completely corrupt and incompetent and
then the experts the the the people who
had been professional snipers the people
who had been in the Secret Service said
oh no there there's no way all these
trained professionals would make that
many
mistakes are you ready to update your
opinion
yet I I'm going to call it I'm the only
one on the planet it who said
nope that looks like ordinary
incompetence to me now before you get
mad at me I have always said and still
say that doesn't rule out that there
might have been you know one
mole uh as well as some kind of team
that was helping the shooter so those
are still live possibilities and at no
point did I say that that there was no
chance of those so I am
allowing that we could still find out
something deeper about one or both of
the shooters and I think uh Dan banino
knows more than we do and thinks there's
more coming on at least one of them
so I'm going to I'm going to add that to
my list of the
hardest most unlikely predictions that
was completely right because based on
what we know now it it would be really
weird if all of these people were in on
the plot so the person running the
drones didn't have enough train pain in
and it was on tax support do you think
that they were part of the plot or just
 doesn't work and people have to
call tax support and that's the most
normal thing in the world I think it's
normal the communication problems that
they didn't have the right
communication maybe maybe that's where
the person who was the mole made sure
that didn't happen but there were still
like three other ways that they that
they could have known the guy was on the
roof they had 27 minutes when the guy
was walking around so even if you say
the person in charge of communications
was in on the plot which I'm not saying
it was still full of
incompetence and if you look at the fact
there wasn't somebody on the
roof was that a plot it could have been
but still it was incompetence because
there were enough people who knew that
you shouldn't be in that situation that
could have fixed it so whether or not
anybody is a mole and had some kind of
connection with bad forces that wanted
him assassinated not ruling that out at
all I'm just saying mostly the
observable errors were just
incompetence uh underfunded undertrained
underst
staffed all right um Biden of course did
not help Harris because every time he
leaves his cage he says dumbass things
and now he went on The View and he said
that uh he delegated everything to uh to
Harris including foreign policy and
domestic policy now that's not true but
Harris is out there saying we need to do
something new and Biden's out there
saying well you've been you you've been
in charge for three years three and a
half years so that's not helping her
that's like the opposite of helping her
her entire game depends on acting like
she was never in charge because she was
just the VP and then the president goes
out like oh yeah she was totally in
charge you could not
be more damaging to the candidate than
to say that if anybody
listen
um he also said that for years too
little has been done on the fenal
problem he's been in charge for
years and too little was done on the
fentel problem and KL Harris was the
borders
are he is throwing her under the bus so
hard
yeah she's in charge and nothing good
happened those are basically the two
messages he's giving I can't even
believe
it oh I'm seeing uh an
NPC you so you believe that I'm duped
and that the real story is that every
one of those individual people who were
Inc competent were all part of the plot
the clever plot and you think that
that's more like likely than just
ordinary people who were understaffed
and
undertrained but also there might have
been a
plot I would say that you're you're
dealing in magical world where you
magically know things that are not in
evidence I'm dealing with what's in
evidence the incompetence seems
widespread and just everywhere but we
haven't ruled out the plot
all
right um do you remember when James
Carville was helping the Clinton uh
campaign back in the 90s and he decided
brilliantly and famously that they would
put a little sign on the wall that said
it's the economy stupid to remind the
candidate to mention the economy economy
economy because that was their winning
play did that stop being
true when people are more worried about
the economy right now than maybe they
ever have have you noticed that James
Carville is not trotting out his most
famous
advice why wouldn't he use his most
famous advice when we're in exactly the
same situation where the economy is the
biggest
question I can only think of one reason
you wouldn't use your famous
advice because nobody's going to think
Harris is the solution to the economy so
so I think even car the the it's the
economy stupid person is going to
character attack against Trump you don't
go to character attack if you have real
stuff
right it if if a armed burglar comes in
your house and you also have a weapon
you know and your life is in danger do
you throw the weapon down and take a
feather duster and go I got you with the
feather duster no you just why would you
put your weapon down to
that
so if he thought it would work he'd be
saying it's the economy stupid I remind
you that when people have a
catchphrase uh whether they use it
themselves or the news uses it the news
loves catchphrases so they love love
love to use a phrase that the viewers
have heard before and they can you know
instantly know what's happening and
that's why CNN always has the worst than
Watergate guys on
just asked them is this worse than
Watergate oh it's worse than Watergate
and then the public understands oh well
I didn't catch all the details but
sounds like it's worse than
Watergate so
yeah if they thought they could win on
the economy they he'd be doing
it
um you you remember Jason from the Allin
pod who may be watching right now hi
Jason um and it was on was on the The
Morning Show recently and I saw him um
interacting with somebody else on
X and about January 6 and he said this
he said Highly Educated partisans will
make jokes about the January 6 riots I I
think that's me I I do make jokes about
the January 6 riots and I am a highly
educated partisan so I think it's more
than just me but I I fall into this
category Highly Educated partisan who
makes jokes about January 6 riots and
try and confuse citizens uhoh I don't
try to confuse anybody about the
difference between the shaman guy and
the
oathkeepers the former is a sad mentally
ill character that would be the shaman
guy the latter are traitors and
terrorists okay um and he was talking to
somebody named oh I guess he was talking
to Matt Walsh and he said it's critical
the upars this issue for fellow
Americans so we don't have the
oathkeepers and other domestic
terrorists cause damage to our country
well um how many people knew that the
oathkeepers were part of the January 6
event in the comments how many of you
were aware that a group called The
oathkeepers were in any way involved
with October 6 did you know
that I kind of sort of remember hearing
it and what
percentage of the people who were there
what percentage were these uh alleged
dangerous
oathkeepers I don't know 20 people maybe
I don't know the number but
20 there were maybe 100,000 people in
that
area um and were they well armed did
they have their weapons with them when
they penetrated the capital
nobody
did nobody had any weapons with them now
they had blunt objects and there were I
think
49 um law enforcement people were
injured which is not
nothing
but here's my problem with the January 6
thing it seems like every discussion
about January 6 involves one or both
sides
pretending and I can't get past the
pretending
and I don't know what's up with that so
here's the
pretending when I talk about it I of
course know that some of them were bad
actors who did violent things and the of
course the Department of Justice should
take care of that no doubt about
it but there were maybe
1% now if I say that to somebody who's
you has a different um understanding of
the event you can get them to do the
math and come out with with the same
okay it's about 1% were bad characters
and nobody brandished like a firearm or
a knife you know they had tents and
poles and that's bad it's all bad but
now aren we in total
agreement
because
um because Jason mentioned in his
comments that he and I had some
difference on this topic and when I
thought about it I thought what
difference where would we have any
difference
so he he pointed out that there you
should make a distinction between what
the shaman guy did I wouldn't call him a
sad mentally ill character by the way I
think that's
unfair um but I would certainly make a
distinction between the people who are
having fun and protesting and the people
who maybe had at least the potential for
darker intentions but everybody does so
if that's your
complaint that the Republicans are ignor
oring that there were dangerous people
there that's not true every Republican
I've ever talked to 100% is 100% aware
that some number of the protesters were
violent and nobody's in favor of that
not a single person but we can't get
past that even though we agree isn't
that
weird if if we agree that it's about 1%
can't we get to the next
questions but it's like we have to keep
talking about that but you know the
oathkeepers were there right they're
they're in the 1% but you know people
were hurt right right right we've
already agreed they're they're in the
the
1% but you know the some people uh died
a few days after that and but you know
that's
tragic we we're all on the completely
the same page but we can't get past that
question it's the damnest thing so but
let me give you my my take as I gave it
to Jason
onx
um I said to Jason I thought we agreed
that 1% were bad actors and trespassing
doesn't conquer
countries now I think he agrees with
that that you can't conquer a country by
occupying a building no matter how long
you do it um but but that's not his
opinion right I don't want to
mischaracterize him as having a opinion
we we'll get to the meat of it I
think so we would agree that it was 1%
Bad actors and there certainly weren't
enough people there that they could have
conquered a country with any kind of
physical force and we know that uh so
that wasn't enough people or the right
equipment for any kind of a physical
Insurrection and we also know that
there's no evidence that Trump planned
one so there's no evidence that he
planned a physical Insurrection and we
have written
documentation that he tried to um
organize a defense so there would be no
violence that day and he authorized
maximum security well ahead of time that
if they had been employed the violence
would have been maybe eliminated but I
guess it was General Millie who said it
would be a bad look to send the military
in so we decided not to now I've heard
somebody say but Trump still could have
ordered it well could
he cuz to me if Millie can say
no he can say no and he did say no so I
don't think he could have ordered it if
Millie can say no which he
did now I don't think he said no to
Trump I think he said no
to whoever might have been Pelosi I'm
not
sure um
so anyway so we agree they couldn't have
taken over by
force and we and we certainly agree that
the evidence shows that Trump had no
plan for any kind of a forceful takeover
and we know from the messages that even
Don
Jr was trying to stop the violence and
certainly had no no evidence that he
knew of some kind of plot to take over
the country so I think we can rule out
that it was meant to be a physical
takeover and insurrection but there was
also another part which involved the the
alternate electors that Democrats would
call fake electors but we're talking
about the same thing now the Republicans
have received the
narrative um which I accept which is the
whole point of the alternate electors is
to sort of um in a legal sense establish
your claim which gets sorted out by
courts later if it needs to
so to me it was just
paperwork and I don't know which part of
that Jason would disagree with because
there was no chance that the paperwork
unless everybody in the Congress agreed
with it which seems unlikely and the
courts um there's no way that could have
gone anywhere but it might have it might
have been a playkeepers and it might
have been a little bit extra argument to
delay and look a little harder to see if
if there's any irregularities in the
vote that can be quickly determined
which is what the protesters and Trump's
people were asking for
now which
part would we be in disagreement
about we could interpret it differently
and say no no the paperwork part and the
fake electors that was a real
Insurrection and they were you know they
had some chance of getting away with it
no they didn't
no they didn't you can't con conquer the
United States with some fake
paperwork no matter what it says because
there wasn't anybody who had been in
favor of doing that the Republicans
wen't in favor of it you know maybe a
handful of people that were close to
Trump thought it was worth a try and you
also have to factor in that Trump's not
the
lawyer so he was working with two
lawyers at least who said I think this
alternate elector thing you know might
be a good placeholder or whatever words
they used if a lawyer tells you
something's not illegal and then you do
it the courts look on that in a positive
way they're not too happy with the
lawyer and ignorance is no excuse for
breaking the
law but it certainly makes a difference
right if if if the IRS comes after you
and you say you know I didn't even look
at my taxes I this professional
accounting company do it and if there's
a mistake well that would have been on
them now you're still responsible you're
still responsible Even If you hired
accountants but the IRS is going to look
at that and say oh okay that's actually
a reasonable defense so you still might
pay a fine but you're not going to go to
jail if you had professionals giving you
advice and you took the advice and you
wouldn't have known any better so
clearly Trump was not trying to conquer
the country with paperwork clearly he
was not trying to conquer it with any
Force because none of them were even in
the galaxy of anything that could have
worked or anybody would have thought it
worked they only had a the only thing
that could have worked is exactly what
they said they were doing trying to
cause a pause to look more clearly to
make sure the election had not been
stolen now part of the complaint about
Trump is that the Democrats continually
say he knows he
lost that's not
smart it is stupid it's just stupid to
think that anybody knows who won or lost
our elections we don't have that kind of
system we don't have a system where you
can audit it instantly and know who
voted you don't know how many mailin
ballots were dropped in the garbage by
the mail you know the post office
there's a whole bunch of stuff you can't
check
and so to say that Trump knew he
lost isn't just wrong it's stupid it
would be a complete misunderstanding of
our entire election system so um you
have to mind read that he knew he lost
for any of this to work and yet you look
at the public and the Republicans and I
don't know what the number is but maybe
half you know maybe a third or half of
all Republicans think the 2020 election
was
rigged it's a big number so to so if the
if that much of the public believes it
was rigged is it a stretch to think that
the person who lost at the last minute
with these you know sketchy increases in
votes at the last minute for Biden you
really don't think that he believes it
was
stolen in fact there's almost nothing
that I'm more certain of than the fact
that Trump believes it was stolen now
that's different for me saying it was
because I don't have proof it was stolen
or not so I don't assert that I know
that but I'm really confident that he
thinks it was stolen I'm very confident
of
that so anyway I don't know uh where
Jason and I would have any disagreements
he might uh frame it differently or
characterize it differently but on the
facts I think we have the same facts now
and I don't think he would argue with me
about mind reading Trum
you know because people are innocent
till proven guilty so if somebody does
things which are completely consistent
with being Innocent but also there's a
narrative where that same set of facts
would be consistent with somebody who
had done something
bad they're still
innocent that's how it
works if there're two stories and one is
perfectly consistent with no crime
whatsoever but yet the same facts could
have happened if there was a crime
that's
innocent and it's worth noting that he's
never been charged with or convicted of
insurrection he's been indicted for 93
crimes that were so weak that even
Democrats thought it was
lawfare just just think about this
93 indictments
for things that were so ridiculously
weak and sketchy that he'll probably not
have to spend any time in court and
probably all of it will be overthrown in
higher courts that can be taken to
higher courts so we know that they would
charge him with anything that they
thought could
stick but they didn't try
Insurrection the the one that was most
important to their entire narrative
about him that's the only one they
decided not to pursue after the January
6th thing did all this
evidence yeah so I feel
like Jason if you're watching you
probably will be watching because
somebody will say hey he talked about
you so if you miss it I'm pretty sure
you'll catch up with it um I'd love to
know if we disagree on any facts first
of all and then given those facts would
you agree that it would be completely
consistent
with he he secretly in his mind you know
knew that he lost or thought he lost but
he was trying to get away with something
but is also 100% consistent with
somebody who really thought the election
was rigged and thought his his lawyers
had given him good enough advice that he
had some kind of unlikely but possible
path to maybe find out what happened in
time to improve the result and and uh
save the country from a stolen election
if the facts support both
narratives you have to pick the innocent
that's that's where we are now I believe
the innocent one is the true
one but even if I
didn't I'm I'm going to be consistent
that's you're innocent and if they don't
even charge you with the crime they
don't even have enough to get you know
you they always say you can indict a ham
sandwich so clearly if they had any
evidence they could indict him so
obvious viously there there's
not anyway Hezbollah is trying to decide
whether they want to respond to Israel
or look weak those are the two choices
now I saw somebody say that Netanyahu
Netanyahu had ordered quote full force
in Lebanon despite the us trying to tell
them to pull back now I think the US's
job is to act like we're trying to make
peace while actually of course probably
secretly being on Israel's side and
wanting them to do as much damage as
they can to the
terrorists but so the US is playing this
game like oh we're the
peacekeepers but they're not really too
relevant to Israel's decisions um I
remind you that I do not back
Israel because they don't back me does
everybody understand that when I talk
about Israel I'm just going to observe
and I'm going to say stuff like well if
that were us that's what we'd do because
that's just an observation
but I don't back them first of all I'm
American and I back America and that's
it I don't back any other country even
you know
allies and um we can call them allies
and I think they're important allies and
we should stay allies but don't ask me
to back the the country that's not my
job they're doing fine and um I simply
uh note that
if I were Israel I would say there's
probably never a better time to go full
force at Hezbollah because the sort of
the the Zeitgeist and the opportunity
and the fact that they're currently
weakened and it's not that far from the
October 7th event so you've got all the
justifications they've sent Rockets your
way you have everything you need now
that Gaza is kind of under
control it would be amazing
well probably amazingly stupid if they
didn't just try to grind hbel into dust
while they have the chance and again I'm
not recommending it I'm saying if you
were in that situation you'd be saying
well if if we think we're ever going to
fight these longer so I think it's
inevitable that Israel is going to go
harder than people wanted them to go in
uh against Hezbollah but I don't back
Israel because they don't back me
reciprocity I demand it and and by the
way Israel could back me by denouncing
the ADL which has nothing to do with
Israel but they could still back
me if they did it might change my mind
not that I care one way or the other
it's not important all right that's all
I got for you I'm going to go talk to
