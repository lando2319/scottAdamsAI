good morning everybody
and welcome
to the highlight
of the entire civilization it's called
coffee with scott adams and if you
didn't think it could get any better
surprise
it's whiteboard day
yes we will have a whiteboard in which
i'll connect the uh seemingly different
fields
of politics artificial intelligence the
simulation and twitter
yeah i'll do all that today in order for
you to be primed and ready for that this
mind-blowing experience that is
the simultaneous sip and coffee with
scott adams
you're going to need to get ready and
all you need to be ready for this
amazing amazing experience is a copper
bug or glass of tanker jealous to sign
the canteen sugar flash
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure it's the dopamine
of the day
it's the thing that makes everything
better
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
happens now go
oh
that ladies and gentlemen
is amazing i'd like to start with a
helpful uh tip
have you ever bought anything on amazon
well if you have and you've bought more
than one thing you may have run into a
situation i run into often
it's called the
scale problem
as in
i think i'm buying a big old bag of
something
and it shows up like it's a free sample
how many times does that happen to you
you know you buy a chair for your living
room and it shows up it's like a it's a
barbie chair you're like you know that
looked like a real chair
in my defense i did not check the specs
it looked like a chair it said a chair i
bought the chair
it just happened to be two inches tall
well this brings me to my recent
purchase
which should have been about this tall
about this wide
the big one
but when you look at the little picture
it looks exactly the same
and so i suggest the following
human interface improvement for amazon
jeff bezos if you're listening
i suggest this
in any situation in which there might be
any potential ambiguity about the size
and scale of a of an object it is not
good enough to include it only in the
description which you must click
you must also have a human hand in the
picture
preferably the same human hand because
if this had a human hand in it i would
know exactly how big it was every single
time
and how hard is it to put a hand in a
picture not very hard you can even
digitally add it just nearby
hand
picture
so
please
user interface developers at amazon who
are by the way
some of the best in the world
uh amazon has some of the best user
interface but that one thing
that one thing bites me in the ass about
one time in five probably literally i i
just get some weird size
all right
uh
you know lately if you've been watching
my live streams you know that i've
been adding quite a bit to civilization
uh i've had insightful comments uh
ranging from oh i don't know geopolitics
you know one of my many sort of fields
of expertise
uh the supply chain where i've you know
wasn't an expert until just a few weeks
ago now i am
and of course the global economy
something that
you know people like me know everything
about
so while i've made these tremendous
contributions to society it seems that
the only thing they got picked up by the
media that i did in the last two weeks
was the following tweet
in which i tweeted
madonna is transforming into jar jar
binks and no one is talking about it
yes of all the things i offered to this
world
my many
nuggets of wisdom
only one left the little bubble which is
this live stream
into the the larger world to make it end
and it was that tweet madonna is
transforming it to jar jar binks and no
one is talking about it
so that'll keep me humble for a while
all right uh
in an ongoing trend which you should
watch very carefully
you've heard me say this before
but the more that it happens the story
gets bigger right which is that
mushrooms are becoming mainstream
almost instantly there's something about
2022 that's happening that
is hard to explain but now the
washington post has a story that your
headline says
psychedelics may use cancer patients
depression and anxieties
you know quote these drugs were banned
decades ago my clinical trial suggests
they might have a meaningful
positive effect in treating mood issues
it's happening
that
i don't think those of you who
have had no let's say experience
with mushrooms
i don't think you know how big this is
this is just about the biggest story in
the world
you know obviously the economy and and
war and viruses are big stories but in
terms of our uh
let's say our subjective experience of
life
this is the biggest story
this is deeply transforming of
humanity i mean i'm not sure anything's
going to be the same after this
and you don't have to get everybody on
mushrooms that's not necessary
you just have to get the right people on
mushrooms
right not everybody you just got to get
the right people out of
you know what i mean
let me ask you this do you think putin
has done mushrooms
serious question
serious question how many of you think
putin has done mushrooms
i would bet
a very large sum of money is not
because you know what you don't find
yourself in this situation if you had
and again people who have experience
with this say are saying oh yeah i get
what you're saying
and those who don't have experiences
like i don't even understand what that
means
like how how do you know he hasn't done
mushrooms
do you know how i know putin hasn't done
mushrooms
because he wouldn't be putin if he had
it would have fundamentally rewired him
like he'd be playing
yeah he
exactly is an ego killer
uh russia
especially with putin at the helm
has is suffering almost a personality
disorder
that they have to own ukraine and they
have to subjugate people they have to be
awesome they have to protect their egos
and russia's history and you know the
russian people
blah blah blah
you take mushrooms once that all goes
away
it goes away and then you start thinking
well
what would make everybody happy
and if i made everybody happy would that
work out for me too
probably
probably
so suddenly everything is different
yeah mushrooms changes everything might
be world peace
and by the way i don't recommend that
you try mushrooms let me be clear
because this is a public forum and who
knows who's watching
i do not recommend any illegal drugs
talk to your doctors only
um
i'm going to give you a little tip that
may completely change the lives of some
of you
this is one of my favorite things things
to do
and i'm gonna make my claim really small
so that it's not some ridiculous over
claim
my claim is i'm going to give you a
reframe
that might uh solve
i don't know one percent maybe less
maybe fewer
uh
of your mental problems
i think about one out of 100 if you
might just walk away from this live
stream saying
okay that just changed my life
all right
so i'm setting myself up for
you know a pretty pretty high uh
bar it goes like this
i'm going to start with this assumption
and then i'll give you the idea the
assumption is this and i want to see if
you'll agree with the starting premise
that we we think other people think like
us
do you buy the first
assumption
that all of us
were biased by the belief
that other people's brains are
processing things somewhat similar to
ours
all right so that's the first assumption
i think you i think you largely believe
that
we think they process like us
now the the nose i'm seeing i i think
you're maybe interpreting the question a
little bit differently
because we do know that people are
different at the same time we think
they're not right so we do hold two
beliefs that are opposites at the same
time
we hold the belief that people think
like us
and that we act on it at the same time
we know it's not true
we know people don't think the way we
think right but you act like it even
though we know it's not true
so
that's the first part that's just that
um and i'm going to be talking to people
who feel uh they have low self-esteem
and the other people judge them poorly
is there anybody watching who would fall
into that category you have low
self-esteem
and you believe other people are judging
you
quite a few all right
that's a lot of yeses
the yeses just start popping up on on
the on the locals platform
now not not everybody
all right
all right now here's the reframe
specifically for people who who live in
let's say their reality
is that they feel
uh they have low self-esteem or they
feel worthless
and they feel other people judging them
here's the reframe that fix it fixes it
stop judging other people
that's it
that's it
stop judging other people
do you know why
if you can train yourself to stop
judging other people which would take a
while you have to just keep reminding
yourself not to do it
the the trick that i use is that
uh i i literally believe that everybody
has the same value
because there's no such thing as some
metric for judging your value
you know you could say
who's more valuable for having a baby
well women you know of a certain age and
a certain health situation
but are they more valuable than
everybody else no they they fit a
certain
requirement a need you know they're
important in that way
but i don't fundamentally believe that
anybody's
worth more than anybody else right the
law doesn't
judge you that way unless you break the
law
so if you could learn to simply talk
yourself into not judging other people
do you know what would happen
in theory
in theory if you stop judging other
people
reflexively and just
train yourself just don't think that way
just everybody's equal we're all the
same
as soon as you do that
you're going to stop worrying about what
they think of you
you know why
because you can hold in your head two
thoughts that don't make sense together
one is that you know everybody acts the
same and the other is that everybody
thinks differently we kind of hold them
the same but as soon as you see other
people thinking like you do
if your view is that everybody is the
same
and then you imagine that they have the
same view as you which they don't
but this is the trick right
if you have a bias
and you know you do if you have a bias
toward thinking people do or should
think the way you think
then change the way you think
are you following it if you change the
way you think
it should change your
subjective impression
of what other people are thinking of you
i think one percent of you just got
cured
i'm watching the comments comment on
locals because they come in faster
and uh
people are having a good reaction to it
now
what would be the downside of trying it
do you see any
is there any downside
of simply trying to judge other people
less
as your own solution to how you feel
about other people thinking of you
there's no there's no downside can you
think of anybody who would say no you
should be more judgmental about people's
worth
now remember i'm not telling you
that you should embrace their choices
not that you can still disagree with
their choices of course
just don't judge them they're just you
know people like we're all the same
value-wise in terms of value
all right
and i would say that as as awesome as i
often feel i am in some you know narrow
areas
i have good self-esteem about some
specific things that i do or have done
but of all the things you could do in
the world the things that you could be
good at
what percentage of all the things that a
person can be good at
am i good at
like
less than 0.001
that's about as good as you can get
like if you if you take the most awesome
person
just
think of your friend or maybe in
somebody famous who whoever you think
hits all the notes
like oh that's the person who's really
got it together they can they can do
this and they can do that and they're
this and that of all the things that
people can do
what percentage can they do
really
about .0001
almost exactly the same as you
like if you look at it mathematically
nobody can do anything i mean it all
rounds to zero
so to imagine that somebody else's 0.001
effectiveness in life is is so much
better than your 0.001
i mean i guess it is
mathematically but not in a real way
so that should help some of you
um
good news the good guys win sometimes
do you remember the story of author alex
epstein
who found out that the wall street
journal was planning a hip piece on him
before his book
uh even came out
and
so
he uh actually organized a uh his book
is called fossil future
and i guess the washington post had come
up with some kind of angle
maybe because they don't like a book
that is a
let's say not as anti-fossil fuel as
they would like you know what i mean
that they might try to suppress that
kind of a book especially if it's good
they don't try to suppress a book that's
bad do they
bad in the sense that you won't want to
read it
nobody's going to write a whole article
about a book nobody's going to read
so they're afraid of this book
clearly there wouldn't be a hit piece on
it unless they were afraid of it in
terms of it
threatening the worldview which they
present
so um
what followed was alex epstein quite
brilliantly organized a number of blue
check and other people on twitter
and maybe other social media i'm not
sure but on twitter at least
and many of us had
a dog in the fight
right
i certainly did to me this was personal
this was absolutely personal right i
mean i know alex epstein just from you
know
digital contacts
but to me it was personal
because i have been the subject of hit
pieces
and there's not much you can do about it
it's a pretty helpless feeling
so the fact that he was taking the fight
to the washington post and found a way
to actually get traction which is
organizing enough people
to embarrass
them preemptively embarrass them the
result was the article did come out it
was delayed
how long
delayed a week i think
and and when it did come out they had
removed 90 percent of the
bad content you know the the hip piece
content
including any
including any allegation
that when he was 18 year old years old
he wrote something that somebody thought
was racist if you looked at it it
wouldn't be right it isn't but that's
the way things get framed
completely gone
the the main thing that he was concerned
about was the
i would say inappropriate allegation
that justin didn't make sense in a good
world right like you you have to live in
a bad world for
that kind of thing to exist those
accusations and uh
he did what i've never seen anybody do
he actually preemptively
took down a hit piece
that's pretty hard to do i mean maybe
some billionaires done it by money and
threats or something but
i've never seen a regular person you
know an author do it before that's a
first and i wonder if there's any kind
of
is this telling us there's any kind of
shift in power
because i've been telling you that that
the
um the power of the internet dads or
just the you know the people who have
some credibility on twitter
is growing
and it's it's pretty important
i think this really is sort of a turning
point in
uh understanding where power lies in
society
um
i'm going to tie together a few stories
in ways that will amaze you
so keep in mind that a story
uh about the press and about uh alex
epstein
so
because we'll circle back to some things
so i've talked about this before but
it's more relevant today they do you
remember when paypal was started
paypal had a little group of people who
went on
several of them to do bigger things than
paypal
so for example peter thiel uh i believe
was one of the early
financers for facebook
so peter thiel saw the the potential of
facebook really early
became a billionaire uh
in part because of that reid hoffman who
was part of that paypal group
he founded linkedin which is effectively
uh you know an online resume but it's a
social network as well
so kind of weird that two of the paypal
people would later go on
to have you know major
influence on what became social media
networks and now elon musk one of the
paypal
originals
uh is buying into twitter
which again shows at least his
appreciation and understanding
of social media in a way other people
don't
now what is the what are the odds
the three of the people from this one
company which is often talked about as
being
special in some way
have all had major influence on social
media platforms specifically
not just going on to do other unicorns
but social media platforms
and i asked what is it that made paypal
work
because i've never understood how the
original digital money products ever got
anybody to trust them they weren't a
bank they were startup
how does like a startup of nobodies get
you to put their you know trust you with
their money
how did that ever happen
because the hard part wasn't the
technology i'm guessing i'm guessing the
hard part was convincing people to use
it
how the hell did they do that
i mean really
that's one of the most uh impressive
untold stories or maybe a citizen book
or something but i've never heard it
so i say that because there's something
extra going on with all of those paypal
founders
and what i mean is here's what it looks
like from the outside right so this is
just my speculative outsider's view of
what it looks like
it looks like they all learn to engineer
comprehensively
and what i mean by that is people
sometimes engineer a product
but they don't engineer the human who's
using the product
is there something about the interface
or the way it's used or how it touches
our minds that's incomplete
what's different about paypal
and then facebook linkedin and now
twitter
is that all of them have found an
interface that connects the product
right to your brain
product directly connected to your brain
what does that make you think of
elon musk's other product right
neuralink where you'll have actually you
know chips in your head potentially some
day
so connecting the product
directly to the brain and treating it as
always one system
you're going to say well everybody does
that they all they all consider the
human user and they all consider the
product but nobody does it like they do
it
nobody has done it
in a way that you can't stop using the
product
yeah nobody's come close to the
effectiveness that
that these folks
have in understanding the brain product
interface
keep that in mind
because it's going to come back today
all right
um
here's an interesting question about
elon musk since he's in the news a lot
why do conservatives like him so much do
you ever wonder about that
because i'm pretty sure he's never
labeled himself a conservative
i'm pretty sure he's never labeled
himself a republican
what is it that makes people like him
and
if i told you that there's somebody who
started the biggest electric
car company
would you say well there's somebody
conservatives are going to love
because he's he's all about the green
stuff and climate change
it doesn't really make sense does it
but he's very much embraced
let me tell you what i think it is
and this you could take this just as a
compliment to conservatives because it's
one that i feel because i feel the same
thing i do not identify as conservative
don't identify as republican
and i feel that i'm
fully embraced
by conservatives all the time
and i think it's the same reason or at
least there's some similar reasons and
it goes like this
let's just take uh
elon for example
uh oh and also he's an immigrant
so every every uh stereotype you should
imagine
about conservatives or republicans he
sort of violates some of the biggest
ones right
and yet
he's widely liked so here's what i think
it is number one
i've never seen him disrespect
republicans or conservatives
agree or disagree
i've never seen it
have you ever seen him disrespect
republicans or conservatives
and you you could say almost everybody's
done that
almost everybody's done that
if they're on the left
and if they're on the right you even the
people on the right uh insult themselves
conservatives fight with each other
right
but i've never seen him disrespect
anybody on the right
now has he ever disrespected anybody in
the left
well he's going after woke-ism a little
bit hasn't he
right yeah i feel like he has
now that doesn't mean he's associated
with the right
it could mean that he's more bothered by
something he sees somewhere else that
doesn't mean he's associated with one
side
all right bill maher
talks more about the problems on the
left lately but it doesn't make him on
the right
um
here's some other things
he
musk as i just talked about with the
paypal people he incorporates human
motivation and psychology into his
systems
who does that sound like
somebody builds a system
in his case is more like a product
that's supported by various systems
but
who is most like that that's
conservatives republicans
they they consider human motivation when
they design a system which is well
you know if we do build a system where
we just give you stuff what's the human
motivation
take the stuff and not work all right
so i think conservatives appreciate him
for understanding that if you forget
about the human motivation you get
everything wrong like democrats often do
with their systems
the next thing is that he's transparent
about both his thinking process and his
motivations
wouldn't you say
do you ever think to yourself i think he
has a hidden agenda
i guess people say that about all
billionaires but it doesn't feel like it
it doesn't feel like he has some hidden
agenda because i feel like he tells you
exactly what he wants
and then he does it in public
it's pretty clear
right so people like that just in
general people like transparency he
shows his work right and obviously he
likes freedom
so that that binds them to the right
even if he's not associated with right
he just likes freedom
and free speech
and he also works harder than most
people
have you ever seen a conservative
dislike somebody who works as hard as
elon musk
you could do almost everything else
wrong from a conservative's point of
view as long as you're obeying the law
you know you have to get that right but
if you're obeying the law
and you're working 14 hours a day or
whatever the hell he was doing 18 hours
a day
conservatives kind of like you
because you work hard
it's pretty basic it's not hard to be
liked by the right
and and he has lots of kids
what does he have six or seven kids
conservatives like that you know family
oriented in his own way and and i think
his family's situation is completely
non-standard and still
still conservatives embrace it so here's
the message from this
we're locked into a world in which we
think the only way you can run for
office
is to be totally one thing or totally
the other thing you're either a
republican or you're a democrat
i think elon musk proves that if you
were smart about it you wouldn't have to
be on a team
that you could get the other team to
like you
easily
respect them
give give some you know appreciation to
what it is that they want
like freedom
be transparent
outwork them
right how hard would it be
you can have very different opinions
from conservatives and still have a lot
of them a lot of them say you know
damn it
i don't like all your policies but i
love the way you're treating everything
like i love the way you approach it
even if i'm not the same page with your
solution you can you could you could
totally get people to switch sides if
you played it right
all right
now i tweeted the other day and i said i
didn't know if
twitter was already changing its
algorithm
to you know maybe sweep things under the
rug before elon musk gets a look at the
algorithm and i wondered if my
engagement and number of followers per
day was going up because of that but
then somebody pointed out that elon musk
had liked one of my tweets
which would also explain why my number
of new users went up so today it's still
up over a thousand
new users today which is about i don't
know
five or ten times normal
so but that that could still be the
spillover from the one tweet so the
tweet he liked was this one
and
this is really telling this actually
should be the biggest story in the news
but it's not the biggest story there
should be that musk
liked this following tweet
because it suggests that his mind is at
least
if he hasn't decided this at least it's
compatible with how he's thinking so
here's the tweet he liked
i said wait until elon musk starts
looking under the hood at twitter and
finds out how the algorithm works i said
that's coming
and it is going to be glorious
now he liked that
now
does that not suggest
that he plans to or would like to
get access to the algorithm
that's everything that's like the whole
game
civilization will be completely changed
if he gets access to that algorithm
i think
i think it's that big
and it looks like
you know by the by the fact that he
liked the tweet
it looks like he at least has some
impulse in that direction
don't know if he can do it don't know
what will come of it
but he liked it
so so he's not disagreeing with the
notion
that him looking at the
algorithm would be maybe interesting
we're also hearing that twitter is
working on the edit button
that makes sense to me in the
elon musk era of twitter
because the edit button um does add some
let's say clarity to things doesn't it
now i do think the edit button should be
constructed this way
if you edit something it should be shown
as an edit
and you should be able to swipe that
edit and see the original it should be
that easy it should just be a swipe
if you if you if you can engineer it
easily now i don't even want to have it
a link
because you know how instagram has the
swipe model you can tell they're in
amazon does it too where there's a
little dots at the bottom of the picture
so you know there's some more pictures
if you just swipe in that direction
if you if you could swipe it and see the
original
that's a good edit to me
i'd also like
i would also like a notification sent
to everyone who interacted with it if it
gets edited
with one exception
if you go to edit your own tweet it
should give you a choice to say are you
editing for let's say grammar
there might be a better way to express
it or or content
in other words are you changing the
content
if you say you are
changing the content for whatever reason
doesn't matter the reason then everybody
who interacted with it gets a notice
with the new content and this is an edit
how about that
you can do that right
because the problem is that people see
the fake news and they don't see the
correction
it's one of the biggest problems on the
internet right but you can fix that by
making sure that every person who saw
bad news
that that got corrected
sees the correction just the system
doesn't you interacted with it you get
the correction
now
immediately you can see
that the edit button is way more than a
user interface
am i right
as soon as i said this did you suddenly
connect that this isn't just about how
easy it is to edit things
it's about free speech
it's about mind control
because if the other process
allows people to rethink what they may
have believed on first look which the
current process doesn't right now you
look at something and you never know
it's corrected you just move on
so this is this gets to transparency it
gets to
um
brainwashing it gets to fake news
this is like deeply deeply important
and it's happening coincidentally the
same time elon musk buys 9.2 percent of
twitter
on april 1st
twitter said it was working on an edit
button
literally as an april fool's joke
april 1st
like was that uh not too long ago right
and suddenly
elon musk buys 9.2 of it and now it's
real that was suddenly real they're
really working on an edit button
i feel like that might have been a
recent change right
who knows
uh it's also possible that part of part
of twitter thought it was a joke and
part of it
was actually working on it
and the other part didn't know about it
that's possible
um
all right
so here's how you fix everything in the
world
let me tie everything together for you
you buy 9.2 percent of twitter to gain
influence over it
you don't need to buy the whole company
you just have to buy enough to get a
board seat and influence
then you introduce uh you use that
influence to introduce algorithm
transparency
let everybody see the algorithm and
maybe even
jack dorsey's plan of choosing your own
algorithm based on what you prefer
once
once the algorithm is transparent
you've created the first unbiased
platform
right
it wouldn't be biased by the algorithm
uh people would just be getting what
they wanted
and now of course that could be its own
bias but in theory you could have a more
unbiased platform
and here's why that changes everything
whiteboard time
it's whiteboard time
here's how everything in the world works
all in one whiteboard
uh
twitter is like the user interface to
the simulation
in other words twitter is the the lever
that ultimately through its connections
makes us think the way we think and
imagine the reality of the way we
imagine it and it works this way
journalists are all on twitter
when i speak in absolutes you can adjust
in your head too well he means most of
them so most journalists are on twitter
and journalists are the ones who create
the narrative and the narrative is what
programs the citizens in other words
changes everything
if you can program the citizens
differently
or better more effectively more honestly
perhaps you get a whole different
outcome
so now
elon musk
now has
some kind of control we don't know how
much yet
on twitter
that means that he will be feeding
journalists potentially
potentially we don't know this yet
but he could be feeding them for the
first time something like accurate news
imagine a journalist
who is reporting fake news on television
while twitter is accurately allowing
people to see what's true
because that's not the case
the case right now is that people watch
democrat news
and then they go to twitter and they see
democrat tweets
so there's nothing to check their work
and it's the same the other way right
republicans watch republican news and
then they go watch republican tweets
but what if the algorithm could be
tweaked so that people could actually
see reality across bubbles
can elon musk
a member of the paypal originals
one of the three people we know
understands human motivation and how the
the wiring of the brain and the wiring
of the device have to be
considered one system in a way nobody
else ever has as effectively
can he
create a situation where journalists
would be and here's the key
embarrassed
embarrassed
to tell bias stories on television
i think he can
i think that's within the the doable
range
and once you get a situation where a
journalist can't go on another platform
and lie because they will be devoured on
twitter
for lying
by their own team by the way i'm not
talking about uh republicans yelling at
you know uh
jim acosta
right i don't think acosta cares how
many republicans are mad at him
but betty cares how many democrats hear
that his story is fake
am i right because that would hurt
so if you can create a situation where
the journalists are embarrassed into
telling the truth
and you would only need one major
platform to do that
and twitter's the one that journalists
are pretty much stuck on they're not
going to leave twitter
uh that changes the narrative that
changes the citizens the citizens can
change anything
and so this story is way bigger
the the the elon musk buys 92.2 of
twitter is
way way bigger than you think it is
and here's the cool thing about it
musk believes in the simulation
or at least
he talks about a lot we don't we don't
know his internal thoughts
but he talks about the simulation being
you know the most likely explanation of
reality
and i i also embrace that same idea
and
i have this impression
that when you embrace the idea that you
are living in a simulation and that
we're literally software
you can start to see the machinery
and i don't know how much of it is an
illusion
probably all of it
but you get the sense that you can start
seeing like
how to reprogram it from the inside
and that feels like what all the all the
paypal people can see
i feel like they see themselves in the
simulation but they can also see the
code and they can reach in and tweak it
musk is doing that with twitter
the the code that holds our illusion of
reality together is what we collectively
see in the media
he figured out
how to control him
through twitter
now jeff bezos
took over the washington post and got
you know a big voice
but the washington post is subsidiary no
not sincere is uh
is lower in the chain of influence than
twitter
twitter affects all journalists
washington post just has a few
so whoever controls twitter controls the
washington post
so if you're watching your billionaire
chess
elon musk just took one of bezos pieces
off the board
because he's now at a higher level of
influence than any of the organs below
it including the washington post
in other news
i asked on twitter if i could get a
black american cartoonist
to help me design a black cast member
for the dilbert comic
now i have forever wanted to have a more
diverse
cast because all the usual reasons right
you you want to attract other um
you want more more of the public to like
your product
so why wouldn't i put people in there
that would attract
more customers so of course i've always
wanted to have more diversity in the
cast and the reason i didn't do it is i
couldn't figure out how
i couldn't figure out how because if i
put
diverse characters in a strip
and give them character flaws which is
you have to because it's a comic if the
characters don't have flaws they're not
funny
imagine me listen i have a character
right now wally he's a
white character with six strands of hair
now his defining characteristic is that
he's lazy he doesn't do work
could i have introduced a minority
character and given that character any
kind of a
defect
like the wally character
nope
no way i could get away with that
how about my alice character
she's defined by her you know
easily angered
kind of tough attitude
imagine if i put that exact attitude
into a minority character
suddenly i'm in trouble right but these
are just universal qualities that
everybody has in every group there's no
group who doesn't have an angry person a
lazy person etc right
but because of my situation and the way
the world works i can't do the thing
everybody wants
like you know not everybody but but the
world wants me to be more diverse i
think
and i i appreciate the impulse
it makes sense
uh
i'm seeing some super racist things in
the comments but because they're funny
they they don't bother me as much
i've told you that rule right
that you can be pretty offensive if
you're also funny
like people will will accept that
balance but if it's not funny it's just
racist
it's just racist it was funny
so
anyway i guess that was done well in
this case
so
um i started writing for this character
because uh
i i hit on an angle
that i think i can make work
i'm gonna preview it for you so before
it appears in deliberate and i'm not
sure it will
i've already written them and they will
get drawn
but they might not run
you know by the time my editor takes a
look at it and somebody has a
conversation with me and
you know they might not run
but here's what i'm going to do i'm
going to introduce the black character
and
the character is going to have one
interesting
let's say personality characteristic
the black character
will identify as white
and it's going to cause a huge problem
for everybody
do you know why it's a problem
because he's hired for uh the diversity
targets
but he refuses to identify as black
he is black
but he refuses to identify then here's
the second level
you'll never know if he's joking
that's the second level you don't know
if he's just with the boss
because it makes everybody uncomfortable
so i think the character will be
somebody who
is having fun
with the fact that people are getting
uncomfortable
with the way he chooses to identify
because it just screws everything up
nothing works
right
now i think i can make that work
somebody says cringe does anybody else
like that
so i saw one comment that says cringe
i think it's actually a good a good
angle
right because here's the thing
is you haven't seen it before as far as
i know it would be fresh which is weird
yeah
all right
yeah it's hard it's hard to not pander
isn't it that's that's the thing i
wanted to avoid from a creative
perspective it would be easy to pander
and make the audience happy
but it's just too icky
yeah
i wanna i wanna treat the character
respectfully while
you know while highlighting you know
something irregular
i've told you before that
the the sign of a good comedy approach
is if the uh the setup makes you laugh
you haven't even heard the punch lines
so the joke isn't even present but you
just hear the situation and you're
already laughing
so that's one of these where it was it's
easy to write to because the situation
itself is fun
that's your humor tip of the day
all right here's a question for you
given that we know democrats believe
they will lose in the upcoming elections
2022 and probably 2024.
what are they going to do about it
it seems like they need a nuclear option
am i right
because all of the normal things that
democrats do they don't really look like
they're going to work
and i think the nuclear nuclear option
i'm not i'm not talking about cheating
in the elections i think the nuclear
option is going to be a new hoax
and my god it's going to be a big one
so i'm going to predict
that the the next hoax will be bigger
than anything we've seen
and just crazier
because they've got to get bigger than
russia collusion january 6 insurrection
hoax the fine people oaks drinking
bleach oaks the russian bounty in
afghanistan hoax i mean they have a lot
of hoaxes
that sort of set the uh
set the quality expectation for hoaxes
i feel like they've got a
they got to take it up a level and what
the hell is that going to look like
i mean
this is stuff that democrats actually
believed
democrats believed all of this
like everything i just listened they
actually believed it all
yeah they believed that democrats
believe that black lives matter was an
organic movement
and it wasn't about somebody funding
people
they believed everything
now i'm not saying that republicans
don't also believe things that aren't
true
but uh it's less relevant to this
question because
the democrats need a hoax
whereas the republicans don't do you
know what the republicans need to win
play it as straight down the center as
you can
just talk about reality
reality is all the republicans need to
get elected but the democrats can't get
elected based on reality
that option is gone
i guess this is the best way to say it
republicans can definitely get elected
based on reality
right
anybody disagree
that the polls and and just the facts we
all observe are just so
clear at this point
that all you need is to do is tell the
truth just be straight with the american
people how could you fail to get elected
at this point
right but the democrats can't use
transparency because that would work
against them
the only thing they have
is a bigger hoax it's all they have
and ordinarily you it would be hard to
predict they could outdo the russia
collusion oaks but they have to
they have to
they don't have any other play except
losing i suppose
so
uh i predict
that the next hoax
is going to be magnificent
just magnificent
china collusion hoax yeah maybe
maybe
all right
chinese in lockdown 23
cities
so over 193 million people have some
form of lockdown and they represent
22 of china's gdp
or in some form of lockdown according to
brokerage firm nomura
uh however
i i loved something about this story
which is the
the resilience of humans
people are really damn resilient
maybe not every one of us but
collectively
my god we can adjust the stuff fast
apparently in china since there's
lockdowns but they don't want the
banking system and everything to
collapse there are a bunch of people who
have put tents next to their cubicles to
keep the banking system over so they
literally live they live on the floor
next to their cubicle
because they have to
to keep the country running
and now i think we would have done that
here i think in america if you had to
you know if you didn't have any other
choice i think we would have pitched
tents next to cubicles too
but i just love how
how uh
i know spunky people are
they'll do anything to keep the system
working
or work for home yeah i don't know that
banks always have a work for home option
because of security
that may have changed though
somebody do a fact check on me
back in the old old days
you sort of had to be on site for some
of the highest security stuff
has that changed
maybe it's changed with better security
systems i don't know
uh banks work from home now but every
job in the bank
i i feel as if
uh there's secures way there are secure
ways of logging in now remotely
there should be
yeah okay well let's assume they could
have worked for home so i have no idea
why they're sleeping intense
so we learned today that the obama
administration is giving free phones to
illegal immigrants
what's your first reaction to that
free phones to illegal immigrants
my first reaction was i thought it was a
joke
did you the first time you saw it did
you think it was real
well they're not giving phones to
illegal immigrants nobody would do that
it's real
it's real
now does anybody remember an idea i had
about giving free phones to immigrants
let's see if anybody can remember that
so if you've been following me for a
while
do you remember my idea for giving free
phones to immigrants
yeah and
what did
jen sake say was the reason for the free
phones
to track them
and also to allow them to check back in
is that good enough
is that a good enough reason for you
that they can track them
well they don't plan to deport them so
what's the point right if you're not
going to deport them
why do you even need to track them
just to call them and tell them to hey
hey really i'll turn off your phone if
you don't show up to the court
appointment
i think they would let their phone be
turned off right so i don't know how it
works the way they've designed it let me
tell you how i suggested designing it
the way i suggested it is that
the only way an illegal alien could be
paid
was if they had the phone
and it had tracking on
and the payments came digitally through
that phone like it would have to be that
phone no other phone
because if you said the only way you
could get paid for your work
is through the phone
maybe they'd keep them
and maybe that would be a way for people
to get temporary workers and that the
phone would act like a work visa
right
so
now you need a republican administration
to make this work so if there was
somebody who had the phone and they were
just living here illegally and they
weren't working or adding anything to
the system
you know then the republicans could say
oh well we know where you are and they
go get you because they're tracking your
phone
wouldn't be much of that i suppose
but i do think so here's what i think
there's one thing i agree with aoc about
and i know you're going to hate this
if there's anything that would trigger
you more than that i don't know what it
would be there's one thing i agree with
aoc about
when it comes to defund the police
and also the economy in general and
capitalism
and you're not going to like it
she she thinks that maybe we should just
rethink the whole system from scratch
generally speaking i i don't want to
speak for her but i think she says we
should rethink capitalism
you know rethink the criminal network
system now when she says that
what do we do reflexively
her critics then say well if we're going
to rethink it let's think of the worst
possible way to do it and then blame her
for it
which is you know what critics do okay
yeah we'll rethink capitalism in the
worst possible way that could never work
and we'll say aoc came up with it
or we'll just get rid of the police
and blame aoc for whatever happens
that's not exactly
re-engineering
the justice system that's just getting
rid of police
that's not that's no plan
so here's what i like about the phones
as a let's say the the seed of something
that would be better than border control
maybe the phones are your immigration
control
could you design a system
where the phone became indispensable to
the um
to the illegal let's call them
immigrants which would actually be legal
because we would develop the system for
them to come into the country
add to our system
add to the system
so so if money is coming through the
phone it means there's some employer
that wants them
that means they're adding to the system
and at least in that sense uh and maybe
there's some way to have you know
massive
uh inflows and outflows of people coming
in seasonally for example for farm work
they come in
they help us we help them they take
their money back to mexico mexico gets
more money
good for them
right
so if you were if you're going to
rethink immigration
completely
could there be a way
that the
the the phone idea
sort of binds them to the country in a
productive way
don't know
but i i
i think it's such a provocative idea
that
i'm sort of attracted to it even though
i don't know how you do it exactly just
feels like there's something there i
don't know maybe not for every every
immigrant for some some who are coming
in for work specifically not not the
criminals obviously
um have you ever thought of this that uh
the only thing that holds our country
together is racism
how do you feel the first time you hear
that the only thing holding america
together is racism do you know why
there's a reason
see if you can come come up with it
before i tell you racism is the only
thing that holds the country together
here's the reason
if you didn't have racism we would
realize that it's a case of the rich
against the poor
and that all the poor people are on the
same team
and there's a ton of them
there's a lot of them and they're all in
the same team
do you know why they don't know they're
on the same team
because they're racism
they think they're on a race team
they're not
not really
yeah if all the poor people said hey you
know
i get that there's you know differences
in discrimination they get all that
that's real
but what if we poor people just all
banded together and said give us some
 you rich people we want to take
your stuff because
we we have enough votes
the only thing that keeps the country
together is that the rich have found a
way through the media
to convince people that their main
filter should be
uh race
as long as their main filter on life is
race
they're they're oblivious just like a
magic trick it's a distraction so you
don't see how the trick is done the
magic trick is it's always been about
money
dave chappelle says exactly what i'm
saying
except not exactly what i'm saying
he uses different words but the same
message
that racism is a distraction from the
actual
uh you know the actual inequality of our
time which is which is uh income or
wealth
all right uh there's a weird story about
some
two people posing as
federal agents and giving gifts to a
number of secret service officers
including like apartments and
high-powered weapons
and spy technology and stuff
and
uh then i'll just
i'll just read the names of the two
individuals
who were captured pretending to be
members of homeland security
uh you can make your own
racist judgments
about who they might be working for
okay
one of them is named ariane
terezadi
and the other is a hater ali
now
if these two are working for any foreign
country i think that would narrow it
down to probably a middle east
country
um
iran i'm looking at you but i don't know
for sure
i'm not i'm not even sure if those names
specify the region do they
could you tell the region from the last
names
i don't know if you could do that
um and we don't know if they're i mean
they could just be americans so you know
don't don't make any racist assumptions
about their allegiances or their
nationalities by their last names
can we all agree with that
i think we're all adult enough to know
that the last names are a red flag but
we're also adult enough not to just
assume that
you know
race is telling you something right race
doesn't tell you something it might tell
you where to look
and i guess that's racist enough
but it doesn't tell you what their
motivations are or where they came from
it doesn't even tell you that islamic
all right
um so we'll wait and see what's what's
what on that all right that ladies and
gentlemen uh brings us to the conclusion
of the best live stream that's ever
happened
and i hope you enjoyed this breathtaking
romp
from artificial intelligence which i
haven't mentioned yet but i'm going to
now
through the simulation through politics
through
it all
let's talk about aai
have you seen the new ai art
that's been created
apparently there is ai that can make you
a perfect image
just by describing it in words
so if you say for example a monkey doing
his taxes which was one of the actual
examples the ai
will draw you a picture of a monkey
not a picture but like it looks real
like an actual monkey
over a piece of paper like struggling
over his paperwork
you just have to describe it and it
draws the picture and then
and some of them are just like crazy
like your mind is blown and they're
actually pleasant to look at
so now imagine the ai can do art
because it is it is doing art and now
imagine that the ai can rapidly test
which of these two pictures is better
it just has a website or
you may be discussing people who do this
for it for money or whatever and they
just respond every they'll get a notice
say oh do you like the one on the left
or the right
they go ah the left that's all they do
that day just one person one click but
there are lots of people doing lots of
clicks
so ai immediately
goes through a bunch of iterations and
finds out the best piece of art you
don't think artists are in trouble
as an artist let me tell you that art is
mostly a formula
it doesn't seem like it because you
don't know how to do it
i hate to tell you that
but the reason you think art is
mysterious and you know there's some
magic to the creative process
is because you don't do it
if you do it
you see the machinery
all right
look do a google search on the six
dimensions of humor it's literally a
formula
for knowing that the humor is there or
not like i've just turned it into a
formula and i use it
so
and everything else that i've done that
has any creative element to it
eventually
you know sometimes i start out
intuitively
but eventually i can see the the
machinery and i go oh i see what's
happening now when i follow this formula
it works when i follow this formula it
doesn't so that's the machinery
so yeah ai is going to take over art
and it's going to
influence
your social media algorithms and
everything else it's all connected and
if you had to have somebody who's sort
of
has their finger on the user interface
for reality
somebody who knows ai somebody who knows
social networks somebody who knows how
the human mind is is interfacing with
products somebody who's so clever about
these things
he or she might not even need a
marketing department
that's kind of who i want to have their
finger on that lever
so i think we might be in good shape
thanks to
good people
trying to make the world better and
maybe making some money at the same time
maybe making some money at the same time
perfectly acceptable as long as it's
transparent
and as long as
you he has the country's best interests
in mind and it looks like he does
so on that note
um
on that note
i'd like to say goodbye to the youtube
people i'm going to talk to the locals
people a few more minutes and
i think you'd agree
um
i think you'd agree it's the best live
stream you've ever seen
bye for now
