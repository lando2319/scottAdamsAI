to the finest thing that's ever happened
to you is the highlight of civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams
if you're here because you think I might
cause some trouble
yeah
Maybe
Maybe
well we'll get to all of that but if
you'd like your experience to be the
kind of thing that your grandkids will
hear about
all you need to take this event up to
levels never before heard of
all you need is a cup of mug or a glass
of tanker chalice or Stein a canteen jug
or flask a vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid
I like coffee
I like my coffee black
stop it
I like my coffee black
stop it
sip
that's so good
so good
the hell was that
something loud just fell over
all right well I didn't have time to
check the news today let's see if
anything is trending on Twitter
foreign
we'll get to that we'll get to that but
you're gonna have to wait for it
I know there's a story you probably want
to hear about today
maybe a little bit
but let's talk about some other stuff
first
uh number one there's a new study
Fox News is reporting a growing body of
evidence suggesting that cannabis
is not entirely without harm
and there's a suggestion
Stanford University a physician says the
study which has not been published
will be presented Sunday I guess and it
shows that there might be some
cardiovascular disease associated with
uh have a use of marijuana
now let's take you through the analysis
tone
number one
marijuana is either good for people or
bad for people right
it can't be both well it actually could
be both but if you're talking about
whether it causes you
potentially greater disease
that's either a yes or no
now separately you could say it helps
you with other various things but those
are usually
comfort really not survival
but in terms of survival
and in terms of cardio the study says
that there could be cardiovascular
implications
all right so before there was a study
what did you know
let's say it was the only study that had
ever happened what would you know well
nothing it'd be sort of a coin flip if
somebody said hey does it hurt you or
help you
or hurry or not hurt you it's sort of
binary right it either hurts or it
doesn't
50 50 coin flip if you didn't know
anything you had no information
whatsoever
50 50. so now there's a study
probably peer reviewed
and what does that change the odds to
yeah so the study says it's could be
dangerous so this the odds were 50 50
when you didn't know anything you're
just flipping a coin because you got but
now you have a study what are the odds
now
still 50 50. because half of all studies
are wrong they point in the wrong
direction
half
so there's actually no this is no
information
now it's the beginning of something that
could be information if lots of other
studies confirmed it and if every way
you looked at it and every way you
studied it gave you the same answer or
even if most of them did well that then
you'd know something
but when you get like a new bold brand
new study yeah it's 50 50. you didn't
learn anything actually
so just keep that in mind big news that
probably should have been bigger news
AOC seems to be quite uh solidly
pro-nuclear now
did you know that
so I guess you visited some nuclear site
and
she was talking positively about how
well they can control radiation
and also specifically positively about
how France uses its nuclear waste as
fuel for its reactors
and other countries don't and she's
she's saying that's a good way to handle
it that's that's a pretty big deal
if you could get AOC to say you know
nuclear is just unambiguously a good
idea
and I think she's there
that's got to make a huge difference
because that would be one of the few
things that the right and left could
completely agree on completely
so it looks like Unity is breaking out
does it feel like that to you
maybe not everywhere
well Fox news reports that the
University of North Carolina
is moved against what they call the
encroaching woke culture
and I guess the university is voting to
ban diversity equity and inclusion the
Dei statements and politically
preferential hiring
so they're working Against Racism
but that will be called being racist
do you know that whenever you try to
reduce racism there's an there's a name
that you will be called what is it
what happens when you try to reduce
racism a racist yeah a racist is a
person who tries to reduce racism or a
person who has racism who is one
it it's a word that works for both
um
sort of like bi-monthly
you know could be twice a month or yeah
well anyway
um and I like this phrase that they use
I don't maybe you've heard this phrase
before compelled speech
so I guess they're calling Dei and
things that go with it a form of
compelled speech meaning that whether
you believe it or not you're going to
have to talk this way
which is an interesting way to put it
because they don't talk about Dai
changing your mind
which would be a different argument
wouldn't it yeah we're going to do this
train training to change your mind
I don't think anybody believes yeah this
is probably Jordan Peterson's take
you're right I don't think anybody
believes that Dei changes anybody's mind
there's sort of a
a tacit appreciation that is only
changing the way you speak so you won't
get fired you know canceled
am I wrong about that the all of the Dei
and CRT stuff is only forcing you to
talk about it like you believe it it's
not really changing anybody's mind have
you ever met anybody who changed their
mind
about anything
it's like nobody ever changes their mind
especially and stuff like that
I would agree so here's where the black
community and I are in complete
agreement
all of the you know bad stuff in the
past has to be fully reported right you
can't hide anything so certainly you
want a complete and useful education
about all things discrimination in the
past
from slavery on to systemic racism
so I think we'd all agree on that but
it's interesting that we can't keep it
with let's all be educated it has to
change to let's all talk this way
you have to talk a certain way
all right compelled speech
do you know anybody in the news who's
trending today who is the
victim of forces who are trying to
compel his speech
uh
uh boom just looking at my messages
Jesus get a lot of texts today
all right
um
China is rumored to be thinking about
sending
deadly weapons to Russia
for the Ukrainian invasion
now here's my take on this
do you think China is a stupid country
full of stupid people
does anybody think that
or do you think somebody said yes you
racist no you don't believe that
now or do you think that China is a
Smart Country who understands their
self-interest and is pursuing it quite
aggressively
I would say China is a smart country
full of smart leaders
who have their own interests you know at
the top of their list and I can't really
complain about that
can't really complain about that
it's just that you have to you know be
awake and know what to do about it can't
complain about it though everybody gets
to pursue their self-interest
um
but here's my take on it
I think China is not stupid the
leadership specifically
and therefore they would be crazy to
give deadly weapons
to Russia because I think they totally
understand that's a red line
that whatever economic blowback they're
getting now
the U.S would very quickly increase at
the levels that they don't want to deal
with very quickly
so what is China's best play
because they want to be allies to Russia
because they have to live next to them
they trade a lot but they can't really
make the U.S mad in that specific way
like they can make us mad a hundred
different ways but not that specific way
that specific way is going to be too far
there's only one thing that could happen
here in my opinion
China will yank Putin around and tell
him that any day now they're going to be
sending him weapons or they've got a
committee looking into it or they've
said yes but they need to collect the
weapons it's going to take a long time
or we got a bunch of weapons to send you
but oops they're accidentally they need
maintenance we better need a little more
time I don't believe that they're going
to send them any weapons
I believe that they're going to pretend
they are which is probably what our
Intel is picking up and
in the end they're just going to try to
stall and hope it gets negotiated before
anybody needs any extra weapons
wouldn't it be it would be stupid
for China to actually send the weapons
but it would be just as stupid to tell
Putin absolutely no I'm not sending you
weapons nope not going to do it
right the only smart way to play this is
to sort of you know pull Putin along
then maybe there may be some little gray
area here where you say all right we'll
we'll give you some non-weaponized
drones
for surveillance you know which they
would immediately weaponize as soon as
they got them and then China will say we
didn't give them any weapons
we just gave them our drones drones with
no weapons surveillance probably for
crop you know maintenance something like
that yeah uh it's not our fault those
Russians who saw it coming they put
weapons on our Jones so it could be
something like that
but I don't think I don't think China is
going to be shipping artillery and you
know large caches of weapons to Russia I
don't think so what do you think
do you think China is just going to go
yeah let's let's sell you or give you
sell you or give you a bunch of weapons
do you think that's going to happen
that seems like the least likely thing
that could ever happen
but remember remember the one that I got
wrong on this I said that I said that
Putin would never uh well not never but
I said he would not invade Ukraine
because it was a stupid play and he
wasn't stupid
and then he invaded
and it was a stupid play
I I didn't think he was that stupid
to me it looked like a suicide play for
Russia
but he was he was now of course he maybe
he was probably operating on completely
different information because I had none
except common sense and you know he had
lots of information but his information
was probably all lies from his own
generals oh yeah we're ready to go
give us three days we'll take Ukraine no
problem
so apparently I had better information
than he did because I had no information
except you know an understanding of the
world and what he had was all of his
generals lying to him because if they
didn't lie they would be immediately you
know executed or something
four chance going crazy somebody said I
wonder why
all right so that's what I think has
happened
um
what else is happening
yeah so uh China's uh recommended uh
an outline for a peace plan
listen to this
non-helpful suggestion
so this is China trying to be helpful
with the Ukraine Russia thing
they've recommended that it be ended by
negotiation
oh now that's something that nobody had
thought about before
you know a lot of people are thinking
how could we end the war without winning
it
what what would be any other way you
could end a war let's see there's
winning
there's losing
there's a third way I know there's a
third way
it's on the top of the tip of my tongue
what is China saying China
that's it that's what I was trying to
think of negotiating
and China helpfully reminded us that
that's that's one way to end a war
without killing each other
didn't see it coming yeah it's China's
free money China gets to be anti-war
while risking nothing it's just perfect
I don't even think I don't even think
China wants an award end do you
do you think China cares
it seems like they have you know more
access to Russian energy
um and they're you know their
adversaries are being degraded
why would they want to end it
really why would they
yeah depleting U.S arms getting us all
worn out in case they make a move on
Taiwan it wouldn't really make any sense
to help Russia
all right
um
today
at
two o'clock my time five o'clock Eastern
time I'm going to be talking to hotep
Jesus on his podcast
and I will answer all of your questions
about my recent provocative comments
now there are some updates
we're entering the third Act
if you don't know how a movie is set out
then you don't understand what you're
watching here
in the First Act there's something that
changes the the life let's say path
of whoever is the protagonist in the
movie so often in movie somebody will
die or there'll be some tragic event and
it sets the person off on a course for
something else
now in this case I made my controversial
comments and that would be the First Act
where everybody's like whoa whoa what's
Happening Here
the second act of a movie if I can
borrow some language from save the cat
it's a one of the most famous script
writing books is the fun and games scene
so the second act of a movie is where
you have a bunch of scenes which you
know collectively they fit together but
they're just a bunch of fun scenes like
it might be fight scenes that are fun to
watch if it's a fight movie or it might
be some car chases or basically it's
just a bunch of fun things to watch
so each of these scenes can stand alone
but collectively they you know they tell
a story of something
um yeah the 5 PM is Eastern time for the
hotel Jesus
talk today
all right so then the third the third
act which I've told you before is where
the protagonist of the movie is in an
impossible situation and could not
possibly get out
that's today that's today so so the fun
and games was last few days where there
was lots of back and forth and stuff on
social media today right on schedule
and you might say to yourself Scott did
you anticipate this happening
I wrote the movie
I wrote the movie of course I
anticipated it yeah today's the day I'm
supposed to get canceled by newspapers
so USA Today has already announced
they've canceled
the Cleveland Plain Dealer has canceled
and apparently there's a number of other
newspapers that are canceled now I
assume this is the beginning
and probably because it's the weekend
you're not seeing the the major move by
Monday I should be mostly canceled or
maybe a third or half or something like
that so most of my income will be
Go On by next week
all right now that's a third act that's
like you cannot not only that but the
income is actually the least important
part the important part is that my
reputation for the rest of my life
is destroyed
you can't come back from this
am I right
there's no way you can get out of this
so that's what makes it a third Act
that's why you watch
you watch because there's no way to
escape
is there
well let's talk about uh what's going on
[Music]
um because the simulation is just a gift
one after another
my cancellation happened by complete
chance and I had no idea this was
happening by complete coincidence
it's happening on the day of hate
apparently some neo-nazis are Marching
and today they've designated the day of
hate now do you think do you think this
this movie could have been written any
more perfectly
to correspond what I did which was the
opposite of racism
but also racism
it was the opposite but it was also
racism as the opposite always is
the opposite of racism is racism
uh I'll talk about that in a minute but
it's like the perfect storm of the worst
case scenario
the worst case scenario is that that
story is bright literally it was
trending on Twitter my name was like
right above day of hate
that's like the perfect third act
because it's like everything bad
happened exactly the same time when I
saw that I was just laughing I was like
oh that's perfect
like I thought I wrote this movie
you know to hit all the notes but it
turns out that that one was accidental
but it was just like hit perfectly it's
like oh everybody's going to think I'm
part of that
so watch for that
um
let's see
so the yeah the Cleveland Plain Dealer
canceled me and so
you know I like to think of this as a
learning
experience for all of us not just for
you I feel that I'm here to learn as
well and when the Cleveland Plain Dealer
canceled Dilbert I guess that happened
yesterday
um I learned something
and I learned something that I did not
know
and it's probably going to be important
to me for the rest of my life
and what I learned from this is
Cleveland have a newspaper
did you know Cleveland had a newspaper
I guess I did
so that will stay with me for the rest
of my life
now one of the questions I asked on
Twitter was if a young person asks you
for a career advice
would you recommend moving to Cleveland
would you recommend moving to Cleveland
uh surprisingly 90 percent said no
it seems like such a nice place
I don't know why you wouldn't move there
yeah and especially if you're non-racist
is 53 black
I checked
so if you were a non-racist that would
be exactly where to go that'd be like
one of the best places so Cleveland
um has rejected me
but
um
I'm probably gonna you know change my
advice because I've learned so much from
this if somebody asked me for advice I'm
going to say move to Cleveland
because they've got it going on right
um
let me uh clarify
what I was intending to say
you'll see if this sounds like what you
heard
so here's something I say all the time
including including lately and today
I can abide by no discrimination against
individuals
does anybody disagree with that
is there anybody who would say no you
should just you should discriminate
against individuals
anybody
is there anybody in the world
like I've never even met anybody who
thinks you should discriminate against
individuals oh somebody says they do
you're a troll
so some people are saying yes
discriminate against individuals no you
don't mean that I know you don't mean
that
all right
um
so does anybody believe that I don't
mean that
is there somebody here who believes that
I don't mean it when I say you should
not discriminate in any regard not
personally not professionally
no exceptions does anybody not believe
me
now
from a constitutional and a legal
perspective in the United States
should you discriminate against anybody
for race or religion or ethnicity or I
guess that's the same thing sort of
almost
should it no no so does anybody think
that I oppose the constitution
has anybody watched me for a while and
say that guy does not believe the
Constitution I think he really secretly
believes that we should discriminate
against people in a legal
legal sentence no of course not
do you think that I said you should shun
your neighbor
if you're white and your neighbor is
black
does that sound like something I would
say shun your neighbor because they're
black
nobody would say that
literally nobody
so if you believed you heard that
do you think maybe there was some
context you were missing
perhaps
all right let me ask you this question
if you were uh
a black family or even if not
and you you lived in home and suddenly a
bunch of neo-nazis bought all the homes
right around you so you found yourself
accidentally living in a Neo-Nazi
Clan neighborhood and you're not you're
not with them would you stay or would
you go
would you move or would you stay try to
work with them make it work out
you'd go you'd go
yeah interesting so would you agree in
general with the with the notion and
this was my this was my other major
point
that if there's a group of people
who
on average
not individually but on average
have a racist opinion about you
or a negative opinion about you would
you recommend to somebody stay in that
situation
if they had the option of moving
what would you recommend stay around
neo-nazis or to make some distance get
away from there
you would leave
well that's pretty racist
pretty racist
all right um
so
so here's the question
you know my comments were in the context
of course gets removed the way all the
way most hoaxes are created is the same
way
the the fine people hoax in
Charlottesville was created by taking
the middle of the statement but lopping
off the beginning in the end
the drinking bleach hoax
was created by showing the middle of the
video
but lopping off the end in the beginning
the Covington kids hoax video was
created by showing the mill
but lopping off the end in the beginning
the Scott Adams video that got me
canceled same way you just remove the
context
the context was
that nobody white or black should hang
around with people who on average
the talk about a group not individuals
but on average you should avoid
situations where you're disliked
does anybody think that you should play
it the other way
does anybody think that good let's say
life or career strategy would involve
going where you have the least chance of
success because people dislike you
is that good career advice
so I think here's the here's the frame
that people were missing
on an individual level
you should absolutely be nice to your
neighbor
unless they're neo-nazis of course but
you know if you've got a black neighbor
or a black family member you know
increasingly there's more of that if you
have a black family member do you think
I'm saying you should avoid them
does anybody interpret it that way
does anybody think that you should shun
your co-workers
like who would who would interpret it
that way no I'm saying that if you know
a population an identifiable population
has a high level of disregard for you
you should stay away
now suppose you think it's true but
you're not sure
how would you play that
you think it's true maybe because you're
racist you think it's true
but you don't know
how would you play it
somebody says a B test I'm not sure you
can do that too easily because it would
involve moving
you know here here's the thing that
everybody's missing
in the story and when you hear it you're
going to go oh
you ready
the the the country isn't ready for this
this is going to up your heads a
little bit
when it comes to the Constitution
there's no wiggle room
everybody has to be treated as an
individual cannot discriminate legally
based on any kind of you know legal
constitutional stuff justice system
has to be as Fair as it could be
individual decisions
who you hire who you sleep with who you
marry who you associate with all needs
to be on individual basis no exceptions
but
there's one category that we don't speak
about
career advice
can you do something for your own
personal career
that's racist
yes
completely legal and completely ethical
completely let me give you an example
if you were a young black person
and you wanted to take advantage of
your racial advantage
which would be Fortune 5 company Fortune
500 companies in particular they have
diversity objectives and they would love
to hire you
so
would it be a good career decision
to use your race to your advantage if
you were black and you knew that
companies were looking for you they they
really wanted to put you at the top of
the list
I think it would
i i in fact it's at the exact advice I
give to all black young people
I say look for look for the place where
you have an advantage right don't stay
where you have a disadvantage
where would be the worst place
for a let's say a young black person
who wanted to you know succeed really
had ambition where would be the worst
place for them to live
what would you say
or the worst place for them to go get a
job
Cleveland
Cleveland
would be the worst place to go
right I would go somewhere where I had
an advantage if you go to Cleveland it's
53 black
if you're competing against
a large pool of other black candidates
then whatever Advantage you got
because Fortune 500 companies are
looking for you you would be in a larger
pool of candidates
so should you go where you're special
and you'll stand out as being special or
should you stay where you're competing
with people who are a lot like you
it has nothing to do with white or black
you should always go where you have a
career advantage
so that might re that would require this
hypothetical black person to make a
racist
personal decision which I would totally
back
if you're making decisions for your own
personal your life it can be as racist
as you want
that's not illegal and it's definitely
not unethical
right
suppose you believed that your company
your school should have more
CR2 CRT classes or Dei or something like
that
would that be racist
yeah of course by definition but would
it be bad racism
see racism is is whenever you're
treating any group like they have
something in common which is what the
Dei and CRT stuff does
so anytime you're introducing almost any
change into society
it's a racist change
if you if you change the tax code in any
direction
you know that's racist right like
actually not not jokingly it's actually
racist because any way you change the
tax code is either going to benefit
people at the low end which
disproportionately you know affects
black people or disproportionately the
high end
there's almost no change you can make in
the world that doesn't have a racial or
racist overtone
so I would say this for sure whether
you're black or white when you're
managing your own career
you should be as racist as you need to
be to get the advantage
so I tell everybody to seek their
advantage if you're if you're uh
let me put it this way if if you're a
man
should you go work for a company that's
mostly women let's say
I don't know if this is true but let's
say the Avon company
let's say they've got a lot of women and
high executive roles I think they do
if you're a man would it be a good
individual strategy
to go work for a company that is very
female-centric
no no that would be crazy
that would be pretty crazy right now
reverse it
suppose you're a woman
and you want to go work in a male
dominated industry
is that a plus or a minus
well I'll give you an example so my my
ex Christina
became a pilot she's
instrument certified and actually can
she's actually certified to be a Trader
now she can teach people how to fly
knows a number of aircraft Etc do you
think she has an advantage
being female in a in an industry that's
probably 95 male or do you think it's a
disadvantage
I think it's an advantage because I
think that Airlines
would want to increase their diversity
you know both gender wise and race wise
so if I were if I were advising her on
her career
I would say don't join Avon
if you join Avon you're going to be
competing with all the other women
who are also awesome
if you go compete against Pilots you're
going to be at the top of the list every
time
why would you not go there
why wouldn't you
now who who disagrees with the idea that
you should stay away from pockets of
people
where the odds are they're not going to
like you again has nothing to do with
any individual
and no discrimination involved here I'm
just saying that as a personal career
decision
you should absolutely be racist whenever
it's to your advantage and that's for
men for women for black for white for
Asian American for Hispanic every one of
you should be open to making a racist
personal career decision because we all
we all have that option it's not illegal
and it is not unethical
it's very difficult to say out loud
though because you'll get canceled
all right
somebody's saying it's boring because
it's not controversial though
the the guys saying is boring is saying
it 100 times because that's not boring
well we'll make you go away
right so that's the framing let me
summarize that no discrimination against
individuals not your neighbor not your
family members not your co-workers ever
no constitutional violations ever but in
your personal
career decisions
yeah you should make decisions about
avoiding people who dislike you
and you should go where there are
clusters of people who have a favorable
opinion of you that would be your best
career move
now let me tell you what happened
as I was watching all the comments to my
to my comments
um number one
there I was expecting something like
you know maybe black people would not
like it and white people would be
signaling and here's what happened
there's a weird non-racial correlation
to the comments
which I wasn't really expecting I I
don't know what I expected but
the number of black people who have said
to me either privately or on Twitter
that that sounds about right about half
of black people have a bad opinion of
white people
now what do you think
now some people question the Rasmussen
poll and I think that was the good
criticism
you can't trust any poll if the question
is ambiguous so the question on the poll
was is it okay to be white and that
could be interpreted in so many
different ways that you know you don't
know if you're getting a good answer
there but do you think the general
concept is wrong so here's here let me
put it in a in context
in the context in which Dei is being
taught
CRT
um
and there's another one I think but am I
wrong to say that The Narrative of the
the new trends in both education
as well as company ESG yeah ESG am I am
I wrong to say that to trend is to
create a narrative in which white people
are the cause of current problems would
you say
would you say that all of those three
things esgu Dei and CRT
have as a common element that white
people are the the cause
right now what would be the predictable
outcome of that
I don't I don't think there's any way it
could go other than black people would
start having a bad feeling
about white people how would that be
avoidable
if you were trained to think that a
certain class of people were your
oppressors
even if it's just historically mostly
but you know it lingers today with
um systemic violence or I'm sorry
systemic racism
um
yeah so what I see is that the media is
continuously brainwashing the public
that white people are are the problem
and
having nothing to do with black people
you could replace black people with any
population of people and if they were
Brainwashed the way the media is
brainwashing all of us today
there's a predictable outcome
so let me ask you this if you're black
is it useful to know
what the cost of those programs is
I you know I guess it's the Econo The
Economist of me The Economist in me says
you should always know the cost and the
benefits of everything you're doing now
the benefits of esge and CRT and Dei
the benefits will be presumably to give
minorities and women
a little little leg up a little little
Advantage maybe some context make things
better
to make things better
now
I don't know if it does
but the part that I can speak to was
some Authority
is that it has an expense
and the expense is you can have what you
want but I don't want to be near you
do you remember the Pence rule
the Pence rule was he wouldn't go to
lunch or dinner
with a woman who is not his wife
now do you think the Pence dislikes
women
would that be would that be a reasonable
conclusion the Pence goes to you won't
go to lunch unless his wife is there
he won't go with another woman
is that an anti-woman thing
yeah by the way he's totally right
here here's how I interpret it
has nothing to do with any individual
woman
Mike Pence is now saying oh this one
woman who wants to go to lunch with me
is bad this Jezebel wants to go to lunch
with me he's not saying that
he's just playing the odds
isn't he
I think he's just playing a statistical
game
he's just saying if I don't put myself
in a situation where a Bad Thing could
happen
less chance of a bad thing happening so
I just won't be in that situation
but there are two situations that I
would think Mike Pence would want to
avoid
one is getting any kind of a romantic
interest with a person that he didn't
intend to
that's the first thing to avoid but the
second thing to avoid is getting me
tooed
when maybe you didn't be to anybody
right so that that's a more modern risk
is getting me too falsely because we
know that happens
so he removes the risk of being metoo'd
you know falsely or even even you know
if he did it he removes the risk of
doing it and also the risk of being
accused of doing it just by getting rid
of the situation now given the way black
Americans have been primed
by Dei and CRT and ESG and the media
would you expect that they would be
primed
to see racism everywhere
of course that's just how it works and
does this have anything to do with being
black no no because white people are
being primed the same way
right most of the people who were mad at
me today are white
most of the people who were mad at me
today are white
because they've been primed to have a
certain reaction to what they what they
think happened now most of them don't
know what I'm what I'm doing they're
they're missing they're missing the
movie entirely which makes it a movie
that's what makes it fun
yeah so we're we are trained to see race
as a primary variable and not a you know
one of the variables
no I don't maybe it is maybe it is a
primary variable so so whether or not
those programs are accurate or not
that's not related to my my point
it could be that everything that CRT and
Dei and also say is accurate I don't
know I haven't experienced it but
whether it's accurate or not it would
Prime people the same way
it would Prime you to look at white
people as a source of racism
and so
the Mike Pence rule would say you want
to get some distance
you want to get some distance
now is that racist
Yeah Yeah by definition
right but as racist in a personal
um
personal success context which is
completely allowable
it's completely allowable and by the way
black people can do it too
everybody can do it
you can take care of yourself first
there's no no law against that
and you can do it for any reason
as long as you're not bothering other
people if it's an internal if it's an
internal uh conversation doesn't bother
anybody you just don't go to Cleveland
right there's anybody disadvantaged
because I don't move to Cleveland
it's just a decision I make
that is racist
but it's good for the individual
now do you think that all racist things
are bad
it's a trick question
because affirmative action is racist is
it bad
I mostly have supported it historically
but where I where I have let's say my
complaint
is that at some point you have to get
rid of it and that's better for
everybody like everybody's better if you
can get people close enough
to you know similar situations that you
could get rid of it
you need to start planning for that
right
but that doesn't make it bad just
because it's racist
yeah we I think we're primed to hear
that word and just go now here's here's
what I think is the most interesting
part of the reaction to the video that's
going around of my comments
white people were most likely to say
racist cancellant racist
black people
mostly the men for some reason I don't
know why but black men
were more likely to say
I think there's some context missing
it's kind of wonderful I wasn't really
knowing what to expect exactly but but
black men by and large they smell a wrap
they're like wait a minute
this doesn't this doesn't smell right
could those comments be the way they're
being presented is that even possible
uh people asked me if it was a deep fake
they were so disbelieving this is a deep
fake other people said contacted me
directly uh black men mostly and said is
there some context here I'm missing
and I would you know send them to the
context
so I love the fact that black Americans
were on to me they were like onto me
right away
and white Americans totally fell for
everything they do they just fell for
the the entire second act
right so today on hotep Jesus's podcast
it's the only one I'm gonna do so I
think I'll just do one and then I was
planning to do no interviews all year
before this popped up but this was sort
of irresistible like I had to do one
he's not in the 46 percent but but
here's what you should look for on this
controversy
look for the people who are mad that's
the big part of the story now here's the
fun part
look for somebody to disagree with my
opinion
have you seen it
nobody has
literally nobody disagrees with me
they're just sure I shouldn't say it
am I right
the the entire point is that I shouldn't
say it
nobody disagrees with it
who would who would go on the side of
saying yes you should hang around with
people who have a bad opinion of you
the closest somebody got to disagree is
saying that the Rasmussen pole might not
be an accurate poll
which I accept it might not be
but I'll tell you what nobody is arguing
with is that black Americans
are are developing and have a pretty
negative opinion of white Americans now
not all of them
anytime I talk about a group it's never
everybody in the group
I I trust you to be adults
and know if I say Republicans own guns
that doesn't mean every Republican owns
a gun if I say Democrats are awoke that
doesn't mean every Democrat is woke it
never means that so if I say black
people who do this or that it never
means every black person acts like every
other black person that's not a thing
the funniest comments were from black
men who said oh I totally understand why
you'd say that Scott because my own
experience is the half of black people
don't like white people
I could see why you'd want to stay away
from that situation
that's from black people
now that's something that the white
people can't say
only the black men have said that so far
it's it's all man but the black men are
like yeah you got a point there I see
where I see where you're coming from
and but the the white signalers I don't
know if you've seen some of the ones who
are like into Super signaling
they want to be so black they're like
trying to be black like oh I love black
people more than black people and black
people
I'm going to signal so hard I'm the best
person on the entire internet so a lot
of narcissists have been surfaced
all right now the uh
oh damn it I didn't write down my
favorite
my favorite comment was from a black man
on Twitter
who said that uh white white people
should be examining I hope I'm
paraphrasing correctly he said that
white people should be examining
uh
how white people are demonizing other
white people
to which I said
player enters the simulations
player enters the simulation
yeah yeah white people are mostly being
called racist by white people
mostly
is mostly white people attacking white
people to show that we're better than
them
and let me tell you something that uh
I think is being poorly appreciated
so I've told you that I lost lost two
corporate jobs because I was white and
male there's a black editor I think for
a newspaper who's been challenged me
because he doesn't believe it
he doesn't believe that I lost two
corporate jobs
directly because I was told in direct
language your male and your white so we
can't promote you
directly and not reading between the
lines my boss in both cases told me
directly in a specific meeting just to
tell me that
just to tell me that but here's the part
I don't talk about
it was all white people
I I have exterior experienced severe
discrimination in my life but only from
white people
only
in fact if this situation
were only between me and black people
it would already be over
it's only the white people keeping it
alive it's only the white people trying
to be blacker than the black people I'll
be blacker than you damn it I'll be so
open-minded that I'm more black than you
are yeah if if you took the white people
out of the conversation here's how it
would go
Scott why are you saying that white
people should stay away from black
people
and then I'd say oh it's because my
understanding is
that within the black population
there's you know a very high percentage
of people who don't like me
and since I don't know which ones it is
and since it's completely legal for me
to move or associate with whoever I want
I'll reduce that risk
by not being with people who don't like
me
what would a black person say to that
I think they'd say that's the same thing
I do
I go I don't want to live with racists
right is there any black person who says
you know where I'd like to live
in like the most racist white part of
the country
that's what I want
I want to get me some of that nobody
says that right
so I believe that if the conversation
were between me and either all black
people or or any black person they would
immediately say oh that's what you're
saying
well you're saying you don't want to be
around people who don't like you
totally on board I get it yeah we don't
like it either
yeah it's too bad you're in that
situation
um you know I like you so you know can
you and I hang out to which I say well
you seem nice yeah I'll hang out with
you
absolutely
all right
so the two things my two points that
people are disagreeing with and hate me
and are canceling me is that everyone
should be treated as an individual no
discrimination in person
or constitutionally or legally
but you should also avoid any group that
doesn't respect you
even if there are people within the
group or refined
it's legal
and it's the obvious it's the obvious
response to Dei and CRT and ESG and all
that stuff
so it's the obvious response
all right
um
by the way I blame systemic racism for
this situation I think it sounds like
I'm blaming black people
is that is that what people are
interpreting
that I'm blaming black people I'm
blaming white people
all of the Discrimination that I've
experienced in fact the newspapers that
are canceling me do you think they're
canceling me because of black people
maybe but probably as white people
yeah so I'm being canceled by white
people
almost entirely I guarantee it
blame the patriarchy yeah
all right
here are some topics that we know to be
racist taxes like I said any change to
taxes is going to favor or disfavor some
group border policy climate we've been
told Healthcare obviously differences in
health care and housing
and of course economics and everything
else schools it's hard to think of
anything that isn't objectively racist
at this point
because because it's racist if has a
racist outcome right so anything you do
to the school system taxes the economy
will have some kind of disproportionate
outcome
so it's all racist and certainly what
I've suggested was
yeah but not all racism is something you
should run away from like I said
affirmative action
I think helped
like on the whole
on the whole I think it helped we just
have to you know be smart about when we
wind that down
all right
um
I'm going to give you one
does anybody have any questions
are you surprised
on locals maybe you can't see this but
I'm looking at the comments uh
did I see that Charlie chion video what
are we doing to white people now
now
I did not see that send that to Beth
I I think what's going to happen is
you're going to see a lot of interesting
people enter the conversation
and you might be surprised you might be
surprised because there are a lot of
people who uh even if they don't like
what I said
um feel that anything that sounds honest
is like a like a breath of fresh air
like I'd rather just hear your honest
opinion
by the way I love black people
I don't know if I've ever said that
directly I think that's useful to say
like I love black people
that's partly why I've worked extra hard
for much of my adult life
to specifically benefit black Americans
I thought it was worth doing
so
I always feel like you should say that
directly because anything you say that
where you don't say that directly
I believe is misleading
wouldn't you say
so let me say it directly I love black
people always have
in fact my personal interactions
with black Americans and even Africans
actually has been universally positive
universally I've had
I believe I've had zero bad experiences
with any black American I've had lots of
bad experiences with white Americans
like right now like right now this is
mostly a problem with white Americans
by the way the reason that my corporate
experience was white people canceling me
is that white people with power
will cancel any any white person without
power to protect themselves
did you know that
well I guess all the white people did
but you know that white people will
throw other white people under the bus
immediately
like immediately
and black people are more well let's
look at the situation
because I think white people are like
trying to get the the signaling gain so
they have to hurry like they have to get
in Fast and black people are saying well
I think I should understand this
situation and you know then I'll make my
opinion and there's there's a real
difference there really is a difference
the the black people who are weighing in
are saying actually smart useful things
such as let's hear the whole context
and the white people are just going
 nuts
which is what makes it a good movie
the woke cloak
uh
you said I've known some people that
take advantage of being a minority in an
unkind way well I don't know what that
means but if you're not taking advantage
of whatever racial benefit you have
bu black or bu anybody else you should
because when it comes to your personal
life and your personal success you can
do anything you want that's legal
that's legal
ideally you should be ethical as well
uh
right
uh
what is the financial gain of getting
canceled
I don't think there is one
are you ready for the European river
cruise
that that's what that's where it's like
you're reading my mind
there's actually nothing I'd rather do
than take a European river cruise right
now like that would be way high on my
list of cool things to do
that's that's weird that you would
mention that I was literally just
thinking about it like yesterday
all right
um I was going to say something about
Ukraine and nukes
so I'd like like to make you feel better
about what is going to look like a
nuclear Holocaust
all right
under all scenarios in Ukraine we're
going to get right to the edge of a
nuclear war
you know that right
so being close to the edge of a nuclear
war won't tell you anything about the
likelihood of nuclear war
no matter how close we get to it it
doesn't change the odds
that's what you need to know
you're going to think that the closer
you get
the more likely it's going to happen
but the only way you get a negotiated
settlement is for both sides to think
nuclear war is likely
anything short of that nobody's going to
negotiate
so you have to get to almost nuclear war
whether you're having a nuclear war
or whether you're doing the opposite and
negotiating
so when we get right up to the brink of
nuclear war which we will
it doesn't mean it's likely
you get that it doesn't mean it's likely
it means it had to happen it was it just
had to happen in fact the entire point
of nuclear deterrent
is that when the risk becomes real then
everybody changes their behavior until
the risk feels real people are going to
act like it's not there but the moment
it looks like oh God we're like one
minute away from nuclear Holocaust then
people get flexible right or or Putin
gets overthrown or something or we
change our president or something
yeah Cuban Missile Crisis yes thank you
perfect example the Cuban Missile Crisis
had to get to a crisis
because nothing was going to change
otherwise
so don't be afraid of the crisis that's
coming it's going to be manufactured
it's a psychological crisis that we have
to pass through
to get stuff done
all right all of you I expect you to be
watching
today I don't know if it's recorded or
live but if it's live make sure you
catch it live
we'll see if uh
what makes this the third Act is that
I'm I'm racing to the conclusion at the
same time I'm getting canceled
so it's like a movie where you're
running up the stairs and the stairs
behind you are crumbling at the same
rate that you're running
so that's what makes it a good movie
will I be totally canceled by the end of
the week
or can I find an impossible way out
what do you think
we shall see I'm going to say bye to
YouTube I'm going to talk to the special
people on the locals platform for a
little bit more
and
thanks for joining
