hey everybody
start streaming in now come on in
it's time for coffee with scott adams
will it be the best part of your day
i think it will i think it will you can
hold me to that
and if you'd like to make it extra extra
special
like super special and i'm talking
extreme
well then all you need is a cup of
margarine glass a tanker chelsea steiner
canteen jugger flask
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that's going to make everything better
it's called the simultaneous up it
happens now go
yeah well
i know everybody laughed when i said the
golden age was coming
and i have to admit the pandemic
definitely threw me off my game but it
seems
that without the pandemic we could not
have reached the golden age
think about it what did the pandemic
solve
for us of course tragedy like crazy
lots of deaths not minimizing any of the
the pain
but we kind of had to have a pandemic
to get to the other side so that the
golden age could happen
uh for example i think it will redo
education totally it will redo commuting
totally it'll redo what work is totally
uh it'll probably change family units i
mean just about everything's gonna be
changed but also we're much better
prepared for a future pandemic
which is really big and it could be that
some of these technologies the mrna
platform might be even a solution for
cancer
so you know just as nobody would ask for
a world war
the fact is when you have big wars you
end up
you know inventing radar and inventing
you know
nuclear power accidentally and all that
so nobody wanted a pandemic but here we
are
and uh my job is to look at the news
and tell you you know whether it's true
or
what to think about it or at least a
different way to think about it
and there's no news
the news just stopped because news is
usually bad news right
and it is in my imagination
but is everything looking solved except
the debt
and i'm not even sure if that's a
problem because it's all confusing
so let's talk about all the things
which are not the biggest problems in
the world
things are looking pretty darn good
stock market's up
economy is recovering pandemic is
uh i feel like we've got the the leash
on the pandemic now
but here are the things that qualify as
news
during the pen during the uh the golden
age
uh bill and melinda gates announced
they're getting divorced after 27 years
now this would be a big surprise to
anyone who did not watch
the netflix documentary about bill gates
if you watch the netflix documentary
you'll see interviews with
melinda and bill separately and
i came away from that thinking i don't
think they're getting along
i mean when i watched the special i
thought to myself
they don't look like they should be
married because
melinda had a little bit of an attitude
about bill
they came across and i just felt like i
was picking up some contempt
like some some negativity did anybody
else see that special
because i i came away from it thinking
why is he married to her she seems
terrible to him
and she was doing it publicly so i
thought oh
i feel like insulting your spouse on
television in a
in a documentary might be telling us
there's some problems here
but bill gates is a free man now and
uh based on what i saw in that
documentary he's gonna be a lot happier
like a lot happier uh so congratulations
to bill gates for
you know pulling the cord i think he
needed to do that
now there's a story uh about their
meeting
that that tells you everything about
couples
are you ready for this so this is
apparently an anecdote of how they met
so they met at work and then bill gates
saw melinda later in the parking lot
uh and esther on a date two weeks out
now who asked somebody on a date two
weeks out
it's a little bit too prepared or a
little bit too planned
and i guess melinda told him two weeks
from tonight
i have no idea what i'm doing two weeks
from tonight
okay first of all that's when he should
have walked away
if you if you try to make a date with
somebody in two weeks
and their excuse for saying no is they
don't know what they're going to be
doing in two weeks
walk away just
so anyway and then melinda said
quote you're not spontaneous enough for
me
melinda said and then she said he called
an hour later and said
is this spontaneous enough for you and
then i asked around and they went on a
date and got married
now this is everything you need to know
about men and women
as a couple uh i don't think i'm
speaking about anything too personal
when i say i have been accused of not
being spontaneous
i i sometimes come off as being
calculating i often will think about the
the impact of my actions and how that
might affect my future
in fact i can't really turn it off i'm
always thinking
if this happens what will be the outcome
also known as the normal way a brain
operates
so when women require us us men
to be spontaneous do you know what men
say to that
that's not a thing that's right
the main one of the main things it's not
the main thing
but one of the main things a woman wants
from a man
is a thing that doesn't even exist
spontaneity
that's not a thing
if you're a man have you ever
spontaneously had sex
well somebody probably thought you did
it's not spontaneous if you're looking
for it all the time
and then sometimes you get it that's the
opposite of spontaneous
would you say that if you're hunting for
mushrooms in the forest
and then you found a mushroom that you
were hunting for
was it spontaneous finding of a mushroom
no it's the opposite it's you planned to
go look for mushrooms
you didn't know exactly when you'd find
it but there it was
it's like that with sex for men we're
always looking for it
it never turns off and when we get it
sometimes the woman will say well that
was some spontaneous sex we had there
i sure enjoyed that spontaneous x and
the man is thinking
spontaneous i've been trying to make
this happen for a week
spontaneous so no matter
how rich you are you have the same damn
problems
all right rasmussen in a new poll i
don't know if you can see it yet but
you'll be able to see it soon
uh said that uh you asked this question
among others should vaccinated people
wear masks in public
are you surprised the republicans
said yes to mass in public by only 25
percent
what if i told you about 25 percent
every poll doesn't matter what the
question is
25 of the people answer are just going
to be up
it doesn't matter what the question is
it doesn't matter if they're democrats
republicans
it doesn't matter 25 of everybody you
poll
will just have a up response that
you can't explain
it's like well you can ask people
would you like to be beaten to death
with a hammer
25 percent of people responding would
say yeah
i think i wouldn't mind that i think i'd
like to be beaten to death with a hammer
i can't explain it it's just 25 no
matter what the poll is
but uh democrats uh 75 said that they
as vaccinated people should wear masks
in public
is that based on science
which one is following the science the
gop
who says the risks are very small or the
democrats who also say the risk is very
small
but you should do something about the
risk
which one's following the science it's
opposites they're both following the
science
right that's the problem i'm
sorry i
was worrying too much everybody who says
follow the science
here is my response to everyone in the
world who says
you should follow the science and my
response goes like this
for football the science or your fault
because it's just stupid people can't
follow the science
it's not a thing it's like spontaneous
sex
you think it's a thing but it's not
it's not that you can do it or you could
not do it
it's not like some people do it and some
people don't do it that's the frame
we've been given
there's nothing like that it's a bunch
of people
a hundred percent of them who are
incapable of
following the science all human beings
a hundred percent of us are incapable of
following science
because we don't know what it is perfect
example
is a science telling you to wear a mask
after you're vaccinated
a little bit is it telling you not to
wear a mask
because you're vaccinated a little bit
so what do you do you you default to
what cnn or fox news or whatever you're
following
whatever they told you basically so
there's no
no illusion here of anybody following
any science
the questions like this just line up
exactly by political affiliation
nobody is looking at science if you just
coincidentally happen to line up exactly
by political affiliation
except for the twenty-five percent who
are whack
all right um if you've been wondering
how to deal with this big lie
question now uh just background the
the phrase the big lie is what cnn and
the left are trying to brand
trump's accusation that the election was
not
fair and equitable now
they started out by saying it's a big
lie to say the election was not fair
trump did a trump on them today
he decided to define the big lie
as the opposite so trump has told us now
that he
will be considering the the phrase the
big lie
to refer to the fact that the election
was fair
is he going to get away with it totally
totally totally going to get away with
it does it sound like anything
familiar yeah he used the same play
before
perfectly do you remember when when the
the left tried to brand trump and the
right with fake news
remember what happened to fake news
trump
took the took the weapon out of their
hand turned it around
and used fake news to just destroy the
entire industry
trump and mostly just trump the rest of
us being you know
uh follower honors but trump destroyed
the entire news industry
by you know branding fake news and then
there were so many examples
that it just became true it was always
true but in our minds it became true
so i think he's going to pull this off
i think trump will actually at least you
know of course
only for the republicans not for the
democrats i think he's going to turn the
big lie
into a whole different meaning and
it's fun to watch just to see if you can
get away with it
but here is my argument
well if you can call it that or funnel
when i encounter people online or other
place who say to me
scott we know for sure that the election
was fair
and anybody who says otherwise is part
of the big lie
let me tell you the the technique i use
to essentially change their mind
in real time which is rare have i ever
told you that you really can't change
people's minds
it's so rare in this case you don't
actually change their mind
but you can get to the point where
they'll stop talking
meaning that they'll just sort of slink
away that's as close as you can get
now after they slink away knowing that
you've destroyed their thinking
it'll just resurrect after they're away
from you a while they just need a few
hours of recharging to get back their
their fake news
bubble but here's here's what causes
them
that pain so the first thing somebody
says
it's a big lie that the election had any
widespread
fraud it's a big lie big lie i say to
which i say
you can't prove a negative
you can't prove something didn't happen
and then
then people will say well but none of
the courts found it
and then i say the courts weren't
looking for it
the courts were addressing specific
questions but nobody had
visibility on the whole process nobody
audited the code of the machines
nobody did a thorough order audit from
beginning to end
so then i say
you can't say that the evidence doesn't
exist
if you didn't look for it now so far i'm
only saying things that people
will have to accept are true number one
they will accept that you can't prove a
negative even though there's some
exceptions but
basically you can't prove a negative
they will accept that
they will accept that not looking for
something
is different from looking forward and
not finding it
nobody looked for it that's why there's
an arizona audit
because it wasn't looked for you don't
do an audit
if you already did an audit so the first
the next thing you convince them of is
that nobody looked at it and the courts
are not even designed to look for it the
courts will rule about whether they're
rule on it
and they might rule on some specific
issues which
you know nobody's pushing as true at
this point
well some people might then
you go to the the high ground and here's
the kill shot right
if i told you the high ground maneuver
in terms of persuasion
the high ground maneuver is where you
take the argument to a higher
level where nobody can disagree with the
next thing you say
now it's hard to find those situations
but when you find them
it's the end of the argument if you get
somebody to the high ground it's over
here's the high ground every system that
can be hacked
will be hacked under these conditions
there are lots of people involved
so you know that there are always some
bad people in there if only one person
was involved in whatever the thing is
you're talking about
well maybe you got a saint right you
know lucky we got the one honest person
but when lots of people are involved you
can guarantee that some of them
are you know going to do some some bad
stuff
secondly if there's a high payoff either
in money or power
in the case of an election you have all
the incentive in the world
you've got people who would do bad
things in the system and in the right
place
under those conditions you will get
fraud 100
of the time every time there's no system
that would
that would be invulnerable to that
so the only thing you don't know is
whether it's happened already
that's the high ground the high ground
is every system gets hacked
if there are lots of people involved and
it's possible
is it possible to hack an election of
course
it may not be possible to do it and get
away with it forever
that might not be possible but it's
certainly possible to do it
we just don't know all the ways it could
be done etc now one way to do it would
be to get to
insiders meaning that somebody who works
in i don't know electronic voting
machine
company or something like that and we
would have no way to know if any of that
had ever happened
but it is true that we do not have
evidence of it but you can't prove a
negative
so here's the here's the thing you say
nobody looked for the evidence because
courts are not set up to do that
and the audits were only limited so
there's
there's no visibility in the whole
election and then you take them to the
high ground and say whenever this is the
case
you don't have full visibility you get a
lot of people involved there's a lot to
gain
it will be compromised by intelligence
agencies eventually
so that's the part you might want to add
by intelligence agencies
maybe the cia maybe russia
maybe china but sooner or later they'll
one of them will get a get control of
the voting system we just don't know if
it's happened yet
all right um apparently china has a
rocket
that has a component that's
that's just going to fall to earth
wherever it falls
that's kind of scary isn't it there's
just this big old rocket
in space and it's going to eventually
degrade its orbit and just
fall wherever it falls so
got that hanging over our heads
literally
um is it my imagination or is the biden
administration actually getting
a handle on the border it looks like
they are
i think the number of you know kids
being confined at the border is down i
don't know 84
or something but it looks like the biden
administration is
making some progress getting that under
control
i don't know if we have good reporting
on this situation though
because i'm a little a little confused
as to how they could ever be making
progress
when everything they're doing seems to
look like it would encourage more people
to come now fewer
and it's also exactly the season when
they should be coming
so i feel like maybe the reporting is
lagging here does it feel like you're
getting good reports from the border
because i don't know how it could be
getting better
but the reporting says it is i'm a
little skeptical about the reporting
um cnn reports that the white house is
discussing a new plan to expand domestic
wartless surveillance of americans
by paying private companies to
infiltrate and report on
private social media groups i think i
saw this in a
tweet from snowden
and i'm saying to myself is this new
i don't even know if this is new
um haven't haven't we always
infiltrated extremist groups
so i mean it sounds scary but it sounds
like just what we've always done i don't
even know if it's new
i got a question for you on herod
immunity if we had a normal virus
herd immunity would be in that you know
70 percent people have to be
have a natural immunity or vaccination
but given that the super spreaders are
all going to be the super sick people
and we know that they're not children
we know that they're either over 70 or
they're obese
do we reach herd immunity effectively
just by vaccinating the obese and the
people over 70
because here's here's a question i've
been arguing with on twitter
i believe but i think this is short of
being
you know dead confirmed i believe
it's true that the sicker you are the
more likely you're a super spreader
you have to have a lot of virus in your
body in order to give it off when you
breathe
if you have to if you have to be pretty
sick
to be a super spreader and we vaccinated
all the over 70s and the obese people
you would basically have taken all of
the super spreaders out of the mix
and then all you would have is sort of a
regular spreader
i feel as if we're going to hit herd
immunity faster than we think
because we're intelligently vaccinating
not only that but the virus itself is
i hate to say intelligently but it's
targeting the group of super spreaders
so once they've either had it or been
vaccinated
i think we just take pretty much all the
super spreaders off the field
and i i got a feeling that we're going
to get over this better than we think
now the wild card as you know is the
variance there's a scary variant in
india
there's scary variants in europe and so
far we're thinking that the
vaccination should work against the
variants
but the variance might attack younger
people
and that might put a dent in my in my
herd immunity concept that if you get
the if you get the people who would get
sickest take them off the field
no super spreaders so that's just my
non-doctor
hypothesis i would love to see somebody
who actually knows what they're talking
about
give an opinion on that all right
here's some fake news update apparently
this was a big one new york times
washington post
nbc and others they all reported this
story that turned out to be false
they said that rudy giuliani was warned
by the fbi he was a target of some
russian
disinformation campaign apparently
didn't happen
now they all had anonymous sources
and they all confirmed it independently
what do you think was the anonymous
source
for each of these media outlets
well i'm going to go out on the limb
and say it might have been the other
media outlets
and they just didn't want to say it so
they just say anonymous source
well we saw it in the new york times why
don't we just tell people
it was an anonymous source because if
they guess
right it works right if it turns out the
story is true
and there's an actual anonymous source
that's a real person with a real story
well then you get away with it it's only
if you guessed wrong
and you said oh yeah we totally
confirmed it and then it turns out to be
false
how exactly did they confirm it
how do all these major news outlets
confirm something that never happened
so they're either talking to the same
spook which is one theory i've seen
that there's you know some cia person or
somebody else
you know some some deep dark person
is giving all of these outlets the same
fake news as an anonymous source or
gave it to one outlet and then the other
outlets said well we'll just use this
first outlet
as our anonymous source i think that's
what's going on but i don't know
that's pretty ugly um
are you watching tucker carlson go after
frank
luntz uh pollster on on his show
how many of you are watching that and
now i'm seeing uh looks like fox news
has picked it up on their website and
i guess the accusation goes like this
that frank luntz gives advice to both
democrats and republicans but also to
big corporations
that uh you know may not love
republicans
and apparently he's good friends with
kevin mccarthy minority leader
uh a republican and actually rents
uh one of frank luntz's properties
so he actually is staying at a luntz
property we don't know if he's paying a
market rent
there's no no evidence that he's not so
that so we don't have anything that
looks like
anything illegal or improper but there
is a kind of connection here that
uh tucker carlson is calling out
and he's wondering why the republicans
allow
frank luntz to have so much impact on
republican opinion
when he might be leaning more left seems
like
maybe he is now i don't have an opinion
on
frank luntz's political opinions
my observation of him is that he seems
to be
you know he seems to at least try to
talk in a way
that's free of bias nobody's free of
bias on the inside
but when i see him talk i'm going to say
i don't see him talk in a biased way
like he's obviously just selling a
narrative
he does seem like he's just talking
about the poll results
but when it comes to giving advice you
know we don't see that part
so who knows how much impact he has but
why is this a story now
what is the trigger for this do you know
does anybody know
um why is the trigger for this
why is tucker going after him so hard
somebody says that frank luntz hated
trump yeah but you know
some republicans did too you know he
didn't really
when i saw frank luntz in public i did
not see
here see him saying anti-trump stuff i
don't know what he thought about
otherwise
so it's an interesting question can
somebody who is a pollster
whose job is just data can they work for
people on the left and the right and the
corporations that are
that are probably controlling them both
can they can he do that
i don't know it's a good question you
know i think that tucker's doing a
a solid service by making sure that we
know about this
so we're at least informed but once
we're informed
does that mean it should stop i feel
like it needs transparency
but i don't know that you should tell
somebody who's a data person
that they can't sell data to anybody
they want or even advice
so i certainly wouldn't want him to be
like locked out of being able to give
advice to anybody he wants
but tucker is certainly onto something
when he says
we should at least know what the
situation is you should at least
you should at least be aware so good
work there
by tucker for making us aware um
so here's a
big story that you won't see in the news
because it's about the news
it seems to me that the the health risk
from watching cnn is so real now that
you have to actually take it seriously
it's i think the health risk
of the fake news getting you all worked
up about
uh you know how many people are worried
that climate change will make the earth
uninhabitable imagine waking up
and believing that the earth will be
uninhabitable
i mean that would be pretty bad for your
mental health
but also imagine any of the other stuff
that's on cnn
and believing it you would be in this
continuous
you know panic so i think all the people
who are watching the panic porn
on the fake news have a real legitimate
health problem in terms of anxiety
mental health etc
but who would report on that
not cnn because the people whose job it
would be to report on this
they can't put themselves out of
business by reporting that they're bad
for your health
so it's a weird story that's really
really important
in my in my opinion it's really
important because
this is a real health problem and a
major one
probably affects a hundred million
people
is that too much tens of millions
this is a big big problem but by its
nature it just can't get reported so we
won't treat it that way
so that's a problem
joe biden is finding out that it's a
it's a good thing to be a serial gaffer
because when you make a new gaff people
are just used to it
so it doesn't seem like it it doesn't
seem like a problem
so his latest one is he said anybody
making less than
400 000 a year will not pay a single
penny in taxes of course what he meant
is that they would not pay any extra
taxes with the tax increase
but instead he said they won't pay a
single penny
now does that mean he has alzheimer's
now it's just more it's more him
so i don't think that shows his decline
but it does show he's joe biden still
one of the funniest stories is watching
cnn uh
hire republicans as pundits so that they
can say well
at least we had one republican on there
and then canceling them for being
republican
it happened to steve cortez so he had a
contract with cnn to be their you know
republican
pundit i guess but he got frozen out
because he kept
being too good at it that's literally
true
steve cortez lost his job on cnn by
being he was too good at it
you know he was debunking the fine
people hoax
on their network which was true
and useful and important they couldn't
handle it they got rid of them
so now we're seeing rick santorum is
now in the crosshairs he also i don't
know if he still is but was on the
payroll
as their pundit and he made the mistake
of uh in a speech recently
he i'm paraphrasing so this won't be
exactly it but
paraphrasing he said that the
constitution and our country was formed
uh primarily with anglo-saxon influence
and not much in terms of the native
americans
but historians and
people on the left got quite ins you
know
quite angered by that and they said read
your history
rick santorum because you if you did you
would learn
that the the framers of our constitution
did in fact look at the iroquois nation
to get some ideas about how to build our
country how many of you knew that
did anybody any of you know that the
framers of the constitution
looked at the native american
you know the five nations and how they
they had a federalist system
so um i may have learned this when i was
a kid i didn't remember
it so i just was refreshing my memory of
it
but here's my question so just to
uh be specific so the iroquois
were made up of five nations maybe you
could call them tribes but they call
them nations
so five nations but the individual
nations were like states
in the sense that they would make their
own rules and they would manage their
own little nation
but there was still a federal if you
could call it that a higher authority
that was a hereditary leader
now if we're building a
democracy i don't think you can say we
borrowed from
a dictatorship to build our system
but that's what people are saying so uh
if you've got one leader and it's a
hereditary leader
feels sort of dictatorship to me but
just in the specific sense of letting
the individual nation states have their
own laws
as long as they didn't violate whatever
the the top you know the top law was
some are saying this was the model for
the states having lots of control and in
a federalist system
now here's my question to you
are there any systems that are different
because i'm not well informed so i can't
answer this question myself it sounded
like it was
it sounded like i knew the answer when i
asked the question but i don't
so here's the question in china
does china have a system in which
locally people have their own control
but of course if anything violated what
the
federal government wanted the federal
government would win
is was there any any place that was
different
because it seems to me that the uh the
iroquois nation
was certainly maybe not influenced by
any other
country because they didn't have contact
but it feels like everybody just comes
up with the same idea
don't they can you give me an example of
a
large large has to be large
country in which uh there was no
local control and local laws that
differed among the
local groups is there any example of
that because i feel as if this example
we just accepted like
oh here's a good example we we borrowed
that federal system from the iroquois
to which i say but everybody who sits
down to invent a system comes up with
the same one
don't they so that's what i need to fact
check on
was there any system at the time when
when the framing was
done was there any system in the world
because they looked at
other governments before they made their
decisions was there any system
in which they didn't have local laws in
addition to a
federal i don't know
um somebody's saying china and the
soviet union
but even they have local local
government
i think they all have local government
so i reject this
this explanation that we are influenced
by nativist the way you do it i mean i
just think it's the obvious way to do it
right anyway we'll never hear an answer
to that what was hilarious though is
watching don lemon and chris cuomo
when they do the changeover from one
show to the other uh
they do some banter on screen which is
really good by the way
one of the things that cnn does well
is that that uh that handoff from one
show to the next
where they do a little banter before the
other one takes over inside you know if
you like
if you like cnn's programming that's a
really good technique
uh it's engaging every time but anyway
don lemon and chris cuomo were arguing
with each other like a married couple
over this rick santorum thing and and
when i say married like
arguing like a married couple it goes
like this
hey chris cuomo what do you think of
this
i think it was bad chris cuomo agrees
and then don lemon gets mad at him
because chris cuomo also
made another point so then
don lemon gets mad at him for not
agreeing with him
in which he already completely agreed
but he also made another point which is
just true
which feels like not agreeing because
that's a different point
so why can't you just say i'm right and
go away
you know so basically the two of them
were in complete agreement as far as i
could tell
but they thought they were arguing or at
least
don lemon did he thought he was arguing
but there was no disagreement and he
acted like he was still arguing and that
chris cuomo was like the like the the
 here and he was
he was the one who'd done something
wrong and and i think cuomo was just
uh you know i'm watching this i'm
thinking i think cuomo is thinking
am i not agreeing with a 100 of what
you're saying
why do you have that arguing voice on
yeah very very much like a typical
marriage
uh meanwhile the gop is reportedly going
full
racist there there's some talk
we don't know that this is confirmed so
this is a little bit speculative but
there's some people talking about
replacing
uh liz cheney from some leadership
um areas because liz cheney's anti-trump
blah blah blah
and this is axios reported this they
said most members recognize cheney can't
be succeeded by a white man
given their top two leaders that
mccarthy
and steve scalise or white men
so um i don't know if this story is true
now obviously it's something they have
to discuss
can we have a third white male in
leadership
it's the right question but here's the
thing
it's racist how can the republican party
do something that's
overtly racist it feels like that's
off-brand
isn't it
feels very off-brand so as someone who
has
lost a couple of careers for this
this is how i lost my banking career
there were too many white men in
management
and so management said we're going to
just stop promoting white men
and they told me that directly like
that's not an interpretation
they called me into the office and said
we can't promote you
we don't know when that'll ever change
because you're a white man
and we have too many of them in
management so i quit
went to the local phone company got on
the management track
i was i was going to be a you know high
executive if things went well
and same thing happened one day they
called me and said we have too many
white men
in management people are complaining
so we can't promote you ever
maybe because you're a white male so i
quit that job
to become a cartoonist once i became a
cartoonist one of the things i did was
start a
tv show on upn which on the second
season it got cancelled
because they decided to use that night
for african american programming
so three careers
i lost by either being a white man or
having a comic about
a white guy and here it is again
now this was years ago and you know you
kind of wish that this wasn't still
happening
but don't you think there's somebody in
congress who's saying
wait a minute i thought that was going
to be my job
isn't there somebody who's just being
discriminated against
you know if the if the third you know
more powerful person
happened to be male and white i don't
know if it is
but this is just racism i don't know how
you can call it anything else now having
said that
i also support having a government that
looks like
you know the nature of the people but
you don't have to do it on every hiring
decision
you know it's more like you should
recruit better
but i don't know if denying somebody a
job that they're they're the right one
for
i don't know if that gets us there but i
do agree we need to
have a government that looks like the
people
so apparently biden was going to keep
trump's uh low number of uh refugees at
15
000 but he got a lot of pushback on that
and he raised his cap to
62 500 this fiscal year
so that's how many refugees will come in
so that would be on top of
immigration they would be the ones who
had some some reason to be a refugee
and i think to myself how do we come up
with that number
are you curious why is it 62
500 you you couldn't round that off
it couldn't be 60 000 or 65 000
or seventy thousand but it's sixty two
thousand
five hundred because somehow we know
that's the right number
there's no right number because helping
refugees
doesn't really have a limit right
either these are people in desperate
problems and
you should help as many as you can or
they're not in desperate problems or
it's not your problem
and you shouldn't do any but how do you
pick a number
it's just weird it it's like picking a
number
that you feel will make people leave you
alone
that's what it feels like it's like oh
15 000
people didn't leave us alone they said
it should be more let's try
62 500 and see if people stop
complaining
i feel like this is just a stop
complaining number
because you couldn't i don't think you
could back it up with any economics or
the bible or the constitution or
anything there's just no objective way
to pick this number
so i guess you just pick a number that
sounds to the public like you thought
about it
it's best you can do there was a
fascinating question on twitter today
that i would love to see
a whole bunch of different variants on
and the question was this
this is from andrea just a user on
twitter who ended up getting tens of
thousands of retweets on this and
andrea asked what happens in your brain
when it comes to adding
28 plus 47 and then she says
quote your process let me see how your
brain works
this was really interesting because 28
plus 47
is just complicated you have to go
through a process
and watch all the different ways that
people approached it
all right alex so alex marty you're a
you should just get the off here
right you just
just leave don't ever come back i don't
want to see you again
so these are the that just
ruined the world so alex
or alex is saying scott is for open
borders
scott is for open borders no you
i'm not on the opposite of that i've
said it a million times
just go yourself and leave get out
of here
you are not helping anybody you are just
