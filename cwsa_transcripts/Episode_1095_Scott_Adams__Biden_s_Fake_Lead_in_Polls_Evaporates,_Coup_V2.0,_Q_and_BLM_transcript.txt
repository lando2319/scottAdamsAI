hey everybody
come on in i put on the shirt
just for you that's right i was sure
listen to a moment ago because
we're in a heat wave and i don't have
air conditioning
sure wish i did i do i have it in the
other part of the house but not my
office
and how long does it take to fix air
conditioning during the heat wave
well it's not fast so maybe sometime in
two weeks or so
so i may not be able to work in my
office i'm gonna have to relocate
somewhere for probably a few weeks see
what happens
but enough about me let's have the
simultaneous step and all you need is a
copper mug or glass attacker challenger
stein a canteen charger flask a vessel
of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip
and it happens now go
well although i still have electricity
where i live in my zip code
i'm in california and it looks like a
lot of california will not have
electricity today why
because our government in california
is incompetent it decided to be very
green and
socially correct and the cost of that is
getting rid of your nuclear power maybe
some of your gas power
and trying to make it more green
what's the problem with that no
electricity when it gets hot so there
will be people
dropping like flies today because of bad
government management there will be
people who
probably die today because governor
newsom didn't do his job and the rest of
the government
because if you're getting rid of power
sources when you don't have enough
that's going to come back and bite you
so if you'd like the rest of the country
to be as
well managed as california you know how
to do
it um
i don't know why anybody stays in
california the only reason i do
is because connections and roots and
you know i've got too many things here
that i can't
walk away from but anybody who can
leave who stays in california
i don't know why you do it unless unless
like me you've got connections
so uh rush limbaugh is getting in
trouble today for i guess
i didn't hear it but he was referring to
uh
joe biden and kabul harris as joe and ho
now he didn't he didn't make that up
you've seen that going around the
internet
here is my advice to republicans
slash conservatives that line of attack
on harris
just doesn't work so if the only thing
you're trying to accomplish
is to make republicans and conservatives
less popular and to get them fewer votes
then that's the way to go because you
know the
the personal uh sexual past of
anybody we just can't make that part of
politics it just can't be
you know if she broke some laws okay but
otherwise
that since that didn't happen it's just
counterproductive
it's just counterproductive doesn't do
anything
so i would say don't do that all right
so
here is the democrats plan for
retaining power or getting power i guess
back from trump
they have three ways to win
three different ways to win number one
fair and square let's say biden and
harris just get more votes that's one
way to win
number two
rigged the election with mail-in votes
and fraud and all that
could that work absolutely
because you're only talking about some
battleground states
how hard would it be to rig the votes
with mail-in votes and battleground
states
easy easy i would think so they could
win that way
but they have a third plan
which is the dangerous one and that's
the one that goes like this
phase one make sure that the election
will not be seen as
credible no matter who wins now this is
a big deal
because we're better off with an
inaccurate vote count
that we mistakenly think is credible
than we would be
if we if we got exactly the right vote
count let's say with no errors
whatsoever
impossible just say that but we don't
think it's credible
that would be the worst case right so if
you had a choice
of a good vote count that we don't trust
or an inaccurate vote count that for
whatever reason we do trust
you want the one where we trust because
otherwise the country
is in trouble and it looks like the
democrats are setting up
a situation that guarantees the outcome
will be in question wouldn't you say
that that's obvious at this point
it's fairly obvious that the intention
of the mail-in voting
is to make sure that you can't tell who
won
that is the intention uh you know you
don't have to be a mind reader to know
that if you could select from choices
that have more
integrity versus less in a national
election
you would never choose the one with less
integrity
unless you wanted less integrity
right you would only choose that option
if that's what you wanted
otherwise you'd say all right
everybody's got the same risk
go to the voting voting places and vote
so once once they get there let's say uh
trump wins but narrowly if trump wins
but narrowly they're going to say that
the vote was not
valid and they're going to start
whatever legal
and or extra-legal process to remove a
president that they would then label as
a dictator
who refused to leave office how do you
know this is true
because you can see the disinformation
campaign
very clearly there on cnn you're going
to see
more and more of this it's going to be
what happens
if trump refuses to leave after he loses
right every time they bring up that
hypothetical
they're forming a truth that they can
then just
transfer into whatever happens so
reality hasn't given us
an outcome or election yet but cnn is
already
forming the truth about it which will
then just be ported over to the actual
situation
and so the truth that they're selling
the brainwashing if you will the
disinformation campaign
and by the way if i had heard anybody
talk the way i'm talking right now
five years ago i would have laughed now
it said you
stupid conspiracy theorists
there's nobody trying to overthrow the
government
but then we just watched it we know for
sure
that the democrats the fbi and the media
did in fact try to overthrow the
government that's not even
speculation at this point it's you know
proven demonstrable
fact so if they did it once
would they do it a second time oh the
reason to do it a second time
is way bigger there's a way more
incentive to do it a second time
do you know why because we haven't yet
jailed the people who did it the first
time
if the let's say i won't name any names
but don't you think there's some extra
people who have some trouble coming
some people whose names are you know
you know i've got a feeling that the
durham probe
and the election are racing right now
and if durham can get
certain people indicted and or in jail
before the election
that might be one thing but those same
people who might be indicted
and or go to jail are probably going to
push pretty hard for the option
of making sure that the election result
is not credible
if trump wins because in order for some
people to stay out of jail
they might have to rig the election and
removed the legally elected
president to stay out of jail
to stay out of jail would anybody rig an
election
to stay out of jail yeah
yeah especially if you rigged the last
election
or you tried to by having a coup and
removing the president
you know in effect rigging it after the
fact i guess you'd say
so every bit of this is entirely not
only possible
but probable i would go so far as to say
probable at this point yeah why is adam
schiff not in jail i don't even
understand that
clearly you should be in jail
all right uh now let's talk about what
the media is
doing to us so we've got mailbox gate
going on
the the belief that trump is having all
the mailboxes picked up on trucks and
taken away
so that people can't vote by mail now of
course
i saw that story and i said to myself
you know
i feel i'm gonna wait a little bit if
you see a story
that the president has ordered mailboxes
to be physically removed
so that people can't vote
the first thing you should think about
that story is maybe i'll wait a little
bit on this one
i'm just going to take a little pause on
this one because i don't i don't want to
jump right in on
on the removing mailboxes all across the
country story
because it's a little bit have you ever
heard me say this before
a little bit on the nose
once you learn this on the nose thing
where the
where the news story is a little too
perfect
isn't that a little perfect the
president is rounding up mailboxes
your first thought should be probably
not
probably not and sure enough you wait 24
hours you lift
put you look at the news you know
breitbart's got a story about uh
i guess during the obama administration
14 000
mailboxes were removed it's normal
maintenance to remove them and
relocate them into busier places it's
just business as usual
there's literally nothing that happened
so
you got that um
then what else what else we've got going
oh there's a
there's the fake story that the
president is pushing a birther thing
with uh harris which he's not exactly
pushing
he's just saying other people brought it
up
that's it yeah people brought it up
okay i guess that's our national story
that's all we're going to talk about
is the fact that the president didn't do
something but you can kind of make it
seem as if he did
if you weren't it right that's news
um what else we got going on
um so new zealand has delayed their
election
which could not make me any happier
because what
the democrats well not not just the
democrats but
uh people have been saying for i don't
know weeks now
new zealand they're the smart ones new
zealand really knows how to handle a
coronavirus
we should be more like new zealand you
know it would be good
if the united states were more like new
zealand they've got their act together
they did what they delayed the the
election because of the coronavirus
ah now we don't like new zealand new
zealand's the wrong model
new zealand does everything wrong new
zealand is dom
so you can expect that today new
zealand's not so smart
when they don't do what we want them to
do
so both biden and harris did not appear
did not appear on any shows before the
convention
what the heck does that tell you neither
biden or harris
or even any senior people from their
campaign
they didn't send anybody out to talk on
one of the biggest
days of the week for the election are
they even trying
is there something going on here's what
i think is going on
hypothesis when would be the best time
to replace biden with harris
would it be during the convention
would it be that once all the democrats
are somehow at least
connected by zoom and digitally
connected
could it be that that would be the right
time
for let's say joe biden to say
i've got a sniffle and because i have a
sniffle
i couldn't possibly run for president
or some minor problem like that is it
possible
that all the conversation happening
right now
is around the question of who should be
the top of the ticket
do you think that they're having that
conversation intensely
well here's the thing if they get past
the convention
it's going to be a lot harder to change
the ticket won't it
it feels like there's a an optimal time
to do it and then there's
it's a little harder after that but
possible all right
so i think the conversation is about
when to do it
not if because it's going to happen
it's either going to happen naturally
during the term it's going to happen
effectively because everybody will
assume that harris is running the show
but it's going to happen so
i think it's possible that having nobody
from the campaign talk about anything
could be a risk management decision in
which
they know that anything they say today
could make things worse
but there's nothing that could have been
said yesterday on the news in terms of
having yours or against talking to the
news there's nothing that could have
made it better
because whatever happens with a shake-up
of the ticket
would be you know a nuclear bomb of news
that would make anything that happened
on sunday unimportant
unless it was a mistake so the fact that
they
are playing to not make a mistake
that aggressively tells me something's
coming there's a little extra coming
and they're at least talking about it
i'm not predicting that they'll make the
change at the
convention i'm predicting that that's
the conversation they're having
all right i did a little uh
poll in which i asked people if they
thought the black lives movement
protests were making things better or
worse for
black americans now most of the people
who answered it were probably
people who were trump supporters
probably
more male probably more white
80 white something like that because
that's just who follows me
on twitter it's not my fault
[Laughter]
don't blame me i'm not the i'm not the
one who decides who follows me
i'm just telling you that's who follows
me if that if you don't think that's
diverse enough
i can't help it um but
anyway uh i think something like 83
percent i didn't check it recently
said that the the protests are making it
worse
for black people in the united states
now you might say to yourself well why
are you asking a bunch of white people
if this is making it worse for black
people well that's exactly the group to
ask
if you want to see how the people who
might have prejudice
are feeling because black people are not
trying to convince other
black people that they should get more
respect resources etc
they're trying to convince the very kind
of people who answered my poll
so that is the group you want to hear
from how do you feel
about this segment of society now that
they've expressed a
let's say the black lives matter
protests et cetera have been expressed
the way they have been expressed
and if you get 83 or somewhere in that
neighborhood
saying it made things worse for black
people
i think that probably did and here's how
i think it's worse
i think the the i hate to use this word
but you know what i'm talking about
the brand for black america
i think is ruined for a while
it might take 10 years to recover that
because it's such a bad look because
it's paired with
looting and paired with pictures of
destruction and violence etc
because all those things are paired it's
just become a terrible look
and then the black lives matter leaders
saying stuff such as
the looting is reparations
i don't know how you could do a worse
thing to the public
you're trying to help i mean really
if if black people in america thought
that something like
real reparations could be possible would
you want your
let's say people who present themselves
as leaders
the black lives matter leaders and
organizers would you want them saying
that the looting was reparations
that's exactly what you'd want them not
to say because that just took it right
off the table
you know i i was sort of pro looking
into reparations at least having
you know having a legitimate
conversation about what could and could
not be done
given constraints i was all for that i'm
all for any conversation and i think
that that was
you know worth having but not now
now it would just be a waste of time i
wouldn't spend one minute
talking about reparations you know
i'd wait another 10 years before
bringing that up
so i think things are worse for
reparations they're certainly worse for
racial harmony
and i think it's going to have the
biggest impact on employment
i think black employment is going to
take a hit because a lot of people are
going to say you know i just
don't want somebody who feels bad about
me
so it won't even be a question that the
employer feels bad about the employee
they'll just say why would i hire
somebody i think might have a bad
attitude about
me yeah and that would be fair
i don't know if it would be legal but it
would certainly be reasonable to
not hire people you have a high likely
a high degree of certainty that they
don't like you
all right um and of course black lives
matter has their priorities upside down
which is the worst thing
they're they're focusing on the police
uh element of it which
you know needs a look i'm not saying
that you should brush that aside
there there's something real that needs
to be looked at there and
made better but it is also their lowest
priority
or should be because it affects the
fewest people
highest priority of course is the
teachers unions
which are the source of ongoing
systemic racism so if black lives matter
can't even
fight systemic racism right they're
going after the lowest priority
instead of the highest priority the
teachers unions
it's hard to give them any credibility
so i think they're way behind
so cnn news is about q anon because that
embarrasses the president and about the
u.s postal service being
actually quite dependable so cnn
is trying to brainwash the country into
thinking mail service is dependable
let me ask you this have you ever had
somebody else's mail delivered to your
mailbox
i think you have i think yes
have you ever mailed anything that
didn't get to its destination
oh i think you have has anybody ever
mailed something to you
that you didn't get oh i think you have
you've had that experience i mentioned
before my father worked for the post
office for 30 years
every night he would come home and over
dinner he would complain about some
post office inefficiency so i'm as
biased as you could possibly be
about the efficiency of the post office
let me tell you one other little
anecdote
back in the days when i would draw the
comic strip dilbert
on paper and i would take a copy of it
and mail the original to my syndicator
who would then take copies and send it
off to the newspapers
well what happens once the the post
office where you mail your originals
what happens once they figure out your
name
what happened after they recognized my
name
and realized i was the dilbert creator
and i was sending a package that was
about the size of original art
what what do you think happened to my
original art
stolen yeah stolen was i the only
cartoonist
who put original art in the mail and
once the post office realized who was
mailing it
they stole it nope
it happened to other cartoonists i'm not
going to name names
but there's a well-known cartoonist who
couldn't mail his
his work because the post office
stole it every time
now i once had his years before there
were gofundmes
i wrote a story about somebody who's
having trouble
on a newsletter i used to do years and
years ago and
uh i think i asked people to i don't
know
send if they wanted to donate to this
person who was in a bad situation
they could send money to this post
office box now what i didn't realize
is that people wouldn't send it
necessarily checks
so something like 80 percent of the
people who send some money to that post
office box
put cash they put cash in it now
of course they they tried to disguise it
you know you put paper around the cash
or whatever
but as soon as the post office realized
that
any cash there must have been at least
one that you could sort of tell there
was
a dollar in there or something as soon
as the postal employees realized
that the mail going to this one post
office box had cash in it
how much of the cash got through after
the day that they realized it was cash
none none they stole every every bit of
it
you know there were like empty envelopes
that would show up and it just like
stopped one day
the moment they realized it was cash
they stole it all
so the democrats are trying to sell you
the most ridiculous
notion that the post office could take a
30
hit to their traffic uh and
given the the current amount of
efficiency
that we would have something like a
credible election that way
there is not really any chance of having
a credible election
with a massive mail-in votes it's just
not a thing
and it doesn't matter who wins and
doesn't even matter what happens
it is not credible by its
as a system in other words there's
nothing you can do
between now and then there's just
nothing you can do there's not enough
time
now let me test out a uh
i need you to fact check this for me
i saw a claim that you can tell
by the bar code and some codes on it on
the outside of your ballot
if you're a republican or a democrat can
somebody confirm that that's true or not
true
and the the claim is that under the
barcode there's this
what looks like a long series of random
numbers and letters
but one of the letters is either a d or
an r
indicating whether you're registered
democrat or republican
i don't know if that's true can somebody
fact check that for me
because again remember the rule if
something's a little bit
too on the nose it's probably not true
so if you hear that the the mail-in
ballots
uh tell have some kind of indicator on
it subtle one but you if you knew what
it was you could look for it
that the indicator will tell you if
you're democrat or republican
that is too on the nose meaning
if that's true well that would be
amazing
so usually things that if they're true
that would be amazing
are usually not true so somebody needs
to
confirm that this is true to me before i
will believe it
but there's a report out there that you
can tell just by looking at the envelope
if that's true there's really no chance
of
of a fair election no chance the the
the oh and and this is the funniest part
if you want to know how dumb the post
office is
uh and again i can say this because my
father worked for the post office
and he he was one of the dumbest guys
i've ever known
true story i hate to say that he's he's
no longer with us so i can say that
but the postal union
decided to endorse
biden that's right
while we're having this big national
debate about whether the post office
can be a major element of a fair
election the postal union
just endorsed one of the people running
now that should have been the end of it
the moment the postal union endorsed one
of the candidates
that was the point when the democrats
should have said oh
okay that really just changes everything
i
i see we can't use the system anymore
because now it's not only bias but it's
announced a bias they announced
a bias that's really the end of it
if we were any kind of a competent
country
we would just say oh well there's still
a debate about whether it could be done
fairly
but there's no longer a debate about
whether it can be seen as credible
and if you think those are the same
debate they're not
so let me say that again because it's
the most important thing
there's a debate about whether it can be
accurate
and that's separate from whether the
public
can ever see it as credible and once
once the
postal union has picked aside
that's it that's the end of any real
chance it could be seen as credible
it can't be because the people
delivering
the damn mail just told you who they
want to win
i don't think it could be any clearer
than that that you can't overcome that
hurdle
that that is a mountain that no amount
of hard work
can overcome you can do anything you
want
you could put a trillion dollars into
making sure that the
actual mail delivery was accurate it
would make
no difference at this point because
the postal union picked a preferred
candidate it's over
this question is absolutely over
but the but the fake news will try to
conflate those two things
and act like the credibility and the
actual
performance are really the same thing
and then there's another bit of magic
where they have to act as though
the post office does a good job
now as somebody who is bad at analogies
said on twitter
oh sure because by the way you can tell
that this is
a democrat talking because they only use
sarcasm instead of reasons so
don't look for the reason it's just
sarcasm oh
sure we we don't trust the post office
to to deliver the ballots but we do
trust it for our social security checks
well i think they do those
electronically but we do trust it for
all of our important other stuff oh no
the only important thing we don't trust
it for
is the election yeah all these other
important things we trusted for
just not this one thing right so that's
a democrat
argument it doesn't say anything it just
says it in that tone
so there's no actual thinking or
rational anything it's just that tone
now here's what's wrong with it of
course if somebody sends you a check
and you don't get it because it got lost
in the mail or it comes a few days late
that doesn't change too much does it
there isn't too much that's going to go
wrong
if your check is a couple days late or
even if it gets lost
you can always call the the person who
lost it as i have let me let me
tell you how many times that i've not
gotten a check
that was mailed to me
25 times maybe in the in the course of
my professional life
something like 25 times i've had to
put a stop on a check or ask somebody to
put a stop on a check because the mail
didn't deliver it
probably 25 times and
so the so the next thing that the news
will try to convince you
is that they're actually good when you
have a time
constraint so the reason these analogies
are not appropriate
is because these are low risk things
that don't have a timing element to them
whereas the election is the highest of
all risk
it's literally the highest risk in the
country if you get that wrong
everything else falls apart it doesn't
matter what you're doing right with your
economy
your anything else if if the election
doesn't hold as credible
everything else falls apart it's all
dependent on that that's the
that's the way the system is designed
so we're going to have a non-credible
result
and the news will try to convince us
that it was credible it's the most
incredible
the most amazing act of brainwashing
you'll ever see
all right um
oh so you notice that there are
riots and massive uh shootings and gun
deaths and stuff
and i guess chicago and portland and
seattle i don't know if new york is
still doing it and they're getting
pretty violent and terrible
and every day that they go on trump gets
closer to election because trump has
played this
perfectly from a political perspective
you could argue about you know
functionally but from a political
perspective
the best thing trump could have done
is continuously offer federal help
and let the cities decline it and then
once they've declined it
allow allow that to stand not overrule
them now the
the minor exception was federal people
protecting federal property but that's
an exception that's
that's federal property uh so by trump
not acting like a dictator in other
words not sending in troops and
overriding the cities and
and the states he looks very much not
like a dictator
and it makes the other side the
democrats running
these riot-torn cities look like
well do you want more of that because
that's what they want to bring you
nationally
i mean if i were the trump campaign i
would do nothing but show video from the
riots
and say this is what they want to bring
to you nationally because you know
that's not even a little bit wrong
that's not even a
slight bit of hyperbole what you're
seeing in the inner cities
is exactly what you would get everywhere
if those same kinds of policies were
taken nationally same kind of policies
in this case being
soft on crime um
cnn has managed to disappear all of the
riots
like it's like they don't exist and also
the kleinsmith stuff
so to so the country is having like
massive these big riots every night
and there was a coup that we now know
you know
at least one of the central uh players
of this coup this kleinsmith guy
and that's sort of not treated as news
[Laughter]
not really news
the the milly weaver thing i haven't
gotten interested in yet i guess that's
been removed
so i guess that's um let's say uh
contentious contentious no some
debatable
reporting there so i don't know what the
truth is on any of that
um here let me
see if i can clear something up that a
few times i made some twitter comments
that were incomplete
and therefore misleading and it goes
like this
why is it that the george floyd story
is a national story whereas the
uh the the five-year-old or the toddler
whatever he was
who was killed by his neighbor while he
was just
in his front yard why is one of them a
national story and the other is ignored
because fox news and others are trying
to say hey
what about this story is it only because
the victim was white and here's
what the public doesn't understand about
what makes a national story
now i deal with trying to turn things
that are not
stories into national stories that's
actually my job
so if i'm trying to get my book promoted
and let's say it was a
the original dilbert books i would tie
them to a national story which is hey
there's lots of downsizing and
offshoring back in the 90s
and here's a character that has the same
situation
so dilbert got on the cover of magazines
etc
because i did what everybody does when
they want to elevate
an individual story they attach it to
something that's already a story
you can't make a story out of nothing
it's really hard
but you can attach anecdotes to existing
stories and then they
they get some attention so the george
floyd thing was
attached to a national story you can
argue
whether it was a true or false story
but you can't argue that it was a
national high-level story
about black citizens being abused by
cops so because it was already a story
any video especially and it's the video
that makes it extra extra strong
it's not the video alone it still could
have been a story without the video
but i think you'd all agree the video
gave it that extra power
so i think i said on twitter it has to
be on video let me
let me adjust that to say doesn't have
to be on video
but it's way way way stronger if it is
so the problem with the child who is
killed by the neighbor
is it does not attach to any national
story
and when the conservative side of the
world tried to do that
and say hey hey this is a story too
why are you ignoring it why are you
being hypocrites they weren't
they weren't being hypocrites because
the child who was killed as tragic as
that
is and and unique in its in its way
in a bad way uh it just doesn't attach
to a national story
but suppose the democrats had run that
same story
it would have been a gun control story
a gun control story right it would have
been
a story about there are too many guns
and therefore look what happened this
kid got shot
but because the races were the wrong
races
it doesn't fit in with the black lives
matter story
doesn't fit in with the protesters so
places like cnn would be
disinclined to attach it to a national
story about gun control
because it would work against their
other propaganda now that part's true
but if you're a conservative i wouldn't
try
too hard yeah his his name is canon
uh hit net if that's if that's the right
name
um so i wouldn't try too hard
to get this attached to a national story
if you're a conservative
because it's going to get attached to
gun control now
you might say to yourself but wait scott
what about the
national story of black on white
murder what about that because and i
looked that up just see what the stats
are on that
um and i think it's something like
like i actually have those stats
um and it's always hard to find stats
when you're talking
on public and looking for your stats you
can never find your stats
how the hell did i not find that oh here
it is
there are more than twice as many black
and white homicides
compared to white on black so the black
population is
13 of the country white is 80
something percent but they have roughly
evil
equal number of crimes against the other
which would mean that the black on white
crime as a
percentage would be sky high
now why is that not a national story do
you ever ask yourself that
why is it not a national story that
white people are being slaughtered by
black people
now i use the word slaughtered to get
myself cancelled
because that's the part will be taken
out of context that's a lot of murder
there's a lot of murder going on
what is it what is it yeah it can't be
80 what's the percentage of
oh you know what it does uh i think in
the stats
the hispanic population was added to the
standard white population so i think in
the
when they do the stats they're adding
hispanic and white together as one
category
so then it gets into the 80s
not that you would do that necessarily
but that's what it is
so ask yourself why is that not a
national story
now of course you can explain it by
income
income groups and stuff like that
but it is not a story that you could
tell without getting canceled
can you imagine any national news
program doing a story
about the epidemic of black people
killing white people
you can't really you can't even imagine
it
in this country that could never happen
and
because dana can be used to make any
case you want
you could simply reverse and say oh sure
but
white people are killing just as many
black people so
you know it's about equal well my point
is
that we sort of decide what the story is
and then
things get attached to it but it's the
national press that decides what's the
story and they have decided it's not
good for their personal careers to
emphasize any
racial disparity in crime and so they
don't
and so therefore that story of the
tragic story of the child who got
murdered by the neighbor
doesn't tie to a national story so
if you think you should that would be
fair to say but if
you're wondering hey why are these being
treated differently
that's the reason it's just not tied to
a national story
and that's the way it always works all
right um
coronavirus deaths i think there are
over 175 000 for this country
predicted at least another 24 000
in the coming month so we will easily
it looks like past 200 000 dead
that's a number which i had asked people
who were saying it's just the flu
early on i said well if you think it's
just the flu can you commit to
a number beyond which you'd say oh god
that wasn't just the flu
and and one of the one of the what would
i say
coronavirus i don't want to say skeptic
but skeptic in terms
of how bad it would be
had said 200 000 would be the number at
which you'd say okay
all right for 200 000 deaths that's
definitely not the flu
especially since the 200 000 you only
got to
because of the closed down and the
severe punishment of the economy
so does anybody still argue it's just
the flu
has that population of people now shrunk
to the point where
it's a different conversation a
conversation about how to handle it
but not so much that's just the flu
so i don't know if that transition is
going to happen but i don't hear the
just the flu people
being as loud on social media anymore
speaking of statistics do you believe
that we will ever know
eve no matter when at any date in the
future
whether the u.s did worse or better than
other
countries do you think we'll ever know
that if you said yes
oh yeah we'll definitely know i mean
once it's all done
we'll look at the data lots of
researchers will dig in they'll find out
what worked what didn't
and we will know if president trump did
a good job
compared to the other leaders if you
believe that can be known
you've never been involved in this kind
of work meaning
data analysis of any kind we can't know
that
it is completely unknowable unless it
was some
major obvious thing that anybody could
tell but if you tried to
suss it out of the the data and the only
thing you're doing is saying i'm not
going to look at
i'm not going to look at the decisions
he made i'm just going to see how it
turned out
you know you're never going to be able
to do it and here's why
would it be most appropriate i saw this
yesterday
for the us as a whole to be compared to
the other wealthy countries would that
be a good comparison
well i would argue that you need to take
the islands out of it
i think you need to take your taiwan's
your south korea which is effectively an
island because of the dmz
you're you're new zealand's
and maybe you're australia that's a it's
a pretty big island but
uh but i think you need to look at the
island separately
and say okay these have the most in
common with each other because of
you know the island element of it and
see how the islands did
so if you're throwing the islands in
with wealthy countries
well already that result is less
credible
okay that's just one problem here's some
more
the united states is really 50 different
entities
you know 52 if you count i don't know
puerto rico and guam or whatever
so should we say that the
average of those all those entities is
what the united states is
or should we treat each of the states
like a country and say all right how did
new york state do
compared to europe right because
actually new york state's doing pretty
well
you know they had a they had a tough
spot wasn't their fault for the most
part
you could argue about the about the
the old people being put back in their
senior care places that looks like a
mistake in hindsight
i don't know if it was as obvious when
it happened obviously it wasn't
it wasn't obviously a mistake when it
happened
but wouldn't we find for example that we
have let's say
just guessing probably more than 40
states
who are doing better than europe
would that be true would we have 40 of
our states doing better than europe
maybe but then those european countries
would say wait wait wait
if you get to cherry-pick your states
we're going to say
if you take i'll just pick a random
all right we'll do the same thing we'll
take frankfurt out of our equation
i'm just guessing that frankfurt had bad
coronavirus i don't know if it did
we'll just take that out of our equation
how about that and then we beat you
again
so basically everybody who wants to look
good is going to have an argument well
don't count the you know the senior care
places
you have to take those out that was just
you know
tragic but you know if you're really
going to compare
that was just one event that had a big
impact you got to take that out
so people argue about whether that
should be in around whether the state
should be compared
whether you're on the same curve we
don't know
and then here's
here's the thing that's so completely
unknowable
and the thing that's going to drive me
freaking crazy for the next five years
and it goes like this as far as i can
tell
sweden did the dumbest strategy
and it worked out the best
now that of course creates a situation
where
you can say that they didn't have a good
strategy or that they did
you could just spin it any way you want
so here's why it was the dumbest plan
when sweden went for herd immunity the
assumption was they'd have to get the 60
or 70 percent infection
turns out it's probably closer to 20
because people seem to have some natural
immunity
and if sweden had known it was going to
be 20
well they're geniuses oh they're
geniuses
we'll talk about italy in a second
but
but sweden thinking that they were
heading toward herd immunity of 60 or 70
which by any measure would have been you
know quite a big
death toll probably would have crashed
their health care system
they probably would have ended up
closing more stuff they would have had
to more aggressively close down because
the public would say
too many people are dying or health care
is dying so if
so if sweden's plan had worked the way
they thought it would work
here's the key part if sweden's plan had
worked
the wastes we didn't thought it would
work if it gone exactly the way they
wanted it to
it would have crashed their whole
economy
because they thought it was 60 to 70
percent for herd immunity
they got incredibly lucky
i think now i think we'll probably have
to wait to see if this is real
but the only way that sweden got down to
basically
something like zero deaths lately is
because herd immunity was
a fraction of what everybody thought
nobody knew that
they did the dumbest strategy and hit a
home run
it was like they were blindfolded and
they were up to bat and somebody threw a
ball and they swung really hard
and they hit the fricking ball and they
got a home run and it wasn't because
they were good batters
they had a blindfold on right that's
what happened
so it's going to drive me crazy that we
will ever be compared to sweden's like
look how smart sweden was no they were
the dumbest
country but they got the luckiest
that's what it looks like to me
so if it turns out that 20 is hurt
immunity
and it also is true that the united
states has rampant
infections where europe does not who's
the smart one
right because now we've seen sweden
if we'd never seen sweden hit herd
immunity
we would also think it was 60 or 70
percent but now that we know it's closer
to
20 and we know that in all likelihood
i'm not sure you can say you know
anything but it seems
very likely that the reason that new
york city and new york state are doing
well
is that they have so many infections
that every they got to hurt immunity
and we might be the next one who hits
herd immunity simply because we didn't
control it that carefully
same as sweden so
if it turns out that we get back to a
functioning economy
and fewer deaths because we had herd
immunity faster than europe
who is the smart one would we be the
smart one because our economy would be
kicking back into gear
our deaths would be zero we'd be on the
other side of it like sweden
while europe is still trying to tamp
down every fire
i know we better close down again better
close down again better close down again
and they're going to end up in the same
place
so my my basic point is that
we will never know who did better than
anybody else because everybody was
guessing we all have good hindsight
none of the data is reliable and nobody
can decide what two things should be
compared
i will add this following prediction
i think that the reason that the herd
immunity is so
low somewhere 20 percent ish
might be because the vitamin d thing
i think we're going to find out that the
people who had the lowest
vitamin d as well as any other
medical problems were just the entire
the entire group that could have a
problem because it turns out that you
have low vitamin d if you're
african-american
if you're overweight if you've got
diabetes
if you're old if you're you know
probably in a senior care facility
like all of the things all the types of
people were at high risk
coincidentally also had
very low vitamin d i think in the end
we're going to find out that they were
the the ones at risk and
and if we had tested for vitamin d
levels we could have
really uh done better all right
now some of you are going to say how can
hurt immunity be 20
when we know that at least in one city
in europe it was over 50
and there are some prisons which are
also over 50 and there actually is a
perfectly good
reason why some environments don't get
hurt immunity at twenty percent and it
has to do with
density so if you got people packed
together such as
in a jail it doesn't matter that herd
immunity would normally be twenty
percent
they're just they're just basically
marinating in virus there's just so much
of a viral load
if you get enough infected people in a
small area like a jail
that in that case as with at least one
cruise ship as well
it'll it'll rush past 20 but those are
artificial environments where people
can't get away from each other too well
so it could be true that a prison or a
cruise ship
or a certain town could have a 50
situation for herd
another one might be 20 percent if
you're just living in the country
so those can be compatible all right
[Music]
cnn has a poll that shows uh
that the here's here's how it's worded
uh on i think breitbart
that joe biden's lead has evaporated in
the last two months
a new poll from cnn shows
this is a cnn poll showing biden's lead
has evaporated
now let me ask you this
let's say you were planning a coup
version 2.0 and let's say
let's say you wanted to maybe keep all
your options open
and one of the options would be to
replace the top of the ticket
with kamala harris if you were an
illegitimate news organization
whose leader jeff zucker was
personally and has for a long time been
a promoting
kamala harris what do you think your
polls would show right before the
democratic convention
i believe your polls would show
that biden has a lead
that evaporated because if cnn wants
kamal harris to take the top spot
they're going to have to create a
narrative that says that
biden cannot win the way he's going in
other words they're going to say
ah the weakness in the party it's
obviously the top spot
because you know and now his lead has
evaporated according to cnn
huh how convenient just when the
democrats are at that decision point
of deciding whether they need to make a
change at the top
just at the right time cnn that is very
pro-kamala harris coincidentally
produces their worst
poll results for joe biden huh
interesting what a coincidence
or is it
now i would say that one of the reasons
that maybe
trump will look better in all the polls
because i would expect all the polls to
start narrowing especially as we get
closer
to the vote and here's the thing that i
don't think you can
underestimate the degree to which
democrats
saw biden as a seat of filler and not a
real candidate
because as long as trump was running
against a generic
democrat that generic democrat didn't
have any flaws
and biden was really just a sea filler
he was just a stand-in a proxy if you
will
for a generic democrat a person who was
not trump
but now you put it in kamala harris
people say well she's the real president
and suddenly it's trump versus
an actual person who has actual
history and actual targets
and actual flaws it's the first time
until now trump was running against a
generic
even with biden and it was just a
generic now it's a real person
so you would expect that the flaws of a
real person
would seem bigger than the flaws of a
generic because that person can be
perfect
in your mind and the funniest part is
that the
battleground states the only ones that
matter
have how close are they they're dead
even
so the battleground states are dead even
do you know what dead even means in a
cnn poll
if the cnn poll says the battleground
states are dead even
statistically it's 49 to 48.
that means that trump is ahead of the
battleground states
there's no other way to see that because
you know
there's some shy trump supporters in
there
how shy are the trump supporters let me
put it to you this way
you know those gigantic trump boat
rallies
that you've seen on social media but you
don't see in the news because the news
doesn't cover it
those uh
i'm just looking at a comment that's
making me laugh the reason that trump
supporters have to have the rally in the
water
is because they can't do it on land
trump supporters could not put on their
trump hats
pick up their trump flags and say hey
let's meet in the park and have a trump
rally
it would be dangerous it's dangerous to
be on land
as a trump supporter that could be
identified it's
actually dangerous and so trump
supporters
didn't just find a cool way to show
their support it's like hey
boats are cool if we have a lot of boats
and it's the summer
it's going to look pretty cool let's
have a lot of boats yeah that's part of
it
that's part of it but the bigger part
is the republicans are not safe on land
democrats could have a pro-biden
[Music]
parade and they would know they would
not be harassed
maybe verbally but not physically right
democrats can have a rally on dry land
you live in a country where this sort of
this sort of snuck up on
you it's not an accident that the trump
supporters had to leave
the continental united states i mean
they're still in
u.s waters but they had to leave the
continental united states
literally physically leave it leave the
united states
to have a trump rally i mean they're
still in in our waters but
they have to leave the the dry land
that's not a joke
there's no joke there that is actually
what happened
they couldn't feel safe on dry land
now you tell me that these people are
telling the truth when pollsters call
them and say who do you support
not a chance not a chance
i told you that when a pollster called
me the first i think the first time it's
ever happened
um the moment i realized it was a
pollster
and i realized what the question was
going to be about in my head i said
oh i'm going to tell them biden because
the last thing i'm going to do is tell
them the truth
and you know it turns out they asked me
if i was registered to vote and i said
no and that was the end of it so i
didn't have to lie
but i would have so
at the moment it looks like there's no
real chance that biden
can win as the top of the ticket and
that means that cnn is going to soften
up the public by giving some
low poll numbers you should expect that
any other poll
polling company that's friendly to biden
is going to show his
his his lead narrowing you should see
all of the left-leaning polls narrow
quickly
because they're going to try to create
the story that well
sooner than it's sooner than better
sooner is better to replace the top of
the ticket
better get this going better hurry up
because he's not going to win you look
at the polls
he's not going to win you better put
somebody stronger in there hey
who do we put in there calmly hear us
all right
uh somebody says dude trump was holding
two rallies a week
until covent on landed everything
well that was trump trump has the
advantage of having lots of security
and a secure location uh that's still
safe
but if you were to just say hey why
don't we have like a trump parade
or why don't we all meet in the park and
we're just it's just us
there's no trump it's just us what do
you think would happen
it's a different situation have you
noticed that the people who disagree
with me are just bad at
analogies i think the democrats have
basically
two modes of arguing a bad analogy
and sarcasm and sometimes they they
combine the two
because you saw that even even though
that was a written comment
about the person who said uh that trump
has had rallies
even the written comment was written as
sarcasm
dude trump has had two rallies and
everything
even spelled everything so in that
sarcastic way and there thing
they can't actually have any kind of
irrational debate
it's so is so universally true it's just
a bad analogy
with sarcasm and they actually think
that that's some kind of
thinking some kind of point
it's really not it's actually not it's
just sarcasm
sarcasm isn't reasons and analogies are
not reasons either they're just
something that reminded you of something
else that's it
that's the whole thing
uh yeah try to put a trump bumper
sticker on your car
better yet put a trump bumper sticker
over
any car that you think is a biden
sporter
no don't do that their cars will get
wrecked
take that back do not do that
although i know it's been done as a
prank
somebody says warren i don't think so
but
you know nothing can be ruled out at
this point i don't think warren would
have a chance against trump
uh somebody says what's up with trump
helicopters
flying with four missiles why wouldn't
it
you don't think you don't think air
force one has defense
i would expect the helicopters to be
harmed
why wouldn't they be all right
uh somebody says
the comment was funny jesus ease up
boomer
can i see that now first of all the
comment
was meant to be a serious comment that
that trump has
rallies so here's somebody who can't
tell the difference between humor
and not humor actually can't tell the
difference and so
has decided to call me a boomer because
didn't have any other reasons
so so i guess that's the third argument
there are three democrat arguments
bad analogy sarcasm and calling people
to boomers
kind of it but this one won't have to
worry anymore because he is now
relegated to the
blocked world goodbye
all right that's all i got uh did you
cash out your kamala bet well she's not
official yet
she's not official i have two bets on
kamala one for the top of the ticket and
one for vice president
both of them were long odds so if either
one of them comes in
it pays for the other one so i'm at
least going to win for vice president
which would pay for my other bet and and
more
uh but if she becomes the top of the
ticket
i'm going to make some serious money so
i still have those bets in place oh
q anon um i
i don't know what to say about q i it
seems like cnn wants to make that more
of a story
uh q has become a bit of a religion i
think people
i think people just enjoy the whole cue
thing i just can't take it too seriously
somebody says if i see an american flag
i think trump supporter i think you're
right
i think you're right i don't think that
the democrats use the american flag
anymore
i think that they too see it as a
republican symbol
all right that's all i got for now and i
will talk to you
tomorrow slaughter beaters at 100
percent
