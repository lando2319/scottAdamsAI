good morning everybody
and welcome
to the highlight of civilization again
it gets better every time doesn't it and
lucky for you you found your way here
don't you feel better already
because this is the only podcast that's
guaranteed to make you a better smarter
happier person by the end of it
guaranteed if
if that doesn't happen for you I will
refund all the money you paid for this
live stream all of it every penny goes
back to you that is how confident I am
that this is going to be the greatest
thing you've ever seen and if you'd like
to guarantee it well there's one thing
you need to do
this is what you need to do you got to
get yourself a copper mug or a glass of
tanker Chelsea Stein they can't eat
jugular flaska vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee
join me now for the
dopamine here today the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it's going to
happen now go
all right Johan God says he's watching
from the toilet
and that is authorized the very best
places to watch this
would be while exercising
doing housework
uh instead of work while you're
pretending to work or on the toilet
those are all the very best places to
consume this content
and uh what about all the the news today
um
so the Twitter cybernetic brain which
reveals its Consciousness in the
trending section
if you think of
if you think of Twitter as a big
cybernetic brain which I do
when you see what's trending
that's similar by analogy to how your
mind is focusing
it's what your brain is focusing on
so today uh the trending the three three
on my trend line
it was Geraldo in the middle
then Balenciaga above him
and Fuentes below him
and I thought to myself
there it is there there is Twitter's
Focus today at least the version I was
looking at those are the three things I
thought were important it doesn't like
those three things today
didn't didn't like it but we'll talk
about more more about that
all right uh
so Moss said today there was a a third
party some kind of a blocking app so
here's what he tweeted I'm not sure
exactly what this means but I'm
suspicious of everything now right
so most says Twitter experienced slight
degradation of service today from an old
third party tool used to block accounts
that had no rate limit Psy
should be fixed now
what exactly was the third party tool
used to block accounts that had no rate
limit
what what
what does that mean
does that mean it blocked Bots
because if it was a blocking tool I feel
like he would have said that
uh
oh uh so is that telling us that there
is somebody some third party
tool
but I guess it was used what does it
mean to be a third party tool
I mean I'm pretty sure somebody's called
me a third party tool by now
if you start a third party and run for
president are you a third party tool
is yay going to start his own campaign
and run in his own party would he be a
third party tool I don't know I don't
know but uh it makes me wonder if there
was some external source that had the
ability to block accounts
was that possible do you think a third
party app could block accounts that
Twitter didn't know it was blocking
is that even possible
everything's possible at this point
right
I don't know what it means I wouldn't
make any assumptions about it
the other thing must said
cryptically
so just hold in your mind that the
person who just bought
Twitter is saying this this is this is
not a random troll this is somebody who
actually at this point knows what's
going on at Twitter and this is the head
of Twitter musk's tweeting this today
the amount of pro pro you meaning
professional psyops on Twitter is
ridiculous at least with new verified
the new verified accounts they will pay
eight dollars for the privilege ha ha
how does he know how many professional
psyops there are because he also tweeted
today you know a meme about all the
psyops
what does he mean
because you and I probably have an idea
what
what activity on Twitter is a
psychological operation
but he must have a much better idea
don't you think
this feels like the sort of thing that
you and I would have said is happening
you know we're just we're not fully
informed about what's happening if it
seems like we would have said we as just
users say ah I think there's some psyops
a whole bunch of psyops running on
Twitter
it's one thing if we think it's true
but this is a guy who owns Twitter
the guy who owns Twitter says it's like
bristling with professional psyops
operations
probably is I mean sounds like a
credible source
so that's interesting
um the China protests are heating up and
I saw one piece of news that I thought
was different
everybody always says the same thing
about these stories but one person says
something different
that there have been protests in China
before so that part is not super unusual
but they tended to be
geographically Limited
so prior to these current rounds of
protests they tend to be you know one
city that sort of thing but these
apparently are all over China
so they're protests everywhere and it's
all about the same topic it's about the
crackdowns and the government
and
so maybe this is the real thing and
apparently the uh the shock troops are
moving in to take care of the protesters
now
so
apparently China chairman she has
decided that he will use violence to end
the protests
so we've never seen violence used at
this scale on Chinese citizens lately
you know in modern history so we haven't
seen this kind of violence applied to
the general population like you know
before I've been isolated in a location
Tiananmen being an example
um so this could get really ugly
and who knows where this could go if you
think you can predict this one
I don't know maybe you can't
now here's the other question do you
think America is behind any of this
do you think America is doing anything
to
create some you know maybe uh help some
people who are anti-government
I don't know it would be dangerous
seems like it would be a super dangerous
thing to be involved in any way because
it looks like maybe we wouldn't need to
be
you know the the Chinese citizens don't
need
I don't think they need help
doesn't seem like they need any help if
the Chinese citizens decide to change
their government they're going to do it
I don't think there's enough enough
military to stop it
if they wanted enough now they might be
scared off by the violence that's coming
probably today
so it's hard it's hard to make a bet on
where this ends up but anything could
happen I think at this point anything's
literally could go in any direction at
this point
all right
I saw a funny take on you know correct
me if I'm wrong I don't know if it's
because I'm spending more time on
Instagram or if it's really a trend are
you also seeing a trend where the basic
assumptions about the relationship
between men and women like the real
basic stuff is being challenged
and that people giving relationship
advice they're just all over the place
now like there's nothing the standard
anymore and the advice is terrible and
and the way we're trying to Grapple with
the fact that you know the basic glue of
civilization
which is marriage and children has
fallen apart
not everywhere at the same time
but it's really being challenged right
so you're seeing all kinds of opinions
that I don't know if we would have ever
seen before it feels like stuff that
people are saying out loud
things that could never be said out loud
before I'll give you some examples
so here's a tweet from a Twitter user a
woman who calls herself the redheaded
libertarian
so keep in mind it's coming from a woman
who identifies as libertarian
and she says in a tweet feminist men are
the most dangerous type of man
they have an undeserved sense of
entitlement to status often due to
covert narcissism
but are too weak and lazy to naturally
rise in the hierarchy so they
artificially stationed themselves in a
in the easiest position to prey on women
does that sound true
does that ring true when you hear it
right now it might be just you know it
agrees with your political leaning on
this
now were you also aware
that there is science that shows that
the more physically strong you are
the more likely you're going to be a
republican did you know that
and if you're physically weak
you're sort of looking for the
government to help you a little bit
like women
right because women need help because
they don't have the physical strength to
defend themselves in society and men who
are not physically strong might look for
the same kind of help makes sense right
well here's a uh there's a video I just
tweeted I highly recommend it it's
pretty short just a few minutes and it's
a interview with Gad sad and Jordan
Peterson
and Gad sad brings up the topic and
apparently this is a real thing
in in the world of biology
there's a mating strategy among some
types of species
and this is the actual biological name
I'm not making this up
called the sneaky strategy
and it goes like this
there are some animals that pretend to
be female
so that the alpha males don't chase them
away
and then they say oh it looks like a
bunch a bunch of women having fun over
there and suddenly the the male who's
pretending to be female
turns into the sneaky that like
 one of the one of the women and
gets away before the alpha male realizes
what's going on
and God's side was extending this to the
social justice Warrior Man
who effectively are disguising
themselves as women
to to get into the the women you know
attention sphere and then once they're
there look for a weakness
talk them
 them and then get away and then
then they can reproduce
does that sound accurate
yeah I I never I'd never heard this
before but it does I now this is how I
always saw it this is exactly how I
conceived of it
but there is a second consideration
and I'd like to put this out there
early in my dating life
you know my earliest relationships but
you probably before anyone in my
marriages
two of them so far
I was in a relationship with a woman who
very cleverly
praised me whenever I did anything that
was
let's say
what did she call it
enlightened
she she praised me for being an
enlightened male
now what an enlightened male meant was
that I would sometimes take on
traditional female roles within the
relationship such as you know cleaning
cooking and just being more of a
nurturer and whatever I got praised for
that
I think oh I'm really nailing this
aren't I I feel like I'm nailing this
I'm I'm trying to make this one person
happy
she says oh you're killing it I loved it
when you did that thing they're like oh
okay
now this was before I realized that
making women happy was a real thing
you know when I thought it was actual
something people couldn't do I didn't
see the mechanism
I saw the goal but I didn't see the
system I couldn't see the the gears the
machinery
once you see the machinery
you realize it's a sucker's play
giving women what they want
because it doesn't have an end
I always thought well if the goal is to
give you what you want tell me what you
want and I'll give it to you
and then we're all good
but that that's not that's not how the
system works the system requires the
women to continually make the man
unhappy
so that he tries to fix his Happiness by
giving them more resources and they use
those resources primarily
as a transfer of energy to the Next
Generation
and so there's nothing wrong with it in
terms of it's a good design for
reproducing the species
but it requires the men to be fooled
into thinking they can get what they
need by giving women what they ask for
there's nothing like that that works in
the real world nothing like that works
if you're given what women what they
want they will cheat on you and find
another man who doesn't
until they can confer him to giving them
what they want then they'll cheat on him
too that's just the that's just the
system
right that's just the system there's
nothing you can do about it
however because we all have irrational
Minds we still reproduce
because
it's our natural impulse
um
I have a different take on the social
justice Warriors
I feel that women treat them more like
pets
the the model that I see in my mind is
more like a pet
don't you think you know every woman has
a uh a male friend
the male friend I think it's uh Chris
Rock who talks about the male friend the
male friend is the boyfriend under glass
that that's the one that's ready you
know break glass and emergency it's just
a friend
I think he's probably gay
let me ask you have you ever had a a
love interest of yours
tell you that they had a male friend
that they think is probably gay
she's that guy
she's that guy
if she's hanging out with a guy that she
tells you is probably gay she's
him yeah or wants to or has or did
recently or something yeah
so
uh so that's what's going on
uh
but that sneaky thing to know
that there's actually a biological
explanation for everything you see
is just wonderful like it kind of helps
me helps me understand the world
all right here's something super cool
um there's a tweeter named Michelle
Huang
who tweets that she used AI to have a
conversation with her younger self
so she trained to the AI by feeding it
the diaries that she wrote when she was
a young girl
and then the AI could reproduce the
conversation of her as a young girl with
the same you know concerns and and
preferences and stuff and then she had a
long conversation with herself
you know as represented by the AI from
her younger self and then used that as
sort of a therapy mechanism to work
through some issues
now apparently this is going to be a
real thing
the the talking to a version of yourself
in the past but I also think in the
future
because they've also shown that if you
see yourself in the future you'll save
more money for your retirement
you'll be better to yourself in the
future you might stop drinking
right imagine seeing yourself in the
future but you got two versions you go
into virtual reality and you see
yourself in 20 years one drinks alcohol
for fun and the other one quit
and you just look at them and you're
like oh they do not look the same
one that one of them is out of shape and
has some health problems and one of them
is killing it
what would that do to you
if it's yourself
you know it registers as yourself in the
future is very impactful so it's a new
way to program people faster than maybe
anything else could except fear I
suppose fear programs people immediately
but you could program people so
effectively by making the voice that's
programming programming them themselves
or some version of themselves there's
nothing more powerful than that
here's the way I sometimes describe
hypnosis
hypnosis is getting your subject the
hypnotist gets the subject to put their
conscious mind exactly where the
hypnotist conscious mind is at the same
time
so the hypnotist says you know you feel
X
so that's what the hypnotist is thinking
and that is what the subjects thinks so
the two of you think the same thing for
a while
until you start being comfortable that
since you're always thinking the same
thing
that the thoughts that are coming
directly from the hypnotist
become substitutes for your own thoughts
but you're aware of it you're aware that
the thoughts are coming from another
source so you don't have any danger
that's why hypnosis is not dangerous
because you can just say oh I'll stop
paying attention to that and you could
just do it anytime you want but
it's this idea that you're both on the
same page
that that allows the hypnotist to
temporarily
control the body
like once you've decided that the
hypnotists
thoughts and feelings are the same as
yours and you just move it aside and say
okay you run you can drive for a while
since the things you say and do and
think are just like mine
how about you drive the car for a while
and the car is your body you just say
all right so you want my hand to feel
cold oh it is
and then you watch it and you can
actually have the sensation
that instructions are going into your
body
and they're being translated into real
time into something you feel just like
just like it happened in a normal way
so that's how powerful
these AI representations of yourself
will be
they will be like the hypnotist the
hypnotist does it the hard way because
they've got to pace and lead you long
enough that you lose the distinction
between yourself and the person talking
to you that's a tough trick it's why not
everybody can do it
but if AI can produce a version of U
it is your hypnotist that's your
hypnotist
a version of you
created by AI in let's say virtual
reality is a hypnotist
it's just it's designed to hypnize you
specifically and it would be so powerful
yeah mind blown if you don't understand
how powerful this is
uh you're gonna you will
it will be so powerful it can just
rewire you in real time
uh him to success rate now let me let me
correct that somebody says that
hypnotist success rate is what 10 to 20
percent totally incorrect that that
you've got that wrong
the 20 of the hypnotists uh look for are
the 20 who are extra easy to hypnotize
the rest could be hypnotized
everybody can be hypnotized they just
have to be willing the 20 can actually
feel things fairly quickly as if they
were real but everyone is subject to
hypnosis there's no exception
and everybody who tells you that they
quote can't be hypnotized
or just
um
wrong or they don't want to be is they
don't want to be then they won't
participate or they can take themselves
out of the situation so they do have
that control
all right Wall Street Journal have a
little uh article on
the rising trend of middle-aged male
suicides
so middle-aged men are ending their
lives at record numbers I guess
and the article was written by somebody
named Andrea who I'm going to make the
assumption is female
now here's a suggestion
don't let a woman write an article about
adult male suicide
because you know what she's going to do
she's going to write an article about
how there are these new new types of
Therapies
wait
is it it is a female right
so I think somebody's questioning that
but
um the article emphasized the uh
the treatments to help people who have
these Suicidal Thoughts
isn't something really really left out
of that
do you think a man would have written an
article about male suicide going up
and left off
the cause
what about the cause
isn't that the story
maybe the cause is people who write
articles like this
this article completely ignored the
well-being of the men involved it just
treated it like oh you know the medical
community has this new thing
like how about care about the
men who'd want to kill themselves
because they have nothing to live for
about figuring out what what's going on
there how about figuring out what
changed
you know what changed you all know what
changed tell you
don't you all know what changed
is there any any mystery to it at all
yeah I mean it has to do a lot with
social media
so social media creates a situation
where most men cannot find happiness now
and most women
so I don't believe we have a system
that could provide happiness for most
men or most women or most
you know lgbtq non-binary whatever you
want I don't think most could be happy
under our situation
I do think maybe uh super attractive
women
maybe I don't know maybe uh maybe
attractive tall rich man
maybe I don't know
but the system isn't designed to make
you happy it was never designed for that
and you can see the results
well Merriam-Webster
has chosen their word of the year
what do you think the word of the year
is for if you haven't heard it what do
you think the word of the year is
gaslighting that's right now I would
note that the word of the Year happened
under this particular word under the
Biden Administration
now it doesn't mean only Democrats are
gaslighting pretty much everything's
gaslighting these days I don't think
much of the news is real at this point
it's so unreal it's crazy but
that feels right to me
um you know the Biden Administration
saying inflation isn't real and gas
prices aren't that bad and I mean it's
all just ridiculous now
I want to give you the Nuance that
Merriam-Webster uh accurately put on it
gaslighting I used to think wasn't
exactly real
but it is you know I have to give up on
that it's it's real
and it's different from lying
lying is very different
lying you you tell a lie and you hope
you hope somebody believed it that's
just ordinary lying
gaslighting is you tell a lie that's
obviously false you know was obviously a
lie
and then you don't change your stance
when it's proven to be a lie
instead you move your lie all the way to
well you must be going insane
you maybe you should seek help has
anybody ever had that happen to him
have you ever been in a relationship
where somebody literally said you should
seek psychological help
like literally
I have
I have yeah I was literally asked to get
psychological help not for a
psychological problem per se
but for something wrong with my sense of
reality and that I seem to be
remembering things backwards
why do you keep remembering things the
opposite of how they happened
have you ever had that happen
I will tell you it is the most
disorienting thing I've ever experienced
and I didn't think it was real right
like I didn't think it was real
until you experience that you don't
think it's real but when you experience
it you actually have a break with
reality
the gaslighting itself causes you to
have an actual total break with reality
and I gotta admit I had that
I had a complete break with reality
and it wasn't easy to find my way back
like finding my way back
it was so hard it's easy to imagine that
people would just kill themselves
like I could so easily imagine people
would just take themselves out it's just
too hard
yeah it was amazing
so
I have
uh uh such mixed feelings about Marjorie
Taylor green
so
so that's that's my setup mixed feelings
so I'm going to tell you some things
that are very bad about her
and then some things that I appreciate
about her and then I'm going to tell you
I don't know what the to do
about this all right so here are the
things I don't like about her she
attended uh Nick Fuentes event
and she said some things I don't agree
with right so don't put me on the side
of people who agree with things that she
said are we clear on that
that said
I love her Stones like she's really
Brave
can we agree on that
she's very brave and it's just really
fun to watch it like she's a fighter
she's clearly not backing down from
anything you just like to see it now you
order fighting on the right side of
things right so if she's a fighter and
she's fighting for the wrong stuff well
that's not good that's not good at all
but one of the things she tweeted about
was that she watched the
documentary died suddenly
now that's the one that claims that
there are so many vaccination related
injuries that people are falling over
dead and their their blood is so clotted
that even in the autopsy you can take
that blood out as clearly deformed not
like anything we've ever seen before do
you think that's true
do you think that documentary is
credible let me ask you
this is a trick question
please answer the question is the
documentary credible go
thank you no no the documentary is not
credible does that mean nothing in it is
true that's a separate question
that's not the question I asked
should you ever believe a documentary
no you should never believe a
documentary
period
that doesn't mean the documentary is
wrong
I'm saying it's presented in a way that
on its face you say oh that's coming
from someone who is presenting a point
of view probably and I can't tell if
they're being fair or not because I'm
not the expert
yeah it's all propaganda it doesn't
matter who it is you're I see so many
people tossing out some names well what
about this one what about this one now
in every case the documentary and the
documentarian gets to choose what's in
and what's out
if you're choosing what's in and what's
out
it's a narrative
and you you know for sure there are
people who would have seen it a
different way and would have a different
narrative if they're not in the
documentary well it's not really a
presentation of truth it's a point of
view
now
but
here's what Marjorie Taylor green
tweeted about that she said
how many people watched died suddenly I
watched it I'd like to talk to him
bombers so she would like to get to the
bottom of whether it's true or false and
talks to some embalmers because I guess
some bombers were shown like looking at
people's blood
so I tweeted about that and I said do it
on camera with both sides
now
here's my dilemma
Marjorie Taylor green is recommending
the only thing I think our government
should do
and she's the only one I've ever seen do
it
she's basically saying
I'm paraphrasing she's not saying this
at all but this is this is my
interpretation of what she's saying
 this I'm going to find out myself
like I can't trust anybody I'm just
gonna go find out myself
and I'm gonna and here's why she she
responded to me and again
isn't the Wonder Isn't the world
wonderful
that I I can send a message to a member
of Congress
who is talking about an important topic
and I get a personal response in like an
hour or something
like how incredible is that does that
just blow you away and it's not because
I'm you know a big account she responds
to other people as well and every time
it happens I'm just blown away by the
the magic and Majesty of it all you know
the Twitter is just a it's beyond a
National Treasure if we use it correctly
so that's the challenge to us
but uh here's what she didn't say
I said do it on camera and show both
sides
and she said I'll definitely do it on
camera
let me say that again
I said do it on camera and show both
sides she said I'll definitely do it on
camera oh
 so close
so close
to getting it right and she missed it
she missed it
right
because I would have been in quite a
dilemma if she had answered that
correctly
if she'd answer yeah I will show both
sides and we'll do it on camera I would
have said
the president
and I thought I don't even like her
opinions I'm like she has some scary
opinions
but if she would actually show both
sides put it on camera and tell us tell
us publicly I'm going to let this shake
out whichever way it shakes out I have a
concern but I don't know what's true
and nobody's telling me what shoe so I'm
going to go figure it out myself and
I'll put it on TV and I'll show you
I could love that
I love it it would be the best thing
anybody ever did in politics
so close I want to love this but she
couldn't say I will show both sides
couldn't say it or didn't say it or
chose not to right
God so close but again maybe that's
maybe that's good because then I don't
have to support her because she didn't
didn't quite hit the mark but man
nobody's been that close
so I do support her effort and I'm all
in on do more of this just do more of it
um
yeah
all right uh and I think the vax
manufacturers should be included in that
don't you think Marjorie Taylor green
should talk to the embalmers and have
whoever is the top medical expert from
Pfizer or something in the room
not talk to him later
you know not get a not get a comment on
Twitter
put them in the room right next
to the embalmer
and then have Marjorie Taylor green say
all right you idiots
stop lying to us tell us what's true
one of you is a idiot let's
figure out who it is
and just put it out there and just just
Crush whoever's wrong just crush them
right on life live camera I'd love to
see that
won't happen stop yeah okay I'll stop
dreaming that won't happen
all right so I guess my bottom line on
Marjorie Taylor green is I love her
systems approach how can we create a
system where we can find out the truth
and she proposed the system and it's
almost perfect so that's a good start
you know just a little tweak and she's
got it so I'm not going to criticize her
that the first draft wasn't perfect
right the first draft is we'll do it on
camera
the second draft should be and we'll
make sure there's a say a Pfizer person
in the room or somebody like that then
she's got it she's so close
I like her systems and not necessarily
your goals
um
part of that documentary includes
a a basketball star
uh chaante Johnson who collapsed on the
court
and it must have been part of a maybe it
was part of a compilation of people just
falling over I believe that was in the
movie
and I got fact checked and sure enough
that guy collapsed uh December 12 2020
before the vaccines were available and
he didn't die he didn't die it was just
fake
so that doesn't mean the other ones are
fake but at least one of them is
all right here's a weird story that I
would not have even mentioned except
that it came from a source
who's unusually
smart and credible
so this is a tweet by a Twitter user who
should definitely follow Brian romelli
spelled r-o-e-m-m-e-l-e
so if you want to follow him great like
scientifically uh just stuff you you're
not seeing anywhere else you're just not
seeing him anywhere else it is always
interesting he's just one of the best
sinkers of the internet for you know new
and Innovative stuff
and especially old stuff it's not even
just new stuff
but he showed a clip which he thought
was meaningful about some experts
talking I think in the 60s
that
if you try to remove somebody's memory
or something
by
um
if you tried to remove somebody's memory
of something
by removing part of the brain where if
you're trying to find where the memory
is stored you can never do it
you can degrade memories
but they always seem to be there in some
form and the the thought is that
memories are now stored in a place
they're stored in some kind of a
holographic way in the brain
and I don't think I could explain that
except that if you were looking at a
physical hologram
uh the stuff you would see would be the
interference of the lasers am I right
so the lasers would be invisible except
where two lasers intersect they they
shine a little bit and that shine would
be like the pixel and then if you do
enough of the lasers and it creates
enough of interference all those points
of interference could be formed into a
picture that would look real
but the thinking is that the brain does
some version of that
that there's some kind of energy
intersection that is where memory is
which means that memories are everywhere
like somehow the memory is distributed
all the way around your brain now
Brian in his tweet he said only .001 of
the world knows about it and the
implications it has to everything so he
thinks the implications are really
really big
I agree
but I don't know exactly what the
implications are like it looks like is
really big
and what I mean by that is it may go to
the nature of reality itself
because I did see see some people talk
about the fact
that it's absurd to think of reality as
made of anything
have you ever thought about that
in my book God's debris I asked this
question if everything is made of
something
and then you say okay what's that made
of well particles okay what's a particle
made of all right maybe it's muons and
some other you know charms and stuff all
right but what are they made of
eventually you get to the point where
things can't be made of other things it
becomes an absurdity you know once you
get down into the quantum area there's
nothing there
the the quantum level there's nothing
there it seems like we think there's
something there because we're seeing the
the intersection of Energies
or ideas
or what I don't know exactly what the
intersection is up but if we're only
seeing the intersection like the two
lasers that are crossing we're not
seeing either laser
do you get that
if you're looking at a hologram you're
now seeing the laser that goes sideways
or the laser that interfered with it
you're only seeing something that
doesn't exist which is a point of
intersection a concept
and that at the deepest level of reality
there might be nothing but an
intersection of Concepts
and that the intersection of Concepts
is substantial enough that you see an
entire world end of it that doesn't
exist except in your interpretation of
things intersecting but those things
intersecting are purely imaginary
they're just Concepts there's nothing
there when you dig down
or is zeros and ones because we're a
simulation
take your pick
take your pick
so he says really bad analogy was it an
analogy
here's how you use analogies right and I
say this so often but for some reason I
can't communicate it well enough to
convince people
an analogy is a wrong use is to use it
as an argument
this is true in this analogy so
therefore this other law should be done
the same way
bad use
if you're explaining A New Concept for
the first time analogies are perfect
for example if you'd never heard of a
zebra I'd say well it's like a horse but
it's got stripes and you'd be there
immediately right
so the the zebra horse thing is perfect
if you'd never heard of a zebra
but if you'd never consider that reality
is the intersection of any kind of
energy
than saying well there are examples
where there are intersections of energy
primes your brain to understand the New
Concept but it's not an argument so I'm
not saying that because a laser can
create a hologram I'm not saying that
logically therefore
reality is a hologram I didn't say that
I'm only trying to get you to understand
reality as a hologram
by private you so that's a good use of
an analogy not as an argument does that
make sense to everybody
I feel like that's the best I've
explained this so far
everybody on the same page with that
maybe not
you're lost again all right Eric says
yes that's good enough for me
um I guess I've mentioned that
documentaries are not credible and I
told you that I recommended highly the
ancient apocalypse
um
ancient Apocalypse series on Netflix
which I continue to recommend from an
entertainment perspective as well as
information because you get to actually
see all these historical sites that you
wouldn't see any other way and I thought
they were fascinating and you know the
the production values are excellent like
I was engaged all the way through it
it's like through Eight Episodes totally
totally good piece of entertainment now
is it true
[Laughter]
well the critics have weighed in now I
don't know if the critics are right
and I don't know if uh Goose Graham
Hancock who made this documentary I
don't know if they're right because I
don't have the perspective where I can
criticize them but I'll tell you what
the uh at least one prominent critic
said
all those assumptions he's making
they're all debunked for example
one of the biggest points he makes is
that uh farming
you know the domesticating of livestock
and farming
sort of grew suddenly in uh sometime
after the Ice Age whereas the critic
says
um no it's been known forever and all
archaeologists agree that farming you
know started in the in the Crescent the
Fertile Crescent or whatever it is and
it grew from there and we can trace it
from where it started to how it spread
and basically the most basic assumption
that people learned how to build things
and Farms sort of suddenly she goes
that's completely debunked
like you can you can track you could
track these building uh the building
knowledge all the way back to the Ice
Age it was always there
we've got the ruins he goes you just
look at it they knew before they know
now
they've been farming since the
practically the Ice Age basically his
most basic assumptions about things
happening suddenly
no support for it
now are you surprised
are you surprised that that criticism
exists again I'm not saying the
criticism is correct I don't know I
haven't checked it myself
but you shouldn't be surprised that that
criticism exists now are any of you
qualified to tell me which one is right
the critics
or does anybody qualified to do that I'm
not
because if the critic is right then
Graham Hancock just made up a bunch of
 and told you it was a fact
what what if the critic is doing that
if I couldn't tell the difference if
Graham Hancock had hypothetically made
up a bunch of and told me it was
true how could I possibly tell if the
critic is doing the same thing I don't
know who's making up and telling me
it's true it all looks kind of true-ish
who knows
now the uh
Graham Hancock the maker of the series
he was on Joe Rogan I saw some of you
note
and the few Clips I saw showed Joe
Rogan's you know mind being blown and
seeming to you know have it have fun
with the the idea of the documentary but
here's my defense of Joe Rogan
Joe Rogan is very transparent he
actually had his own show Once where he
looked into conspiracy theories like I
don't know the Bigfoot and stuff like
that
correct me if I'm wrong but doesn't he
say directly he loves conspiracy
theories
doesn't he
I mean it's part of his
part of his presentation is I don't know
if this is true and I don't know if it's
not true but it sure is fun
is that a problem
it's only a problem if you don't know
that's his his approach because it's my
Approach too I have a identical approach
which is I have no idea if Atlantis
existed but I loved I loved going for
the ride
as an entertainment vehicle it's really
strong I recommend it completely
now likewise I have a book called God's
debris in which I it's a fictional book
but you know sort of a psych philosophy
related uh factually and I take the
reader for a ride
and you have to sort of suspend your
skepticism for a while to enjoy the ride
so I'm not that different than somebody
putting a documentary together that's
got a fun narrative but maybe it doesn't
hold up to science
so
so it's a
so I'm going to say I recommend it but
just know that the argument against it's
pretty strong
pretty strong I don't know who's right
Elon Musk tweeted today in response to
somebody else's tweet about ESG being a
nightmare uh musk tweeted this
ESG is the devil
the context was that uh
Exxon has a good ESG score and Tesla
does not
and part of the the E is the
Environmental environmental social and
governance so it's a standard that
BlackRock and other Financial entities
are trying to impose on companies to
make them report or do things that are
good for the environment according to
the people watching them and that's
where the problem is so basically it
inserts a new boss
into a system that really really can't
use another boss
the last thing you want to do to
capitalism is insert a new boss
that's bad every time right so any new
boss is just bad we already have a
government
so if the government doesn't want to
make changes I don't think they should
come from another source
so that's bad
so do you think that I've uh I just like
asking this because I'm so happy with
myself
I promised you a few months ago that I
would kill ESG by the end of the year
I feel like I did
I feel like I did I don't feel there are
any sophisticated investors who think
it's credible anymore
do you do you think any sophisticated
investors
find any value in ESG
I'll bet it's very few at this point
so if you get the sophisticated people
the CEOs you know the the thought
leaders I mean
how in the world does BlackRock ignore
the fact that Elon Musk says it's
 not just but it's bad
it's bad for the world like how do you
just go on
when somebody of you know that
intellectual capacity and certainly is
in the middle of it he knows exactly
what he's talking about when he debunks
it like how how do you go on
how do you support it like it's almost
just embarrassing at this point
but I guess they like their
embarrassment
um
let's see what else is fun
um I'm going to go out Tick Tock again
because I have not been successful in
putting a dent in this but here's my
problem
um does anybody do a fact check on me
here is there any member of Congress
or any member of the Biden
Administration
who has ever been on the side of keeping
Tick Tock illegal in the United States
anybody
has anybody ever seen it
any Democrat any Republican anybody
nope nobody you've not seen it how about
the Press
is there any major press Outlet
that has made an opinion piece as
anybody published an opinion piece that
says you know Tick Tock might be a
little dangerous but we should keep it
nope I haven't seen one
so what are you making the fact that all
of the media and all of the government
left and right is on the same page uh
Banning Tick Tock would be easy
executive order
Congressional law kind of easy
and that uh we're absolutely nowhere
near it
it's not even on the table is it
as far as I know it's not even being
debated
is it
so
tell me what's going on here
how do you explain it
how do you explain
you know it's easy to explain why our
government can't do things where they're
deadlocked where there's somebody on
both sides I get that everybody
understands that but why why in the
situation where everybody's on the same
side is nothing happening
right your reasonable assumption has to
be corruption
right
but what else could it be
what else could it be give me the
alternative I mean incompetence
because I don't even think the
government is that incompetent I think
the government's pretty incompetent but
the one thing they know how to do is to
make something illegal
that's the one thing the government
knows how to do really well make another
thing illegal okay
tell the Apple Store to delist it how
hard would that be how hard would it be
for Biden to say this looks like a
national security threat
while we're looking into it I don't want
the Apple store or the Google Store to
carry it how hard would that be
I mean he could just ask couldn't he
I don't even know if he needs an
executive order
couldn't he just say Apple and Google
I'd like you to I'd like you to defend
why it's still there
he doesn't even have to say why he
should come down you should just say
could you do me a favor I'd like you
both to defend why you're keeping it
there you know the risk just defend it
would they
would Apple defend it
would Google defend it
let's put him on the record
I don't think they would
I think they would take it off
I think if Biden said you can keep it on
there there's no law but I need you to
defend it in public go ahead and defend
it and then maybe you can keep it there
do you think Tim Cook would defend it
now he might give some general defense
of you know if they're not breaking or
or if they're not violating our terms of
service there's nothing we can do
but does that does that count for
National Security
do you think Apple's terms of service
are a higher uh priority that National
Security
I don't think so I think Apple will
violate its terms of service anytime it
wants to
when National Security is at stake so
Biden doesn't have to do anything he
just has to ask them to defend it in
public
am I wrong
what the would they do
defend it in public
do you think Apple could actually defend
that in public of course not
Biden doesn't even need to do anything
he could just ask them to defend it
that's it
because they can't do it and then they'd
have to take it off
or it'd be easy to coercive to take it
off of them I'm not wrong
I am not wrong
if you simply ask them to defend it it
would disappear
yeah maybe I am wrong who knows
well
um
the Press doesn't ask why
clearly the Press is afraid of China I
don't know what else it could be because
at the very least they should ask why
right you don't think you don't think
even one of those
you don't think uh Ducey
who's who's at one of the press events
you don't think you could say I
understand that
um
uh you know I understand
that you're looking at Tick Tock and
you're concerned
but can you explain why you're keeping
it
like give us the argument for why it's
still there
yeah Peter Ducey could just ask that
question right
why not
I mean you might ask are you going to
ban that and they'll say well we're
looking into it but wouldn't you want to
ask the question like why would he even
wait like what's the argument for not
doing it right away
all right uh Rasmussen did a poll on the
laptop from Hell which is the funniest
labeling for a thing
I think the best uh
the best labeling of a news story is the
laptop from hell
because that's such a perfect
description of you know the contents of
the laptop the laptop from hell
uh 62 percent of likely U.S voters
approve of the house gop's investigation
of it
sounds about right so a little under
two-thirds of the public would like to
know more about the laptop I feel like
the people who don't want to know more
are either total partisans or they don't
know enough about the story
it would be hard to know the story
and not want to know you know have an
investigation right
and 25 percent right
um so here's something I did not have on
my predictions
uh yay uh is mad at Elon Musk because
yay says Alex Jones should be reinstated
because Alex Jones is a Christian
and uh Christ is Lord
um and it needs to have uh some
Christian people on there and and so yay
is supporting Alex Jones being
reinstated
because he's a Christian
so there you have it
um
what the hell is going on
okay does anybody figured out what's
going on here
now here here are some things that I
feel like we can say with some
confidence
EA is a creative genius and one of the
great artists in America
but like many great artists
he's a little bit nuts well it's hard to
understand it in any other way that he's
just a little bit nuts but he's a little
bit genius at the same time so it's all
confusing
because he's definitely a genius
he definitely looks nuts and I think
that those things you know operate
together so often that that's no
surprise
right
but can you imagine what is he trying to
accomplish
what do you think his play is
what is the play is yay trying to take
Trump's uh far right uh
base
maybe it looks like Yay is going to try
to become president
by taking Trump's original view you know
his hard-ass immigration View and you
know hard ass on other things and just
be more Christian and more
you know more extreme and you know
backing
backing the people who have been banned
Etc
so I don't know exactly what his plan is
that doesn't seem like the best plan in
the world
but let me ask you this how many of you
are sure
that the uh the the dinner event at
Mar-A-Lago was a setup there was some
kind of an OP not necessarily only by a
but by some other forces how many of you
would say that didn't happen naturally
all of you right
most of you
most of you could see that it was some
kind of IOP now do you see the news
treating it that way
the news is treating it like it was
dinner
and really there's nobody in the entire
news business who could say the obvious
the most obvious is that it was a setup
and the most obvious is that it wasn't
all yea's doing
right and nobody nobody in the media is
curious about
like how how yay even met
Fuentes nobody's curious about that
so I'll tell you what I'm going to do
with this story
I I might I might just shelf this story
because I think we know everything we
need to know about it
it was a setup we don't have a
functioning media so they they didn't
treat it like a setup
and their both sides are both sides seem
to be happy with the explanation
that uh you know supports their
narrative one way or the other
so if both sides are happy with the
narrative instead of anything that would
explain what the happened
why should I be concerned
do you know how happy I am that I went
on record as not supporting Trump for
this election
do you know how happy I am I don't have
to explain this disaster
like I would have if I'd said yeah this
is your best chance for president is
this Trump guy like I did last time I
would have at least tried to put it in
contacts and you know explain what's the
best way to look at it if there is one
but I don't have to do that
let me ask you
how easy would it have been for Trump to
explain this away
if Trump were a full full-strength Trump
the one who explained Rosie O'Donnell
away
you know and and the things he said
about women he explained a lot of stuff
away
this would be easy to explain away
would you like me to model it
yeah I've done it before here's the
quick version Trump why do you let those
terrible people go to dinner with you
here's my answer
uh I'm running for president
I will let any citizen talk to me about
any topic period
and I I would like to support that right
for you as well in fact maybe maybe the
people who disagree with you should
spend a little more time with you maybe
you should spend time with people who
disagree with you if you think that I'm
adopting the opinions of every person I
eat dinner with well that would be
insane
do you know how many people I ate dinner
with
do you think they all agree with me do
you think every time I eat dinner I
changed my opinion of course not do you
every time you sit down is it with only
people who agree with you I hope not now
I hear what you're saying about the
association I want to tell you that in
the future I plan to associate with the
people you hate on both sides I'm going
to talk to Chuck Schumer next week how
do you like that some of you think
that's pretty bad
it doesn't matter I'm going to talk to
anybody I want no restrictions don't
don't tell me that their opinion
splashed unto me
don't don't tell me I'm picking up
opinions because I ate a I ate a taco
with somebody that doesn't happen
right he made his case I listened that's
the whole story
and if somebody else that you don't like
wants to have dinner with me I'm going
to do it I'm gonna have dinner with
anybody I want
and I'm going to do it right in front of
you publicly if you like
and that's not going to change
so if he did that and he and he took the
high ground because The High Ground
exists right The High Ground is easy
I will I'm not going to kick an American
citizen away from my table
if they're talking to me politely I just
happen to disagree you know with what
they say
it'd be easy and the fact that Trump is
not doing this easy play
what's that tell you
what do you make of that it's such an
easy play
am I am I wrong it's just too easy to
make it all go away you just have to say
yeah I didn't know but I couldn't
associate with anybody I want and put
that on the table
put on the table that the that I should
only have dinner with people you approve
if that's your point of view if that's
your point of view say it out loud see
how it sounds see how it sounds to say
that the President should simply not
even have a conversation with somebody
he disagrees with
how does that sound
it sounds nuts doesn't it right and
further I'm going to talk to Putin I'm
going to talk to Kim Jong-un I'm going
to talk to president XI how do you feel
about that
yeah don't don't limit your president
you should have access to everybody
so too easy
I'm making you laugh yeah but it is too
easy right clearly Trump has lost the
snap because that's just such an easy
play
um
so Kim Kardashian has spoken up about
Balenciaga their famous ads that seem to
at least the ads appeared
to be pedophiles supportive
now we're waiting for balenciago to
clarify and explain or apologize
and they had more than 48 hours
and uh Kim Kardashian talked to them and
here's here's what she reports as part
of a tweets right she said I appreciate
balenciaga's removal of the campaigns
and apology okay so they apologize
that's good in speaking with them I
believe they understand the seriousness
of the issue and will take the necessary
measures for this to never happen again
well a good apology also requires you to
say that you'll not do it again what are
you going to do differently so they said
so they gave it an apology
and they said what they would do
differently so those are good things so
far so good
uh
and then we get to the part where
valenciago explains how this could have
happened in the first part
you know that's the most interesting
part right the apology is necessary but
more than that we want to know how it
happened in the first place you know how
would a major Company allow Pro
pedophile stuff on their stuff and so
here's the part where Kim Kardashian is
reporting how they explained how it
could have ever happened in the first
place
foreign
that was it
no explanation
no explanation to Kim Kardashian that
she shared with us
no explanation in the news
no speculation from people who support
them
they just confessed to being pedophiles
how else am I supposed to interpret this
there's not really a second way to
interpret this is there
Fox News had an explanation
did they
Fox News had an explanation
what was that
what was that explanation
I don't first of all I don't believe you
the Fox News had an explanation I don't
believe that
um
Tucker had an explanation no they didn't
unless the explanation was that
pedophiles
were part of their process
they repeated whatever was trotted out
well the explanation that the
photographer was just following orders
may be true but it doesn't explain why
he was given those orders
so nobody said why was the photographer
told to photograph this
right
they all use the same designer for ads
do they those various companies
so
but honestly how could you if Kim
Kardashian is reporting this straight it
looks like it I have no reason to doubt
what she says did she really leave that
meeting without getting an explanation
of how it happened
I just think about this
remember
Kim Kardashian no matter what you think
of her
she's not dumb
can we agree she's very smart
she didn't get she didn't get where she
is by not being very smart
and and you telling me and she's also
you know
I believe she's studying to try to pass
the bar you know so she shoving
attorneys qualifications you don't think
she asked the question how did it happen
well let me ask you do you think do you
think she asked the question how did
this ever happen
do you think she didn't ask that
question
Maybe
Maybe
but whether she asked the question or
not
would you agree that Balenciaga has
never offered any kind of explanation
would you agree they have not offered
any kind of explanation
not a whoops not a we didn't notice not
a somebody got fired and it won't happen
again nothing
I mean to me this looks like a full
confession how else am I supposed to
interpret it
does everybody agree that this is a full
confession I mean I would be happy to
see any clarification they had I would
take that seriously but if they don't
want to offer a clarification
you are completely within your
I'd say within your ethical rights to
say they have confessed
am I wrong they have confessed
this is amazing
still in business
still making stuff or whatever the hell
they do all right
uh here's why uh Geraldo got some
attention
he tweeted that in the spirit of
Thanksgiving I think this was yesterday
or the day before he tweeted it Trump
should announce that he's no longer a
presidential candidate and President
Biden should announce that Trump has
pardoned for any and all federal
offenses
uh Geraldo you're leaving something out
you're leaving something out
um
shouldn't there also be a pardon for Joe
and Hunter Biden
who would who wouldn't pardon them
I I mean the whole part of the thing
doesn't work unless you're partnering
both sides why would you only pardon
Trump when he's not been convicted of
anything it's all this walls are closing
in fake legal stuff that
probably will never be a problem
probably never be a problem
um
and so this opened up an opportunity for
me to run for president and immediately
be the front runner
so here's how I could be the front
runner I will pardon Trump
and and all the bidens for everything
this is this is my offer to the public
pardon them all for anything but also
get rid of them so they'd be gone Bell
pardon them for everything so we don't
have to worry about it and then I'll
declare war on Mexico
and go after the cartels
and I'll be on Tick Tock day one
am I not your front runner
I'm your front runner right
seriously oh I'll also pardon everybody
uh in the January 6th unless they did
something violent so all the non-violent
people pardon him immediately
and then I'm your president how
hard was that
you know honestly it's like the
Republicans are no longer even trying
they're not even trying the reason that
Trump managed to completely hollow out
the Republican party and wear it like a
leisure suit for four years because
there was nothing there
when Trump hollowed out the Republican
party it was because it was already
empty
and as soon as you take Trump out and
you imagine you know he's not the
candidate he was it's just empty again
there's nothing in there I could
literally just walk into it and wear it
like a suit say all right I'm a
republican here's what I'll do
am I right like
yeah I'm not going to run for president
that's a lesson for an idiot but I could
 take over the entire government
because they there's nothing there it
would be like walking into the uh when
we use that analogy
I was gonna say it's like walking into
the Rotunda and uh taking Nancy's uh
lectern but I mean it's basically the
door is open
the door is wide open for the Republican
Party anybody can walk through the door
just say this stuff it doesn't even have
to be DeSantis right you're imagining
there has to be a a candidate with
desantises you know qualifications which
are very high I'm saying that I could be
president without any almost no friction
there would be almost no friction I
would just have to want to do it and I
could just walk in the whole the whole
party's Hollow
am I wrong
there's there's no substance that the
Republicans lost in part because they
didn't have any
positive message for the future
I got plenty of positive messages
I get all kinds of positive messages
yeah
I'll tell you how I'll fix everything
uh I'll tell you that I'll build a
dashboard so you can see how effectively
we're repatriating our manufacturing for
China
boom I'm your president
right if I promised you I will make sure
that there is a dashboard so you can see
every Manufacturing Company by industry
and what what facilities they have in
China I'm not going to make them come
home
because that's too much of a heavy hand
but I'll let the public decide who they
want to buy stuff from and if if you
want to keep making stuff in China
then be my my guest then the next thing
I would do is I'd say I'm going to start
a fund to help finance companies who
want to come back but it's too expensive
and then if you're if you're
participating in the plan to come back
you're good
so I don't mind that you're still
Manufacturing in China if you're
actively looking into the plan to you
know bring it to another country or back
to America
so I could say you know I'll let
capitalism do what it wants I just want
you to know what you're to know what the
facts are government is going to be out
of it we we do prefer that manufacturing
leave China but you the citizens can
decide how much do you care about this
do you want you know cheap chairs or do
you want more domestic safety yeah
now when when you hear how easy it would
be
to satisfy Republicans
and the fact that nobody's doing it how
about the Border
do you think I could own the Border
you've heard me say this before easy
the Border should be
tighter than a gnat's ass to use my
father's famous saying you should have a
border security that's completely closed
down
and separately you should have
bipartisan economists telling you how
many people to let in for our own
economic benefit
it might be all of them it might be all
of them and I'd be open to that because
we have in fact absorbed
so far all of them you don't see any
homeless uh Mexican immigrants do you
they're all doing something
the I don't know how they're a drag on
the system because they're not homeless
so
I do you think you don't think I could
win on that
everybody would look like a chimpanzee
on immigration if I just said those two
things
our our system should be airtight
separately we should decide how many and
what kind of people come in and we'll do
it in an economic bipartisan way that's
good for the country
nobody could argue with that that's the
end of the conversation that's The High
Ground right there's no higher ground
than that that's done
so on almost every topic
I could give you a high ground that you
couldn't even argue with and it's all
right there
it's right there
I'm not saying I have the magic where
where I can find you know hidden nuggets
that are not available the hidden
nuggets are just laying on the floor
and and the building is unguarded you
can just walk into the Republican party
and just pick up a nugget
there's nothing stopping you
except they're running for president as
a Fool's errand and I I don't trust
anybody who does
this must be something going on if you
have to run for president
anyway
um
and that ladies and gentlemen
brings us to the conclusion of the best
live stream you've ever seen
possibly the best one ever
um
you know here here's a way I could run
for president
so here's how I could do it this is like
the the poor man's way to run for
president
I'd say you know I don't really know
anything about the government so I'm
going to pick as my uh
my chief of staff
and they'll name some like really
well-placed you know lay a senator or
something so I'll pick somebody who
really does know the government as the
chief of staff
and then I'll say you know these are my
theories and then people will say but
what about your vetting
when they start vetting you they're
going to find out too much about you and
then there'll be all these reasons to
hate me do you know what I'd do with
that I do what Trump did
do what Trump did
I say if you if you're voting for me for
president based on my character
uh then you can
it's a free country but you wouldn't be
serving yourself
because I'm not selling you my character
I'm not telling you that you should be
like me you shouldn't be I'm not selling
any of my past Behavior and if you want
to make a decision on that you're
welcome but just know it's not part of
the offering it's not what I'm selling
you don't say you don't have to say yes
or no about any bad thing in my past
because that's not on the table
if you want to hate it go ahead there
are no surprises and I guarantee that
you will all find something you don't
like
if you looked into me long enough every
person would find at least one thing
that you didn't like I guarantee it but
that's true for everybody and I'm I'm
trying to work for your benefit
if you would like to also work for your
benefit take a look at what I'm offering
and see how it compares
but look out for yourself you know you
the point of voting is not to punish me
listen to this reframe the point of
voting is not to punish me
for something I did when I was 15 you
know hypothetically
the point of voting is for you to get
your but your best solution
so just compare what I'm offering to
what the other side is offering and I
don't think you should look at my
opponents when they were 15 years old
either
complete waste of time
you could you could High Ground this
stuff so easily the fact that nobody's
doing it should be telling you something
you'd block me for asking
all right
um Dennis kucinich was the only honest
one all right
the pentavaret you know I didn't find
that funny
the pentavirate with Mike Myers I tried
that they had all the com all the
components of something that should have
been great but didn't didn't quite click
I don't know why
um
communion is a simultaneous sip
in a way
are you kidding Hawaii's Mauna Loa is
erupting for the first time in 40 years
is that a problem
can we tell you if moanaloa is going to
be a big eruption
all right which of my books should you
read first
well
uh of the dilber books
you would read the dilber principle now
it's an older book but it still stands
up so you'd read that one first
if you care about philosophy
and the nature of reality
I would read my book God's debris which
is fiction but it talks about
philosophical things if you want to
improve your life
you should read my book how to failed
almost everything and still went big and
by the way you can start seeing the
influence of that book on a number of
other best-selling books I don't want to
embarrass people
oh actually I'll tell you on locals so
once I turn off the YouTube feed
I'm going to say something that I
wouldn't say in in regular public but
I'll tell the locals people something
that's happening in the publishing world
all right uh
I don't think Scott will talk any more
about sh
sh what is sh
oh Sam Harris yeah what else is there to
say
I mean he's off of Twitter
he's sort of out of the conversation
stop giving money to people they hate
you and that includes Scott Adams so
somebody just paid five dollars to me
on YouTube to say that people should not
give me money
I think that was money well spent if
anyone if anyone else also thinks that
people should not give me money I think
you should give me some money so that
people can see that comment
that that's the way I'd play it yeah
that's the way I'd go with that
all right
um ladies and gentlemen
I believe
we have come to the end of our
of time at least for YouTube I'm gonna
spend some time with the locals people
and tell them a secret and you you can't
listen bye for now
