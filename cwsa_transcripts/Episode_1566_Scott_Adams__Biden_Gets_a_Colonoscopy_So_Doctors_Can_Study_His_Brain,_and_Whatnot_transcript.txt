good morning everybody
and congratulations
the first thing you did today or one of
the first things
is hugely successful you found your way
to a live version of or maybe recorded
of coffee with scott adams which is
yeah that's right the best thing that's
ever happened in the entire
history of the universe
now on youtube did any of you have any
audio problems yesterday i heard there
were audio problems but give me tell me
in the
in the comments while i prep you for
another highlight
yeah it's a highlight
it's called the simultaneous set but all
you need is a copper mug or a glass a
tanker gel stein the canteen jug of
alaska vessel of any kind
fill it with your
favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes
everything better
you know it does
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
happens now go
okay it looks like most of you did not
have audio problems but there were audio
problems in some places so i guess it
depends
all right
so in fun news we'll get to the serious
stuff in a minute but in fun news uh
tesla has given us some
beta users
no no they're not beta males they're
just users in the beta program
uh they've given them full self-driving
beta software
and so there are some people in brooklyn
who can actually
take their hands off the wheel
which would be unwise because apparently
apparently
the self-driving part is
not as self-driving as possibly it could
be
um
but here's my take on self-driving cars
i think the highways need to be designed
for them alone
what do you think
do you think well do you think it's
going to be practical to have regular
cars and all kinds of stuff happening
at the same time as self-driving cars
i just don't know if our
our human driving capabilities in terms
of
you know anticipating a kid running
across the road because he lost his ball
i mean a human can pick up trouble
before
a machine right
but the machine might react faster or
even see some things that the humans
don't see
here are the things that i would want
for self-driving cars number one i'd
want the roads especially designed so
it's only self-driving cars i don't know
how you get there but that'd be cool
i would like all the self-driving cars
to be networked together
that's not yet a thing right
but i think that no matter the make of
the car it needs to be networked
specifically so the other cars can tell
if it lost control
because if one of the cars loses
controls control or let's say let's say
all the cars are monitoring each other
or even just all the cars have a buddy
like every car is monitoring itself plus
one other car
if the other car does something
that
some other car would not have done
it should send out an alert right
there's a car acting in a way that i
certainly wouldn't have acted as a
self-driving car
and then you know maybe something can
remediate that situation but the other
thing i like to see is some kind of a
satellite
visibility above the cars
now it could be cameras in the street
lights
it could be some of elon musk's own low
satellites
that could see your car pretty easily
um
but don't you think you'd like to know
if there's a car around the corner
because if you if you had all the cars
now you probably were not sold on the
idea of mixing or probably now solving
the idea of having only
self-driving cars in the road but you
realize you could get rid of street
lights right
like all street lights would go away
because if you had visibility from above
and all the cars were networked
you would have two ways to know if a car
is coming from
a hidden direction
you all of the cars could actually go
through an intersection without stopping
some would slow down some would speed up
but there'd always be plenty of room you
just the the self-driving cars would
just
regulate
and you'd never have to stop
so you could drive 20 you know say uh
20 slower
and get there 50 faster
if you had a self-driving car
did you do your own research on this no
i mean not just
sort of thinking about it and saying
obvious things
that's about it
apparently tesla made a billion dollars
profit was it this year or this quarter
or a quarter just this quarter
that's amazing but a quarter of their
profits was from bitcoin sales
is there anything elon musk can't do
you made a quarter of a billion dollars
on bitcoin this quarter
come on
that's just showing off
i mean it's bad enough he built you know
the most successful electric car company
that felt a little like showing off
but if you add like bitcoin as a as a
sweetener on top of that you just kill
it
that's just showing off
all right
bernie sanders doesn't like our
billionaires having a space race by
themselves
bernie
you are so no longer relevant
what kind of space race would we have at
all
if the billionaires weren't doing it
i think something like nothing right
that's what it would look like
of course we need them
all right here's the fake news of the
day fake news i think this is more of
the fog of war fake news which is a
little different than regular fake news
the fog of war fake news people are
probably trying to get it right and just
getting it wrong
whereas when a story is aged a little
bit
anything that's wrong is probably
intentional you know if you know what i
mean but in the fog of war it could be
just a mistake
and here are the things we've heard
about written house jurors we've heard
that
there were two rogue
jurors that
didn't want to
didn't want to rule
because they were afraid
but i think that's been debunked is it
not
now we hear that there might be a six
six split
all of these are unconfirmed low
reliability reports
um i doubt it
do you think it's possible it could be
six to six
and i hate to say it but it might have
to do with the the racial makeup of the
jury
if the racial make up the jury is half
white and half other
maybe
because i don't think anybody's going to
be looking at facts
i mean as soon as a trial becomes
political
i think people just line up on their
team
you know you hope that doesn't happen in
america but i feel like it could however
i'm going to say i doubt very much the
sick sick split
hypothesis i don't think so
but there apparently is some kind of uh
possibly a four person that's not
confirmed
who might be a hold out for guilty
and maybe trying to you know retry the
case in the jury room but again we don't
know any of this for sure
so i would say that everything you hear
about the
juror the jurors
and the deliberations
put a put a really big skeptical pin in
any of those stories
someday we might know what they did
but we don't know now we'd just be
guessing
um
rasmussen reports
that the public expects unemployment to
worsen in the future 37 think it'll be
worse unemployment
and 27 say it won't be as bad but here's
the funny thing
exactly 25 think unemployment will be
about the same next year
here's the only thing i know for sure
it won't be about the same
[Laughter]
if you want to make a prediction
about anything
don't predict it's going to be about the
same
there aren't that many things that stay
about the same
you know i suppose it'd be obvious which
ones they are so that wouldn't be much
of a prediction
but that 25 if you're new to if you're
new to this live stream i always make
fun of any poll
that has 25 or anything near that number
because that's exactly the number of
people in the united states who get
every question wrong
doesn't matter what the question is 25
of the public will reliably
just get that wrong
and it shows up in every poll
i one of the most frequent criticisms
that i receive
is that i never admit when i'm wrong
how many of you would buy into that
uh in the comments
tell me if you think that's a reasonable
characterization of my
let's say long-term public persona
now in locals you're you're friendlier
to me because you know these it's a
subscription service
um
oh but almost everybody's agreeing okay
i thought i was gonna have to defend
myself but apparently i don't however i
do want to talk about something i got
wrong
now if you think about people who admit
when they got things wrong who do you
think of
give give me some names besides me
give me some names of people that you've
seen admit they were wrong
i'm beside yourself okay now i'm talking
about public figures
public figures who talk about the news
cernovich bill maher
uh bongino tucker carlson
uh
o'reilly well yeah maybe
uh
jack pasabic got felled
okay
um
uh i thought tucker tucker is the first
one that came to mind to me because it
it always
seems strange
when somebody says directly i was wrong
because usually you get that well i was
wrong-ish you know cnn is doing the
wrong-ish play
well we weren't wrong about the fake
steele dossier
because you know after all
the trump campaign did show interest in
russia helping them
so you usually get that kind of whereas
whereas when tucker gets something wrong
he just says this was totally wrong
and then he goes on
like i always respect that
so i'm going to try to uh
i'm going to try to be the the good
version of admitting you're wrong where
you say it clearly
but i'm going to add a little bit of ish
to it
it's me
i get to do that
all right it goes like this
uh do you remember when uh uh sidney
powell was saying uh they were gonna
release the kraken
and somebody reminded me today that uh i
was confident that the kraken was real
that there would actually be a kraken to
be some kind of really big thing
now i was unambiguously
totally
wrong
which has nothing to do with whether or
not there was any problem with the
election
i'm saying that sydney pelo did not
produce a kraken
and i kind of thought she would
and here's what i got wrong specifically
i thought that there's no way
a lawyer operating at that level
could be so easily bamboozled by
but boy was i wrong
now i can't read her mind
so i'm making a an unfair assumption
about her thinking right it's always
unfair when you try to imagine you
you know what anybody's thinking
hello
as soon as you hear the sushi everything
hi scott
goodbye
um
so yes i understand that there's still
some litigation blah blah blah blah but
would you all agree with me
that she has not produced a kraken
and i thought she would
so i am unambiguously wrong about that
wouldn't you say
unambiguously
now i do say and here's my ish part
i do say that any system that can be
hacked
and i think our election system is in
the category of
things which hypothetically
theoretically could be hacked
that whenever you have a situation like
that and the stakes are high
and lots of people are involved it will
be hacked
we just don't know if it's already
happened
so my take is that a kraken is
guaranteed
but no way to know that it happened
already or it's in the future but it's
guaranteed because the situation
guarantees it it just
might take a while
don't know
all right
uh biden's getting his health exam today
i wondered if he's going to get a
cognitive test but then i heard he's
going to be under
anesthesia and he'll get a colonoscopy
as joel pollock pointed out
in effect they are looking for his brain
they're just going about it a different
way than i would have
i know maybe they know something we
don't so they'll be looking for his
brain but they'll be looking for it by
checking through his ass
which is i don't know maybe that's a
maybe that's a good first place to look
um but interestingly during his
anesthesiology anesthesia during his
anesthesia a word i hate to spell and i
hate to pronounce even more
uh kamala harris will be the official
president of the united states
now
remember when i was telling you how i
was totally wrong about that kraken
thing
oh and by the way i was also
one of the first public figures to say
the election is done
you know
we just have to move on
so i think i was right on that
in the long run
um because even if you find something
it's going to be too late so it's not
that you're not going to find anything
it's just too late the system has moved
on anyway harris is going to be
president for a while
and this will give us a unique situation
number one
i remember in august of 2018 sitting in
the oval office and trump asked me who
do i think will run against him and i
said
i thought his biggest risk was kamal
harris
today she'll be president of the united
states
now
keep in mind that i pre that i i
predicted kamala harris would be the the
main competitor when she had her ratings
were like zero
for popularity
and i continued saying it
after she dropped out of the race
right i predicted
that she was still the biggest threat
after she dropped out of the race
and today
she's president of the united states
now i didn't see it happening that way
but i don't know anybody else who was
who was thinking she got a shot at the
oval office and there she is but what we
have is a weird situation she's polling
at 28 approval
can somebody do me a quick fact check on
congress's approval at the moment you
know any of the major polls
is it around it's in the teens right
between 10 to
yeah 13 somebody's saying
so we've got a president at 28 and a
congress at 13 percent
or
i guess it depends what poll
nine percent somebody says 22 is that
harris's approval
anyway we have the lowest rated
government in the history of the united
states i think i mean maybe the civil
war was worse but in the modern times
isn't this the
lowest rating we've ever had for a
government i think it is
yeah
trump would be roughly double that
right
harris has roughly half of the approval
of trump would have if he just walked in
and ran for office
um
interestingly uh harris's communications
director
resigned
now
i have some respect for the
communications director for the
resignation
because very clearly the communication
director assuming that that person had
some talent
could not have had any influence on her
right
because we saw the worst communicating
i've ever seen i've never seen anybody
who was this bad at public speaking
anybody ever
anybody certain at least people in the
public domain
um
and so our communications director quits
now have you tried to read have you ever
tried to read a harris tweet
now i don't know if the communications
director was directly in charge of the
tweeting
but i i just want to open up any
harris tweet
i haven't looked at this but i'm just
going on my own
memory of things um
just watch how boring this is
this is a conal harris tweet from 13
hours ago today i met with president
lopez obrigar of mexico in my ceremonial
office our administration is engaged in
ongoing discussions with mexico
we discussed the steps we are taking to
address the
root causes
uh of
of migration in addition to water
sharing and space
is that the most generic
tweet you've ever heard in your life
her tweets are lifeless
they're absolutely lifeless now i get
that she's vice president right it's not
like pence was you know
the the tweeting champion of the world
or anything
you know vice presidents need to be a
little bit boring but
you could be a little less boring
couldn't you
i mean
this takes boring to a new level
so if you look at
let me take some counter examples take a
ted cruz
does ted cruz understand twitter
yeah he does i'm not sure he always did
you know if you looked at the early ted
cruz tweets were they all provocative
and interesting probably not
but do you think ted cruz learned
what social media is all about and how
to how to move the energy and how to be
interesting and draw yeah yeah ted cruz
is one of the best tweeters out there
you can hate him for politics that's a
different question
but his tweeting and communication are
extraordinary really good
so i think you see a lot of tweeters who
learn from trump that at least a little
bit of
provocation helps your communication
harris not so much
well um here's some more probably fake
news i'm gonna call it the you know the
story about the ridden house
jurors were allegedly followed by
somebody allegedly who worked for nbc
and then ridden house judge decided to
kick msnbc out of the
out of the courthouse so they can't be
there in attendance anymore
for the live stuff
um
here's the question
i don't know if any of this was true
because it's still the fog of war stage
right
now apparently the
and the alleged nbc
employee or i don't know if he was
employer contractor or what
but he claims he had no intention
of filming them or
or whatever
but nobody believes that he's freelance
somebody says he's freelance
but apparently he might have been on
assignment we don't know that
so i would say
at the moment you should be skeptical of
every part of that story
yeah msnbc admits that it happened
but but the part they admit
is that they send somebody on an
assignment or or somebody who was on an
assignment for them did it
i would i would wait to see what we know
about this
because it's possible the assignment
would tell us you know exactly what the
assignment was would tell us what he was
up to maybe i'm going to stay
open-minded my my first reaction to it
is the same as yours
which is horror
just horror
you know that i've said um
that our court system with all of its
problems i mean nothing is perfect right
our court system has all kinds of flaws
but it's also the crown jewel of the
republic
and if we lost the court system
everything else falls apart
would you agree
if you lose the courts if they're if
they're not credible everything else
falls apart
and
here we have a major news organization
who is uh allegedly associated with our
own intelligence agencies
you know that the people who know more
about this than i do claim that nbc is
basically just an organ for the cia
you've heard that right
and there's plenty of evidence for it i
mean the evidence is overwhelming
it's just that i don't personally make
that claim because i mean
i don't know but smart people say it's
true
and there's plenty of evidence for it
this would mean that our own country
tried to destroy the republic
by taking out the the most vulnerable
part of the most important part of our
entire structure
so the the most important part of our
republic is the court system
and then what's the most important part
of the court
a system of your peers
that
keeps the whole country together
let me say it again
jury of your peers
is where all credibility comes from
the entire
 republic
depends on that
you take that one thing away it all
falls apart
almost everything else you could you
know paper over and fix you see how
terrible congress is but somehow some
bills still get passed
right but if you take out the
the peer
you know trial by your peers you take
that out
the whole thing falls apart
and nbc just went after that
just went after the most vulnerable part
of the republic
maybe
i mean we'll wait to hear what they say
if they say something that was
maybe they were going to add some color
to a story like you know something about
how the
how the jurors live in a generic way you
know maybe the story was going to be
that the jurors are in a nondescript
hotel and
something like that yeah i i could i'm
willing to listen to their side of it
but on the surface it looks like they
tried to take out the republic
accidentally i don't know
intentionally
i can't read their minds
i i guess i can't put intention in there
but how the hell would you not know this
would destroy the republic
how would you not know that
i don't know
so
um
all right here's some more uh
fake news
so cnn is still writing that the the
dossier
uh
wasn't totally debunked because we do
know that the trump campaign really did
want russian help
and they write it with a link
to support their
their assertion
that the trump campaign really did want
that russian help now if you don't click
on the link
it's a news site right
if a news site
tells you in a news article not an
opinion article but a news article
and they tell you that
that the trump campaign wanted russian
help
you'd believe it wouldn't you
would you click on the link to see what
they meant as their example of that
well i clicked on the link
because i wondered if it was
here are the two things that they still
they still say
are the trump campaign asking for
russian help
it was when don jr and jared took a
meeting in the trump building
about maybe some hillary
dirt now keep in mind it's somebody they
knew
and all they had to do was walk
downstairs to hear it
that's it that was the entire effort
if you just walk downstairs
we might tell you something important
that might come from russia
who doesn't take that meeting
seriously
who doesn't take that meeting
i would
and i would go further and i say if you
didn't take that meeting you'd be an
idiot because what's the worst that
could happen
nothing right
well i guess it turned into an
international
thing but here's how i would have played
it and i've said this before
first you find out what they have to say
and then if you need to bring the fbi in
or somebody else then you do it but why
would you bring the fbi in before you
knew if there was anything there
because it's somebody you know
and sure enough
nothing was there it was actually a bait
and switch and there wasn't any hillary
dirt at all
so
if you have any business experience
whatsoever
number one you say to yourself this is
probably not what they say it is
right
how often do you go to a meeting and
you're surprised
it's pretty common right so the first
thing you do if you had business savvy
is say i don't even know if they have
anything from anybody but this is a
friend of ours and it's just downstairs
and it's just 10 minutes because we can
leave when we want
let's just see what they have to say
that would be a reasonable business
thing to do
now suppose
that you got actual dirt and then you
knew it came from russia
what do you do then
well you know the dirt so now it's
useful to you which is cool
and then you also do the right thing you
turn it over the fbi
you say hey we got some stuff this isn't
cool
but i'm glad we know it because it's
true
you know you'd probably need another
source you wouldn't want to trust the
russians but if the russians told you
something that you could check out
wouldn't you want to know
how is that bad
you know but cnn just by labeling it
the way they do and knowing you won't
check the details
they don't know that if you checked it
you would find experienced business
people
jared
and don jr very experienced business
people doing exactly what experienced
business people would do
in that situation
they did exactly what i would do i'd
take the meeting because it was easy
maybe it has some payoff maybe it
doesn't maybe i need to get the fbi
involved maybe i don't
but at least find out what's going on
before i made any decisions
all right
um and then the other thing was trump
making his joke in public
you know at some debate russia if you
have those emails
and and cnn's trying to play that off as
um oh yeah he always pretends like it's
a joke
um
but i thought it was obviously a joke
now that doesn't mean he didn't want it
why wouldn't you want that
and what's wrong with that
what's wrong with wanting
some real information you know he didn't
ask for a
what's what's wrong with finding out
stuff even if you find it out from
another or the wrong source
is there something wrong with the
information
now obviously you don't want russia
hacking anybody in the united states but
that's that that part seemed like the
joke
um
i've told you that the energy
at least in my life and it feels like
the country
is really wonky right now
some of you feel it right
there's something about
the world
that it feels like something's getting
ready to happen
now i don't know if it's just politics
i don't think it's a war
i don't feel that at all does anybody i
don't feel a civil war i don't feel a
nuclear war
um i don't feel war at all
i mean might be a low-level conflict
somewhere but i don't think that's
what's happening
it feels different
but i tweeted today and i'm going to go
through my tweet because i think it's
worth it
um
of just what i think might be going on
and i think it's a
an awareness shift
i think the world goes through various
levels of awareness
shifts
as we move from primitive to
more civilized and we learn more
and let me just run through a few of
these things
that have changed just in the recent
years now you might disagree with some
of them
but but hear them in their totality
before you disagree with the specifics
i would say that what's changed recently
just last few years
is that everyone understands their own
news is fake
you used to think the fake news was only
on the other side right
right
now you know it's on both sides you know
that you have you have also been fooled
by your own news sources
now
in my opinion
the left is a little more accurate on
the news
but there's still plenty of criticism to
go around i would say so you know if you
take the kraken the kraken is a perfect
example that was that was fake news on
the left i'm sorry on the right
so i think we now understand that our
own news sources can be wrong
just as easily as the other teams
and that's different
um how about our awareness about china
i think trump did that for us
by the way i think trump is the reason
we understand fake news is fake news i
think he did that which is what i
predicted you would do change how we saw
reality
uh our awareness about china has
completely changed
completely and china is the biggest you
know thing in the world and
if your impression of the biggest thing
in the world changes
you're going to feel it right that's a
big deal
do you remember it was only a few years
ago nuclear energy was bad and now it's
the green solution that will save the
world
what
that's a big difference
you know and each of these have the have
the uh the quality that our awareness is
higher
it's not just our information that's
different it's our awareness
of how we've been fooled that's
different
because the nuclear energy thing was
always an awareness problem
people believed it was worse than it is
and now they've been corrected on that
so they can understand how they could be
so wrong and
and and be wrong for a long time
how about
the fact that the government is probably
on the verge of becoming full republican
in a couple years
that's something pretty big
because it looks like the democrats are
just the bed so badly every day
that they couldn't possibly hold
congress
and and i doubt they'll hold the
presidency
so i mean i could be wrong about that
and that could change three times before
any of these elections but at the moment
it feels like that that may be part of
the energy shift
um
i think the country has realized that
the whole wokeness and critical race
theory things
were an overreach
we feel like we reach the limit that
feels different
right because when you reach the limit
your energy is different
because when people are just you know
nudging you a little bit you're like all
right
all right i got better things to do all
right all right you can have that one
i'm not going to die on that hill
i don't like that but i got other things
to do and then you hit the wall
and i think i think a lot of people hit
the wall
and then that changes your energy also
all right we have now reached the point
where i will i will take this to the end
of the earth
before i was flexible but now you've
reached my limit
that's my limit and now what happens to
my energy my energy just goes nuclear
because you reached my limit some of
that might be happening
we used to think that official data from
the government and from big companies
was
probably mostly honest and
sufficiently accurate even if i had some
problems
do you believe that anymore
i think now we believe that all data is
fake
because it mostly is
now
maybe not intentionally but there's
always some context left down or
something i think we're now more likely
to think that all data is fake as the
default assumption whereas it used to be
the opposite just a few years ago
a few years well even one year ago
a lot of people would have said smart
people
would have said that the second
amendment doesn't protect you from your
government
because the government has you know
better guns
do you believe that now
today does anybody believe that
government that guns
are not the only thing keeping us from
being australia
i think australia gave you all the
learning you needed on that
yeah
the the lockdown that australia is
experiencing that can't happen here in
america
because of the second amendment
i just don't think it can happen here
all right how about
we used to believe that humans make
decisions based on facts and reason now
i didn't believe that but many of you
did do you believe it anymore
now people
now the words cognitive dissonance and
confirmation bias
are common knowledge
they were not common knowledge five
years ago there were things that some
nerds like me talked about
but it is now common knowledge to
understand that we don't make decisions
based on facts and reason
we used to think there was an objective
reality but now i think we can see that
we're watching our own movies
would you agree
we used to think oh i'm seeing the clear
movie and those other people are just
being dumb
but now you realize
some of those other people
don't have low iqs
they're just watching a different movie
and you can't tell which one's right
that's different
that's different
how about
we used to believe that if you saw it on
video it was true
then there was a fine people hoax edited
video covington kids hoax edited video
drinking bleach hoax edited video
and now what happens when you see a
video
you automatically believe or at least
the skeptical part of your brain is
automatically fired up it's like well
let's see the rest of the video
let's see some context
so we went from video doesn't lie to
video lies more than anything
am i right that's just in the last few
years
that we completely shifted on what video
is and isn't
and then of course the russia collusion
hoax
taught us that there's no limit to
government corruption
i honestly thought there was a limit
so here's another case where i'm going
to admit i'm wrong
when
when the people on the right were first
talking about the russia collusion hoax
being a
hillary clinton paid operation with you
know the deep state behind it and the
cia was part of it
and all that do you know what i thought
i thought well you know there there
certainly is something sketchy going on
here but it's not that bad it's not like
a a collusion between intel agencies and
democrats and it's not that
but it was
it was every bit of that
the worst thing you could imagine that
anybody would do to this country
they were doing it it's the worst thing
that your government could have done to
you
and they were doing it hard
so my understanding of what's how far my
government would go
to
retain power and screw the citizens is
way different than it was a few years
ago
now i know they'll do anything
i didn't think that before and they'll
tell any lie because i can get away with
it i didn't think that
i thought that nobody would lie in
public
if it was easy to fact check them
wrong
wrong you can lie all you want in public
because you have your own fact checkers
the left has theirs the right has theirs
right so you can lie about anything now
that's different i mean at least it's
different than how i understand it
so here's what i think is happening this
big energy shift is about people moving
to another level of awareness
i think civilization
just got a big promotion
in terms of our understanding of the
reality such that it is and also the
simulation theory went from
crazy people to
maybe
right
five years ago
were people serious about the simulation
theory a few
but now
i meet people every day who buy into the
simulation theory as well that's where
the math suggests things are
what's this
uh this got predicted
all
right he used to think that voting
mattered oh i never thought that
i never another topic
uh
dj vlad
um
do you know how many of you know dj dj
vlad
of vladtv.com
i'm just wondering if there's like a
complete lack of knowledge about him on
the right
some of you
are saying okay you've heard of him i
only asked because i think his audience
is
mostly the left mostly black america
but
he also interviewed me when he was
trying to figure out trump
so he came to my house and for the
benefit of his audience
interviewed me to explain why anybody
would want to vote for trump
so i have great respect for
t.j vlad you should follow him by the
way
great content
anyway he tweeted this he said which
marvel movie had the best script not the
best special effects
and um
but the the best script
and i tweeted back
they have different stories
i i thought although i thought all the
marvel movies were the same story
am i wrong
there's
something bad happened to the world and
maybe
maybe somebody's personal life was at
risk
and there was a very powerful villain
and they had to fight that villain
and toward the end of the movie it would
look like they weren't going to win but
then they do
in the end
are you telling me that the marvel
movies have different scripts
no
it's the same script
and and beyond that
as i've taught you i think in script
writing terms
all scripts that become blockbusters are
the same pattern they have to be
for whatever reason people don't buy any
other pattern and this is the the script
pattern that marvel uses is
the classic one
you know the the hero the flawed hero
you know overcomes their personal
problems to save the world blah blah
anyway
david brooks is getting some attention
for attending the national conservatism
conference and uh
yeah he was he was appalled by some
things he saw and people are reacting to
it but here's the thing that caught my
eye
he talked about you know how crazy all
the conservatives were and blah blah
blah and how some of them were giving
him a hard time when he was there if
they recognized him but when he went to
just socialize
and have some drinks with him he just
had a great time
because it turns out
that when the the conservatives were off
duty as as you will they're just great
people fun to hang out with
and
he wrote it like it was maybe a surprise
or something
but it's not a surprise to me
is it i mean the reason that my audience
doesn't have exactly the same political
opinions as i do is that i just prefer
you
some of my opinions are closer to the
left
but i have to admit i don't like
spending time with them
you know they're they're largely
unpleasant people
and i know that's a gross generalization
but the left
there's some they have sort of a
personality
disorder
that i think is socially
instilled
whereas the right does not
the right is pretty much how they always
were i think
you know they're uh if if you if you
like the constitution
and you have a job
you're good
right
i mean the right is very easy to please
there's nothing easier
than pleasing the right
i like the constitution do you like the
constitution we're good
do you work
doesn't matter where
do you work
if you work
you're cool
did you break any laws
any ones i care about
no
you're cool
want to go to church with me
i mean it's so easy to make a
conservative happy they have they have
very clear standards and they're very
easy to to satisfy
right easiest thing in the world it'd be
harder to not make them happy you'd have
to work at it but left kind of does
all right so can you imagine being a
different topic
imagine training all your life to be in
the olympics which by the way i think is
stupid
from a risk reward perspective
spending your life uh training for the
olympics i think is just stupid
as a life strategy now if you happen to
be one of the few people who make it and
you get olympic medals and you know it
might open up some doors and those
people certainly made the right choice
but everybody else
if you don't meddle or even if you
meddle in third place
you wasted most of your life
for a copper medal
now imagine that you did all that work
and you find out that when your turn
comes you're the right age and you
finally qualified for the olympics
it's in china
you see you have to go represent your
country in china
literally the country that just
disappeared their top tennis star
because she complained that the
government raped her now i don't mean
with taxes
i mean a member of the communist party
literally physically raped her and when
she talked about it the government
disappeared
and you're you're an olympic athlete
you've trained all your life and you're
going to go over and support that system
how do how do the female uh
uh how do the american um gymnastic
female teams
how do they feel about that
seriously
how in
 does the american gymnastics
women's team who have been savaged with
sexual uh abuse apparently
how did they go to china
after this happened
after china raped somebody in public i
mean the story's public not the rape but
basically
they're they're basically getting away
with it in public
would you go
well you studied you you practice all
your life you kind of have to
so i
i'm not surprised
that our athletes would go to china but
i don't respect them for it
is that fair
because i'm not required to respect
anybody just because they work hard
i do like hard to workers
but if you worked hard and then you
decided to go support a rapist regime
i don't respect you at all
at all
at least that decision i don't respect
i might respect you as a human but not
for that decision
all right um
i feel as though oh here's a
interesting story
put on your skeptical hat when i give
you this one
apparently there's a huge uptick in
google searches for the phrase suddenly
died
and uh a lot of
anecdotal reporting of people who
suddenly died in the headlines
you know somebody 47 suddenly died
suddenly died suddenly died
now the question is asked is is that a
coincidence
is that a coincidence or is it
vaccinations
what do you think
put on your skeptical hat come on i've
trained you better than this
um what do you think
well what would make
google searches go up
for suddenly died
people are interested in the topic
because the rumor is that people are
dropping dead from vaccinations which i
don't have evidence of that
but um so yeah let me be clear i don't
have any evidence that people are dying
from the vaccination
i also don't have any evidence that
they're not
would you agree with that statement
we you and i
don't have evidence that people are
dropping dead from the vaccinations more
than normal because we know every kind
of drug kills somebody
but we also don't know it's not
happening
is that a fair statement we don't know
it's happening but we also don't know
it's not happening
because we it's just uh it's opaque to
us
um and then apparently pfizer's data
they're gonna wait 50 years to give it
to you
so
you know that should put a red flag on
there
well here's what i think i think that
you should expect there would be a there
would be an uptick in searching for
suddenly died
and an uptick in stories whether
vaccines had anything to do with it or
not
does everybody get that
you should see this is very predictable
you should see exactly this
effect the uptick of people being
interested in those stories and
searching for it
whether there's anything to it or not it
would look exactly like this
so i'm not saying that it doesn't mean
vaccines are doing it
i'm just saying you can't tell by this
this is
this is as close to no information
whatsoever
as anything could possibly be
but
could be
could be vaccines
unless you know people to which it
happened no nope that doesn't change it
because it is guaranteed
that no matter what the vaccine was
because all all vaccinations kill
somebody it was guaranteed that somebody
would know them
and we'd hear about it
right
so there wasn't there's no way that
somebody doesn't know somebody who died
suddenly after a vaccination
and we don't know if they died suddenly
because of the vaccination which is the
second
part of it right
lots of people die after everything
people die after eating a slice of bread
and they die suddenly
but it's not because they had a slice of
bread
right
so uh just put the maximum skepticism on
this suddenly died thing but don't rule
out the possibility that the
vaccinations are more dangerous than you
think you can't rule that out
based on anything we've heard
um
all right that
is oh i
i see juan is saying that a florida
lawsuit could finally unmask satoshi
nakamoto
the founder of uh bitcoin
uh i'm gonna say no
i'm gonna say that that can't be true
what do you think
do you think that there's any lawsuit
that could find the founder of bitcoin
no matter what question they asked or
who they're talking to
i don't think so so i think that's fake
news
i'd like to be surprised to be
interesting no actually i don't
um somebody says john mcafee no john
mcafee would be a lot richer if he were
if that were him
um
a verdict today
i don't know
i don't think there will be a verdict
unless it's a hung hung jury what do you
think i think you're getting a hung jury
um
oh here here's some anecdotal evidence
for you
do you want some anecdotal evidence that
doesn't agree with you
all right here it comes
i live in the highly vaccinated northern
california and highly vaccinated east
bay of northern california
probably and i'm just guessing
just because the the nature of the
people who live here
and the demographics and the income and
everything
i don't know anybody who's not
vaccinated with one exception
can anybody else say that
i don't know another person adult or
child actually i don't know
anybody who's unvaccinated
with one exception
now i also don't ask
unless i have a direct reason to right
so
um i sometimes ask because i'm concerned
about their risk not my own
but
all right here's my anecdote
in my entire social and family circle i
only know one person who's unvaccinated
and that's the only person who got
covered
that i know personally
now when i say personally i mean locally
personally not people i know from
twitter or people i met once that sort
of thing
does that mean anything
that the only person i know personally
meaning locally and personally
who is unvaccinated is the only person
who got covered
now i also know people who spend time
with that person and didn't get any
coverage
did they die now mild symptoms
mild symptoms
mild symptoms because the person is not
old enough
i don't think has any comorbidities that
i that i'm aware of
all right so what should you take from
that anecdote absolutely nothing
right so if you thought i was telling
you that story because it meant
something
you shouldn't
right it doesn't matter who says it
it's an anecdotal report has no
statistical meaning whatsoever and the
moment you imagine it does
well then you're misled
you know i tell you the story because
it's sort of counter to what maybe some
of you have heard anecdotally
it doesn't mean anything
it's just my story there's there's no
no credibility they should be assigned
to it other than you know the event
happened
but it doesn't mean anything for the
society
but neither does anything they're
telling us that is correct
my mom got a booster and died from
septic shock is that a coincidence
i don't know
i i would tell you that
given that almost
what 75 percent of adults or what's the
number now 70
have been uh have been vaccinated and
most of us this year
uh
almost everybody who dies this year will
die
relatively close to when they got
vaccinated
you get that right
that almost everybody who dies
from any cause
will have recently been vaccinated
especially when you have
two shots plus a booster
now most people will have been maybe
vaccinated a month ago
but there's a lot of people and a lot of
people die every year
many of them are going to be within you
know days of getting the vaccination so
what does it mean that you know somebody
who had that exact situation
nothing
not nothing at all
but
does it mean that it's enough of a
warning that you should look into it yes
yes you should definitely be skeptical
of any official data on this
because of the anecdotes they're enough
to make you skeptical
they're not enough to tell you anything
for sure
all right that's all for today i'll talk
to you on youtube later
