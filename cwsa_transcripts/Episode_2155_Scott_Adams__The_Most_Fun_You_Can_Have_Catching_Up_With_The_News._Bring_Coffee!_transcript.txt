Papa
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams the best
thing that's ever happened in your life
and if you'd like to take it up to
levels that are impossible to even
describe all you need is a cup or a mug
or a glass of tanker chalices Diana
canteen Joe go flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's the dopamine hit of the
day a little bit of oxytocin today and
uh it happens now go
oh yeah that's good yeah that's good
and now your day is going to look
excellent
um
well Geraldo uh has quit fired from Fox
News meaning that he was fired from the
five he was still employed at the
network but that wasn't good enough so
Geraldo has quit he quit fired
I don't think it's related to
affirmative action
probably just a coincidence
uh we'll get to affirmative action
did you see a news story yesterday that
said aspartame causes cancer how many of
you sorry how many of you saw that
and you thought that was true right
you saw that story and he said well
that's probably true
well it got community noted today
[Laughter]
it's true-ish
um what I didn't know until I read the
community notes is that there are many
layers many layers of uh how bad it is
for cancer
so at the lowest level which is what
aspartame was assigned to
there's all kinds of normal things in
that right like going to Disneyland well
that could cause you cancer you know
there are lots of things that are in the
Bottom Rung like getting into your car
could cause cancer wearing clothes
maybe could cause cancer
so it's the lowest level I don't know so
it seems like that was a very important
context
because it would be in a level of things
that you commonly experience and don't
worry about basically
all right I guess we should talk about
this uh Supreme Court decision
affirmative action
for universities and colleges has been
ended
or has it
or has it
I don't think there's any real change
I think we're just talking about
words you know nothing's gonna there's
no indication anything in the real world
will change maybe we'll see
but it looks like all they did was
change the wording
because the the new wording which is
funny
uh let's see the new wording is
this is how Harvard will skirt the law
so Harvard said they can still consider
a quote this is based on the Supreme
Court decision
Harvard can still consider a quote an
applicant's discussion of how race
affected his or her life be it through
discrimination inspiration or otherwise
and then it says we will certainly
comply with the course order
we will certainly comply with the
Court's order they just tell you they're
not going to change anything
they said they're saying it directly but
in a Harvard way you know so it sounds
like it sounds like they're going to
comply
which they totally are
but the apparently the order gives them
such a gigantic workaround
that Harvard just said did you just give
us a huge workaround where we can do
what we're doing
the same as we've always been doing it
apparently the answer is yes there's a
huge workaround they can't discriminate
against race instead instead of
discriminating by race they can take
race into consideration when they make
their decision
oh that's completely different
now correct me if I'm wrong but when
they had affirmative action they didn't
have a goal did they
there was no there was no specific thing
they were trying to hit
you know just more of it I guess
so how is this different
I would in any way is this different
black kid writes a writes an essay and
says
I've been you know a victim of systemic
racism all my life
you're in
that's exactly what we're looking for
how in the world does it change anything
nothing changed nothing changed at all
right
um
but the so my favorite kind of story
is when somebody's opinion usually a
famous person when their opinion becomes
so absurd but they hold on to it anyway
when people go from having an opinion to
pretending to have an opinion then
everything is funny
and I what could be funnier than
watching uh justice Thomas
and Justice Jackson
debating the uh that Supreme Court
ruling
because
am I wrong in assuming that Justice
Thomas was the Republican's affirmative
action
is that too harsh
does anybody think that they looked at
the whole world and they just
coincidentally he was black
does anybody think that
or do you think he got put at the top of
the consideration list I'm not saying
he's not qualified I'm just saying you
don't you don't think you got bumped to
the top of the list
and I'm not and by the way I'm not
saying that that was wrong
I would have no disagreement with it
whatsoever I do think the Supreme Court
is one place where you put a little you
want to put a little uh
little thumb on the scales make make
sure that there's somebody there that
looks a little bit like the rest of
America you know I don't I don't think
it would be a credible court if it was a
whole bunch of white men
so the other there are places where it's
just necessary
to have to have the group look a little
bit like the nature of the country it
just helps your credibility but
we don't have to pretend we're not doing
that
yeah so you have to pretend you're not
doing that to have this weird
conversation where the uh two black
members of the Court one is arguing
against affirmative action and one is
arguing for it
the absurdity of that is just through
the roof
because does Jackson believe that she
would have been picked to the Supreme
Court if not a woman and also black
does she does she think there's any
chance she would be in the Supreme Court
but I don't think that the Supreme Court
had affirmative action did it
I don't think so the the president was
not bound by affirmative action
to pick a member of the court that
increased its diversity but wanted to do
it anyway for political reasons which
are pretty solid
pretty solid political reasons
so the absurdity is just fun to watch
however just a clarification the
dropping of affirmative action in
universities won't have any effect on
television
advertising or the movies those will
still be entirely based on race
like now
all right um
let's see what else uh Berkeley
so there's a video of a Berkeley law
school dean
explaining somebody had their phone out
and even as he's explaining this in in
front of the group he says if I'm ever
deposed I'm going to deny this to you I
said this to you so he actually says
you know I'm going to deny I ever said
this
in front of a group every one of them
who had a phone with a camera in it
he's a law professor
the dean
I don't know you know Berkeley is my
alma mater
from my business degree but
um
I got a feeling
got a feeling there this isn't their
best work
but anyway he describes how they can
simply discriminate the way they always
have they just won't call it
affirmative action they'll just do it
anyway
now
what do you think
do you think anything changed
who thinks something changed yesterday
I don't know right I saw Gavin Newsom uh
tweeted against against the uh decision
and then this is the most fun part
Michael Shermer
who is very a very well known
let's say I don't know what I want to
say he's a well-known writer public
figure and very much associated with the
left I think although he's more of a
free thinker that's that's unfair I
think it's unfair to characterize in
that way but uh
he said he mocked Gavin Newsom for
thinking anything would change
and he said who do you think who do you
think is running a university
that's going to start acting differently
name names
whose name one person in any University
in California who will act differently
because of this
and it was a really good now the one
thing Michael Schumer is famous for is
being a rational skeptic
right so so he does stick to the the
facts he's a very fact-based opinion
person
and he just says he just looked at it
and said tell me what fact
changes anything give me a fact give me
the name of the person who's now going
to change their policies or at least the
way they act nobody
nobody can come up even with an example
of one thing that will be different
nothing
not a person who will act differently
not a not a outcome that will be
different nothing
but everybody's all worked up about it
my favorite story about this was a tweet
yesterday from somebody named Erica
Marsh
that some people thought was a parody
and other people thought it was real
now I'm going to read it to you and I
want you to use all of your
your powers to discern if it's a parody
or it's real now if it's real
you have the second possibility that it
doesn't mean what it looks like it means
because there's already been a
clarification
now I'll tell you the clarification
after I tell you the tweet so just know
that the Tweet is going to sound really
really bad
really bad
but see if you think it's real or maybe
something else was intended by it so
here's the tweet from somebody named
Erica Marsh it says
today's Supreme Court decision is a
direct attack on black people no black
person will be able to succeed in a
merit-based system
wait what
what
wait what
so and this is from somebody who is
identified online as an ex-biden staffer
I don't know if that's true
but somebody credit I'll just say
somebody credible
identified the account as an ex ex Biden
staffer now there's more in the sentence
but the first part of the guide
everybody excited was this part
she said no black person will will be
able to succeed in a merit-based system
then she goes on this the next part is
important which is exactly why for
affirmative action-based programs were
needed
today's decision is a travesty you know
caps
right
um do you believe that a Democrat who
tweets a lot
said in public
that if black people had to compete on
an equal basis they could not do it
do you think that happened in the real
world do you think that happened
Because the Internet is acting like it
did
like that's actually what happened it's
a real person with a real opinion
all right tell me here how many think
that that was a real person giving a
real opinion and the way it was read is
exactly what was meant exactly what was
meant a lot of yeses
not knows those who say no
what would be your what would be the
tell for it being fake
what are you looking at to decide that
this is not real what's what's the
giveaway
boom two on the nose
If This Were Real
it would be exactly exactly
the worst thing that Republicans think
about Democrats
because privately well even publicly
Republicans will say all the time
the Democrats are the real racists
and the reason they want affirmative
action is because they believe
that black people can't compete on an
even playing field
so the Republican belief is that the
Democrats are the real racists because
they won't admit
that they think they need an extra help
because they think there's something
wrong
some problem there
whereas the Republicans are saying why
can't you just let people be individuals
there are plenty of individuals who will
do fine just like in every group
individuals find a way
maybe the group as a whole doesn't do so
well some group is old does better do I
hate Asian Americans because they're
really good at school
no I'm just really really really happy
that I live in a country where there are
so many people who are good at school
I feel like that's going to come in
handy you know build us a build us some
technology solve some problems maybe
start some internet startups
how could I be mad at that
but
all right so here's so later after the
internet went crazy I saw people like
Matt Walsh
apparently buying into this being a real
opinion uh which surprised me
but here was the so-called clarification
now the clarification is not so clear
which is uh more evidence that this is
not a good tweeter
and then maybe that's all that's going
on it's just somebody who's not a good
writer so here's the here's the
clarification
allow me to clarify this tweet which is
being manipulated for propaganda and
misinformation by all caps Ultra Magna
uh the intention of my tweet
is to highlight that prior to
affirmative action there existed a
supposedly merit-based system for black
individuals to gain admission to
colleges
however these institutions employed
racial profiling to prevent black
individuals from individuals why would
you say individuals twice in one tweet
anyway to prevent black individuals from
attending under the guise of this Merit
system I want to emphasize that my
statement in no way suggests that black
individuals that's three individuals in
one tweet are less intelligent than
people of other races well I think she
made her point
I think she made her Point pretty well
because she identifies as white and she
just said something that's so dumb I
can't imagine any black person ever
saying it
so her point that black people are
smarter than her I think she made that
pretty well
however
Let's uh let's look at her clarification
so what she meant to say
is that before affirmative action it was
allegedly and here's here's the part
that got missing we allegedly had a
merit-based system before
and it just didn't work
so she's saying if you go back to the
system that didn't work what are you
going to expect
it's just not not going to work again
now she's wrong of course because all of
the institutions have
institutionalized a point of view which
will perpetuate more affirmative action
so she's completely stupid and and bad
writer and not a bright individual
but there isn't the slightest chance
that she meant to tweet that black
people can't compete because there's
something wrong with them there's no way
she meant to say that
does anybody really no after you've
heard the explanation
do you really still think that really
because I don't think you do I think if
you say you believe it that she that she
meant that you you were LARPing you are
pretending to have opinions right you're
just pretending that you're mad you're
pretending that this represents
Democrats and now you're going to
channel the feelings you've always had
you know nothing changed it's your
existing feelings you'll just Channel it
through this poor who said
some dumb things online
I would like to defend her
because
at the very least I would like my
audience to understand
and here's here's the thing to remember
whenever there's a public figure or in
this case somebody who's been turned
into a public figure whenever there's an
individual in the news that's getting
heat like this it's never about them
is simply a vehicle that people are
using to to shove their existing views
further into the news cycle
it has nothing to do with her she did
not say anything wrong she said
something unclear that caused the
problem but nothing wrong
she was making she was it was dumb I
mean her her Point as I understand it
with the clarification is still
lacks context the context being that
everything's changed since then we don't
need the extra you know legal push or
whatever it was
to make us want to have a diverse place
you put me into college make me the dean
of the college I'm going to push for
diversity I hate to say it I mean
because you might not like to hear it
but it's it's necessary
you just don't want to be crazy about it
right you just don't want to give up
Merit to do it so do everything you can
but I wouldn't make but I wouldn't I
wouldn't prevent white people from
getting jobs
like that's too far
but if you could do maybe a stronger job
of Outreach maybe maybe a better job of
being a good place to work for all kinds
of people you know you could you could
attack the situation a number of ways
without discriminating against white
people
you wouldn't have to it just could be
one thing that could happen
now uh so I told you that Michael
Shermer surprisingly
didn't have a problem with the ruling
but here's one that that might surprise
you and I'm just going to give some
props to this individual you know uh
jenk Eiger from The Young Turks
political abundant type person is quite
prominent
use heavily left oriented you would
expect him to hate this decision
wouldn't you
he did not he agrees with the decision
completely and I give him credit for
that it is not easy
to piss in the face of your entire
audience which he just did
he just took a big old piss right in the
face of his entire audience because you
know they don't agree with that
but he gives his reasons
and he sticks by it and he's clear and
I've got immense respect for that you
know he has other opinions that I don't
like so much
but this
uh he is he is deeply improving his
credibility in my opinion
uh
I want to read what he said
because the the way he said it was
actually my exact opinion
so if you want to know my exact opinion
it comes from Jack of all things like
who saw that coming today that he and I
would be agreeing completely on this
issue so here's what he says he says I
think Supreme Court got the affirmative
action case right I'm sick of the
stereotypes that attach to all
minorities because of this policy that's
what I think it was necessary in the
beginning that's what I think but it has
become counterproductive that's what I
think but legacy admissions which is
more unfair meaning you get in because
your parents went to the college
uh must be banned and I guess he's
working on getting that banned now I
don't have a strong opinion about legacy
admissions
not really
I mean they do it to do fundraising and
it can't be that many people is it like
what percentage of Harvard are Legacies
is it is it just a really high number
I mean if it's over do you think 25 25
it's funny I was just going to say 25 if
it's over 25 percent is way too much
because I do think that would be too
much right
does anybody know what the actual number
is if it's five percent why does anybody
care
yeah I don't know so I'll just go with
if it's five percent I don't care if
it's 25 it's worth a discussion
you think it's over 25
if it's over 25 percent but they were
also massively massively favoring
minority applicants I was that would
leave basically no
no unrelated white people any spots
whatsoever right
you know once you got rid of all the
Legacies
and then you packed it with all the
minorities that you're trying to attract
what's left there's probably no no space
left
so so I'm hearing people say it is a 36
percent of somebody's saying close to 40
okay then I agree then I guess uh Jack
and I have 100 agreement
on this who in the world saw that coming
this is the craziest day it's just a
crazy day
who would have seen me unabashedly
defending
uh Biden staffer
that happened today this is weirdly
bringing us together if you notice that
that this decision is weirdly causing us
to unite in all the strangest ways I
know that we're going to talk about
where we're disagreeing like all the
discussion will be where we disagree but
I feel like just under the hood there's
something else happening
there's sort of a
um I'd say a more sophisticated
view of it
because I think that no matter what side
you're on you could see the current
situation is unproductive that's what
jenke is saying that's what I think
so I like I like diversity I like
wokeness a little bit
I just don't like too much of it you
know when it goes too far
so this is a this is a good adjustment
and I think that the
um you know I've been telling you for a
while
that the the wokeness peak has been
reached
and you can tell by the absurdity you
know the level of absurdity you know the
whole Dylan move anything so this this
is not just people disagreeing about
stuff this is just flat end absurdity
and once you reached the point where all
of the stories of this domain are just
absurd they're not even really things
you should even bother talking about
they're just crazy once it reaches
that then people people start to see it
as crazy and then they can start
moderating you know you want to keep the
stuff that was good
I don't think the wokeness thing was bad
I think it just went too far and now
we're going to adjust back and keep the
stuff that was good
I like the part where we treat each
other with the respect
let's keep that part
because I don't think we had enough
respect for each other
so if so if what we get out of this is
more respect for people who are
different from us
good but you got to bring it back a
little bit
all right uh I loved watching Cornell
West
react to this with Dana Bash
and I'm going to tell you some behind
the scenes stuff
and you can't ask me how I know
so Dana Bash if you didn't know is white
Cornell West a very interesting
character uh is is black
or identifies as black
I guess I would say that because I was
watching him yesterday and I thought
it's weird that it doesn't look black
but he that he identifies as black and
I'm not going to question that but
um so he was very upset about the
Supreme Court ruling and quite visibly
upset
and uh who was it who said this oh Jesse
Jesse Waters said this
uh Jesse Waters said this yesterday and
maybe it surprises you coming from him
but also maybe he's trying to grow into
his new job
you know his his prominence at Fox News
is higher because he's taken the tucker
spot so maybe he's he's just trying to
modify his game so he started on his
commentary about this the very first
comment was we should all we should all
understand that this is devastating to
Black Americans not all of them
the lot
and I actually appreciated that I
respected that a lot because he started
with there's a victim here
now whether you think whether you think
um affirmative action was right or wrong
unrelated to the thing there are people
who are having an experience a lived
experience which is very negative and I
care about that
because they're Americans they're humans
they're people they're just people I
disagree with on some political details
but I don't want to see them suffering I
don't want to see anybody waking up to a
bad day that's not on my list so I will
also give some respect to Jesse Waters
who often is you know more the Joker
but in this case I think he he hit the
he hit the target exactly
start with the fact and I should have
done it too
you know I regret that I didn't do that
so I thought that was a good model for
Behavior which is to acknowledge that
somebody's suffering
and and it's going to have an impact and
that might blow back on you too you know
you're not you're not independent from
the suffering of other Americans
so
having said that
um Dana Bash talking to Cornell West so
Cornell West was a good example of a
black American
having a tough time with it
but
I I think
this is just speculation because I can't
read minds I suspect that a lot of what
is bothering them
the black Americans in particular is the
feeling that what's behind it is racism
and I don't think it is I really don't
think it is but you could imagine why
they would think that like if you were a
certain age and born in a certain time
and you'd gone through a lot of the real
real racism
who would naturally
suspect
that maybe that's behind this it's just
people that will say it that way maybe
that's what it is so he was quite upset
but what was fascinating about it was
Dana Bash asked him this question
which caused him to melt down into total
word salad
and she said
what would you say to Asian Americans
that's it what would you say to Asian
Americans
how do you tell them they can't go to
college because they're not black she
didn't say that but that's built into
the question
now
what do you expect to see an end to ask
that question
because that that completely turned him
into an idiot
right right in front of you he couldn't
answer it
because answering it would reveal that
he was a racist
which apparently he is I mean overtly
I mean his reaction to this
I don't know how you can I don't know
any way to paint it other than overtly
racist he overtly
directly and unambiguously prefers
fewer Asian Americans getting into these
colleges so that a greater percentage of
black people can
I don't know what to call that
that is racist
by definition
now you could argue that affirmative
action is racist because it is by by
Design
so one of the things I would love to add
to our conversation to fix everything
and I've never heard anybody say this
before directly but again this is one of
the things I can say because I'm
canceled so let me say Well only a
canceled person can say
not all racism is bad
there you go
did you like hearing that not all racism
is bad
the problem is we act like it all is
but affirmative action as I just said I
thought had a important role in American
history it was very racist
but it was good
you see the point it was racist
but it's good I'm in favor of funding
the historically black colleges
completely racist
but I think more good than bad
I'm in favor of it
I'm in favor of
TV and movies and commercials and even
colleges
considering race
when they make their decisions I'm in
favor of that I do think all of those
things should have some effort to be
like the American character
but it's totally racist
isn't it how could it not be it is by
Design overtly we're trying to change
the mix of race in this situation that's
overtly racist
but it's the good kind
right
so I think part of the problem is we
keep arguing with with each other as if
all racism is bad when in fact there's a
whole whole category of racism that we
intentionally pursue
because we generally think oh that's
actually pretty good not 100 good right
because even even trying to add
diversity to your organization a
perfectly good objective
will end up accidentally discriminating
against white people of course
you know not that's not the intention
but of course it would happen of course
it would happen so these are they're
complicated things where you have to
look at the societal benefit
but you also have to look at the fact
that there are going to be some people
who you know getting the knife in the
back
and maybe you balance those and say well
for a little while we'll let a few
people get knifed for the greater good
you know these are complicated things
but anyway
here's what I wanted to say
do you believe that the white
correspondent says CNN are opposed or in
favor of college admissions being
determined by racial identity
what do you think the white CNN hosts do
you believe that they are opposed to
this decision today
well let me let me give you some
background the white CNN hosts
have in some cases children who are
trying to get into college and having
troubles
but in all cases they are friends who
are white whose kids can't get into the
colleges that they want to get into
so that's your behind the scenes now I'm
not guessing about that I can't say any
more about it I'm just telling you I'm
not guessing
right
the the white correspondence on CNN were
not in favor
of affirmative action in college because
their own children were impacted their
own children or the children of their
best friends or their sisters children's
you know that sort of thing
but all of the the Liberals the liberals
who grew up thinking this was a good
idea just found out it's screwing their
children
and their friends children's
when when Dana Bash asked that question
what would you say to the Asian
Americans
that was a kill shot
that was a no round question
that's not what they do
that's not how CNN normally acts you
know normally they take a side right
normally they do unless it's just a news
story like you know if a president you
know murdered somebody they tell you
that even if it was their guy because
it's just a fact but when they when they
ask a question a certain way when they
elicit answer you know answers in a
certain way that's all that's all
narrative
so this was clearly in the domain of
narrative
and Dana Bash
of CNN
determined that the narrative was that
this screws Asian Americans
and she made a black guy try to answer
that question and he couldn't he had to
change the subject
now that's the question everybody should
be asked
because if you're still in favor of
affirmative action knowing is screwing
Asian Americans
explain it you you tell me why they
should have less access after all their
good works and staying out of jail and
staying off drugs we're going to
penalize them for doing everything right
explain it give me your give me your
rationalization for penalizing a racial
group in America who did everything
right
Good Luck Good Luck explaining that
all right so that'll be fun you'll
expect I expect a lot more people to get
that question
um I also wonder if there's any uh
infighting at CNN and MSNBC because I
feel like this divided them
you know much like progression and Putin
so I think everybody's Russia Today like
all the left-leaning organizations that
they just turned into Russia where you
know don't you think Joy Reed is trying
to find the Traders
I'm laughing at my own joke
it's just like Putin Joy Reid is
probably looking at MSNBC saying wait a
minute I said it was a terrible worst
decision ever
but that guy
he's a little quiet
he said he's just talking about it
factually
I don't feel like he's as sad as he
should be
I'm not sure he's on my side
so CNN MSNBC just turned into Russia
with Putin looking for the traitors
uh that's one I mean I assume that's
what's happening
all right
let's see if I covered all those points
uh so here's the next question so people
are asking will Biden react to this by
packing the court so for those two or
three people who don't know apparently
the Constitution does not specify how
many members of the Supreme Court there
are
so a president could just say oh I think
there should be a hundred
and then a point to Andre justices and
then just to point 100 Democrats and
then the Democrats would just win every
Supreme Court
completely doable like there's
apparently apparently there's no
constitutional
obstacle to doing that
however what would be the obvious thing
that would happen
the obvious thing that would happen is
that it would it would encourage a
republican to you know win it would
probably help their chances because it
would seem so ridiculously unfair it
would be the end of the Republic because
Republicans would then say well now I
think the Supreme Court is 200 people
I'm gonna I'm gonna add another 100
Republicans and we'll win every time
well as soon as you get that cycle going
of we'll make sure the Supreme Court is
packed as soon as we get in the moment
you start that that's the end of the
Republic
because it takes away the independence
of the Judiciary and the only thing that
makes our system work is the famous
checks and balances you know the
executive can't order the courts can't
order the Congress Congress can't order
the executive the fact that they don't
have power over each other is the only
thing that makes it work right you take
that out and the whole thing falls apart
in a day I mean I'm not talking about
something that would fall apart
eventually the whole thing's gone the
the moment you do that the whole
Republic is gone
right now do you think Biden knows that
well he used to I mean we don't know
what his mental capacity is but he used
to say it directly that it was the
dumbest idea
because everybody who's smart and
experienced knows is the dumbest idea
so given that everybody smart knows that
packing the court even though it might
feel good temporarily would be the worst
idea for everyone
so I'm predicting it'll happen
I'm just joking I'm just joking uh no
I'm predicting it won't happen
but
if we really go ahead and do the worst
dumb thing that a country could
ever do to itself
we deserve to not be a country anymore
if if we if we get across this bar like
the bar to remain a country is really
low
seal the borders collect some taxes and
don't pack the court
that's it
that's it you just you know a little
border security pay some taxes
that's it it's kind of easy but we might
not be able to clear the bar
that's where we are 2023.
all right let's talk about RFK Jr uh
boy it's hard to have an opinion in 2023
isn't it because you put your opinion
out there and then it just gets smashed
The Smithereens before the end of the
day's news cycle
so for a full day I was thinking that
RFK Jr had all the right arguments and
he was doing exactly you know what I'd
once what I'd want someone to do if
their intention was to bring the country
together
and I thought he was doing a great job
of it
however
uh yesterday afternoon happened
well I can change in an afternoon
so one of the things that changed was
RFK Jr came out
solidly against the ending of
affirmative action
so he solidly for it
that lost him a hundred percent of the
right
a hundred percent
there won't be a single person who he's
been actively courting for months who is
still on his side he lost them all and
they're not coming back
that that is game over
that is game over because this
is an opinion that even jenk
even jenk disagrees with even Michael
Shermer disagrees with and they're just
you know two who are brave enough to say
it in public you don't think there are a
whole bunch of other people on the who
are Democrats who also disagreed with
affirmative action
really
really you don't you don't think there's
a good clump of Democrats who are maybe
silently but secretly pretty happy
because now their kids can get into
college
well I think there is a big group of
that so
so RFK just traded away a hundred
percent of the you know right-leaning
Independents and Republicans
and what what did he buy back
what do you get in return
nothing
kind of nothing
because being against affirmative action
is sort of the uh the minimum buy-in to
be a Democrat
and I believe can you give me a fact
check on this did he come out come out
against uh ownership of what he would
call assault rifles or some people would
call assault rifles the ARs
did he come out against those right so
if he came out against the ARs you know
gun ownership
he's not anti-second Amendment but that
would be a red line
um
he gave away everything he had he gave
away all of it now on one on one hand I
kind of respect that he's willing to do
that
I kind of respect it
but I feel like
um any effort to bring us together is
now gone
so I think he traded that away
and I don't know what he got for it now
may maybe he thought he would get some
democrat credibility
because he's running as a Democrat and
let me let me give him this much defense
if you're running at a Democrat as a
Democrat you can't be against
affirmative action and he can't be in
favor of
you know ARS
so he's probably just
you know he may actually believe these
things as well I haven't I've seen no
indication he's a liar
but
uh it just it just turned him into as
Mike cernovich said a typical lib
sirovich was reminding us that he's been
saying this for a while that he's not
special and that the right the right was
getting enamored by him but he's not a
special you know in the end he's just
run-of-the-mill take your guns and
discriminate against white people kind
of guy
um you know I'm exaggerating that that's
not what either of them said
so
it'll be fun to watch and I I did a
little bit of uh thinking
how in the world there's nothing we can
there's no way to help RFK Jr on guns
would you agree
there's no argument that he can make
it's just sort of over
anybody who wants second amendments not
going to vote for him he's just given
that away completely
but yeah and and what it does is make a
fake um
look better every day
right
because Vivek is pretty pure in terms of
his opinions they they match the right
pretty well but then on top of that he
is the smartest guy in the game
so the smartest guy in the game with the
best you know communication skills are
just crazy
um he could he can sell
a version that conservatives like and
sell it better than they even think it
yeah this is what I say about a good
writer
a good writer tells you what you were
already thinking but writes it better
than you thought it
you ever heard me say that
because what you want is not somebody to
change your mind you want somebody who
says exactly what you're thinking but
the way they say it is wow that's better
than I was thinking it I could not have
explained it as well as that guy did and
that's what Vivek does consistently you
know he he can bring the argument
uh nail it down you know and just just
nail every every thing he leaves nothing
he doesn't leave any loose edges like
you can't pull on the thread and get his
argument there's no thread he locks it
up
and he's probably the best
you're going to see
right
Joe Schmo says still Brown though
I can't tell if you're serious
are you serious
I just don't I can't tell in 2023 you
really can't tell the trolls and the the
parody from the reality I just can't
tell
I don't know
so
um yeah what else is going on
I almost don't want to bring this up
because it's too it's too fun but I'm
going to do it anyway I've mentioned
I've mentioned this influencer before uh
H Pearl Davis
so I think she goes by Pearl and she did
another whiteboard uh video
I wish he suggested that women should
not have the right to vote
and they should repeal the knights into
the men that
[Laughter]
now I tweeted it or you could just go
look for it on Twitter just look for
Pearl Davis it'll probably pop right up
now
I've been following her content mostly
on Instagram for a while and it is
endlessly entertaining
I want to say clearly that I don't agree
with her views
I want you to hear that clearly so we're
not we're not here to argue whether
she's right or wrong I'm not going to
have that argument I'm saying that
watching her uh navigate that sharp edge
between going too far
or being a parody
or being serious
it's really hard to tell and it's so and
because it's hard to tell it's brilliant
because you can't look away you're not
sure what you're seeing
you you you're wondering if at the end
she's going to say just kidding you know
and like walk it back but she doesn't
and and then you think well she's never
going to be able to make this argument
now again I'll remind you I do think
women should be voting
but when you listen to her argument and
the fact that it comes from a woman
which makes it funnier her argument is
suspiciously good
it's not it doesn't sell me
it's like right up to the edge of
something that would make sense it's
like so close it's so close to something
that does make sense that your brain uh
gets a little uh
surgeon just tried to figure it out
Is that real Is that real or is she just
kidding I can't tell and so I highly
recommend her content but I'll say a
hundred times don't assume I'm agreeing
with her content it's just brilliant
content because it makes your it makes
you think
it'll give you
I'll give you my own summary of it which
I think is unfair because because the
details that she puts into it of her
argument are all hilarious
they're just because because you keep
thinking it makes sense but not exactly
that that's what makes humor work
um
but I would summarize her uh her entire
thing and she would not summarize it
this way this is just my summarization
as uh the problem is that men can't say
no to women
and there are a lot of women voting for
stuff and a lot of Ben saying all right
that's what you want
but if you took women out of the mix
from voting and Men voted for what they
thought was a good idea you get a
different outcome
Maybe
you know my my observation is men and
women seem to vote about the same I mean
the the polls say otherwise but uh
yeah actually no I take that back they
don't vote about the same anymore they
used to right
I think I'm out of date they used to
vote similar but now women are more
likely to be Democrat is that true
so it would be women women who would be
more likely to be pushing let's say
affirmative action
if you did a poll of men versus women on
affirmative action would it come out the
same
I think more women would be in favor of
it but I'm not positive
yeah so there are some things that are
different because women are voters
and then pearls
uh serious or not serious I can't tell
the opinion is that that changes things
and it might be a bad way
I I the reason I disagree with her
is not in her argument that things
worked out poorly
because she makes a pretty good argument
that things worked out poorly
it's just that you can't you can't have
you know full citizens of the United
States who can't vote it's just there's
no way to get there so it's sort of a
funny point
not not really a serious plan
that is the most sexist comment I've
ever seen there on YouTube
I was going to read it because it's
funny but it might be over this might be
a little over the line
uh Switzerland regrets allowing it
all right
um let's talk about pregosian
I I may I might end up being wrong about
this
I might so I've said that you'll never
see him again and that when his airplane
flew to Belarus it was just the airplane
and that you'll never see him again and
the reason you'll never see him again is
that Putin needs to know he's found all
the traitors and the only way to know it
is to get her from pregosian because
he's the only one
Who would know everybody he's talked to
and what agreements they made Etc so
there's a hundred percent chance in my
opinion that Putin got a hold of him
uh and he's being interrogated
and when I say interrogated I mean he's
having a bad day
so today there were pictures of him in
Saint Petersburg
oh okay well I guess I was wrong
there are pictures of him getting in the
helicopter in their new pictures
and he's there with his bodyguard and
you know there's no doubt about it he's
he was cleaning out his stuff in Saint
Petersburg getting on the helicopter
and then somebody uh did a close-up of
his hand
and he's got five fingers on his hand
the real pregosian does not
so the guy that everybody thought was
progression was wearing a a coven mask
and he was with his real bodyguard
and they were they were allowed to be
photographed oh what a coincidence how
how interesting there just happened to
be a photographer there
just happened to get the picture of
progosian getting a helicopter in Saint
Petersburg so I guess I guess uh he's
not only free but he's he's
helicoptering around with his bodyguard
no Russians watching him he's just sort
of doing his thing and then then totally
voluntarily he will uh he'll go back to
Belarus of course where he'll live a
happy life on the farm with your dead
dog
so
then they showed the picture of the real
pogosian he's got he's one part of one
finger is missing but the guy who got in
the helicopter who is with his actual
bodyguard because The Bodyguard didn't
have a mask on
so you could tell The Bodyguard it was
definitely The Bodyguard
but it was a body double
it was a body devil
do you still believe there was an
insurrection
yes
I believe it was a
[Music]
conditional insurrection
it was a conditional Insurrection
meaning that
I don't know that pagosian knew what was
possible to happen I think that at a
minimum he wanted to get rid of those
those generals
but I do think there's no chance he
wasn't thinking in his mind that if he
got rid of the generals or actually he
said capture them
it looked like he was trying to take
over the military
so I believe that when progression says
no I love Putin I'm never oh no you
think this is a a coup against Putin are
you kidding me no no no no I'm only mad
at the military so I'm going to try to
take over the head of the military and
replace the head of the military with
myself or or one of my puppets so I
don't want to take over the country
that's crazy I'm only trying to take
over the entire military complex
and then of course once I owned all of
the military I would because I like
Putin I would let him run the country
of course of course Putin can run the
country I just want to own all the guns
do you think he was going to take over
the military and then let Putin run the
country
do you think that was his plan
[Laughter]
I don't think so if it was it was the
worst plan I've ever heard
at the very least he was trying to
control the military if you control the
military
well you kind of control the country
and by the way as anybody said that
I keep watching the news for somebody I
keep waiting for somebody to say well
you know whether it was a coup or not a
coup he was trying to control the
military if he controlled the military
you effectively control the country
I'm the first person to say that out
loud aren't I which is weird because
it's the most obvious
explanation of what was happening
all right
here's my real question much like CNN
and MSNBC after the affirmative action
decision
Putin really really doesn't know who to
trust
and the magnitude of that problem now
is hard to predict
but there are people who you know since
the beginning of the progosian thing
have said oh it's the end of it's the
end of Russia now I didn't think so I
didn't think it was the end of Russia
but
um
who knows how bad it could be
because don't you think that right that
by now Putin is probably jailing or
killing people who were largely innocent
don't you think that's happened
because he's probably dealing with a
bunch of people and if you're a dictator
you take you know you jail or you kill
all the people you're sure were part of
the coup but also and here's the
important part
also anybody who knew those people
anybody was a good friend with a coup
plotter
probably dead or in jail so
the problem is not the ones you know or
the coup plotters the problem is how
many how much of the cancer you have to
cut down by getting rid of people who
really had nothing to do with anything
they just happen to know the guy
and those people are going to become now
radicalized as are older relatives and
friends because they're going to say all
right you just got rid of 100 people
that nothing to do with anything
and we have all the guns
how long do you put up with it
how long does the military put up with
the military being abused by a civilian
Putin I don't know could get dicey could
get dicey it also means that Putin
probably can't go out in public very
much unless it's a really controlled
situation for now because he probably
thinks they're
let me uh let me say it directly there's
no way that progression doesn't have a
assassination Squad looking to kill
Putin would you agree
no matter whether progression is alive
or dead
there's somebody he's already operate
you know he's
he's probably paid or something who's
looking to put the decapitation strike
on Putin so I feel like there could be
another play here I mean don't be
surprised if something blows up near
Putin
like really soon now remember the Wagner
group has military assets
in theory they could drop a loitering
munition right on top of Putin if they
knew where he was
now presumably Putin always travels with
you know even I imagine even the
anti-aircraft
if Putin is just driving from one part
of the city to another
he's probably got all kinds of military
assets you know the whole way at least
now but would they be able to shoot
things out of the air
if he's driving down a city street in
Moscow
and a loitering munition appears from
over top of a building like it was
invisible until it came over the street
looks down
has let's say 15 seconds to lock on and
drop the Munitions in 15 seconds
can his defensive people knock that down
would it would there be helicopters
above any Putin movement so they could
get anything in the air I don't know I
just don't think the anti
the anti-drone technology is so good
that they could get them all
yeah I mean solomani got whacked and he
was obviously looking for trouble I mean
he was looking for
potential attacks
all right uh
so
uh Wall Street Journal is reporting that
China changed their
one of the laws about what Espionage is
so if you're a foreign entity let's say
a company operating in China
you could get arrested for Espionage
based on the new vague standards
and so the uh
the U.S counterintelligence officials
are warning that American Executives
could get arrested over there on charges
that would not necessarily
be related to anything bad they did they
would just use the new ambiguous law to
say well you're a you're some kind of a
spy
so I don't know if I've mentioned this
before but has anybody ever heard me say
that
China is unsafe for business
and it just keeps getting more unsafe
I don't know how anybody would start
business over there
but I do understand how somebody like
Elon Musk might be a little bit trapped
you know he's got to do business there
don't he doesn't have too many options
but why would you open a business there
like what what American would say I'd
like to open a business in China and
I'll be visiting that a lot
with my laptop that will be packed in 10
seconds
all right
that ladies and gentlemen
is all I had planned to talk about
because I was having so much fun reading
about everybody's reaction to
the news
um was there a story I missed
I didn't really get to check the news
news I just was looking at the headlines
yeah we talk about progressions body
double just did that
uh
Supreme Court just threw out Biden's
student loan debt relief
uh
good
so uh it's looking bad for them now do
you think the Democrats will use use
affirmative action
and the turning down of the student loan
stuff as campaign fodder
what do you think you think they will
use these as campaign fodder
I'm going to go contrarian
I think they might so I agree with you
that you know they'll give it a shot but
I don't think that's going to work the
way they want
I think that if the Democrat if the
let's say if Biden if Biden really makes
a thing about affirmative action he's
going to lose a lot of white Democrats
who have kids who are trying to get into
college and he's going to lose all of
the Asian Americans or 80 of them
so
I think it's really dangerous for him to
push that button
timing isn't right yeah 20 years ago yes
now not so much
how will they do an end run on the court
packing
I'd I'd think that Biden is smart enough
not to do it believe it or not
I think he's smart enough not to do it
but if they don't do it it's going to be
you know a lot of years of Republican
victories in the courts
he already did did what
oh Biden already used it yeah of course
Biden's already going to use it but
we'll we'll see if he stays with it you
know it's a headline so of course he has
to address it but does he make it like a
a key part of his ongoing campaign and I
think maybe not I think they're going to
poll it because
I saw a poll today that said that
getting rid of affirmative action was uh
hugely popular in the country
is that your understanding
is your understanding that affirmative
action was not popular and that most
people I think two-thirds are happy that
it went away
yeah so he'd be arguing on the side of
one-third of the public against
two-thirds of the public that's like a
bad campaign approach
you know you should be picking things at
at least 100 percent of Democrats like
and there's plenty of that
all right
well you know honestly what I felt like
is that black Americans got a promotion
yesterday
did anybody have that feeling
it felt like black Americans got
promoted
to full citizenship
that's what it felt like and what I mean
by that is as long as affirmative action
existed
then the system was teaching black was
treating black Americans like
second-class citizens
that's how I saw it I saw them being
treated as second-class Citizens like oh
oh you need a little help oh poor little
guy
yeah you need a little help I thought it
was condescending
and counterproductive the way the same
way Jen thinks so it was a good idea for
a long time but it became counter
productive because it succeeded it's its
own success made it unnecessary and I
think it was time to go
but yeah to me you know wait five years
in five years if you see a new
um new let's say uh young black college
graduate
Maybe
you start saying to yourself wow if you
could be a young black person who came
let's say from a you know poorer
situation and you still made it through
an Ivy League school I definitely want
that person on my team right so somebody
who could plow through you know every
obstacle and still make it work without
any help oh yeah oh yeah I'm hiring that
person
but right now you're thinking all right
I don't know how'd you get into college
did somebody help you
so to me it looks like a gigantic
victory for black Americans
to be
finally no longer considered
second-class citizens
at least in this minor context
so I don't know always good with the bad
anything else yeah somebody said a lot
of the uh black students in Harvard were
actually immigrants and they had no
slavery Legacy whatsoever
although I suppose they might have from
other countries
all right
um and it also puts all the pressure on
uh the the school unions teachers unions
so the Randy Wine Gardens of the world
have some some explaining to do you know
why can't you prepare everybody
so that by the time they're applying for
college affirmative action is like a
ridiculous idea
because everybody's doing fine
but at the moment black people are
getting terrible educations
so maybe that gets fixed someday
all right YouTube thanks for joining and
I'm going to talk to you tomorrow
