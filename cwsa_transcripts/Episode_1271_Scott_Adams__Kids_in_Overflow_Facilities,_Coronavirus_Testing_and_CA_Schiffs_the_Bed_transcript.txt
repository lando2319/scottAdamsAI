hey everybody
come on in come on in you're just in
time
dr drew good to see you everybody else
i'll just guess some names and see if i
get lucky um
hi kathy bob mike janet
diane good to see you i'll bet
somebody has those names now how could
you
enjoy this even more than normal well
it's going to be hard but what you're
going to need is a copper mug or glass
attacker challenger steiner canteen
jugger flask vessel of any kind and you
will fill it
with your favorite liquid my choice is
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine of the day that
makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous sip
and it happens
now go
that's the good stuff
let's talk about the news some stuff
happening
um there's a rumor that representative
adam schiff of california where i live
is uh trying to get a job as
the california's attorney general
that's the the news anyway now
i ask you what would be the perfect job
for the man who is famous famous
for being the biggest liar in the united
states
if you don't count president trump's uh
fact checking if you count that
i guess that's that's tough to beat but
if you don't count that the biggest liar
in the country
isn't the adam schiff can you think of
anybody who would be worse
as an attorney general in terms of
credibility
and and who who you would trust to
decide who goes to jail
so here i am sitting in california
uh a somewhat well-known
trump supporter
and it's possible that the biggest enemy
of all trump supporters
and the biggest liar and most uh
obviously
dishonest person that you've ever known
of in
all of life might be being considered to
be the attorney general
in my state now
i have not gotten involved in any
california politics other than tweeting
some things
i have not been involved in the
the gavin newsom recall which apparently
is picking up a lot of steam i have not
been
involved in really any way in california
politics
but i gotta tell you if governor newsom
actually did this and nominated
nominated adam schiff as my attorney
general in my state
i don't think i could ignore california
anymore
i feel as though that would activate me
at which point i would have to do
everything i could
to change that situation
so uh would you like to hear the
scariest
threat that i've ever thought of
i may have told you this before but if
you ever want to really scare somebody
and they're worried about maybe what you
will or will not do
and i don't mean just in a like physical
fight situation but in a you know
a business situation or a legal
situation
the best threat that i've ever
given is this
don't get me interested that's it
don't get me interested you don't want
me to be interested in this fight
just don't get me interested
try it it's scary as hell
because if what you're talking is
basically it's thinking past the sale
if you didn't think past the sale you'd
say oh i might get into this fight
right but don't get me interested
is thinking past the outcome which is
you made a big mistake if you get me
interested just don't give me and you'll
be okay
um try it at home it works
so uh i would like to uh
i'm gonna have to call him dale dale
you all know dale he's the uh he's
lis he used to be the anti-trumper but
now he's just the anti-republican i
guess
uh dale for this uh next
item i'm going to be talking about can
you set the stage
set the stage for us yes i can
why don't you talk about the victims
there's nothing funny about this there
are victims
children talk about the victims you
monster
okay dale i will stipulate
that in the following semi-humorous
presentation that there are
real live victims real ones no joke
and they should be subject of all of our
empathy
and we should not make light of
anybody's bad situation
dale do you accept that
stipulation i'm not so sure
i'm gonna have to hear what you say then
i will decide
all right with that said
the biden administration is uh
reopening what they call overflow
facilities at the border
some overflow facilities are being
opened what would they use these
overflow facilities for
you might put unaccompanied migrant
children
that you had apprehended in these
overflow facilities
come on in in the comments people are
calling them cages
they're not cages cages
is what the trump administration did
awful
uh cages nobody likes kids in cages
these are not cages because cages
give you airflow and visibility
more of a view situation through the
cage
these are overflow facilities that means
less of a view but the same amount of
containment
i'm guessing now i would like to think
that the overflow facilities
included schools that were bilingual
uh full educational and exercise
facilities as well as medical care and i
hope that i hope that that is the case
but it's gonna be
a little cage-like in people's minds
so watch the mainstream media
turn the overflow facilities into
wonderful
first-class hotels for anybody who is
fleeing a bad situation but don't call
them cages no no no
no they are not cages
so i think all of you have been
wondering what will happen when biden
gets the same problems that trump had
how is he going to respond that's going
to be different
well i tell you what he's not doing is
immediately freeing children
they're not going free are they
so i'm waiting to see oh by now
let's see this news came out yesterday
how long does it take to travel
uh speed of light for digital things
calculating calculating
yes by today there will be pictures of
the overflow facilities
because it's big news right wouldn't you
like to see a picture of the overflow
facilities
checking checking no
photographs of the overflow facilities i
wonder why that is
it seems like it's a big news you you'd
think there'd be a photograph
i'm pretty sure i've seen photographs of
kids in cages
but let's see the overflow facilities if
you will
now i would not be surprised if the
overflows facilities
are much more inviting
situation than the cages but do you see
any problem
that the biden administration has maybe
not considered
that it doesn't matter how many overflow
facilities you build
if you make them kind and
let's say kind and useful and
comfortable will you get more refugees
or will you get fewer because it seems
to me
that if you make it easier to immigrate
and you reduce friction
you get more of them so should we not
see the biden administration
very quickly in the situation where they
either have to
release unaccompanied children which is
going to be a
child trafficking problem of immense
proportions
or do what
put them in temporary holding
facilities with chain-link
walls i don't see how biden is ever
going to avoid
just the same situation that trump was
so criticized for how do you avoid it
i don't if he does i'm gonna give him
credit
if if a year from now there are no kids
being
kept in inhumane cages but rather
they're in good facilities
and we can afford it and it doesn't
cause a spike in
immigration that becomes a new problem
i'm gonna say hey that's pretty good job
pretty good job
took care of the kids did not create a
big problem for the country that's a
good that's a good job
do you think it's going to go that way
in what world
does removing friction not create more
of the thing
in no world it's never happened in the
in the
you know the in in the historical record
has it ever happened
that if you make something easier to do
that people want
that they will do more of it has it ever
not happened
so we'll see if biden has a genius plan
or if it was all just stupid the whole
time
but in the event you could do you could
do better for the kids
all right um there's a study out saying
that the reason trump
lost the election is that the late
deciding people the people who hadn't
decided
a year ago who they were going to vote
for that they
they broke for biden and the reason
according to one
research study is that trump's handling
of the coronavirus
was not good according to the public
now if that's true
and i think that's a pretty big if that
there that the coronavirus was the thing
that
changed the election result i don't know
but let's say it's true
what what role would you assign to the
widespread news hoax that trump said
drinking bleach
was a good idea which didn't happen
but it was widely reported that trump
was a
scientific idiot for suggesting drinking
bleach
but it never happened you know he was
talking about
light as a as a disinfectant
including inserting it into the body
which was a real thing that was being
tested at the time if you didn't know
that
so and what about the way
hydroxychloroquine was treated when the
president came out in favor of it
the there was no uh no solid scientific
proof that it worked there were
lesser types of studies that did
indicate it worked
but they were not the robust kind and i
guess there were no robust studies that
ever proved it worked
as far as i know by now we would know
and so what did the
mainstream media do in treating uh
trump's suggestion that he thought it
would work
well i think that they were correct in
saying that it has not been
had not been proven in the right kind of
test so to the extent that they were
saying he was being a little too
optimistic
i think they were on on point if he was
saying i think this will work
and they were saying the science isn't
quite there
time has proven that the science is not
quite there
by now you would know right so if you've
watched my
predictions about hydroxychloroquine i
told you early on
that each month that we go by without
proving it works
really should lower your confidence that
it will ever be proven
and i kept lowering it from uh maybe
it's a 50 50 or whatever i started with
might have been higher
down to like 30 and then 20 today
less than 10 percent i would say that it
makes any difference
because we wouldn't know by now but
is that therefore a problem for the
president
and he's being anti-scientific
that's the way the news spun it but i
would say that the president was making
a
risk management decision which if it had
been wrong
we would have learned about it in a few
months because nobody would be getting
any good success
with the drug but it probably wouldn't
hurt anybody
you know the number of people who would
be hurt by that decision would be
minimal or none
and it would have been a good good thing
to try
given the number of non-perfect studies
that indicated it might work
so i think the president did a smart
thing
but not executed quite the right way
because the way he talked about it was a
little bit too optimistic
and but the way the media treated it was
completely
wrong they treated it like it was a yes
no
and that the that the experts had said
no
and trump was saying yes and therefore
he was wrong
but that's not exactly what was
happening it was more like
we don't know if it works there's not
really a downside
it's an emergency situation why not give
it a try
and then later find out it doesn't work
if that's if that's
in fact the outcome but it was still a
good try
if if we had done it and gone big with
it and it didn't work
it still would have been the right
decision in retrospect if you could look
back at it from today's
perspective it still would have been the
right thing to try
even though it looks like at this point
it probably would not have worked
so i feel as though the news has pulled
off the perfect crime
which is they painted trump as
a massive incompetent on coronavirus
and by the way my personal opinion is he
could have done a lot better on
coronavirus
i'll give i'll give you some examples of
that
but they do have the power to frame
trump for something cost him the
election according to this
study i don't know how reliable that is
but
was voting important it seems like
voting didn't matter this time
because the media told you what to think
on the only subject that
apparently mattered to the election
outcome the media told you what to think
and then people went and voted based on
that and it wasn't
a good view of what to think but it
worked
so we do live in a uh it's more like a
propagandocracy or something where our
political system doesn't depend on
voters it depends on the manipulation of
the voters
so that whoever does the best propaganda
gets to have the next president
so that's that's the system we work in a
propagandocracy
the word i just made up i think um
speaking of trump's uh performance the
fda has apparently recently said that
they're considering
dropping the reporting requirement for
home
testing apparently if you had a home
test you were required to report it
if you had a positive result and of
course that would be a problem because
if you're just testing a home you're
probably not going to report
so but now they're considering under
biden they're considering dropping that
requirement
which would allow for cheap home testing
which would allow for the end of the
pandemic how many times did you hear me
say during the trump administration
why the hell is the trump administration
not dropping this requirement
and making these rapid tests available
now i don't know it's too early to say
that the biden administration will pull
this off
but the fact that under biden the fda is
now
talking about getting rid of this
requirement which may have killed
hundreds of thousands of people
in my opinion just my opinion and the
reason i say that
is if we had rapid testing earlier
in other words if if the fda had earlier
dropped that restriction
so we could have rapid testing now we
might actually already be done with the
pandemic
so whoever died between now and
let's see last summer probably didn't
need to
because we did have the technology to
stop the pandemic
through rapid testing at home now maybe
biden will make that a possibility
and and i'm going to say that if trump
didn't get it done
and biden does and it makes a big
difference
then i would say that the voters got it
right and
and trump was not the right leader for
the corotovirus
if this happens my guess is that biden
won't pull this off
but if he does i'm going to give him
full credit
because i said from the start it was
trump's biggest mistake
and i'm not going to change that opinion
there's a new study
claiming that uh when conservatives say
that conservatives are being
more banned on social media that it's a
false accusation it's false
it is not true that conservatives are
more banned on social media did you know
that
it's a study i think it was funded by
craig
newmark of craigslist and
they found out that sure enough twitter
is just following its own rules
and that anybody who breaks the rules
gets banned
but that doesn't have anything to do
with being conservative or being
not conservative it has only to do with
who broke rules
so we're good now right everybody
everybody happy now we're all good
i seems fair to me right only only the
people who broke the rules got kicked
off of
twitter for example so no problem right
pretty happy are you
so one question you might ask is a
follow-up and tucker carlson was
doing this so i'm drafting off of
tucker's comments on this topic
uh so
so you've got this claim that uh
conservatives were not
in fact being targeted so the question
you ask is well
follow-up question i'd like a little
context
can you tell me how many conservatives
were banned from the platform
and then how many non-conservatives
because if people are being banned for
behavior
you'd probably expect that behavior to
be at least
partly spread you know not evenly maybe
perhaps not evenly but you'd expect a
good amount of
left leaning bands along with a healthy
dose of right leaning bands right
so in the study obviously it's going to
tell you how many people were banned
except that it doesn't
the only number you would want to hear
from a study of this nature is well just
tell us how many
it's about the same the same number on
the left and the right
because if that's true i'd say oh okay
that's a pretty good point
about the same number on the left as the
right doesn't look like a problem to me
but what happens when you don't try to
produce that number
it's a study about conservatives not
being banned
too much and you don't include the
number of them that have been banned
a little bit suspicious isn't it a
little bit suspicious
so this is more like the uh
the study that proves the opposite of
the study
um the the person who funded this craig
newmark
founder of uh of craigslist
um i've met him a few times actually and
he's a cool dude i like i like craig
um he is very pro uh
troops he does a lot of things for
veterans and uh
works mostly for charitable things
so uh he's getting a little uh
pushback for having funded this study
and i do think the study
falls uh short but i would say that uh
craig himself is a solid citizen he's a
good guy
and you're you should be you should be
happy that
craig newmark exists he's a positive
force
all right um but here's the problem
who at twitter gets to decide when a
rule has been violated
would it be hate speech to say um
something against uh the trans community
yes right that probably gets
you know tweaks some kind of rule so if
you're saying
anything about uh people from their
based on their
gender or sexuality or any of that
that's probably hate speech
probably hate speech and i would bet
that people on the left
and the right would equally be banned
for
that kind of speech if somebody in the
left said something
bad about trans people i imagine they
get banned
but probably don't because left-leaning
people aren't going to be saying that
kind of stuff
but what about somebody on the left who
paints all trump supporters as a white
supremacist
what about them what about maxine waters
calling for harassing
uh trump supporters now i don't think
she tweeted that necessarily but
think think about that sort of thing
that isn't that a judgment call
it's a pure judgment call to say that
one of them is hate
but it's okay to call trump supporters
white supremacist why
because it's true right that that would
be the argument
well it's not true that all trans people
are whatever was claimed
but it's certainly true that all trump
supporters are white supremacists
so you can see that it's ridiculous to
have a standard
that is subjective that's the most
subjective standard you could possibly
have
in my opinion every reference to white
supremacists
when used in the general sense as you
know against republicans or
conservatives
if you're not talking about somebody who
actually labels themselves that way
if you talk about other people just
because they share some kind of a
you know genetic or political outlook
that's hate i don't know what else it is
looks like hate to me
what about all the tweets for the people
saying we needed a list of all the
people who were pro-trump
i think creating a list of people who
were pro-trump is hate
that's how i see it so do i get to
decide what is hate speech
apparently i don't because it's some
group within
twitter i guess and other social media
so it's a ridiculous standard because
it's just purely subjective
the media is saying that
that the fisa abuse that we now know
took place
with you know carter page and the whole
collusion oaks they're saying that
while apparently nobody's going to go to
jail for it
it looks like that it was pretty bad but
that that stuff
was not a coup so the russia collusion
hoax
which was uh our own intelligence
agencies
working against the elected president of
the united states
not a coup and we know this for a fact
that that these people were working
against the elected president
trying to remove him from office based
on what they knew to be not true
that actually happened now
we're not calling that a coup
okay likewise the military in
myanmar or you could call it burma has
taken control of the government but the
biden administration
not so sure that's a coup military
takeover of the
civilian government not so sure don't
want to go so far as to call that a coup
but the viking hat guy and his selfie
army going into the capitol
totally a coup because if you bring the
viking hat and some zip ties
that's how you conquer a major military
power
with a viking hat selfies and some zip
ties
you got yourself a coup so that's what
we're actually being sold
by the propagandist in charge of your
life
amazing here's a little study
so this is was on fox news report
that there's a new analysis coming out
of some non-partisan group allegedly
at from wharton school which found that
biden's
proposal for the stimulus package would
uh stimulate in the short run but in the
long run because it would add debt
uh they say that you would reduce the
gdp
by 0.3 percent in 2040.
does that sound does sound credible to
you
do you think that the wharton school or
people from it
could actually calculate that by 2040
the effect of this specific stimulus
via debt would have a 0.3 percent
impact in 2040
no that's not a thing
you can't model that i'm not going to
say you can
model this what i'm going to when i've
been saying forever that the
climate change economic projections that
go through 2080 are ridiculous
you can't model this stuff this is
completely resistant
to any attempt to predict it now
how should you look at something that is
a
an analysis of something that can't be
analyzed basically
well it can be analyzed but it can't be
predicted with any kind of confidence
the way to look at this is not that this
will happen
the way to look at it is to simply
understand that there is
a an interplay between the amount of
debt we take on
and the gdp now it's good to know that
and it's good to know that too much debt
should
all all things being equal it should
cause a drag on your gdp
but when you're talking about you know
0.3 in 2040
we don't have that kind of precision
there will be
so many surprises between now and 2040
that it is absurd to imagine that you
can predict this
this little difference in the gdp
although 0.3 would be
you know not such a small number when
you're talking about gdp
yeah so while i'm not going to tell you
that the stimulus package is good or bad
or what
what amount it should be it is
ridiculous to imagine that you can
predict
with that kind of uh accuracy
here's my big question of the day would
you like a conspiracy theory
i know you would i know you would
i give you now my conspiracy theory
i feel like i won't be kicked off of
social media if i call it a conspiracy
theory
because it is so what follows should not
be accepted as true
what follows is speculation speculation
alone
fun speculation but speculation alone
don't go all q anon on me okay it goes
like this
why is china doing so well on the corona
virus
is it because they do more aggressive
lockdowns
it could be could be i don't believe it
i mean it doesn't my i hate to call it
common sense because common sense is an
illusion
but my judgment based on what i'm
watching is
there are a lot of people in china and
they had a pretty big infection at one
point and the people do move around
and i don't understand why they're not
deeply infected and i don't believe
that the lockdown quarantine
aggressiveness
is really what's going on there feels
like
something else is going on doesn't it it
feels like it
now you have to be careful that your
feelings
don't actually tell you anything useful
it feels like there's something going on
but i don't know that there is
and and i was asking what is it that
china uses for their
early symptoms you know the the the
people who have
mild cases but might turn into worse
cases
is there is there some way that they
treat them differently
than the united states and because i
have lots of
smart well-informed people following me
on twitter
it took all of about a minute for
somebody to produce the
official document that keeps getting
updated that tells you what china knows
about it
the virus so far and what their
protocols are for treating it
so there you go right there's the
official chinese document
they update it regularly there's a
section there about what they
used to treat it said something about
antivirals
you know being used early maybe a little
bit more in china something like that
so there you go we're good right maybe
they use a little more antivirals
but if that worked and that made a big
difference
it's right there in the document so
wouldn't we also be using it
and getting the same outcomes so it
can't be
that can't be the answer they can't the
answer can't be that the things they're
using for early
for early mild symptoms is so different
than what we're doing that they're
getting a whole different outcome
like wildly different outcome yeah i
don't think it's that
but there was one sentence in there that
caught my attention
it was a specific sentence in this china
made document saying that
hydroxychloroquine
is not recommended not recommended
a direct sentence hydroxychloroquine is
not recommended
uh with or without azithromycin
so they threw that into the sentence so
that's pretty
so that's pretty clear if you were
thinking to yourself
hey i think china is secretly using
hydroxychloroquine and not telling
anybody
well you don't have to worry about that
now because their official document
says they recommend against it so
so that must be true that they don't use
it in china
right
do you believe that here's my
uh conspiracy theory again
don't go all cue on me and believe this
i'm just saying we live in a world in
which you can't rule
things out that you would like to rule
out
you know what i would like to rule out i
would like to think i lived in a world
where i could say no china is going to
tell us the truth about this virus thing
they're not going to lie about the virus
that that's not going to happen except
we don't live in that world
we actually live in a world in which the
following conspiracy theory i'm gonna
describe could happen
completely could happen i'm
i don't have any evidence that it has so
i'm not claiming it as a fact
but here's what it would look like
suppose you created a
gain of function virus enhancement
in other words you human beings in the
laboratory hypothetically
created a change in an existing virus to
make it even
more deadly now we we hear that such
types of research is going on in labs
and various places so we should not be
surprised
if it's happening so so step number one
do you believe that
gain of function research is being done
in major labs
i feel like i do believe that even if we
don't intend to use it
i would imagine that for defensive
reasons alone we would be doing that
research
to find out what can and cannot be done
because if we find out there's nothing
you can do
to add function to a virus well then we
feel safer
we don't need a defense against that but
if our own laboratories found
out oh gee this is kind of easy to do
because we just did it
i mean we just did it so we'd have to
worry about our enemies doing it because
we can do it so the question of whether
such research happens in laboratories i
would say
wouldn't your judgment say yes
like guaranteed yes you don't know how
much of it you don't know where it's
happening but
that's got to be happening somewhere
right
number two if let's say some country
came up with a virus that had
a cheap solution a drug that could be
made
let's say easily in the country that
made the virus
gain a function but could not be as
easily available
to their enemies that'd be a good virus
wouldn't it
the ultimate virus is one where you have
the antidote
or something like it and your enemies do
not
but suppose they could also get it
suppose your enemies
had a way to get it maybe not as easily
as you because
you you make this in your own country
and maybe we don't make any of it in our
country
well we can still get it through let's
say third-party countries that
have a little extra or whatever so we
can still guess them
what would you do and again i'm not
saying this is happening
but what would you do if you were say
this country who had hypothetically made
a gain of function virus
hypothetically had a solution that you
could make as much of as you wanted in
your own country
of a cheap therapeutic let's say but you
wanted to keep
other countries let's say your rivals
from using it
to the extent that they can even get it
what would you do
well if you had control over the major
media
in other countries and you could insert
things about uh you know what to believe
and and do uh mind control of
of your rival well you would tell them
that the drug
that's working fine in your country is
dangerous
and it doesn't work at all now
could china really do that
i mean if they had a drug that that
uh was working in china could they
really convince western media
that it doesn't exist and that it's
dangerous
it doesn't exist in terms of it doesn't
really work and that is dangerous
would they have that kind of power to
actually just brainwash the united
states
yes no it's not even a close
call yes yes they have that power how do
i know
well we have a little story today in the
news
about a woman i think it was cnn covered
it a woman who
had been drawn into the q anon
conspiracy thing and what was it that
programmed her
to believe in cue after the election
this is someone who didn't even follow q
before the election
but got quickly brainwashed into
believing it and now has
unbrainwashed herself and realized she
was brainwashed
what was it that brainwashed her well
according to her story it was
she must have clicked on something a cue
content on tick tock
and then tick tock having seen her click
on
some cue content started feeding her
more
new content and she saw more of it and
she clicked more and she consumed more
and then the
algorithm fed her a little bit more the
algorithm
of tick tock according to this person
who tells
the first person story hypnotized her
into believing in cue
hypnotized her now you could say
brainwashed or mind-controlled it's all
the same thing
but tick-tock is owned by a chinese
company
which is controlled by the government
and so a chinese government app
according to this one anecdotal study
you have to be careful it's one
one example it doesn't prove the general
statement but
i feel like the generality of this is
pretty obvious
if you can program one person just by
the algorithm
feeding them more queue content in it
with a chinese app
and then she takes what she learned on
tiktok and she takes it to other social
media
looks for more q stuff their algorithms
probably do the same
feed the more q stuff in this case in an
american company case
probably not as part of some plot but
the algorithm just gives you more of
what you want
so yes the following scenario i have no
reason to believe it happened
and you should either so don't believe
that what i say next is some kind of a
truth or fact
i'm just saying we live in a world where
the following thing
could have happened easily china could
have created a gain of function
virus they could have found a cheap
available therapeutic let's say
hydroxychloroquine
just as an example i'm not saying that
it works the evidence
is against it actually
but suppose they had that suppose their
country had a not quite a monopoly but
they could make as much as they wanted
for themselves they could restrict it
from other people
and could they then also control the
media to tell you that the secret drug
that they use
doesn't work they can do that
easily every part of this is actually
completely doable as far as i can tell
now does that mean that they did that as
part of an intentional plot
to release a virus and get this outcome
i would say
probably not right probably
not i don't see china being dumb enough
to intentionally release a virus to try
to get some
long-term geopolitical gains
far more likely they were researching
and maybe seeing what they could and
could not do
and it just got out once it got out
then they would scramble to figure out
what to do about it
which might include the conspiracy
theory that i
explained but again there's no evidence
of that no evidence whatsoever
but if you heard what actual chinese
doctors prescribe
do you know i mean we have this document
put out by the government
that says what chinese doctors are
supposed to do but do you think chinese
doctors are doing that
do you think that's how they're handling
it
i don't know that we have any visibility
about what chinese doctors are
actually prescribing do we i bet not
so again um
i don't make the claim that the virus
was
intentionally engineered or that it was
intentionally released or that
hydroxychloroquine works
the evidence suggests it does not i'm
just saying we live in a world where all
that could have happened
easily amazing isn't it all of that
could have happened easily
and maybe it did i just don't have any
proof of it
all right um
let's see what else we got here going on
um
i like that on cnn with the opinion
people
that they refer to quote trump's assault
on democracy
that is such an opiniony way to describe
the current events
as an assault on on democracy
um amazing
there's a capital rioter let's call it a
rioter and not
a coup plotter uh a woman who is in the
capital apparently during those
during the attack on the capitol and uh
she asked
to to get her vacation in mexico
approved by the court
and the court said yes so she gets to go
to vacation in mexico
presumably has to come back for her
court case now she was only charged with
a misdemeanor
do you think it's reasonable that
somebody charged with a misdemeanor
would be allowed to take a vacation that
they planned and maybe even put some
money toward
i think it's completely reasonable it's
a misdemeanor is she gonna leave the
country for a misdemeanor
i don't think so but how did the social
media treat it
uh white privilege white privilege
so the idea here is that she she gets a
special treatment
for being white i don't think that's
what's going on
i'd like to think i live in a country
where a
black person who had a misdemeanor
charge and nothing else
just one misdemeanor charge could go on
vacation
i would hope we live in a country where
that could happen i think it would
but you know if people are concerned
about that it's worth calling it out
keep an eye on it let's keep an eye on
that
that's what i like to say it's like
we'll circle back
the the only thing as good as i'll
circle back on that is let's keep an eye
on that
that means absolutely nothing
um there's a talk about a space war
coming
china and russia and the u.s fighting
for control of space resources
especially mining in space and let me
tell you
if you don't think this is the biggest
problem in the world
you don't understand anything
the biggest risk to the world is the
space
because whoever controls space controls
the future
there's no way around that and if we're
not
putting everything we can into space
uh we're not really planning ahead very
well because whoever owns space
owns the world it's going that way all
right
have you seen any of uh joe biden's
executive orders i was complaining the
other day
that we don't see what his executive
orders are we just hear he's got tons of
executive orders
so cnn did actually have some good
reporting on this
uh credit to cnn they had a it was just
a little blurb it was hard to find but
it was a list of his
executive orders and you should read
them
you should read his executive orders
because the first thing you learn is
that a lot of them are just total
a lot of them are we will form a
committee
to make recommendations on the following
topic
which is sort of like nothing did you
really need an executive order to form a
committee
to give you some recommendations i don't
know maybe that's the way you do it
but i wouldn't be worried about the you
know he's not turning into a dictator
by forming a committee to make a
recommendation
on a topic so a whole bunch of them
fall into that category of they're not
really anything it's the stuff you do
if you're a big company and you know
there's something you're supposed to
address
but you don't want to do anything about
it you just form a exploration committee
so you can say yeah we're exploring it i
got a committee and everything but
you're not planning to actually do
anything
so a lot of the executive orders are a
bunch of nothing
and then there's some of them that look
like something but might be nothing
for example one of the biden executive
orders halts
construction of the border wall
by terminating the national emergency
declaration used
to fund it now if you read that without
any context you'd say oh
trump was building a border wall biden
just stopped it
but weren't we told the entire time that
trump was building his wall that really
he wasn't building much
extra wall at all that all he was doing
was repairing or upgrading
wall where it already existed and even
democrats would agree it should be there
there there's some places where you just
need a wall
and if all they did was stop
funding the upgrade of existing walls
could it be said that they terminated
the wall that wasn't being built
so some of these you really have to sort
of get under the hood a little bit
to find out that nothing is happening
because i don't believe
that in the long run that the biden
administration will halt
fixing existing walls because that was
the thing that even democrats said yeah
well you have to fix
you know the bad walls you'd like good
walls in the few places you want a wall
so i feel as if that's like a big
fake out and that uh it's true that
maybe he won't build
new wall but i'll bet he'll repair the
old ones
why wouldn't you we'll see i can be
wrong about that
then there's also the thing about trump
is reversing the trump administration's
restrictions on
u.s entry for passport holders
key phrase there for passport holders
from seven
muslim-majority countries now
let's put some context on that does it
sound as if
the trump administration was restricting
who could come in from these seven
muslim muslim-majority countries
and that biden just changed that
is that what you think when you read
that because i don't think anything
changed
because by inserting passport holders
into the executive order don't you end
up with exactly what the trump
administration was doing
because the trump administration said
the problem with these
certain countries is that they didn't
have proper documentation
you didn't actually know who you were
letting in but if there's somebody in
one of those countries who has a
proper passport wouldn't we let them in
under normal situation is it that much
of a difference
because remember a number of years have
gone by
by now are you telling me that by now
there are no
actual well-vetted passport holders
because i think that all that happened
was some of those countries got their
act together a little bit better in
terms of paperwork
so that's all we required the only thing
the trump administration asked for was
do you have good paperwork just to prove
who you are
if the biden administration is just
saying okay we're going to reverse
everything
but you also have to have good paperwork
how different is it i mean it might be
different in the sense that the trump
administration
presumably might not have allowed even
those people
within the muslim majority countries to
come in i'd say
i'd say it's not much of a change
we'll probably won't notice the
difference
uh tr biden is extending the moratorium
national moratorium on evictions and
foreclosures
i think trump might have done that right
i think trump might have done the same
thing extend the moratorium on
evictions and foreclosures
you know does that scare you not not so
much
directs the attorney general not not to
renew federal contracts with private
prisons
had you heard about that one so biden
eo says that we're not going to renew
federal contracts
with private prisons that on the surface
without knowing the details
sounds like that might be a good idea
because i think private prisons
uh maybe not the right set of incentives
because they want more prisoners not
fewer because they're a business right
so i don't know is that a good idea or a
bad idea
i could easily imagine trump doing the
same thing i don't know the details so i
don't know if it's a good idea
um here's one
uh the biden executive order charges the
director of the office of science and
technology policy
with making sure that there's scientific
integrity across
federal agencies so in other words the
we already have an office of science and
technology
so it's already exists and they're given
the
given the objective of making sure the
rest of the government is
is compatible with scientific
current scientific thinking is that a
bad thing
is anybody concerned that the government
is going to make sure that all of its
departments are compatible with science
i know that seems pretty safe seems
pretty safe to be
so of course you're going to get a green
green new deal out of that
so you know there's there's some
subjectivity about
what it is that science agrees with at
this point
but it's not the biggest problem in the
world so here's my take on this if
you're worried about all these executive
orders from biden
there's a reason you're not seeing much
reporting about it is that most of them
are
sort of empty or don't have that much
effect or
where trump would have done it or you're
just studying something
all right that might be
all i wanted to talk about today our
landlord's going to get bailed out i
have a real
i don't know about that because i i have
the same question
if you let people not be evicted and
skip rent
what happens to the landlords the
landlords just
eat it what if they have mortgages and
they can't pay their mortgage
does the bank then eat it
because that's probably where things
need to go i would say that the place
the place we should cause the most pain
would be at the banks
so long as they don't go out of business
you have to backstop them so they don't
go out of business
but i don't think you want to push the
pain onto the renter
i don't think you want to push it onto
the uh the building owner
unless they don't have a mortgage so
maybe the banks are the place to
push the pain
name three victimless crimes people are
imprisoned for
someone asks i don't know why why would
i do that
you'll never test your way out of covid
with 360 million people
yes you could and here's how if you do
regular testing
you cannot because it's too slow the
whole point with rapid testing even if
it's a little bit less
accurate is that if everybody can test
themselves every morning
you get on top of it really quickly you
get on top of it really quickly
because what you would do is you would
catch the
you catch the people who are the super
spreaders much faster
if you caught a super spreader on day
one
as opposed to day seven
it's a difference between a pandemic and
a problem it's a big difference
so yeah rapid testing if if you did
enough of it
um could actually probably shorten the
pandemic by 50
i would think uh any comment on the
hotel takeovers in washington so there's
some stories about
homeless people taking over some hotels
in washington or trying to i don't think
they've succeeded
but i feel as if that story is a local
story
and i don't see that as being some kind
of trend that's going to spread
uh and it probably has a lot to do with
the fact that hotels are empty at the
moment because of coronavirus
oh by the way many of you know that i
went on my delayed honeymoon
to french polynesia and bora bora
just as we got back i think it was
yesterday um
they closed french polynesia to travel
so we thought we were beating the system
by getting this this one trip to the one
place
that was going to allow us to travel
there but that
just shut down so i don't see how the
travel industry is going to survive
i don't see any way i think what'll
happen with restaurants and the travel
industry
is that the current owners might have to
go bankrupt
uh maybe sell their assets off for
nothing to somebody who doesn't yet have
any debt
and then somebody who has no debt might
have a chance of reviving these
businesses because they basically get
a cheap business and when the
coronavirus gets solved
if it does they have a good business
they got it for cheap
so that's one way that these businesses
could be revived but the people who own
them at the moment
i just don't know how they're going to
pay their debts and also
keep owning the businesses i don't know
how to do that
all right that is all i wanted to say
for today
i hope that the news gets more
interesting because
it's hard to look at the news without
without the trump effect
you know every day open and like ah
there's gonna be some good news here
today
but even the things that i can find to
talk about
they only make sense by still comparing
them to
what trump would have done or did do he
he's just the universal reference now
you can't get
can't get away from it all right
um hotels turn over a lot yeah hotels
are change management or change
ownership a lot that's true
um
yeah andy now has his new book out which
by the way
you should buy because uh the people who
tried to ban it
cannot win so you see something that's
going to be banned just go and buy a
copy if you can afford it
that's what i'm going to do so i bought
andy nose book
without knowing anything about it just
because he's trying they're trying to
cancel them
and i would hope you do the same
um all right that's all i got for now
and i will talk to you
later
all right youtubers
uh do not buy cp
i mean somebody says i'm addictive i
hope so
wouldn't that be great i'd be cheaper
than drugs all right that's it for now
talk to you tomorrow
