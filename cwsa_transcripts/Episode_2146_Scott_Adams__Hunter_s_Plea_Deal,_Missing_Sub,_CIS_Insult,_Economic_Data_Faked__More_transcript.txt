good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization the
best thing that's ever happened to you
it's called coffee with Scott Adams I
don't think there's a better thing you
could possibly be doing today nothing
nothing
but if you'd like to take it up to you
in a higher level I know it's hard to
imagine all you need is a cup of
margaritas
watching jug of flask of a vessel of any
kind except for a small submersible
submarine so join me now for the
dopamine the other day the thing that
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens now go
yeah yeah that's good
whoa
well do you remember
um
have I said this directly or have I not
so here's a fact check for me have I
ever told you that there's something
wrong with our the economic reporting
that what we observe doesn't seem to
match what the economic reporting is
saying
in the pundits what they predict doesn't
seem to be happening there's some kind
of weird disconnect
between the reported numbers and some
kind of reality
well it turns out that uh I'm not the
only one who thinks that
so Elon Musk was agreeing with a tweet
by Dr Benjamin Braddock who said
on Twitter the gap between economic
stats and the actual economy is wild I'm
now fully convinced that the jobs
numbers GDP calculations all of it it's
all completely fake
now that's a pretty big claim
that that America's economic data is all
faked
because we say that about China and
Russia right
don't we always say that about China and
Russia
but you think ours is pretty good right
yeah China and Russia big old liars
about the economic stuff but not us no
no not us we tell the truth all the time
but Elon Musk thinks differently he says
the numbers don't make sense something
is off kilter
do you remember me saying I didn't
understand why inflation was going down
like like how could it be
I mean I didn't really understand that
but maybe it's all fake maybe the job
numbers are fake
yeah maybe the GDP number is fake it's
possible it's all fake now unlike uh
most of you
I don't have much of a problem with it
I I know that seems like a left turn but
if there's one thing you're gonna fake
that I that I don't mind a little bit of
thinking a little bit you could go too
far is you know as I often tell you the
economy is a psychology machine
people will invest because they think
the economy is doing well
if they think it's not they won't invest
and if they stop investing everything
falls apart
so should your government
lie to you a little bit
all right it's a matter of degree should
your government lie to you a little bit
to tell you that things are going well
because that will actually make things
go well
if they told you the truth maybe you
wouldn't invest and then things wouldn't
go well
I don't know the this one if you're
trying to sort out the moral ethical
dimension of this not so obvious
is not so obvious if you tell the truth
maybe a million people starve to death
hey but you told the truth
so if I told you that if the government
took the sub told you the truth let's
say hypothetically if the government
told us the truth and it caused a
million people to die starving to death
would you be in favor of the truth in
that case go would you be favorite in
favor of the truth if you're pretty sure
a million people would die because of it
yes
she knows I see yeses
I see LOLs
LOL might be the only appropriate answer
that question I see a lot of yeses
um
so do you think that morality is
objective or subjective
and this is this is a sort of a clean
case where I think good people could be
on either side
I think you can be a perfectly good
Citizen and Patriot and be on either
side of that
right
all right well
um it's certainly a possibility that our
economic data is faked this again is one
of the
big National benefits of having Elon
Musk in the conversation
because he has an unusual weight because
he's Elon Musk he owns Twitter so the
his words have an unusual weight but he
also says things that other people don't
say
that that's like his biggest thing is
he'll go into a topic that nobody
important is really putting any weight
on and he'll just put like a whole bunch
of weight on it
and usually there are things that you
need to put weight on now I'm not saying
he's always right nobody nobody gets
that you know award for always being
right
but uh I love the fact that he
highlights issues that people weren't
you paying attention to
he's really good like that
um speaking of that
Elon Musk has now announced on Twitter
that repeated targeted harassment
against any account will cause a
harassing account to receive at minimum
temporary suspensions now that part's
not surprising or even new that if
you're harassing people on Twitter you
might get a suspension but then he goes
on because the topic he was responding
to at this topic the words CIS or
cisgender are considered slurs on this
platform
what what
where is it going with that
so it was a reply to a comment where
somebody said he was being attacked by
the trans Community uh and they were
calling him CIS sis and cisgender and I
guess there's an insult where you could
call somebody a c-i-s-s-y
never that one before
um but apparently these are being used
as insults for
heterosexual people
so now there's an insult for
heterosexual people
now apparently the medical community
uses these terms a doctor on Twitter
says that these are actually medically
approved terms CIS and cisgender which I
believe probably the updated literature
has to have all these you know different
divisions so it probably is and so I was
challenged on can they be insults if
they're just medically ordinary words to
which I say yes of course they are
the the fact that they're accurate
doesn't make them less insulting
right the n-word
I'm not even gonna I'm not even gonna
finish the sentence but there are a lot
of insulting things that are not saying
something that's a lie it's just using a
word you don't like to refer to
something we would all agree with which
is oh this person's black this person's
white this person's straight this person
is gay
so it's really just a factual statement
it's not about being inaccurate it's
just still insulting
now let me ask uh I would ask you this
question because I want to see if I'm
the only one
how long did you go
see exists all over the place in social
media CIS without finding out what it
was
how long did you go seeing it commonly
used and having no idea what it meant
I think I went two years
I think I went two years without knowing
what that meant and you know what I
didn't care enough
I I knew it would be a 10 second Google
thing right 10 seconds sis what is it ah
straight people got it
and somehow I just couldn't make myself
do it because I knew that the people
were using it
like I knew why I mean I didn't even
know what it referred to but I knew why
I knew it was some woke and I
just thought well I'm gonna I'm gonna
ignore this woke until it's
right in my face
and then here it is right in my face
so I would agree with the uh ban on that
using it as a slur
speaking of bands Texas is Banning uh
Live Sex Shows for minors
because you had to pass a law to do that
Texas needs a law
to stop giving to stop doing sex shows
to minors
oh
now
obviously the story turns completely on
how you define a sex show but what it's
talking about of course
is the uh you know the trans
entertainment that has a sexual uh
undertone or overtone or something
so but I think it's just hilarious that
that you have to pass a law to do this
like like it was it wasn't happening on
its own
oh
we we couldn't get that done
it was like it was like as a society we
couldn't figure out how to not give Live
Sex Shows to children
we just we just had to pass a law about
that
all right I'm in favor of the law by the
way I'm not against the law I just think
it's hilarious the society is so lame
you've got to pass a law to stop giving
Live Sex Shows to minors
but you know I'm sure that the trans
Community would argue that they're not
the sex shows so they'd say what sex
shows were just being us
all right
so I've been seeing that uh articles
about cities dying because the remote
workers are not coming in does that feel
like I want to just test this on you
first of all how many of you are remote
workers
can I get a get a sense remote workers
yes yes or no just the yeses
I just want to see if we've got a bunch
here because I'm going to ask you remote
workers some questions
all right we got a bunch bunch of remote
workers all right so here's my question
uh the reason given for
big buildings and cities going bankrupt
is that there's not enough people
populating them so the big companies are
going to blow
but
why do people work remotely
maybe partly to say money the commute is
unpleasant and you you know you can do
stuff at home all the obvious reasons
but let me ask you this for those of you
who are doing remote work are any of you
influenced
by crime
is crime any part of your decision for
remote work
I'm seeing some yeses and a lot of no's
okay we're seeing some yeses but maybe
mostly knows which I would expect
yeah but some some yes I I doubt it's
the biggest variable for anybody but I
just wonder if it's it's in there
so in my opinion
cities are dead but not because of
remote work
because I think you could probably find
a way to you know find some of the use
for the real estate or turn them into
residential or something but you can't
do anything
if the cities are dangerous
if people simply don't want to be in the
city it doesn't matter what you do with
your building
so
I and since I don't see any hope that
there doesn't seem to be any movement
toward fixing the cities I think you
should just get away from
any density
yeah just get away from any density
you know I uh
I don't know if anybody's ever done any
research on this or if I'm just
uh spitballing some crazy stuff but it
seems to me that the you know the the
crime and the bad stuff happens when you
put a lot of people in the same place
it's just a density thing
because you just don't see the same
crime when people are spread out
so
you know I wonder how much of that is is
the issue
all right um
president Trump had a uh let's say a uh
an awkward exchange with Brett Baer in
which Trump had said he'd like to see a
death penalty for drug dealers death
penalty for drug dealers then Brett Baer
pointed out that that would require
executing Alice Johnson the woman that
Trump famously got out of prison
you know early uh because she had a low
level
drug conviction
and uh and bear said but she'd be killed
under your plan
and apparently Trump responded huh
and that bear said as a drug dealer bear
replied and then Trump said no no no uh
oh under that it would depend on the
severity
now this is being a
is being reported as an embarrassment
for Trump
what would be the embarrassment
where's the embarrassment
he just said if they're big drug dealers
kill him if they're small drug dealers
probably the Ellis Jones types that
doesn't apply
where's the problem
now you might you might think that
nobody should be executed that would be
a reasonable take
um I'm in favor of executive I would
actually do summary executions of the
big fentanyl dealers
I think they should be killed at the
border at the time that the the
discovery is made like if you if
somebody's driving across the border and
the panels of their cars are filled with
fentanyl you should be able to put a
bullet in their head right by the side
of the road
that'd be my preference
just summary execution right at the
border
um
I might be a little biased on this topic
maybe just a little bit biased possibly
but I don't think anything else would
stop it
so if you want to stop it stop it now
I'm not talking about executing somebody
you think might have done something I'm
talking about somebody who's driving
across the border and the panels are
full of Fentanyl you should drag them
into the bushes and put a bullet in
their head or do it in front of other
people so to make you know make it a
public execution
I saw that the uh I saw a story that was
at the Taliban did their second public
execution
since they took over and I thought to
myself oh my God this is going to be so
barbaric
and I thought I I have to read about
this just to find out what terrible
world we live in
so I thought I usually don't like to
look at you know the details of horrible
stories but I thought this one I don't
know I'm going to look at the details
here's the detail of the horrible story
of the Taliban
doing a public execution
first of all it was done outside of
mosque
that's that's a bad look right
secondly it was done to somebody who was
convicted of killing five people
it was somebody who was a mass murderer
because I think he wiped out a family
and then the execution was performed by
one of the the uh the children of one of
the deceased
so the child of one of the deceased got
to put this guy in his knees and put a
bullet through his head the guy who
killed his family
and I said to myself that is so
that is so
all right I'm going to give you a pass
on that one Taliban Taliban you get a
pass on that one uh I wouldn't mind
seeing that actually
honestly if somebody wiped out my family
I would like that option I'm not joking
I mean I might I might say now
but would I like that option if somebody
had actually been convicted in court of
law there's no doubt about who did it
and they killed your family yes I would
like the option of personally putting
the bullet in their head I would love
that option and I would do it I think
pretty sure I'd do it
yeah so
I don't know
so that that story had like a little
twist to it that I wasn't expecting I
wasn't expected to go full Pro Taliban
today
but we'll just you know limit it to that
one area and I'm happy about that
uh let's see
um the courts have ruled that uh Joe
Biden can't be a giant racist I mean
he's not allowed to be he's not allowed
to be a racist because the
um
the the there's a proposed uh motion
from the government just to be huge
races
and then the federal judge said you
can't be huge racists
do you need any details on this story
the Biden Administration wanted to do
something hugely racist that nobody
would nobody would disagree by the way
there's nobody would look at it and say
it wasn't racist
because they literally have developed a
department to prevent white people from
getting stuff
it was called the minority business
development agency it was going to be a
new federal agency dedicated to helping
only certain groups
meaning not white people and white males
in particular so he actually he actually
developed tried to develop a department
within the government
for the purpose of discriminating
against one specific group
oh
what
now it seems like a small story that you
know the the Court ruled on something
blah blah blah because they always rule
on something but
it was only the court
that allowed the stop the Biden
Administration from racial
discrimination without any
I mean just right in your face
just as clear as day yeah if you're
white you can't have the stuff but
everybody else can
amazing
it's like amazing that that was ever a
question
but uh Biden can't be a big old racist
so uh China's mad because uh Biden in a
fundraiser referred to president XI as a
dictator
what else is he he's literally
isn't he like a president for life or
something
oh but that's not a dictator
president for life
totally different and then Biden is
claiming that President XI did not know
that they'd sent a spy balloon Over
America
how in the world
how in the world would buy them no or
president XI knows
how in the world would you know that
that's the most ridiculous thing to say
in public you can't possibly know what
he knows
using your mind reading technology
all right of course we have to talk
about hunters plea deal
let's see how much of this is totally
surprising and unpredictable
all right so he does his plea deal
that would keep him out of jail
by pleading to lesser charges Etc and uh
what did the people on the left say
about the deal
do the people do you think that the news
on the left said it's not necessarily a
sweetheart deal no it's not that unusual
at all do you think that happened
oh yes amazing your your psyche Powers
were correct big surprise the people on
the left thought that was reasonable
now let's see if you can get the next
one right did the people who are
politically right did they say it was a
sweetheart deal
what do you think
if you haven't seen the news take a
guess
they did they said that's a terrible
sweetheart Dale
and uh
do you think that anybody tried to turn
it racial
just take a guess did anybody try to
make this a racist story
of course they did of course they did
it's America that's what we do
so not only can this story be used to uh
to promote whatever favorite thing you
want to promote I think I'd like to talk
about racism all right
Supremacy it's all it's all over the
story
uh I think I'd like to talk about uh the
UN unfair Department of Justice
all right we got your story for you
right here
so it's the story that's is sort of like
the uh the Rorschach story
the hunter Biden story has no meaning to
any of us I mean certainly the yeah if
he really took five billion dollar
bribes that's a different thing but
that's not confirmed him
so
but his his small little crimes had no
victims have no importance to us no
importance whatsoever but they become
vehicles
to carry your own little political
message now I've told you before that
the stories the stories about public
figures they're never true
they're never true
do you think that you know enough about
that hunter story
do you think you know enough about the
hunter story
here's something you don't know
you don't know if the plea deal included
not being charged for the the bribery
stuff
isn't that a pretty big question
what what if the plea deal said we also
won't look into any other crimes
that's a pretty big
pretty big thing right now if you don't
know that
do you know anything about this story
do you feel that you can have an opinion
on that without knowing
if this covered all future crimes or was
limited to these ones that have been in
the news
pretty big story huh
I would say there are probably at least
five critical facts about this story
that you'll never know
that are deeply important to
understanding what happened
would you take that bet
five key variables you'll never know I
don't even know how to guess them that
are part of the story that who knows
it's probably about personalities and
who did what and who's related to whom
and who bribed whom and who wants a job
and it's all that stuff
you have no idea what happened in this
story except the very narrow legal
charges part
part you probably know but in terms of
what
you know what Hunter actually did
probably we don't know
yeah looks like a pocket pardon Maybe
but given that Hunter could have been
pardoned by his father what difference
does it make
I mean hunter could have just been
pardoned for the federal charges and of
course he would have
did do you think there was any chance
whatsoever
that father Biden would not have
pardoned Hunter
of course no of course not there was no
chance whatsoever it wouldn't have
happened is there any father who
wouldn't pardon their son
for a victimless crime no no I mean
maybe if it was a murderer or something
but uh
yeah so he so Hunter never had any any
risk of going to jail as long as Dad was
in charge
now let me throw a speculation into the
mix that I have not seen anybody do yet
I'm going to try to be first
and you need to tell me if I'm first
okay
speculation coming tell me if I'm the
first one
Biden was only running for reelection to
stay in an office long enough to Pardon
Hunter boom now the hunter maybe if
Hunter is actually free of all the
charges
and that would include the dad so Joe
Biden would have to feel he's also free
of all charges
that might be the key for him to drop
out of the election
boom my speculation is the only reason
Joe Biden was running was to protect his
family no other reason because he knows
that he's gone he knows he's not capable
and there's no other reason that for Joe
it was just protecting his family no
other reason and that if that's I I
don't know that they're out of the
they're out of the woods because they
still have the the bribery allegations
from Ukraine but if that got handled by
this
that's a really big if
I think he's going to drop out
now he'll probably make an excuse like
you know Health his health is not good
but it will really be about protecting
Hunter I think that's the reason that
Biden needs to stay in office
that would explain Newsome's interest
right so Newsome could also be part of
the larger plot
to not primary
Biden but to just be the one waiting
when the you know when the convention
happens I can easily see that the
convention is what installs Newsome
because they can
um what do you have to file his
paperwork
how does that work suppose Newsom had
not filed paperwork to run he could
still be nominated at the convention
is does the timing work for that
because probably you only need a few
weeks to do the paperwork and you could
do it anytime before the election
is there a deadline for paperwork before
or is it just the election day
oh it means uh so yeah that's right Dana
Perino said that
getting Hunters problems out of the way
might be the beginning of the Biden
campaign
well it is if Biden is still in trouble
with other legal risks
so he's going to definitely stay in
office long enough to Pardon himself I
would
all right
are you aware that there's a thing
called the Marco Polo report I forget
who put it together but it documents
mostly from the laptop I think
459 crimes committed by the Biden family
and their business associates
and apparently no charges coming
no charges coming
all right the people were saying that
this is uh racial
Hunters sweetheart deals some say
by the way I don't know if it is
so I heard I went to see an end to get
the other side of this because you know
everybody in the right is just saying
sweetheart deal but who knows so I saw
Eli coating is it
I hope I got his name right
so he's a a legal expert on CNN and I
have to say that he's I find him um
unusually objective
for CNN
so I was really interested in what he
had to say because if he said this looks
like a sweetheart deal I would have I
would have believed him because I would
be going against you know the narrative
there
so
but his explanation was this very rare
to have this kind of you know gun crime
and I guess it was lying on a
application but the people who have been
convicted usually had something else
going on
for example other people who were
convicted for this same kind of gun
crime might have already been felons
so if you're a felon trying to get a gun
or if you got a gun and committed a
crime well those are much higher levels
of offense than just lying on some
paperwork so
but here's the interesting thing
do you know why Hunter is not a felon
because of his other sweetheart deals
the only reason he's not a fellow is
because he hasn't been charged
so there's there's some poor black
rapper in jail uh Kodak Black I think is
his name and I don't know so he got
convicted on a gun charge got three
years I don't know why his complications
were maybe he already had a felony or
something but
but part of the part of the reason that
Biden Hunter Biden is not being treated
more harshly is that he wasn't already a
felon
but the only reason he's not already a
felon is because he's
probably been treated
you know differently
so everything about this just smells
wrong
yeah
so we've got the case of Wesley Snipes
going to jail for not paying his taxes
but hunter did not we've got Kodak Black
going to jail for some got in charge
[Music]
um
and Hunter did not however I would uh I
would caution you that those cases are
probably not the same
and that there probably is a matter of
degree
and it probably matters
so
um
but I do think this is more of a class
and power situation than a racial thing
what do you think I say it's class and
Power
and not even Democrat thing really it's
just class and power I think any anybody
with enough power
would get the same treatment
you know Republican white black just the
same power
I think so
so not a big surprise
all right um
so we actually have a have a situation
where Trump might go to jail
for not promptly sorting through his
boxes
and Hunter Biden may be part of a
criminal Syndicate that did 459 crimes
maybe allegedly
and uh no problem
that might actually happen
but
can I say this for sure the sweetheart
treatment of Hunter Biden guarantees
that Trump will not go to jail
am I right the sweetheart deal for
Hunter Biden guarantees that Trump won't
go to jail
because the right would flip out
the the country would fall apart
it's too far
too far
putting Trump in jail just you know on
its own would be too far
but if it's done in the context of
Hunter getting a sweetheart deal and
Trump not
that's not going to fly
I'm sorry this country doesn't go on
business as usual if you put Trump in
jail can I say that it won't be business
as usual
if you put Trump in jail the wheels are
coming off I don't know what happens but
the wheels are off
so
don't say you didn't see it
coming right if there's somebody trying
to jail him for this
um and again I'm not saying that he
didn't break any laws or rules or
anything like that I'm just saying it's
too far
just too far now if it turns out we
found out something new about his
documents that there were battle plans
and he sold them to Iran or some crazy
thing then of course I'll change my mind
but basically what we've heard is
no victims
and it's just Trump being Trump
so if you go to jail for that
the wheels are coming off
all right
um
so this missing sub story
you all know the submarine with the
tourists who are going to go look at the
Titanic and now the sub is missing I
think it's still missing unless that
unless they found it in the last 10
minutes
um I was having trouble talking about
this story and so I was going to ignore
it and the trouble is
that I'm I have too much of a tendency
to make jokes about stuff
and these are people who might actually
still be alive
uh might be in the worst possible
situation you could possibly be in
or might actually be you know may have
already passed and
it's just because there's a billionaire
on there and you know there's some
there's a funny story about the
diversity hires and stuff it's hard to
be to talk about this one because it's
just too sad
it's just too sad
it's also funny
that's the problem
like I can't
I can't ignore the fact that there's a
funny part of this
but I don't feel comfortable making
those jokes
at least in public privately maybe but
publicly I don't know just feels a
little a little extra for me but I will
tell you what people are talking about
they're talking about how
uh this is unfortunate the CEO of this
venture
who owns and operates the submarine uh
had said on video and of course it's
going around today that he was very
proud of the fact that they weren't
going to hire a bunch of 50 year old old
white guys with experience
because they weren't really
inspirational to people watching so he
wanted to get some young people who
didn't have qualifications and then
train them to be the operators and
specifically they would be operating the
uh a little game controller like a
little Logitech gaming controller
exactly actually literally the same ones
they would use for a video game
and
I saw a Critic talking about that and
saying
seriously
it's not wired what happens if they lose
the battery
do they lose the sub if the game
controller battery goes out like who
would use who would use a wireless
controller
for something as critical as a submarine
now I don't even know if that's true but
I did see pictures of them using
something that looks like a game
controller so maybe that part's true
now
there is no indication whatsoever that
these young people who are hired with
less experience had anything to do with
anything that went wrong all right so so
it's a very unfair story if you don't
know what went wrong it's kind of a
stretch to say it's the diversity hires
and I would say it's diversity hires
it's more like he just wanted some young
people because he was a old horny guy no
I'm not that's not true it's just baby
Amy baby was just a guy who thought his
company would be more fun if it wasn't
filled with people like him
he was like uh I think I'd like to run
my company in a way that I have some
 excuse to dire 25 year old
woman
that's what it looked like
uh Facebook is launching a competitor to
Twitter
called uh allegedly will be called
threads
and
at first I thought to myself well that's
not going to be competitive with Twitter
because the whole thing with Twitter is
that you know it's had a bunch of
upstarts trying to compete from uh what
is their parlor and getter and truth and
I think there were some more and none of
them worked because the problem is that
Twitter is just to
too much of a network effect if all if
all of your friends and enemies are on
Twitter yeah Gab it's hard to leave
Twitter you might also use the other
ones for something but it's just hard to
read leave Twitter
however Facebook has a plan that's made
me immediately go
oh
they might actually pull this off and
here's what they're doing that's unique
you can move your entire Instagram
followers over to the new platform with
a click
so you could come on to the platform
with four million followers
if that's what you had on Instagram you
just bring it over
now if the top influencers come over
with their four million followers
that's a pretty good service right under
the Chute but the question I ask is how
many Facebook products are you going to
use
right are you going to use the Facebook
and the Instagram and the threads
now of course Elon Musk points out that
that would be a disservice to free
speech if you let Zuckerberg have too
much control of too much social media
and I agree it would be a tragedy for
Twitter to be destroyed by Facebook
because then Zuckerberg owns the world
because he would own all Communications
at that point all the useful
communication which is social media
so
this one's one to watch
I'll tell you my gut feeling
my gut feeling is I have personally zero
interest in that platform
before it is even launched
zero interest
do you think that'll change
is there anybody here who says ooh you
know that's that's kind of interesting I
wouldn't mind going over there
is there anybody who's even tempted
probably probably not my audience so
much but
yeah meta bombed that's true
so here's the main thing that you need
to know about
predicting products
you can usually predict products by
based on how people feel
just how they feel
uh I've got a uh an amp that I bought
for my electric guitar and I've got
actually got two amps one of them does a
really good job and makes a good sound
but it looks like something your grandma
built it was like your grandmother
designed it or something it's not fun to
look at it's kind of brown and look and
the other one is this little Sleek uh
design that actually excites me
physically every time I see it
can you believe that I have to show it
to you it is just a little you know
rectangular box with knobs on it and
stuff but whoever designed this little
rectangular box with the knobs
did something that that I keep looking
at to try to understand it it almost
gives me goosebumps when I look at it
it's designed that's you know achieved
an artistic level because you can feel
the design you just feel it
now it's sort of like you look at some
cars I was looking at a
high a new Porsche the other day go buy
me on the road
and I hadn't seen this model before it
looked like the 2023 model or something
and I thought to myself why is that
Porsche that shape
immediately exciting
now some of you maybe have different
response but I can't look at a Porsche
without I feel it
like I just feel the design of that car
same with the uh Ford
Bronco so Ford has a new version of the
old vehicle that used there was the
Broncos they have a new one and there
are tons of them uh boy if you I was
thinking of buying some Ford stock today
because I just keep seeing Broncos all
over the place and when I see
one every time
I I have a feeling when it's driving by
me when I see the front I don't like the
backs as much but the front of the Ford
Bronco is exciting
like you can actually feel the design
it's the damnedest thing
so so if you if you go with what your
gut feels when you're exposed to a new
product that's usually a pretty that's
pretty good indicator because the the
first day that the Bronco was advertised
I actually tweeted that it was exciting
and I saw it on the road and sure enough
first exposure and it never changed it's
exciting every time you see it Great
American design best American design in
my opinion is Ford
um
however what I hear about Facebook is
going to launch something called threads
that will allow short messages what does
your body feel like
just dead
I don't feel anything at all
I don't feel anything now that would be
a bad sign but like I say the fact that
they can move you know four million
users over or whatever from
from Instagram is pretty impressive
so I mean as a business model that's
smart
and it's a big Advantage so we'll see
I would hope it does not succeed because
I wouldn't want Facebook to put Twitter
out of business
um Rasmus and ask some people about
their opinions on war with China
and turns out that 44 of likely U.S
voters believe it's likely that the
United States will go to war with China
within the next five years
so nearly half
of Voters think we're going to go to war
with China in the next five years
how many of you think so
how many of you think will go to war
with China next
next five years
bloody S's
over Taiwan primarily
all right here's my prediction
uh no
no
do you know why I say no
I don't think we're used to a country
like China
I don't think America understands China
because if you're American
you've grown up in a war a warrior
culture America is a warrior culture we
fight we attack other countries we find
reasons to leave our borders and kill
people we just can't stop leaving our
borders to kill people like that's
unfortunately that's who America is
that's who we are we're we're
Warriors we go kill stuff
what is China
now China is super tough and of course
looking out for their own good and you
know we talk about the total war concept
that they're trying to hurt their
adverse areas in any way they can
Etc that's probably all true
but you don't see China starting
physical Wars
and I don't think that's going to change
and the reason that they don't do you
know why China doesn't start physical
Wars
does anybody know
why does China not start physical Wars
because there's no good reason to
because they're a nation run by people
who have good judgment
that's it
it's a nation run by people with good
judgment
even if you hate them they have pretty
good judgments you know for what they're
trying to do for their own good Etc that
the Chinese government is largely
engineers
did you know that the uh you know the
Communist upper level people there they
tend to be trained Engineers you know
stem type people so you don't have a lot
of crazy people there
the other thing that
um one of the reasons I think that
chairman she and China were they're all
mad that Biden called him a dictator is
that I would also call them a
dictatorship but they're a modified
dictatorship and what I mean is I
believe that the ruling you know the
ruling party could remove she if they
wanted to
I think they could
I mean it would be a little bloody maybe
but I feel like they could
so
um
yeah it's an oligarchy right so at the
moment they probably all get you know
tremendous benefits from supporting him
so they probably get lots of Financial
and you know reputational benefits so of
course they support them so I'm sure he
has full support
but if he if he decided to start a war
I think that would go away right away
and I think that the Chinese ruling
party being reasonable engineering type
people would say okay explain how that's
ever going to work out well
all right when has that ever worked
uh Iraq
Afghanistan Vietnam what does it ever
worked you crave give me an example
whereas ever worked right so
that that's I think that's the kind of
attitude you get out of China
is if you can't tell me one case that
this ever ever worked don't do it
but in the United States we don't even
look at it that way
we just think we can win every war and
oh our military is awesome and we better
stop that we better fight them there
before they get over here and their
dominoes are going to fall and we've
always got some reason that we
we have to go kill people in other
countries but China doesn't
China's like um how is that good for
China
tell me again how that's good for China
so I do think that China would move on
Taiwan if they felt uh they could do it
without starting a larger War
and I think that ultimately I had to say
it in public but nobody listens to me
anyway so it's okay
I think we would let Taiwan go
if the alternative was war
I think we'd let it go
now of course you you know if I were a
larger platform you know if I were ABC
news or CNN I wouldn't say that like I
wouldn't say that out loud on a larger
platform but you know among my limited
audience here I think
we're talking among friends I'm pretty
sure we'd let Taiwan go now I don't I
mean it would be a gigantic fight within
the United States because lots of people
would would you know really disagree
with that
but we'd figure out a way and we
wouldn't have chips right it would be a
gigantic emergency in chips but if it
came to a war do you know what we'd do
we'd negotiate the chips
that's what we do in order for us to
stand down we'd probably have to say
look you're going to have to transfer a
bunch of this technology to us you know
let let Taiwan build some facilities
here in addition to the ones they have
so we don't run out of chips then maybe
we won't start a war and you can have
Taiwan it's not of our business you know
I I think if it actually came to
serious War we've just negotiated away
unfortunately very bad for Taiwan but
it's also
China's problem
you know it's China's problems and and I
have to admit I don't hate the fact
well let me say it a different way China
is smart
to be pressuring the United States and
Cuba
am I wrong
so China is creating something to trade
for Taiwan so they're trying to build
you know training bases and listening
bases and in Cuba and I think that's all
just to with us over Taiwan I don't
know that they really need those
listening stations do they I mean they
could put it they could just put a ship
12 miles off the coast and probably get
everything they want I don't think they
need the Cuban Missile you know
listening stations necessarily
um yeah they could use their balloons
so it feels to me like China is doing a
you know every button you can push
to increase the odds that they will
someday control Taiwan
uh shorter War
and I don't think there's anything that
can be gained in the United States by
having a war if we can get chips so
basically China is gonna all they have
to do is figure out a way
for the Us and other you know say
European countries not to be denied
chips
and probably we don't care after that
they take Africa I think the Chinese
investments in Africa are going to turn
out not to be the best idea
I guess you know I've read some articles
that that money seems to be wasted yeah
because they're not getting enough back
and they have access to natural
resources which is good but beyond that
it's probably not a benefit all right
um they didn't need balloons maybe not
yes so yeah the Taiwan semiconductor is
building a facility in Arizona but I
think in terms of capacity there would
be that we'd have to build a lot more
facilities
we yeah I'm seeing the suggestion here
that we should already be duplicating
every chip plant that's in Taiwan not as
easy as it looks because I'm not sure we
have the expertise in this country you'd
have to have the Taiwanese come over and
show us how to do it I think which is
sad he's sad the state for America
and then we should do it yes I mean if
they're willing to do it we should
absolutely do it
sure
yeah I think it's already happening but
I don't know if it's happening at a
scale yet
let me ask you this
uh would you agree with my statement
there's a reflection in my eye okay
here I can fix that
there you go
much better
um
would you agree with the statement that
the so-called internet dads
uh their power is rising
would you agree with that
you know specifically I'm looking at the
the Bill Ackman David sacks Elon Musk
the Mike cernovich's sometimes me
yeah and and it feels like it's a third
force and they're mostly people are
identifying with the right but I don't
think that's exactly what's going on I
think it's more like a third force not
exactly beholden to a political party
yeah
it's the daddies
it's the internet dads
all right
uh it's because they tell the truth well
I think that's part of it it's not just
that they tell the truth
it's that um
it's that they don't have an incentive
to lie that's what it is they don't have
an incentive to lie
so I don't have any incentive to lie to
you
because my my entire business model if
you can call it that
depends on credibility
so if I get one wrong that's bad for me
bad for you bad for everybody so I'm
certainly not trying to get anything
wrong I'm certainly not trying to lie to
you
because I don't have a reason to and
that would be the same with you know the
rest of the internet dads they're
they're basically the people who don't
have a reason to lie to you that's it
the the news has a reason to lie to you
social media is full of liars and trolls
and Bad characters
so if you can't depend on the news
because they're incentivized to lie
you can't believe in government because
they're incentivized to lie for their
team
but the only people who are not
incentivized to lie and also are paying
attention to things or the internet dads
it's the only group that's both
independent and paying attention and
cares that your kids do well actually
care about your kids
all right
I uh got some pushback from somebody
about my uh toughness over Fentanyl and
wanting the death penalty on that and
somebody on Twitter said
that my opinion is distorted because I
lost my stepson to Fentanyl
so therefore I could kind of be
discounted because I'm just dealing with
my own tragedy
to which I responded
I'm trying to save your kid
this isn't about the past
I don't really live in the past the the
past is over I can't I can't get a
handful of the past I just don't live in
the past I'm trying to save your
sons
mine's dead
I can't bring mine back I have no like
I'm not working through a I'm not
working through my trauma trying to save
for your son
then that would give me some meaning so
I get oh actually I guess I am working
through my trauma in a sense that if I
could save your son
that would have great meaning to me I
would give some meaning to you know my
stepson's life
so yeah there's that but it doesn't
distort me it just makes me want to work
harder to
save you or something
or your daughter
all right
um
that ladies and gentlemen is
oh
I'm looking at a comment here my niece
died yesterday from Fentanyl
I feel you
so sorry to hear that how much how much
more are we going to take
how much more of that are we going to
take
I I mean I just want to see bodies in
the street at this point I honestly just
want to see that border patrol just put
bullets in the head of anybody who has a
bag of fence and all coming across the
border
yeah so
uh Texas passed that bill what bill
we have to adjust the cause
do you wish I'd use high density instead
of cities no not really
I mean
I would get out of cities
uh why aren't we doing more it's a good
question
good questions all right ladies and
gentlemen that's all for today I'm going
to talk to you tomorrow YouTube
thanks for joining
bye for now
