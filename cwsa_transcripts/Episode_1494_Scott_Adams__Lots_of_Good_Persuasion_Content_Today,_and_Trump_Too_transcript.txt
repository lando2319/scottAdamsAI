is it my imagination or do you all look
sexier than usual
huh
um
i don't know what causes that
maybe you're uh working out
somebody says no audio
let's see if i can fix that
um i've got a problem with my technology
on one of my platforms here so
let's do this
do this
allow my microphone
how about now
yay we got a sound on two platforms
we're cooking now i'm gonna implement
the rumble platform too i think i'm all
i'll approve now
comment for the locals development team
for some reason your interface doesn't
allow me to know if i've hit the right
buttons i'll talk about that later
well what's the news lots of good things
happening here oh wait
wait
what have i forgotten
yeah
yeah
do you realize that i almost read the
news
without the simultaneous sip
crazy
days
but you need that sip and all you need
is a copper bug or a glass of tanker
jealous just like the canteen jersey
flash vessel the guy and fill it with
your favorite lid i like coffee and join
me now for the unparalleled pleasure
dopamine to the day thing makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip join me now go
all right story number one the taliban
have apparently agreed to let 200
americans and foreign workers who were
trapped at the airport out
now
what did we promise
to get them out
do you think the taliban said when we
asked hey you've got
200 americans can you let them out at
the airport
what did the taliban say
did they say oh
oh yeah we didn't even know they were
there of course let me make a phone call
we'll get them right out of there
is that how that went
or
is it possible
that our government promised them
something
that the public probably shouldn't know
about
yeah
we kind of self-blackmailed ourselves on
this situation didn't we
we put ourselves in a situation
where we blackmailed ourselves
by leaving enough people there
that we knew we'd have to pay something
i assume or agree to something in order
to
get him out of there so
i don't know
how much worse you can do as a
government
than blackmailing yourself
has anybody failed that hard in the
history of governments
hey i've got an idea
instead of blackmailing our competition
just hear me out on this
we're going to blackmail ourselves
oh just try it
you know we might get a surprising
outcome
well that didn't work out
in other big news uh jennifer aniston
is
launching some hair care
situation
i guess new new line of business or
something
and the daily mail shows pictures of her
and
it describes it this way
she's putting on a leggy display
a leggy display
now
the story of of course the point of it
was that she's uh attractive
and
she's 52 years old
is that amazing
have you seen a picture of jennifer
anderson at 52
what the hell is she doing
why like why can't other people do that
or can they
i mean how how much of that is genetic
and how much of that is technology
because i have a feeling a lot of that
is just lifestyle choices and making you
know doing the right stuff
now i would always say that's easier if
you're a famous rich movie star because
being in shape is actually your job
right if somebody paid you
a million dollars a year to go to the
gym
you'd probably go to the gym
a lot more than you do now
so you know if you're a movie star
you're basically being paid to go to the
gym
so of course she gets good results
probably as a personal chef
but i only point that out because
um you know the story about the four
minute mile
that
until the first human being
ran a mile under four minutes it was
assumed just not even possible there was
a limit of human capability but as soon
as the first person did it then the
record just fell like crazy a lot of
people did it
and
there's something in the psychology
about what's possible
and when you look at jennifer aniston at
52
and they're still doing uh like glamour
pictures of her to ever advertise her
product and the point of the pictures is
that she's sexy
that completely changes
your view
of what looking young and sexy could be
i mean if you could look like her into
your 50s
maybe it's worth trying
right how many people even try
to be good looking in their 50s
i mean seriously
who in their 50s who just has a normal
job you know you just commute to work
how many people in their 50s are saying
to themselves i'm going to work extra
hard to like really look sexy
just about nobody because you just give
up right
you just think well
even if i worked all day long i'm going
to be a 50 year old whatever i mean
there's you know there's a limit to how
good i can look but apparently there
isn't
jennifer aniston is showing you that
whatever you thought was the limit you
probably weren't even close
all right enough about that
um
fox news is dunking on its competition
by noting that they're ignoring another
big story
the story they're ignoring
is about the documents that uh
the uh
the intercept
uh published that uh suggests that fauci
lied to congress about uh nih funding
for the wuhan lab
now that's a pretty big story isn't it
even if you were going to debunk the
story it's it's a big story
and it was not covered by cnn msnbc new
york times or washington post
among others it wasn't even covered
now
personally
i don't think it's that big of a story
uh i think that the lying to congress
was more like weasel words
meaning he was just using gain of
function in a slightly different context
i guess
so i'm not sure it was a lie
so much as a corporate weaseling
persuasion thing that wasn't so cool
but
i don't know i think they did need to
fund game functions
research
so i'm not even sure it's a big deal
it's a big tragedy
but i don't know that it made a
difference that he funded it
um
united airlines is requiring
vaccinations for
all of their uh staff
but here's the twist so that i mean
that's a story enough
but the twist is this any of the united
airlines staff who
claim they don't want to get the
vaccination for religious exemptions
religious exemptions
they will not have to get the
vaccination
so that's pretty good right if you claim
a religious exemption you don't have to
get the vaccination
you also won't get paid
you also won't be working
you'll be on unpaid leave
so you won't get fired
you just won't get paid
and you won't be working
so united airlines is playing hardball i
guess they figured people were just
claiming religious exemptions to get
away from get out of it
uh but follow that story it's a pretty
big one
so biden has announced he's got a
six-pronged plan to deal with uh covet
six prongs
now some people would say i have a six
point plan
some people might say i have a plan
there are six elements
but no the biden plan has six prongs
prongs
i'll bet if you say prong ten times
the word will stop sounding like a real
word
try it at home
prong prong
prong
prong
prong
is prong even a word
prong
anyway if you watch ted lasso that's
funnier
it's a call back to one of their jokes
so federal employees must be vaccinated
in this six pronged plan so one of the
prongs
of the six prom plan
is they all got to get vaccinated we'll
see if that works seems to me that that
would lose us about 20 percent of our
federal employees
don't you think
20 of the federal employees are just
gonna
not get vaccinated i don't know what's
going to happen there
all right i've told you before that cnn
has a
one anecdote per day schedule
for anecdotal persuasion
and every single day they will run one
new story about the poor bastard who
wishes they'd gotten a vaccination
because data matters but not as much as
anecdotes
so here's today's anecdote
before she died of coven 19 she begged
tick-tock followers to get the vaccine
megan alexandra blankenballer was
waiting to get vaccinated until she had
until she had convinced her family to do
it together
so she didn't get vaccinated and she
wishes she had
every single day there'll be a new one
what was the reported weight
of
the tragic death of uh ms blankenbiller
what was her weight well it wasn't
reported
but they do have a photograph
and she's large
she she was a large large girl
now
i feel as if the news and the medical
community are just
screwing us
by not reporting
you know the the weight class of the
people who are dying
it's a big deal
and just ignoring it like that's not a
thing i mean they do report it you know
as a as a statistic and stuff every now
and then but every single day they
should report we had
300 overweight people die
and six people of
normal weight
do you know why they don't report that
because you wouldn't get vaccinated
if if you weren't overweight you
wouldn't get vaccinated so they have to
 you
let's let's just put it that way that
they have to
fool you and
and manipulate you
to get vaccinated
and so they don't want to tell you that
your risk
if you're not overweight
is not nearly the same as overweight
people
now i you know whether or not you should
get a vaccination should probably have
nothing to do with your weight but they
know that it will
i mean logically
the choice to get vaccinated probably
shouldn't depend on that
but it will i mean people will make
decisions based on stuff like that
interesting question here let me put
this to you
so see what you think about this so
here's a persuasion
subjective uh opinion i want from you
when texas introduced their new
anti-abortion law that allowed private
citizens to sue
abortion providers
did that make it more or less likely
that the governor of california
would be recalled
because the abortion is such a rallying
cry
that it might it might make people
want to make sure that they maintain
their democratic governors to maintain
abortion
now i don't think california is really
at risk
to have any kind of law like they have
in texas
we're so far away from that being a
thing in california but i don't know if
that matters
if people are afraid
they'll just vote based on their fear
and so if texas makes them afraid to
lose their abortion rights and that's
their top issue
the texas may have guaranteed
that democrats keep a majority in
congress
because the government the california
recall isn't just about the governor
if feinstein leaves office and she's not
going to last that long i mean she's a
really advanced age
if she leaves office she'll be replaced
by the governor
if it's larry elder he's going to put a
republican in there
and then you know the the balance of of
the senate changes so this is a gigantic
you know variable
and suddenly texas with their little
abortion law may have changed the entire
nature of the political equation in in
the country
now it's probably good that they did
this well before 2022 i mean it's not
that far before uh but it's gonna have a
big impact i have a feeling that the
texas abortion law
uh
could be one of the biggest variables
for the next i don't know five or ten
years of political life
we'll see but it also could be nothing
the other possibilities is just nothing
because
i live in california and if you tell me
you know i should be influenced by
something that happened in texas
i say well i hear your argument but i
just don't feel it it just feels like
it's the other side of the world
so i'm not sure people feel it in
california but if they can be made to
feel it it'll matter
did you see
greg guffeld's interview with trump i
guess it's going to be airing in three
parts started last night
it's really great i haven't watched all
of it but i've watched a number of the
clips
watch especially the clip where greg
asked trump
uh how to convince greg's wife to get
vaccinated
so you know she was born in uh in russia
and so they both joke about her big
heart to convince but you have to see
the quality of trump's answer
it's really good
have i taught you pacing and leading
right pacing and leaving
so first you have to agree
with the person you're trying to
persuade so watch when trump is asked to
persuade greg's wife
what does he say right off the bat
right he says he got the vaccination
that's that's the context we need so
that's the first thing
so trump got the vaccination
the second thing he talks about
is freedom
right because he's pacing her he's like
you got your freedom
and he's making sure that he's he's
acknowledged that completely
that's good persuasion
and that's what the the bad persuaders
are getting wrong you have to
acknowledge the other side's argument
or you're done before you start if you
can't acknowledge their argument then
they know you're not really arguing
or you're not persuading you're just you
know
talking
so trump does that
and then
watch how
gently
he gets into his reasons why she should
be considering vaccination
it's really
gently and perfectly done
he just sort of
is talking he acknowledges her side of
it he stays light he's not trying to
push anybody and then he says you know
but i think the vaccinations may have
saved millions of people
now that's not even about his wife
right
it's the same topic
but he takes it away from greg's wife
so that it's not like a personal thing
he says you know i think we save
millions of people
i don't know if that's true but it's
good persuasion
and and uh
and then there was something else he had
oh he added that if you get the
vaccination and then you get infected
your odds of having a bad outcome are
really low
and that
was the kill shot
but he got to the kill shot
while you thought he was serving you tea
and biscuits
because he had agreed with you from the
start
oh he's agreed with me personal freedom
all right all right all right yeah did
really did he did he save millions of
people with the vaccination
oh it makes you think
yeah what's he talking about now
oh
yeah
the last thing he says
so it sticks in your mind
is that the vaccination will keep you
from getting really sick or dying
now did he go after statistics and
science and stuff like that nope
because probably none of that would have
been persuasive
he is so good at this
you don't realize it until you
understand technique
once you understand technique you see
him apply it
you see him apply it
correctly time after time and yesterday
in the live stream i talked to you about
the doctors who are doing exactly the
opposite of good technique and you watch
them side by side
and then you learn the technique and you
can see the difference it's a big
difference
all right so watch the rest of uh the
gottfeld interviews there's a few more
coming up on subsequent nights
the robert e lee statue the biggest one
in the country came down in virginia
uh of course that gives us plenty to yak
about but
speaking of donald trump
uh speaking of that
um what did trump say about the statue
oh i hope i didn't not write that down
um
he said oh he said that robert e lee
if he'd been the general in afghanistan
he would have won the war in afghanistan
for the united states
i miss him so much
god i miss him
are you serious
robert e lee would have won in
afghanistan
come on
come on
that's the funniest thing anybody ever
said in public
or at least this week
because it's so provocative
it's not really serious right i mean
it's not really a serious comment
but you cannot walk away from that
comment that's not a comment you could
hear
and then think of something else right
away
you put you put that thought in
somebody's head and they have to stop
and think about it
it's just so diabolical
that the way he he takes his normal he
made he takes this totally normal topic
and he combines it with like
gasoline in matches
and he just does it so effortlessly you
know robert e lee
i think he would have won in afghanistan
people don't understand how funny he is
like if you don't get it
that that you know he's that he does
this intentionally if you don't know
it's intentional
you don't get it the the other person
who's like this
is
have you ever watched norm mcdonald
comedy
especially at these
i think he's still on a show on uh live
stream
and what one of his continuing themes he
does in his stand up and his shows is he
tells
jokes that are going to make you really
uncomfortable
and usually it's because it's it's
uncomfortably
sort of racist but it's not
and you say to yourself
i'm having a reaction to this
even though it's not racist
it's like so uncomfortably close and
that's the joke
he's making you uncomfortably close to
something that you don't want to deal
with
and then it's funny because he's just
making you uncomfortable but he's doing
it intentionally and he does it with you
know uh sexism jokes and stuff like that
you'll tell the joke and you'll think to
yourself well that's really sexist
wait a minute he's doing this
intentionally he's screwing with me oh
the joke is on me
because the joke is about how i react to
it
right so the joke is not the joke with
norm mcdonald often
the joke is what he made you think and
how you reacted to it that's the joke
right
so
trump does that too you know you don't
realize that you're you're always part
of the
the larger part of the joke it's either
on you
or at least you're laughing from the
sidelines knowing what he's up to right
i know what else is going on here
all right here's some interesting info i
got from
um
machiavelli's underbelly
for best accounts
machiavelli's underbelly so just search
for that on twitter
and he asked people uh
or he gave some statistics damn it did i
forget to write those down
uh apparently
exercising
if you are not an exerciser but you get
on an exercise program
your odds of
having a bad outcome with covid go way
down if you're a regular exerciser it's
a big difference
and so this is this issue of weight and
exercise is a big deal but where is
biden telling us to exercise
i don't know if we've ever had a better
president
for uh fitness
maybe bush jr
am i right
will you will you give me that even if
you're anti-bite and if you don't like
him as president but will you give me
that he is good role model for health
he doesn't smoke the way biden does
you don't see him going to mcdonald's
right
am i right
on that one area he's actually a really
good role model he's thin he exercises i
think he's been running up until
recently probably
well you know you're saying skinny fat i
get what you're saying but
um
yeah he's ice cream i'm not sure that's
the worst problem in the world
yeah he doesn't eat a lot of ice cream
i i don't think that's the problem
relative to you know i see ice cream as
entertainment
whereas eating at mcdonald's is a meal
so
anyway um i think biden is missing a big
play because he should telling the
country to exercise
exercise makes a big difference he's got
a six
pronged plan
i feel like he's missing a
prong
i feel like he should be a seven
prong
play and that seventh prong should be
get outside you bastards start walking
start running around maybe eat a little
less
i feel like the president should tell us
that
and just give us statistics and say
it'll
improve your odds against the
chronovirus by whatever percentage it's
a big deal
and also in machiavelli's underbelly
he tweeted this he said based on
reactions i've received
to tweeting the most up-to-date science
on exercise and weight
the stuff i just told you about as it
relates to code outcomes
he thinks that the biggest reason is
quote i've given up on life
is the reason i perceive so this just is
judgment you know it's not a survey or
anything
um but he says the more overweight
someone is the more they have given up
and the more they object to data quality
saying ah the data's
not good
um i don't fully agree with this
interpretation
uh because there's another factor going
on and i call it the
the pleasure unit
uh theory now this is my own my own
little you could call it a hypothesis if
you prefer so this is my own little
invention and it goes like this
that every human being
needs a certain minimum amount of player
in their day
or else they'll just give up
they'll just literally put a bullet in
their head
you have to have
some
pleasure every day
now what happens in the pandemic
our pleasure got taken away
right
a huge huge portions of our pleasure
just were taken from us so what do you
do
you're going to make the difference
and you're going to make up the
difference in any way you can
because if you can't find a healthy way
to get pleasure
you will find the unhealthy one
you will not
sit there without pleasure
because you'd rather be dead a day
without pleasures
you'd rather be dead literally
so you will do whatever it takes you
will do cocaine you will do heroin
you will overeat
you will drink
you'll do whatever it takes to get
enough pleasure the minimum into your
day and that's a model that
explains almost everything you see
basically
so uh when i was watching a kids stream
out of high school uh the other day i
was noticing that i don't know it could
be just confirmation bias but
they look a lot fatter than they did
last year
has anybody noticed that i mean i think
statistically is true
but if you noticed it just visually
go to the mall
or watch a high school class streaming
out of class at the end of the day
they look
visually
way fatter
now
it's a big deal i mean we're actually
killing ourselves by locking ourselves
in and taking away all our pleasure so
here's the filter to put on this say
you're the president of the united
states
and you know that people are going to
overeat if they don't have access to
pleasure
make sure they get it
make sure that they're getting enough
pleasure and whatever that takes might
might be getting rid of some mandates or
whatever but you got to make sure they
get enough pleasure
that they have the option of losing
weight
because you don't even have the option
of losing weight if it's your only
pleasure
you think you have free will
you think you have good willpower
try having
no pleasure except food then then tell
me about your willpower
it won't exist because it's an illusion
willpower is an illusion we respond to
the greatest urge
that's it
that's it that's all you need to know
about people
there's no such thing as willpower
it doesn't exist it's an illusion
you always respond to the greatest urge
so if you're not hungry and somebody
says do you want a cookie
does it require willpower to resist the
cookie
no you just weren't hungry now you're
starving you haven't eaten in three days
and somebody offers you ice cream and
you know ice cream isn't the healthiest
thing in the world
do you say no to the ice cream you
haven't eaten in three days no you eat
ice cream
even if you're allergic to it you eat
the ice cream
right it's just urges that's all we are
and when somebody can resist food and
somebody can't
just a different urge that's it no
willpower difference because willpower
doesn't exist
how you learn to eat sea rations
okay
there's a good news in fusion energy
although you should take this with a
grain of salt because there's been
periodic good news in fusion energy for
30 years and we still don't have fusion
energy but there's some new
superconducting magnets breaking
magnetic fields strength records
now
if you're predicting the next 80 years
of climate change
where do you put in your prediction
fusion
it's not in there right
you've got an 80-year prediction
of what the planet's going to be like
with your solar power and your windmills
and whatever
but nowhere in that prediction is and 30
years in we developed fusion
it's just not in there
are we going to get fusion in the next i
don't know 30 years where it would make
a difference
yeah probably
let me tell you this uh what one of the
smartest people in the
technology field
told me five years ago about fusion
because he was he was a billionaire and
still is a billionaire so he's a
billionaire genius
uh i won't give you the name because
that would just
you know
you'd be thinking about the person
instead of the point
and the person
said that
fusion energy
is now just an engineering problem
now
if you're not an engineer or a scientist
that doesn't mean much to you but let me
explain
if it's a scientific problem it means we
literally don't know how to do it like
the math doesn't work
if it's a scientific problem it means
that no matter what you do
you're going to use more energy than you
produce
that's a scientific problem and
therefore you just can't you just can't
do it it's impossible
but
the scientific problem is solved
which is a big deal
it's like a really big deal
and let me put this in terms that some
of you will understand
and some of you may not appreciate
it's an engineering problem now
goosebumps
did you get goosebumps
fusion is one of the most you know long
sought
impossible sounding goals of all time
it's now
an engineering problem
let me tell you what that means
it means it will be solved
when you when something is reduced to an
engineering problem
it basically guarantees it's going to be
solved
because engineering is trial and error
trial and error
you know experiment till you get there
and you know how to do that we know how
to experiment until we get there
we didn't necessarily know how to invent
it in the first place but apparently
that's solved
we just have to engineer it
making you know god-awfully powerful
magnets that we've never made before an
engineering problem not really so much
to science well maybe there's some
science in there too so
this is this is one of those stories
that you could just totally miss you
know you're just looking at the
headlines oh a fusion i heard that a
million times
but
there is some possibility
it's the biggest news in the world
because if fusion ever became a reality
the entire energy uh model of the the
world changes permanently
it never goes back
right
oil is dead
if fusion works well i don't know that's
that's a exaggeration but
in the long run it would be dead
so look for that because that's
gigantic
all right let's talk about uh a dog that
is not barking same same topic
do you remember
when it was common to see groups in the
streets protesting nuclear energy
most of you are old enough to remember
that right you've seen protests against
nuclear power not just nuclear bombs
but nuclear power
where are they
where where is the person going on
television to tell you nuclear power is
a problem
they stopped
there aren't any
do you know why nobody is going on
television to tell you nuclear power is
a bad idea
because nobody's smart thinks it's a bad
idea anymore nobody
nobody's left on the other side
but
if you'd made your job for the last 20
years in the media of saying bad things
about nuclear energy
can you just change and just put people
on say oh well turns out that it's safe
now a lot of it is because time has
passed and we know how to do things more
safely we're smarter about storing the
storing the waste they just store it on
site now which is the obvious thing to
do
um you know because it's already a
nuclear power plant
right
so the question of do you
want to live near a nuclear power plant
is sort of already salt so they just
store the nuclear waste
next to the power plant
it turns out it was sort of obvious
because it's the one place that
you know what else were you going to do
with it
just use part of the parking lot and
turn it into your storage area you're
done
there are other ways to take care of the
waste for example generation four
nuclear power plants will burn it for
fuel
so you can take all of that waste and
just repurpose it for fuel for the newer
generation of nuclear reactors
so here's my point we didn't notice
because it happened gradually
that all of the opponents for nuclear
power stopped talking in public they'll
still talk privately
but as soon as you tell them that their
information is out of date
they'll walk away and change their
opinion because people's opinions
against nuclear energy are really data
related you know the data says it's
unsafe the you know whatever
but
once you show them that current data
makes it obviously the thing you need to
do
um it's a different story
all right
so
so i don't know why but
nobody wants to talk about the fact that
nuclear energy is now liked by the left
and the right biden likes it biden's pro
nuclear he just doesn't make a big
enough deal of it in my opinion
well china has threatened to send a
warship to our coastal waters because
apparently we sent a warship within 12
miles
of one of their artificial islands
made in the south china sea
now if china sends a warship to our
coastal waters
should we sink the first one
should we just sink it
probably not
probably a bad idea
um
because then you know they'd feel like
they had to sink one of ours in the
south china sea right they'd sort of
have to
retaliate
but
i don't know
i feel like we should at least consider
sinking it
just consider it
somebody says hit it but don't sink it
yeah that would be smarter i guess
uh
i'd have to think about that so let me
say let me just say this out loud
china i know you're listening
as a citizen
i don't know if i would fault my
government if we took out your worship
if it entered our coastal waters i don't
know that i would fault them even if
there was a pretty big blowback
i feel like i feel like i might be okay
with that
so if you want to send your warship
just tell your sailors
some of them aren't coming back
just let them know
um so these are three things that china
has ruined in 2021
these are three things that used to be
okay
but now they've ruined them
breathing
breathing
yeah we can't breathe anymore because
we'll breathe in the coronavirus
um and of course pollution
uh the ocean the ocean is no longer safe
because they're they're going to start a
war in the ocean and make the south
china sea
too dangerous to navigate so the ocean
forget about that
and commerce
commerce isn't safe because they're
going to steal your ip
and
they're going to do bad trade deals with
you
so
if you liked any of these things
breathing the ocean
economics commerce if you liked any of
that
china's not your friend
cider's not your friend
now as you know china has some big
problems coming
they might know about some of them
they definitely don't know about all of
them i can promise you that
but they have some big
big problems coming
so
to anybody in china
you better think twice about your form
of government
because your form of government is
taking you off the edge
you're going off the cliff
now it isn't up to me to tell you in
china how to run your government
but it's taking you off the cliff and if
you like that
keep going if you don't like that
maybe you might want to think of a
change
i'd also like to reiterate that the us
has every right to kill your fentanyl
dealers in chinese lands
right right in their house
and i encourage our government to do
exactly that as soon as possible i want
to see bodies hitting the ground
fentanyl dealers the big ones i'm not
talking about a street dealer but the
big ones in china that are sending the
you know the massive amount of
precursors to
the cartels
we need to kill them in place
kill them where they are right we gave
china a chance to handle it
did we not we gave them the names of the
dealer
i'm sure they have their address
they know the names the face
they know exactly who it is we told them
who their dealer was
and they decided not to do anything
about it apparently
now we have every right to kill that
dealer in place
right in front of their family if we
want anything
there is no moral ethical or legal
restriction anymore that i recognize
against killing those dealers in place
in china gotta do it
and i know the first time you hear that
is so shocking you say uh that's world
war iii
you can't do that
no you can
you can we can kill them in place and we
have to do that
all right that's it for today
and
i hope you enjoyed
this episode i'm gonna do a little
testing on the rumble platform see if we
can get that up and yes i have to go do
some driving
and i will talk to you oh did you like
today's live stream
i saw some complaints as i was talking
oh good
good good uh larry elder you're asking
about larry elder well
i did hear he had a little uh some issue
uh at an event or some protester there
or something
or there was a racist protester
you know
when i see somebody uh
protesting larry elder i guess they were
dressed in a gorilla
costume and were doing racist things
i'm not so sure that was an anti-larry
elder protester are you
because would that hurt him or help him
to know that he was being treated poorly
by racists in california
i don't know it's hard for me to imagine
that whoever put on the gorilla outfit
uh thought that this would hurt larry
elder
because it doesn't
he he's pretty anti-fragile if you know
what i mean
anti-fragile in the sense that uh
if you if you go after him
all it does is give him attention
and the attacks don't seem to be you
know having any effect
so the more they go after him i just
think he raises his profile it makes him
look like the leader makes people think
why do i want to vote for the person who
has one percent support when i can do
the one that might actually win
you know
uh i think it works in his favor
alright that's all i had to do for today
and i will talk to you all tomorrow
