[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called cwsa coffee with Scott Adams it's
the best thing that ever happened to you
if you would like your experience now
streaming on multiple platforms I think
Rumble is working today we've got uh the
X platform and YouTube and locals for my
beloved
subscribers and here's what you need to
take this experience up to levels which
you couldn't even imagine were possible
all you need is a c marker glass a
tanker CH a canteen Jugger flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparallel pleasure of
the dop of head of the day the thing
that makes everything better it's called
the simultaneous sip it happens now
go pretty
good yeah sometimes those sips aren't
perfect but that was pretty good well
here's the good news I found a movie
that I can
watch Wow have you noticed that all
movies
suck well it turns out that there is
still one person making good movies and
I've said it before Tom Cruz
why is it that Tom Cruz is the only
person who knows how to make a
movie I was just watching the latest
Mission Impossible just came out on live
stream
and it it is screamingly
unwoke without being bad in any way in
other words you don't really you know
pick up on the wokeness or anti-
wokeness of anything you just watch the
movie it it is so not heavy-handed in
the
wokeness that it just feels like a movie
from yesterday or something and and the
other thing that Tom Cruz does right and
I have to think it's him I feels like
more him than even his directors they
are so well
edited he doesn't have any moment in the
movie where you're like Fast Forward
fast forward it's like every every
moment totally belongs in the movie It's
very rare so check it out what might not
be the best movie you've ever seen but
it's all very watchable so
for well today I'd like to give you uh
another statement from science now
here's something that you've heard
probably you've heard this before from
uh marriage experts mostly divorce
experts I think you've heard it from
Jordan Peterson and I just heard it from
some other relationship expert on on
Instagram don't remember his name but he
was saying that uh the most predictive
variable for divorce do you know what it
is what what is the one thing you look
for that's most predictive of divorce
that's right contempt yeah yeah money is
one of the biggest problems but if
you're going to predict divorce it's
contempt so the first time I heard that
it was it was years ago and I said to
myself holy cow wow that's like that's
like opening up like this whole uh
understanding my my awareness has been
maximized now I know exactly what to
look for not only if I'm in a
relationship but other people and I can
totally predict what's going to happen
and I thought why why didn't I know that
before that contempt predicts
divorce because it's backwards
science
backwards
science let me let me just reward this
all right so the experts are telling us
and sounding very smart when they do it
that if you see
contempt that predicts divorce
huh
so when one or both of the people who
are married to each
other uh started thinking the other was
as a and they can't
stand a moment in the same
room that well I didn't see this coming
but that actually predicts
divorce
wow can you believe it that people who
don't like each other while married are
more likely to divorce than people who
like each other where where did that
come from it's like it came out of
nowhere why why did I think that was
profound for
years for years I thought that was
telling me something
useful so people who don't like each
other are less likely to stay
together why did that sound profound
until today today for the first time I
heard it and I thought well that's
obviously backwards you know what's the
better way to say
that people who have already decided to
divorce treat each other like
dicks it's backward
science it's not predicting it's already
happened there's no pred thing going on
all
right uh very important story we still
don't have in America here uh we have
not elected a speaker of the
house and the problems are mounting for
example okay next
story uh Elon Musk is trying to kill
newspapers uh he did a couple of things
in that direction uh this week so
so uh he he posted this on the X he said
the articles printed in newspapers are
quite literally yesterday's
news the newspapers are literally
yesterday's news and I thought to
myself well if it's printed yes I mean
they can do a little bit better online
because they're usually online as well
but it is a good
cut but I had to correct him I don't
like to correct Elon Musk as is usually
you know pretty spot on I usually agree
with him but here I think uh his his
statement is incomplete you know he said
articles printed in newspapers are quite
literally yesterday's news and I had to
correct them because I said the
Washington Post is not yesterday's
news The Washington Post is yesterday's
fake
news and that's
different So speaking of uh billionaires
and newspapers
um I saw a tweet today that it was so
exactly what I've been thinking that it
just blew my mind so on the xplatform
rod laoren posted I wonder if Jeff Bezos
is embarrassed by Washington posts
incessant lying or does he endorse it or
not realize
it and I thought to myself I spent a
full hour
yesterday wondering about that
you know I don't spend all of my time
thinking about the Roman Empire
sometimes I think about Jeff
Bezos and I swear to God I I was working
out and I was just obsessed by that
question does Jeff
Bezos know what the Washington Post does
I mean how could he
not on the other hand does he approve of
it or is it you know does he see it as a
problem
also what what's going on and the
my best hypothesis is that he's he's
under
duress that he's being forced to own it
for the benefit of some government
entity that has some some power over him
either because they they can buy
billions of dollars worth of server time
on Amazon servers which the CIA has or
maybe they control whether he can
operate you know as freely as he wants
in different markets
maybe gives him some protection there I
don't know you could you can imagine a
number of government entities having
some power over Amazon and therefore
over a Bezos but there there's such a
disconnect between what we know about
Bezos and his ownership of the
Washington Post would you agree what we
know about Bezos from everything except
the Washington Post I would describe him
as
non-political and a a
pragmatist meaning that I don't even
know if he leans left or right I
couldn't tell
you which is remarkable really and what
I mean by that is he probably decides on
each issue
individually which is what super smart
people
do so it wouldn't surprise me now I'm
sure he identifies with one side or
another probably more Democrat than
Republican just a guess but probably
obsessed with you know more more looking
at each each individual thing because
it'll be some the Democrats like he
likes some things they like that would
be bad for business so he's he probably
picks and
chooses but why why would he put a
reputation thing on his businessing the
Washington impos because has an amazing
reputation in my opinion they do soft
Ware than anybody's everever done it I
mean I could not be moreon without
Amazon as a technology works the fact
that you don't think it every day like
some problem because of it tell you how
amazing it is I mean my God the
complexity of that and then that it
actually delivers me stuff off the night
I'm just blown away away every
day so I think he's underdressed but
that's
just all speaking of
speculation in billionaires did you see
the the news yesterday that P teal is uh
has been an FBI informant for for
years it wasn't the
biggest but it was was all over the
Internet so so is confirmed it's
confirmed from the FBI hand Handler
himself which is pretty good good I
think the Handler's retired or something
but said oh yeah one of mine now uh just
so you don't get tooo excited about it
the
the is that he was an inform forment
strictly for international foreign stuff
which I don't mind too much do you if
he's FBI
for specifically excluding stuff he was
excluded for talking about Trump
domestic Pol politics just an informant
if you if you learn something other
country that was to the
US
ition or
observation how could could anybody who
who's a buire not be talking
Tobi or maybe maybe other intelligence
groups I think it's
un you don't you don't think that that
entities approached Elon
Musk it's impossible to imagine it
hasn't happened impossible to
imagine now that doesn't agreed to to do
thing you know with doesn't mean not if
I were a billionaire the way handle it
is I would with the government when it
made
sense and I would resist it when when it
didn't mix or it violated some you know
moral ethical boundary that's what's
happening every billionaire who has any
influence or
anything somebody like some like Elon
I feel like government has one pocket
which doesn't mean they trolling him it
could be an in play where we're always
looking for their own benefits but don't
be naive imagine that we have you know
important influ billionaires who are
dealing with other countries China in
particular and and that not being talked
to by the government of course they are
how much impact has on each issue
individually well awami said something
that I agree with completely
U post it's not 980 anymore which Great
Frame by the way he says not anymore the
real threat free speech today the
government using a combination of carot
and sex to get private companies just to
censor speech that the government cannot
censor
directly he says if it State action in
Disguise the Constitution still applies
oh that rhymes if it State action Inu
the Constitution still applies period I
didn't realize he had a rhyme there I
think that was accidental but very good
um this this precisely my point of view
precisely that uh in fact You' probably
probably seen me say that that was an
argument in in the 80s have you have you
say that online I say the same thing
it's a good the
80s and the reason is that if if you
don't if you don't uh
uh pay somebody you're never going to
change the mind so if somebody somebody
says blah blah blah speech the
government not do it's private company
so it's say the correct answer is you're
absolutely right in the
80s that's what because if if you don't
don't get them
that they a proper view you a well
constructed opinion it just doesn't
apply anymore that something that that's
a much gentler way to say wrong totally
right right
until and then things change now you
should assess it very very good
persuasion all right how many of you
have
heard and let me say let me make this
statement speech is gone
there there's not free speech spech
United States I don't know if any
country has it but we definitely
definitely have it and I'm getting more
and more more pissed when I hear people
say we do because it's going Beyond just
a thing we disagree about you know
whether the has been met something it's
not really just
words it's like it's like you're part of
the problem don't know this free free
speech is
on don't be be part of the problem
know if there is a solution but if
you're acting like you still have free
speech you only only the freedom to be
uning to the the government that's
that's it the moment you're in or you
can make a different difference people
to you you're your speech is gone G as
as a practical matter now I'd like the
the NPC to take a moment to say but
Scott Constitution applies government
not too
private you missed all PCS miss all
Point um have you heard an entity called
News Guard how many have heard of this
News News
Guard so apparently it's some EU
organization you know
[Music]
volunteers who are are in the business
of uh
censoring
people and it turned that one of the of
the people on that organization of
looking censor people is uh Jim Jimmy
Wells one of the founders of
Wikipedia are you comfortable with
that are you comfortable with Jimmy
Wales Wikipedia guy being on a
censorship
board
um I I would to give you my
Insider view here now normally I would
not tell you about a private
conversation so I'm not going to give
you any details but I have had had set
private priv with Jimmy Wales about the
information on wiia and some other other
stuff I was just because they were like
19 20
2020 we had some extensive back back and
fors so one of them was about
the
and I I brought his attention hey
Wikipedia that to find find people HS
the real thing and needs to be fixed
it's like the biggest problems in the
country they fix it now now to his
credit he looked at my information the
transcript what was reported different
and he to it actually dug into uh dug
into the conversation that was
Ono and back to me he said
uh it looked like like the people who
were sort of fighting it out for
Supremacy had all the right
arguments meaning he didn't didn't know
how it was going to end up but the but
the was working there there were people
were questioning the narrative loud
enough so so that people were hearing
them they were showing their work right
transparency involved and so his
um his uh summary was that that would
work out now as I looked at wik imately
to see if the people hoax is covered
correctly because you know you know some
get there there'll drift off back and
dri drift off so
I but um so here's what to support Jimmy
whale in my
conversations he was very interested in
getting it
right that that was my take that he
actually just wanted to get it right so
I didn't I didn't see you know I can see
bias for sure so there was no no
question why he leaned politically but
he was was fully engaged in listening to
the argument and making sure the system
included the the counter argument and
then let this do what the system was
going so wouldn't I wouldn't hate on him
too hard I do think that a lot of good
good people dragged into the into the
world of censorship um and don't
realize don't realize implications of
what could go wrong I think they number
just trying to make the
information
but I put that out there
and would you let me ask you ask you do
do you think suburbs are less safe since
Trump wasn't
this seems like like a delated question
but let me ask the question your sense
are the suburbs
safe because one of the conversations I
had with Jimmy was he wasn't wasn't he
and I don't I don't think he find this
because question was completely
reasonable this is nothing about
him round 2020 Trump said said in a
tweet that uh if got elected
the suburbs you know start getting
dangerous I
retweeted and had already had had a
number of conversations with with Jimmy
Wales so he was curious and I just
reminding myself looked at our uh pcast
conversation morning and he was curious
if I really believe believe that because
I'd retweet tweeted it did I really
believe that if Biden got elected
suburbs would become
less and I answer that it was was a
reasonable it was a reasonable
prediction even if purpose of the
prediction would prevent it your
prediction have two purposes um and you
should probably when I make predicts
some of my predictions are just get it
right just seeing if you can predict so
so some of it out is it possible to even
know what's going to happen and we do a
refund I predict this then you get to
compare it
but I'm G to turn off the uh the speed
if you stop if if you stop Bing about
the sound now the locals I've already
them but I don't want to seem like a but
I can't can't do the sh if if every
 minute you're you're complaining
about the sound so stop stop watching
the platform you're watching if if the
sound is sufficient you can watch it on
YouTu rumble or the XX platform live or
you go to
scotts.com and at the moment moment um
it's unlock for nonsubscribers
but could you please shut the the
up about this sound can you do that for
me because this is live if if you yell
at me all day day long comments while
I'm live I can't do this it's not
possible just I just have to turn
you do you think you can settle down a
little bit there always a few people in
the Spectrum who just can't stop I have
to have to give them a little bit of
social programm so socially you
shouldn't be doing it right technical
problem problem is social problem so
come the
that
um
anyway think the uh do think subur a
little more
dangerous um let's let's talk Sydney
Powell so as you know Sydney Powell
Kraken was coming coming find out some
issues about election which out no K
found yet um but had bunch of felonies
were dropped he had to plead guilty to
sick misdemeanors that small fines and
didn't seem to be any think that would
affect her too much had to make it aoll
or something no big
deals um but then she she also agreed to
to testify honestly uh in the
RICO case against Trump that um CH him
with allegedly a conspiracy to take over
the government now how do you think this
is being reported on the left and the
right complet completely right just
completely different the left and and
right
so the left is is Ming to it I mean I
swear to God God I think people wereing
with one hand and it was
like Syne Sy she's gonna talk she's
Gump it was like was actually cre maybe
not as creepy as
my my account but it was it was creepy
like it actually made me feel feel dirty
watch watching people uh and it and it
was poor because there no doubt about it
they're getting a dope dop from the that
that Trump could be hurt and they're
getting pleasure it's weird but here's
the weird as why are they getting any
pleasure from that what makes them think
that's going to go go their way their
their is that it's obvious that Trump
was obvious he colluded to overthrow the
government and and for if if it's
obvious he's guilty say the left all you
need is one person who says they they'll
tell the truth who's also an Insider and
boom Trump go to jail problem soled
right not sure that's the going to
go I don't think that's that's
TR if I had
to put a pretty healthy on the she's
going to destroy prosecu
recase saying she that she was there and
saw every part of it and and at no did
anything legal
happen that's what I think because
remember she did did not say she testify
quote against Trump that's that's the
news she agreed to tell the truth she
testified is that actually a compromise
let me see famous
attorney and might have to testy do you
think that that might try to tell tell
the
truth I've got a feeling that if a
famous attorney isn't going to do a lot
of
lying you know on the witness CH chair
are they does that happen a lot I don't
see how that could possibly be good
for
so uh this is one of those situations
both sides a little dop
dopamine when I heard I said to myself
oh uh basically the Char charge against
one of the main players have now SE
 the felonies were all
dropped words they were probably
bullshitty anyway and then then she gets
to
talk I'm very interested in what has to
say so I think I told you that
conversation with my who I who I call
Democrat
friend he's he smart because went to to
a school attention to the the news
serious person right so you're any any
kind of conversation with him about
anything serious he's GNA bring Goods
like he's paid attention he's got an
argument he's gonna he's whip
it uh he
believes I
think that uh Trump's advisers or or
AIDS have testified Trump knew knew had
lost the election but was do his protest
protest anyway and trying trying to over
the country now when I when I heard that
I myself is that possible is it possible
I miss that
story was there a story in the news in
which there was was somebody who was in
the room who's claiming that that Trump
said oh I know I lost fair and square
but I'm going to going to pretend I
didn't because I'll overthrow country
and I said to myself how would I miss
that
story and so I I I Googled what I could
think of to Google and there is is no
story left I mean obviously if such a
story exist exist would be at the top of
the the feet
right that's search works if it's an
Trump it's going to be be the first
there was nothing like
it there were were things around around
it for example there were St that said
that Trump's advisor leave the fair and
they told him
so somehow I think that mored into he
knew it wasn't he knew knew it was
fair why would Trump suddenly believing
his his advisers on something something
the couldn't possibly know one way or
the other how could they
know doesn't even make sense and then it
goes further to that that Trump knew he
lost now I don't know what Trump said or
didn't say to any any people at the time
do know this nobody could have known if
they won or lost it it wasn't no
all right right you only know what
people people told you I know that the
experts said the election was was fair I
do it did you did you do you remember
Rec the B
yourself the only thing we know what
people tell tell us and what people tell
tell us
reliable or
unreliable a multiple choice question or
both both it's unreliable anything that
comes from humans is sketched
out so
so think about think about the level of
tdds you would have to have imagine that
you could read the president's mind and
that somehow he he could minds of all
people with the the so it's like a dou
reading thing first must that Trump can
read the minds of all all the people in
the election elections in to know that
they had pure thoughts and nothing wrong
if you couldn't read their minds you
would have no way of KN
knowing if somebody found a way way that
wasn't picked up I would you know the
only person who would know was who did
it probably so he would have to read
their mind and know that none of them
existed and then we would have to read
Trump's mind to know that
Minds How Deeply broken broken does you
have to be to believe in double mind one
read all the the mind all the people who
ran the election everywhere and also we
can read his mind and see that he he
read the
minds that's actually the clay I mean if
you work it out that's what it'll be
it's amazing that
smart are not immune from
persuasion one thing I I can teach you
that you really really need to
understand intelligence does not protect
you from
 and in fact there are people
who say the intelligent are more easily
fooled because more confident in their
opinions that comes being smart the
smart people were say I looked at all
all the and
this is what it is the less smart people
say I looked at the evidence I could
find but they probably fool me so to
know for
sure right so the people who don't know
much much will qu often right
answer all right uh B did his little
last night two mixed
reviews uh BR thought it were to force
abuse his words words he said quote
after the speech on Fox I think it may
remembered as one one of the best if not
the best speeches of his pres he he was
firm he was une
une he was was strong as he he has been
particularly in Rec days before he went
to Israel and while he was over
there so really really kind of a hero
hero in a way the leadership we've been
waiting for as what
I uh not everybody Dana Pino on the on
the show at the same time and thought he
was bouncing around from Ukraine to is
Israel to Taiwan and it was a little bit
disjointed other people said he one of
the the instructions on the the uh
teleprompter that was not to be read so
there was one one part the said make it
clear I think I think it was talking to
him not something he was supposed
supposed to read so so he just make it
clear in the middle of his
sentence now I don't know you that's
that's something you could see Joe B
Biden doing when he was
50 I don't know that that's actly did
men men you but maybe who knows
and
um
the the part that made me
disgusted that he said that that
for to help is and also Ukraine first of
all the fact that he tied the two
together so that nobody can say no to
all of it as long as as long as he says
that the is one p package you would have
to say either no to Ukraine funding or
no to you Israel funding and there's
probably nobody in Congress who can say
to both that maybe you know a few few
Rogues so got this trick to figure out
how to through the
American using
procedure but they're doing doing in
front of
[Music]
us because you might have a different
different fing Ukraine Ukraine then you
might have funding isra Israel and
instead of letting the public decide on
them individually he's together and use
a procedure available to him to make it
say no watching my my president screw me
public and ask for Applause is not
comfortable me no you
make them two separate separate things
and vote independ depending don't don't
me and then tell me you're doing it and
act like I should be F saluting you no
you should you should lose for that you
should Beed immediately for these two
funding requests together together
that's what he's doing doing yeah so to
me it was a disaster but the chil part
was where count very specific the number
of defense or let's say say Munitions
makers in the United States make a lot
of money M because
deal there's nothing wanted he less than
that
nothing I want to hear less than he was
going to take money and transferer
Munitions makers no I get I have to do
that now and then then it's unpreceded
thing but but the fact you would call
call it out and then name the theit it's
like oh in Pennsylvania you got this
thing I thought that was gross and
disgusting and I was embarrassed
by I'm not really by much but you get
the point and I asked myself as much as
is famous for turning any political
issue issue into a real state or a
business um frame which I kind of like
you know I like he's looking
at nor if he sees it as part part State
question and and stuff because it gives
gives them the variables that other
people have access to us too so but I
don't think that Trump would have asked
for Mone for two Wars
and told told you it would have been
profitable for the
makers I don't see it I do do not see it
now it's possible he does like I say he
talks about business terms about
everything but I don't think you would
have that bad judgment that feels like
just terrible terrible judgment for
selling sing the because he's selling
he's not selling economics when he's
selling War he literally told us the
world would be
profitable to people who are not
me Scott I will take your money but
don't worry it'll be profitable for
these other companies but but they're
Americans so hey that's not really good
enough not
enough and um I saw I think Mark Warner
said that that of the shows that maybe
talking to Brett Bear or some he said if
you don't don't understand why maybe
this why why Ukraine is this important
to tyon you don't understand geopolitics
other words he said said if we let
Ukraine fall China would see his
weakness that's the implication and go
go after Taiwan let me that
hypoth how many of you think that the
only thing stopping China from taking
Taiwan on was what happens in
Ukraine because you know it's been
decades and decades where China had had
a question about Taiwan and never wants
Ukraine part part of conversation and
yet and yet yet it's the same situation
so now you had Ukraine and you really
think that if we pull our military sport
away away from Ukraine would give us
greater military capabilities for other
things
that that's the point that they ha once
we stopped wasting our money or else we
attack ATT that they that they Tred to
make then that doesn't make any sense to
me to
me and and I thought looked
hypnotized because he said it like it's
so so obvious right in front of you that
if you don't see it you're some kind of
like Pol political idiot and I'm looking
right at it and I'm say I'm say who who
world thinks like that that Decades of
having Ukraine part of the but as
Ukraine gets in here here that's the key
V variable the only thing that
matters that doesn't even
sound it doesn't even sound a little bit
credible now now I
point but I just can't imagine saying
that's the very we'll just wait for for
that and then we no I don't see
it also also don't think that um
companies or country countries are
geographically
disadvantaged as much as Tai
Taiwan I think they always end up with
the man don't they you just you just 100
years or 200 years but sooner or later
they're going to be the country
and I hate to say because I'm very Pro
is Israel how could Israel survive in
the long
run I mean seriously how's that possible
in the long like in the in the 200 years
long run how is it even
possible yeah it seems Seems like
geography is just too important you know
the reason that the United States has
done well well warse is it's hard to us
got that big old ocean if we were
literally if Mexico and Canada were
filled with people with growing
population that numbered US 10 to one
and wanted wanted us dead and surrounded
us would America last last I doubt it
not years so um yeah I worry I worry
Israel I feel like Israel needs Israel
too I think there should be new Israel
that we we sort of set aside in the
country you know you take some place in
New Mexico say all right this is just
the back back there there's nothing
there we won't put anything there just
bday in two
years Israelis might need an escape plan
plan it' be nice to up but on other an
escape plan wouldn't fight so hard to
keep what you got so it would be more so
it's a bad
idea but I do worry 200 years in the
world could can geography not and not be
the primary
variables
all right Kur rufo posted this he said
Hamas leader of he's talking about a
ham
uh say quote I want to take this
opportunity to the racist murder George
Floyd this is the leader of
Hamas this
week the leader of
Hamas this week decided that key thing
to say to the the rest of the world is
that we should the racist Geor
he says the same type of racism George
Floyd Floyd is being used by isra
against the
Palestinians and as Christopher rufo
points out Theos BLM DSA I don't know
who they and decolonization are all the
same blood lust I agree right Hamas
BLM clear clearly not the
same but they're of the
same let's say philosophy they they're a
similar kind of kind of danger except
smaller numbers you know you know if
there were people in BL
BLM
who but yes I think it's important to
point out that they have L for the
people who don't look like that well
happening in Ukraine I saw one one dat I
didn't know 70% of the
casualties uh are the big guns I guess
that means
artillery did you the at least
70% from the big because basically just
drops off on you need to know is coming
and it it turns all day long so that Mak
sense but it turns out the new more more
artillery that Ukraine has has been a
match for the vast
outnumbering number of big guns that the
Russians have so the uh the rans
apparently have set up a very
sophisticated spotting and and
destuction system so they'll they'll
spot some with their drones they'll put
a drone over the target the Drone can
the target shoot at it and then tells
them how to how
to 20 feet short adjust a little bit
little bit again so they pretty much
take account 100% of anything they
see I me think about that ukrainians
have the ability to destroy 100%
anything that can be seen from the air
that's on the FES
there so they're just one by one and
just take it m m and apparently it's
it's almost just
routine see it shoot at at it just kill
it it go to the next one now I don't
know if they're going to run ofy
shells before Russia does because one of
the things take account is the local
Munitions Depot so it's harder Russia to
get the Munitions to wear they so so it
does look to me like like a little
uh you total uh it's a tie nobody's
anywhere and I don't know how our our
leaders make peace in a war war where
it's obvious it's not not going
anywhere it seems Seems that's the the
the ultimate way you could make PE
all right have you paying attention what
do we're going to match it do it
forever why don't we
work a comment say actually the are
advancing rap well do you believe that
that I believe we report somewhere but
do you believe the Russians are
advancing rapid
rapidly I
don't no nope I don't think so
Alexander M course reports it doesn't
matter who reports it just doubt it's
it's true now I do think that places
where either side will punch through but
once you punch through you're just it's
just target practice right punching
through through is not it's not getting
you a
lot you know see the Russians giving up
I I don't see anybody giving up until
they get what they want but but the
Russians could get get want without
War
probably I've got an idea
for well let me let talk about Gaza so
the hospitals failing there there you
might imag the the emergency suppli
having trouble getting off Crossing as
you would
anticipate and apparently the ground has
not started so it's much later than
people thought some of it be that takes
a while to organize ground
assault but I've got a feeling that they
may have changed their
tactics and remember remember what I
said it didn't makes to do a ground
disol you remember I said that I said it
makes more to do a Siege which is what
they called it they actually use the
word Siege and The Siege would be
basically starving out both these
civilian
andary until you separate enough good
people from the bad and then you can do
whatever you want with the people so I
time is on side and maybe the wor thing
that Israel could do is create a bunch
of casualties that are way on the P pale
I think several thous already died in
Gaza I saw 4,000 plus um I don't know
how people would have to die in
Gaza before our minds rever and it just
looks like you know is Israel's the back
if you were back at this point but there
is some I I don't know number is but
there's if we hit it everything will
reverse so so Israel would be smart just
to stay away from whatever that mental
number is you know keep keep those
losses down to be somewhere in range of
is Israel
losses and at least you know not too
much much of magnitude
bigger and just just take as they need
expensive but fewer fewer people die you
know to me your enemy live underground
is more a plus than a
minus if if you're a gorilla
out and the other team doesn't want to
bomb your being being underground very
good
idea however if it's it's a SE being
under is just the place
you am I right and you can't shoot at
people
underground so I think the I think the
to networks become the weakest part of
of the Hamas military to me that's their
weakness
and I will just start I don't think
anybody's going to go down into a tunnel
if they don't have could just send a
Rob all
right um so here here's things are
going um
I think G be an is dictation strike on
Iran because there may be no way
to would be the normal sequence of if
theault then has not just AE but almost
a requirement for survival that they
have to attack reason being if they
don't attack them their supporters will
say why are we giving you all this money
like this is the time you you attack you
have all the the cover of Israel going
into a
civilian you numbers of deaths you they
they're distracted there could be no
time to attack in the history of heah
this would be time to attack you given
that they know they're lose don't attack
it doesn't matter
to if ground assault
starts will get aggressive
if they didn't get aggressive they' be
seen as weak and why are we funding you
sort so they they have to if if gets
aggressive and uh Israel takes takes two
minutes because there's some there's
some amount of little aning hits that is
will just put up up
with all that war is too too much but I
think will exceed
israels and then what Israel's next move
and all out with
h do you think that would be the next
move that would be I think a
mistake that would be mistake I I I
would do a decapitation on Iran if they
can figure out way to make it work yeah
the hostages get killed no matter what
and and I'm saying
that cavalierly or you know without
respect to their their Dignity of their
lives Liv say but
realistically
realistically they they're in where
there's not there's not much like I
don't see too too many rescues happening
but but maybe and worth trying certainly
worth worth I wouldn't expect a lot from
many
rescues but I think is Israel's done
talking I think that they canot it it
would be waste time to destroy
Hamas and just fortify their border
border because it would just recreate as
long as gives money to the
bad situation will just be recreated and
I don't think put up with it a second so
if they want to end it they would
probably have to try something old like
taking out the leadership of ram as many
times
it like you know immediately they get a
new hardliner you just take out the new
Hardline
now you may say
be this will create create massive
terrorism around the world the lights
might go out in the United States I
think they they might I think the light
might go out in the the United States
because I'm sure Iran has ter terrorism
teams in the united by now they would
presumably activated automatically and
they would presumably go after things
things like the grid you make sure
everybody's going on so I I expect
lights go on actually um in a few weeks
permanently
but I'd make sure you got batteries
candles is what I'm saying because I
think I think Iran will hit back if they
they get and I don't know what would
stop stop them being hit we're we're
already already our embassies are being
cleared down in the whole area we see
barely it if you if you were Iran
or in Israel and you you look at
leadership and no speaker of the house
don't you
tell you're GNA have to kind kind do
this on your
own now now the the American Military
being in the Gulf Gulf we got a strike
for force that kind of pulled up in the
area area do you think that that's
because of
Hezbollah or do you think that's to keep
uh AR under control in case there's a
DEC strike
strike I know those things could could
be what Joe Biden says way to keep
every where they are not not to get them
War maybe but um so make this prediction
if there's a bloody ground ground
assault which I think is in question I
think the C
likely at this point but but go in and
there are massive casual casualties
Hezbollah will be active
Israel will say we're done with this
they'll just take out
out at any cost I think they'll take out
the
leadership now remember when was taken
out by
Trump and people said oh no that's going
to create wave of attacks did it
I think might have done the opposite so
I got a feeling the Iranian people are
not so happy about their leadership that
that they wouldn't minding vaporized
Franklin you know that it's an
unpredictable thing because you if you
any country they tend back leaders
during the attack it's a dicey
proposition um
so do you
imagine that Isel or the United States
know where the head of Iran is I feel
like might be just wait waiting to know
for sure
where and I don't I don't think he'll
appear in
public ever as of Iran appear appear in
re or is always sort in a room that you
didn't didn't know
was
I can't can't imagine him doing an out
event in in the land world of
drones um by the way you you you know
that uh in the age of drones leaders
will no longer be a to Door
events so that's going to
happen all
right all
right these other forms want me want me
to turn it turn it off off do you want
to talk about the audio some
more
no no I'm just I'm just if they want me
to turn it
off turn it
off which which platforms the audio
problems
specifically is it all all of
them it's the end of the show anyway you
tell
tell c c well the comments just stopped
