hey everybody
come on in come on in it's all going to
be fun and good news today
no bad news today it's all good
it's all about the brainwashing and the
mental games the psychology
oh it's going to be good but first
we'll need the simultaneous sip to get
ready for this awesomeness
best part of the day and all you need is
a copper margarita glass of tango tells
us to end a candidate or plastic vessel
of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day the
thing that makes
everything better yeah it does it's
called the simultaneous sep
and it happens now go
ah yeah that was good
so one of the uh unintended consequences
of the coronavirus and the school
shutdowns and all of that
is that uh states are breaking out all
over the place
trying to assert their assert their
ability to
allow students to choose where they go
to school
what the biggest two stories in the
country
in terms of how important they will be
to the future
largely ignored are you watching all the
headlines about the
uh all the movement toward breaking the
let's say the monopoly that the teachers
unions have on schools
there's a lot happening a lot a lot of
states
moving forward with saying hey let's
let's propose at least
funding the students so lots of action
lots of proposals
imagine if school choice could become
real realer so that you have real
school choice for everybody that would
solve most of our problems
it would take a big bite out of systemic
racism
let's say every kid gets a good
education or can
that takes a lot of problems away right
and it's the teachers unions that
prevent that
good thing from happening but they're
having a lot of problems now
because they're keeping the schools
closed and i would guess
this will lead to less support for
teachers unions
and more support for choice so that's a
gigantic story
if it goes the right way gigantic
transforms the country protects us
forever
i mean it's really big the other one is
that the
the government and i don't know what the
trump administration can make
permanent but at least in terms of
current priorities
the government has decided to go big on
small nuclear reactors to be used for
space now you don't realize yet how big
a deal that is
but if the government is decided that
nuclear power
is necessary for space space force space
exploration
space defense and it is that means that
our domestic
industry will get a big boost because
they'll do a lot of things in maybe the
government sector for military and that
will
almost certainly create smaller cheaper
better
new technology reactors that
might even be safe from a meltdown
so that is something that would affect
climate change no matter what you
thought about the actual risk of that
it will change our whole energy
structure it changes our
defense posture in the future gigantic
you take those two stories just the
nuclear energy for
space and how that will ripple through
everything
and then just the school choice stuff
that's springing up everywhere and
like lots of little flowers those are
transformative
golden age almost
almost if i told you before that
uh you should expect a demolition phase
before rebuilding because there was
already stuff here
the united states already exists you
don't you don't have a green field where
you say well
i imagine we build something from
nothing you don't have that option
you gotta you have to do demolition and
i feel as if 2020 was a year of
demolition
now some of it wasn't our choice right
coronavirus just
made us rethink every assumption which
was
a really bad pandemic
but what is the unintended consequence
if you will
of rethinking every assumption
it's really good it's really really good
like really really so good you can't
even
wrap your head around it the pandemic is
nothing but bad in terms of what it's
doing to us at the moment
but making us rethink from scratch
every assumption about commuting
what is the nature of school how do we
interact do we shake hands i mean just
everything
medicine how we deliver medicine how we
make vaccines i mean a lot changed
but we're still in the middle of the
fight so when you're middle
in the middle of the fight against the
pandemic
that's where your concentration is but
if you just took a moment
just take a moment to just rise above it
a little bit
look at it from 35 000 feet
just get a little distance from it there
is something
amazing that is forming
now are there also bad things that we
have to watch out for that are forming
oh yeah there are oh yeah
but we'll talk about that too
it's all optimism today i'm feeling good
about america
uh part of it is that the things that
are going wrong are just sort of funny
they're they're sort of laughably funny
problems
i'll get i'll tell you a few of those in
a bit uh
apparently mike pompeo allegedly he's
going to report today that
we have dramatic new evidence about the
virus
allegedly leaking from a wuhan lab but
the biggest part of it the bombshell
part
is that the allegation includes the fact
that they quote
cultured the virus now i don't know what
they mean
by cultured the virus i assume that
means it's at least modified or
created by humans right so it's at the
very least
modified now that would be new
information
right it's something that we suspected
it's not something that's ever been
confirmed
but just to make it interesting great
britain
is saying it's not true so britain says
it is not a
credible source of intel and that they
don't believe
that it has shown that it is a cultured
virus
or that it even came from the wuhan lab
lab
so you've got allegedly we haven't seen
it yet but this is the reporting that
mike pompeo will say we have new
evidence
that wuhan was the source of the leak
and that they had cultured the virus
so it was at least partially man man
human modified let's say
less sexist and
great britain says there and tell people
say that's not true
so who are you going to believe so
you've got
our intel agencies as stark contrast to
the british
intel agencies so who do you trust which
one of them is the credible one
neither neither
our our intelligence agencies aren't
credible for this kind of story
there might be some kind of things for
which
our intelligence agencies are credible
by its nature i suppose
but this isn't one of them if your own
intelligence agency tells you something
like this
and there's no source and there's no
document they can show you
i wouldn't trust it this is weapons of
mass destruction all over again
there is zero credibility
to the mike pompeo story unless you see
it
with your own eyes if mike pompeo goes
on tv
or whatever and says we have secret
intelligence information that i can't
share with you
it means nothing
you should put zero credibility on that
now
what about great britain if i'm saying
there's zero credibility
am i agreeing with great britain and
therefore
great britain is the credible one no
no great britain's intelligence agencies
are not credible
not even a little bit in fact
their job is to fool people if you're
taking
as your model of credibility somebody
whose entire job is to fool people
well you're not really smart so you have
two intelligence agencies on
opposite sides of the story and neither
of them have
any credibility so what do you do with
that
i'm planning to ignore it and you can
make your own decision but
i would say this is a story about no
information
hello the breaking headline is today we
have no credible information
on anything whatsoever that's the news
if you're interpreting it as hey i think
i just found out
something about wuhan uh no
we don't live in a world where you can
trust our intelligence agencies on this
kind of question
at all like zero is exactly the right
amount of trust
which doesn't mean it's not true by the
way if you think i'm saying it's not
true
then it escaped from the the lab or it's
not true
that it was cultured i don't know i
don't have an opinion on that
but i know i can't trust anybody else's
opinion
that i know all right um so it looks
like new york city is canceling their
contracts with the trump organization
for their their iconic central park
skating rink and
something else in retaliation
over the mega mob capital riot what is
the unintended consequence
of people punishing the trump business
for something they didn't like about
trump's
uh role as president doesn't that pretty
much guarantee
that you don't get business people
running for president anymore
let me ask you if i ran for president
should i expect that my income would go
up or down
you already know the answer to that it
would go down
anybody who already has some established
kind of a business
would be crazy to go into politics
watching what happened to trump
now if trump had gone through his term
and
simply been loved or hated in whatever
degree
you know he was and then they just said
okay but now you go back to your private
industry and that's
you know that's just separate just do
what you want to do
that would be fair but the moment you
make it
acceptable i mean new york city's
uh government is doing this in public
and bragging about it
they're not it's not like it's
undercover or anything they're actually
publicly punishing him for his political
actions in his business
is that the standard you want why would
anybody successful
run for president if they could if their
business will be punished
because of their decisions remember half
of the country is going to hate whatever
you do
why would you go into a situation where
half the country
is going to put you out of business even
if the half loves you
i wouldn't do it a number of people have
been asking me to run for president
partly because the republicans have no
more leadership
i'm not even a republican that would be
sort of
the first requirement i would think to
run for president as a republican
i would be an excellent choice but i'm
not crazy enough to take that
job i can't think of anything that would
make me want to do that job
i mean i love my country but i'm not
going to walk into a suicide situation
don't love it that much let me say let
me say that clearly in case you didn't
hear it
i love my country but i'm not going to
intentionally run into a buzzsaw
that i don't have to run into so i'm not
going to run for office
that would be stupid for me now if you
don't have money
and so you don't have a business to lose
and your life is politics
well that seems safer
here's the funniest story you probably
saw this uh if you watched
tucker carlson or so some of the video
clips so
joe biden so far has the worst start to
a presidency i've ever seen
now i've only seen presidents during my
lifetime
but i've never seen a worse start and
here's another example
of it uh not al so not only you know did
he start by calling half of the country
a bunch of racists
which if he did nothing else that would
be the worst start of any presidency
but it gets better he just appointed
to the head of department of justice
civil rights prosecution
so the person responsible for
prosecuting civil rights
violations in this country at the
federal level i guess
had once written a uh an article
while she was at harvard so the good
news is
she went to harvard so when you hear
that biden is
uh is putting people in place
who uh went to harvard that sounds okay
at least there that's proof that they
have high intelligence and
are capable of succeeding so so far so
good let's see did she say anything that
would be say controversial
or as does she have any history or
background
saying something that would not make her
let's say the perfect choice
for the head of the department of
justice
civil rights prosecution what could that
be something maybe in that domain
that she may have said at some point in
the past that would have some relevance
to the current job situation because
you know one of the big complaints about
trump is they didn't make
good hiring decisions now i've semi
defended that by saying he didn't have
many choices
because people didn't want to work for
him because of the reputation
so therefore he had a small pool of
people who were even willing to take the
job
so that was part of trump's problem and
i've also said that he
fires better and firing is the real
skill
when you hire people you're kind of
guessing like ah they've never done this
exact job but i feel like they could
that's sort of guessing but when they
don't do the job
well the firing is the skill part it's
like okay
pull the trigger and he was good at that
trump's a good fire
but how is biden doing so he picked
somebody for the head of the doj
civil rights prosecution who had once
written a paper saying that
black citizens she happens to be
african-american that's important to the
story
she says that blacks black people
are superior to white people mentally
physically and spiritually
and that there's a good reason for that
it's because they're pineal gland
doesn't have enough melanin or something
um now i don't need to tell you
the science does not back her opinion
i also don't know if she still holds the
opinion
because this was a while ago right so if
you're in college you can say some
you can say some dumb stuff in college i
don't mind that and i've suggested the
20-year rule
the 20-year rule is you just ignore
anything that happened 20 years ago
but that would kind of depend on her
disavowing it today
yeah has she ever retracted that is
exactly the story
had she retracted and said you know that
was just a dumb thing
it was just a college thing i was just
being
you know i was being academic i was
trying to be provocative
i don't hold those views now if she had
said that
i would at least attempt to be
consistent with my view
that the 20-year rule should apply to
whatever dumbass
racist thing usually is racist but
whatever racist or homophobic thing you
said 20 years ago
you're probably a different person by
now
and if you're a different person by now
maybe you should be judged by
who you are instead of something else
um but
what could be funnier than joe biden who
is one of his big
claims to fame is that he does good
hiring compared to trump
and he hires somebody who literally says
that black people are superior
mentally physically and spiritually
because of some science that isn't real
science
you need to retract that really hard
i don't know how much of a retraction
you'd need to hear
to feel that it was real but i think you
need a pretty serious retraction on that
one
if she if she wholeheartedly disavowed
her old views
i would still hate it but i would want
to be consistent with
my views on republicans and everybody
else which is if it was 20 years ago
and you don't hold that view now i'm
going to let it go
but she hasn't repudiated it so
at the moment it's just it's hilarious
how
how incompetent this is i mean how
incompetent would you have to be
to pick this person for that job that's
like the ultimate presidential
incompetence and let me tell you i love
being just a critic
it was so much harder when i was trying
to put a
you know the persuasion spin on trump
and say well yeah he said this but
you have to understand how this is going
to work out that was hard work
criticizing biden for being a dummy
is really fun and easy so my workload
went down about 50
um here's some more stupid news
that this is so dumb that when i read it
you're not even gonna believe this is
true
but i swear to god this is true uh you
know there's facial recognition apps now
and law enforcement is using them to
figure out you know who was in the
capital and
also other stuff and apparently the lapd
has announced
that they will allow a technology that
uses a
database of existing mugshots
so they they're okay with using a
database of existing mugshots
and facial recognition against their
small
existing database because that's they
only have mug shots
they don't have everybody else in the
world who is not in a mug shop
but they're not going to use clear view
or or tools like it clearview is sort of
the leader
in terms of accuracy there but
clearview has trained its technology
and they use this is the right phrase
trained its technology
on three billion photos now people think
that clearview stores the photos
like they've scraped them and they've
got a database of all the photos that
didn't happen
clearview doesn't store any photos
they have looked at all the photos and
turned them into
a formula or an algorithm or a
mathematical
construct so what they store is math
they don't have a photo of you in their
database they've got math
that was a result of your facial
features so that's all they have
is math and then that math becomes a
pointer to
where on the internet the actual public
information is you on
on facebook etc so lapd has decided that
they will use
facial recognition but only on a tool
that
hardly ever works so they've decided
that they won't use
a reliable tool that could find pretty
much everybody
i mean close to 100 percent so they
that's evil
so they're not going to use the evil
tool that is 100 effective
or near it but they will use the evil
tool because it's the same thing
it's still facial recognition right they
will use the one that doesn't work
now that sounds like i made that up
doesn't it
but we're actually in a world where an
entity will announce proudly
they proudly announced that they will
use the tool that is
if i had to put a a number on it maybe
five percent as good
as clearview but the same technology
in this not the same technology but in
the sense that they're both facial
recognition
this is happening this is actually
happening like out loud
right in front of us we choose to use
the one that's five percent effective
is equally evil you know if you think
facial recognition is evil
that's what it is and they're not hiding
it it is facial recognition
but they only want to use the one that
doesn't work and they said that in
public
what somebody says clear view
is intrusive well it's facial
recognition that works
it's only more intrusive than other
things because it works better
that's the only thing that makes it
different anyway
i thought that was funny
scientists have done an experiment with
snails
and they found that they can make the
snail remember something that never
happened
do you know what else never happened
scientists making snails remember
something
never happened i don't think i have to
actually read the story
to know that whatever a snail remembers
i don't know if you can test that
but let's say they taught this snails to
do something if they saw some
if they saw something they'd seen before
so maybe there's a way you can test
false memories that way but
i thought that's not really the story
that you can make a snail
believe something that didn't happen you
know what the story is
the fake news does that literally every
day
are you surprised that scientists
working really hard can fool a snail
i'm not really surprised because
75 percent of the people i interacted
with on twitter today
also are operating under false memories
they were implanted by the fake news and
it's why it's quite obvious
you just read their opinion you go oh
you got that one from the fake news
that's not real
it's exactly like the snail how much did
we
what kind of a grant did we do to find
out this night the scientists
can can give snails fake news and
they'll believe it
because if you can do it to a living
human being easily and
effectively and consistently are you
really surprised you can do it to a
snail
i'm just saying there are some sciences
more useful than others
here's a question i have in my my ever
my my attempt to get as close to
cancellation as i can
without actually getting canceled i
don't want to get cancelled by the way
and i'll i will intentionally do things
to make sure i don't go far enough
that that's likely but i'm not sure it's
up to me because all it would take is
one
what would it take to get me canceled if
i don't do anything wrong
what would it take to get me canceled
snail
false memory right all it takes is the
fake news to
tell the the snails that they have a
false memory of me doing something
is that hard nope it's real easy
i'll give you some examples in a bit
where the fake news is
actively telling people to remember
something that didn't happen
it's happening right now it's actually
the headline the main news right now
is the snails it's just that you're the
snails
and the the news is telling you
something that didn't happen
and it has become a memory i'm gonna
tell you in a moment
a memory that at least half the country
has maybe three quarters
an actual memory that didn't happen
we'll get to that in a minute so if you
think you're different than the snail
hold on for that so here's a question
that i
asked provocatively if the
mega protesters if they were all mega
who knows
that assaulted the capital
if they were planning a violent assault
meaning that they planned a violent
overthrow
you know with uh you know universal
violence as opposed to there were
members of the group who definitely were
violent
and literally killed people or at least
one
so there definitely were violent people
there who went there to be violent
but here's the question i have the mega
people
were armed to the teeth some of them
were
right and if you looked at the number of
guns owned by the people who attended
probably most did not take their weapons
but the amount of them that attended who
owned
um weapons and i'm not talking about
clubs i'm talking about
actual guns are you a little bit
surprised
that there was an insurrection of the
most gun
owning people on the earth i think
that's true
wouldn't republicans be maybe among
or the most gun-owning people on earth
and none of them shot anybody
am i right have you heard any story
of a maga person even aiming a weapon at
another human
now i don't know that it didn't happen
but i haven't heard the story about it
there's no reporting on it
all of those weapons all of those
weapons
thousands of them that they had access
to
some of them actually brought weapons
not one person
brandished a weapon as in aiming it as
somebody
now what kind of an insurrection is that
when the people with massive weaponry
don't bring it and the ones that brought
it
didn't even attempt to use it what do
you call that
well we'll get into that
um here's what i'd call it
the fake news has sold you on the idea
that there was a
coup attempt and or and insurrection
so those words used not exactly the same
as each other
but you know i think the coup attempt is
a little more
let's say organized because it assumes
that there's somebody you're putting in
charge
whereas an insurrection maybe it's less
organized i don't know
or maybe they're the same doesn't matter
for my purposes
but here's what got lost in the story
and this is how all of the snails will
be reprogrammed
what ted cruz and the other republic
republicans were asking for
was not quote overthrowing the election
but how is it being reported it's being
reported that those
senators were quote trying to overturn
an election
did ted cruz ever say i would like to
overturn this election
nope how about josh hawley
did he say i would like to overturn the
election
nope nope there wasn't a single person
who said let's overturn the election at
least not in congress
not a single person did
um did trump say let's overturn the
election
nope nope don't know anybody who knows
that
all i know is ted cruz saying let's have
let's use 10 days for an audit
we have 10 days it won't slow anything
down it won't change the outcome unless
we found out something we don't know
and wouldn't it make the whole country
feel more confident
in the process so
congress was trying to take a an
election
that did not have credibility with
enough of the public to be
you know really called a a high-class
quality
credible election now it might have been
fair and free
how would i know i don't have any direct
direct
evidence that i have access to i only
have news reports
so it might have been fair enough and
free enough
but it is still a fact that half the
country
ish doesn't believe it was as fair as it
should have been
so when you've got senators like ted
cruz who i believe
is a genuine patriot and josh howley
genuine patriot and the others matt
gates etc
when they're asking for 10 days to
improve the
reliability and credibility of an
election
that's not just for republicans
that's for everybody is there one of you
who would not
be better off with a more transparent
election well i mean you can make an
argument
if it changed the result of who got in
office and you like biden more than you
like trump
then yeah maybe but wouldn't you be
better off with a system that works
wouldn't you be better off knowing that
the election worked
the fake news has brainwashed
the public into thinking this was an
actual coup
to which i ask you this provocative
question
if this were a coup attempt as opposed
to
trying to force congress to have a
10-day audit
and have some transparency which the
public
required if it were a real coup
how exactly was that coup going to work
did they think these clever
coup plotters that once they had
occupied
two empty rooms that they were then the
leaders of the country
was that their thinking uh once we get
in these empty rooms
with all this furniture we run the
country now
is that what they thought because i
don't think so
i don't think they thought that did they
think
that by stealing the magic lectern
which did happen nancy's lectern was
stolen
were they thinking if we can get a hold
of the magic
golden lectern we will have power over
the whole world
i don't think they thought that it
looked more like they were getting
souvenirs
so let me ask you this if i said to you
there are some senators who want more
transparency in the election so that we
can be sure we had
a solid election and that's better than
the situation we have with great
uncertainty
does that sound like a coup is a coup
where you take the existing system and
try to improve it as it stands
that is the opposite of a coup
if you're trying to make the current
system
work better transparently
which is all they ask for just an audit
you're doing the
opposite of a coup a coup is changing
that system
and changing the outcome now could an
outcome change
yes but only if the system worked
it only the only way the outcome could
change is if the system
were repaired through transparency
and we can see what happened with an
audit and if and we don't know that
would be the case
and if that repairing of the
transparency caused a re-vote or some
re-evaluation that could happen
but it's the opposite of a coup
when you're trying to make sure the
public feels confident with the existing
system
changing the existing system is the coup
so when these people came in there and
they were obviously trying to
um intimidate congress so some people
said to me scott scott scott
what you don't understand is no it's not
about
stealing the golden lectern so you have
power
it's not about them thinking that a coup
could be accomplished by
fully occupying two empty rooms
they didn't think that they were trying
to bully and intimidate
and scare congress into doing something
and that's bad
that is bad except
what exactly was it they were trying to
bully and scare and threaten congress
into doing
was it were they trying to bully and
scare
and threaten congress into doing
something illegal
no no they weren't trying to get them to
do anything illegal were they trying to
threaten and
congress into doing something that their
own
rules of congress wouldn't allow them to
do
no no congress could have done what they
what the protesters wanted
they could do an audit in fact ted cruz
had
suggested it so
wouldn't you say that the congress was
being threatened
and bullied into doing the job because
i would say that if half of the country
feels
there's no credibility in the election
and they have 10 days to do something
that might make a difference
and you want them to do that thing which
can be done it's practical
it wouldn't change anything in terms of
the timing
and it's their job you actually had an
insurrection to try to force congress
just to do its job that actually
happened
and that's being presented as a coup
attempt
and an insurrection it's literally the
opposite
it was an insurrection mostly right
there were some bad elements in there
who had their own
they must have had their own motives so
i'm not trying to minimize the fact
that there were some bad people in that
group and what those bad people did they
have to be held fully accountable for
you know it's illegal you could execute
them for all i care
especially the one who beat the cop
anybody who beat that cop you can
execute them i'm
i'm fine with that this would be illegal
but i'm just saying that the mass the ma
the far majority of these people that
are being called the insurrection and
the coup
were literally trying to intimidate
congress into doing its job for the
first time
and that's being called a coup right
encouraging congress to just simply do
its job
that's it they didn't ask them to do
something that's not their job
they didn't ask them to quit none of
that
they just asked them to do their job
that's it now you could argue that maybe
they shouldn't have done their job that
way etc
but you can't argue what the intent was
because if the intent
was a coup i think they would use some
weapons
if the intent was an insurrection like
an actual change of government based on
their
threats or their actual violence would
they do it that way
what kind of a weak-ass coup takes over
two empty rooms
steals a lectern and says i think we got
this
i think we're in charge of the united
states now
that's not a thing that's what the fake
news
sold to the snails the snails believed
there was a coup
and they will never believe anything
else because the snails have been
programmed
by the fake news to think that instead
of a bunch of people taking
a body of uh of
you know the government the congress
which had what a
13 approval rating let me tell you if
patriots
surround a a part of the government
that has a 13 percent rating of approval
and they're refusing to do the most
basic part of their job which is
hey could you maybe give us some
assurance that the election was fair
pretty basic to the job i would say
um if they're not willing to do their
job
shouldn't and they have 13 approval
whose fault is it that uh
patriots surrounded their building the
bad ones went inside
we don't condone that whatsoever totally
disavow the ones who went inside
but you should expect that they're going
to surround the building
you should you should expect a free
speech
kind of demonstration i mean if you
didn't expect that
so uh trump uh will either be impeached
or almost impeached based on the fact
that although his words did not
encourage violence
and specifically said the opposite he
said
be peaceful specifically be peaceful
but i do think it's a fair it is a fair
criticism
that he should have known what would
happen
even though his words you know we're not
um telling them to do that it wouldn't
have been too hard to know
that you're creating a dangerous
situation so i think he has to take
responsibility for that the same way he
can take credit for some of the great
things he did
but if it's true that trump could be
impeached or almost impeached because he
should have known it's not what he did
intentionally
it's what he should have known would
have been the result
even though his specific actions didn't
have that tell for
for a problem he should have known that
his actions would have caused that i
agree with that
but should congress have known that
denying
an audit under this condition would
create violence
yeah you just got quiet didn't you
should congress have known
that not backing the audit which
there was no problems with it didn't
have a budget problem
didn't have a timing problem there was
no objection to it
it could have been done should congress
have known
that this would cause violence
absolutely they should have known
and all i ask is for some consistency
i will not push back on attempts
to impeach trump over this
because i do think he's got something to
answer for
all leaders have to answer for the
result of their actions right
the fact that he wasn't intending this
to happen
matters but it doesn't excuse it
right because you can be impeached for a
mistake
i would say it was a mistake it was a
big one it was a big mistake
but it wasn't intentional i do you think
do you think that
trump wanted violence i think that's the
last thing he wanted
i think that's the very last thing he
wanted it's obvious that he wanted
pressure on
congress but pressured to do an audit
not pressure to overturn the election
not pressure to enter the building
but there's no way trump wanted that but
buck stops at the top you know if i'm
if i'm going to be even a little bit
consistent the person in charge gets the
blame
and the person in charge gets the credit
if things go right even if they weren't
directly involved those are the rules
and i don't think we should change them
i'm not going to change it for trump
but i want to be consistent kamala
harris was
promoting violence by the bl black lives
matter
protesters i think that should be
treated the same
so i can support impeaching trump
over this even understanding in my
opinion that he didn't intend any of it
to happen
but the same way uh kamal harris
actually actively
supported i'll say unrest i won't say
violence she didn't use that word
but she was certainly in favor of unrest
which guaranteed
death and destruction guaranteed it and
of course she would know that
so how does kamala harris not get
impeached
it's the same standard and secondly how
do
all of the members of congress who voted
against
the 10-day audit how in
did they not know that they were going
to get attacked for that
how the did they not know that was
going to cause that problem
right same standard
all right let me read this comment um
the coup insurrection false narrative is
beyond annoying
yeah the dems used it against uh
yeah right that comment disappeared for
reasons that i'm not clear as i was
reading it but thank you for the comment
um so
how do you feel living among the snails
who have been convinced that an attempt
to
solidify and protect the republic as it
stands
has been turned by the fake news into
a coup attempt and an insurrection where
plainly it wasn't
plainly you don't need to be an expert
on insurrections you just have to look
at it and say
uh they took over a room
you can't control a country by taking
over a room
an empty room now some of you are saying
but but they meant to take members of
congress
hostage let's say that's true there was
a guy there with twist eyes right that
that showed some intent
but let's say worst case scenario that
some of the people who were in the
building
intended to harm or take control of
let's say
members of congress do you know what's
wrong with this
how could you control the united states
by taking hostage
any number of people who have a 13
approval rating
and are not doing the will of the people
i do not condone any kind of hostage
taking
that i hope that's obvious i don't
condone any violence and i
absolutely disavow anybody who entered
the building
they should have stayed out of the
building period
but if you're going to say this was a
coup attempt
you have to you have to complete the
story i'm just asking anybody who thinks
it was a coup
to complete the story and the story is
if they took
hostages in congress would they control
the country
no no not even a little bit
who named a member of congress that we
wouldn't sacrifice
as opposed to overthrowing the
government of the united states
i'm a big fan of mike pence even though
he's very unpopular with a lot of people
this week
i've been saying since the beginning
that if you judge him
for his job as a vice president
spectacular
i really think he's one of the strongest
vice presidents we've ever had
even though i disagree with him on lgbtq
stuff and other stuff
so i don't think he should be president
but as a vice president
damn good now as much as i like mike
pence
imagine if you will if the
the alleged coup attempt people had
taken him hostage and were planning to
kill him
if they didn't get their way then did
the coup attempt
people have they taken over the country
would that work hey we got your vice
president
we're going to do bad things to him
unless you let us run the country
or put trump in in charge and let trump
have a second term
would that work no
no we might love mike pence
but we're not going to trade his life
for the country
that's not how it works we would say
well if that's the way it's got to be
you know we're going to miss mike pence
there isn't a single person in the world
who would trade the country
for mike pence and mike pence is awesome
great guy
you know overall i know some of you
think he's a traitor for not
for not wanting to vote the way he did
et cetera i think you
i think he's a good person who's just
trying to figure out
the best option and of bad options i
just see him as a good person
you don't have to agree with him i don't
either
i don't agree with all of his decisions
but i feel like he's a good person
still still
if one person in our government is taken
hostage we're not going to overthrow the
government
turn it to the president whoever the
president is you could pick
trump or biden or anybody else bad
people
take the president hostage sometime in
the future
do they own the country no
no not even a little bit not even
slightly
you could take every member of congress
hostage
and it wouldn't have any effect on
controlling the country
because the rest of the country would
say oh well i guess we need some new
politicians
and we would just go on like it didn't
even happen you know we would of course
kill all the coup people first but it
wouldn't stop us
there's no way that any of those actions
conceivably
in the most wild imagination
could have turned into anything like a
coup
there was just no no connecting tissue
that could have made that even slightly
possible
not one percent nothing and yet
the snails have been convinced it
happened all right
um glenn beck's getting in trouble
for referring to the uh the private
company
social media censorship of some voices
as a digital holocaust
and then the people who um you know like
the auschwitz museum people etc
say stop using our holocaust analogies
because
you're trivializing the holocaust i have
two things to say about that number one
never don't don't compare things to the
holocaust
the whole point of the holocaust is that
it can't be compared to other things
unless it's an actual another holocaust
like if somebody actually kills
six million people of some identified
group well yeah that's all the cost
but i don't call censorship and stuff
like that a holocaust right
it does it does cheapen the holocaust so
i agree that
it's a word that there are some words
you want to preserve
right right you just want to preserve
some words
and not not water down their meaning
because they're important
but here's the fun part and the second
part
having suffered from four years of
hitler analogies about trump
i really did kind of enjoy the
glenn beck is making a legitimate it's
legitimate
i mean it's as legitimate as the
uh as the charges against trump for
being hitler
meaning neither of them are legitimate
because nothing really compares to
hitler nothing compares to the holocaust
where it's just hyperbole but it's
completely fair
that after four years of listening to it
you want to send a little back
i kind of enjoyed that and
i have to tell you when it was obvious
that trump wasn't going to get a second
term
i i suffered a little bit of
not depression nothing like that but
maybe a little bit of pre-sadness that i
wouldn't be
entertained in the future
wouldn't be fun things to talk about but
uh that doesn't seem to be the case so
making fun
of biden will be way more entertaining
than defending trump because it'll be so
easy
um john dvorak wrote a really
provocative article
talking about how the poor countries
seemed
i was talking about this yesterday how
the countries with low incomes seem to
be doing better on the coronavirus
than the countries with good health care
systems
and i was speculating there we don't
know why that is
maybe it's sunshine or
bad reporting or you know any one of ten
things or
ivermectin or hydroxycholera queen
everybody's got their own
private theory but uh
john devorak's theory is the most
provocative of them all
and i'm not telling you i agree with
this i'm just going to tell you his
opinion
because it's so fun and his opinion is
it's mass hysteria
that the countries that have a let's say
a well-developed news social media
industry
they've generated a mass hysteria so
that our impression of what's happening
is way out of line with what's happening
and that
the poor countries don't have the same
you know robust
social media fake news kind of influence
and so they don't know that they're in a
pandemic
and the hypothesis and again this is not
my opinion
i'm going to tell you in my opinion in a
moment but the hypothesis
is that mass hysteria is so strong
that if you get enough of it going it
looks like you have a pandemic
when maybe you don't now part of his
argument is
we don't see bodies piled up in these
third world countries and i
that's a mystery right if these other
countries are doing everything wrong
at least according to the developed
countries they are
because they're not they don't have the
you know all the
uh high quality health care if they're
doing everything wrong where are the
bodies
wouldn't we notice i mean even though we
don't have great information about
what's happening in you know
congo or some african country
we don't have great information but
wouldn't we notice by now
it'd be a lot of dead people
maybe there are we just haven't noticed
that would be weird
somebody says they bury them yeah but
you still notice
i mean they'd be talking about it so
i don't think i quite buy into uh john's
theory only because we do have bodies
piled up if you count the number of
people who seem to have died
if you look at the impact on icus where
there's a hot space
it looks like real real disease to me it
looks real to me
so there may be there may be some
some way that uh john dvorak's opinion
about the mass hysteria
or at least a hypothesis let's say it's
a hypothesis as opposed to
an opinion i don't want to i don't want
to oversell
his opinion uh he needs to do that
himself
but let's scale the hypothesis it's
really interesting
and the part of the hypothesis i like
and the thing that makes it provocative
is that it's entirely possible for a
mass hysteria to cause people to think
they're
having health problems they're not but i
don't think that's happening in this
case
because i think there are too many
doctors looking at too many real things
and too many real patients but you never
know
it's just a fun thought um
let's see i'd like to give a random
compliment today
i told you i'd be giving out random
compliments uh
especially to people who you don't
expect me to be complimenting
today's compliment is to geraldo rivera
yeah i know i know what you're gonna say
hold on
just hold on it's not as bad as you
think
you can handle this i know you can
so geraldo of course has uh been quite
brutal on
the president trump um who have been
friends for a long time so haralda's
been a booster
overall but he's you know disagreed on
immigration and some other
some other things so here's what he said
in a tweet he said regardless of how the
senate ultimately votes i think he's
talking about impeachment
he says it's entirely appropriate that
trump be impeached by the house
he knew what mob what the mob intended
from the jump
and uh basically that's his point he
knew what they were going to do so it's
it's on him
and he uh he goes after trump pretty
hard
now here's my compliment to geraldo
yes he took a selfie with his shirt off
over the age of 70. yes uh
capone's fault did not go the way maybe
he hoped
yes he does do a lot of self-promotion
that's his job so do i if
you do this for a living you do a lot of
self-promotion that's
sort of what you do that is part of the
job
but here's what i love about uh geraldo
and
the following compliment geraldo doesn't
give a
what you think about his opinion
and i could not love that more he
geraldo
has said more opinions that more people
disagree with
and said it you know with
complete bravery i guess would be the
right thing he is one
brave mofo he will say
absolutely anything he thinks is true no
matter what you think of it and he'll
say it in public
and there are not many people like that
now i don't agree with heraldo on a
number of things
you know i've been watching him for a
long time sometimes i like him
his opinions sometimes i disagree but in
every case don't you feel he's telling
you his honest opinion
that's the special part it looks like
i mean you can't read minds but my
opinion of his opinion is that every
time he gives it
i'm seeing an actual opinion when you
watch
almost anybody else who's in this
business and i think i could put myself
in that category unfortunately
you can smell the bias right like
it just reeks some people just reek of
bias
even when they're saying things that are
true they still wreak of bias
geraldo does not he does not
reek of bias he can take a position on
the left when it looks like it makes
sense to him
even if i disagree and he can take a
position on the right
if he thinks it makes sense that is
special right you need more of
geraldo even if you disagree with them
you don't need less of that
you need a lot more of it in my opinion
um stephen beschloss a historian i
believe
he tweeted that after the grim week i
was talking about some
some of members of congress tried to
come to work
with concealed carry i guess and they
felt that they needed it for their
safety
and they the they set off the
i guess the security alarms
and they refused to be patted down now i
didn't hear the rest of the story
whether they were let in or not but they
were
apparently they were strapped and they
were they had weapons
now beshlos um says that
maybe i shouldn't be surprised by the
disgraceful level of
arrogance of congress people who refuse
to go through a metal detector
arrogance and selfishness qualities that
helped
us get into this mess to which i say
uh steven did you notice
that congress was just invaded by armed
people with
twist eyes ah
i feel as though congress has a right to
defend themselves
it's called the constitution and i don't
think we should ask them to go to work
in that environment
without feeling safe and if what it
takes for them to feel safe
is their second amendment rights who has
more second amendment rights than a
congress person
you know ideally we all have the same
rights but you know be serious
they've got some they've got extra
rights because they're in congress they
shouldn't have but they do
and i completely back
100 the congress people
who wanted to be armed if you put me in
a situation where my personal security
was as as loose and tentative as
apparently the
security is for the capitol building i
would want to
i would have one concealed carry because
who was going to stop the
you know if they got in who is going to
stop him it looks like the police were
standing aside
i'd want to be armed so i'm
i'll back the people who tried to be
armed for that um
i made a prediction here that the odds
of democrats
permanently shutting republicans out of
power
um and that's the worry the worry is
that they have so much power now they'll
they'll be uh um changing the voting
districts and they'll be adding the
district of columbia and they'll
they'll add get rid of the filibuster
and they'll pack the courts and
everything
so the worry is that the democrats will
just have this firm
permanent control on power maybe
maybe that's definitely one of the
things that could happen
but if you're looking at the odds i
would say the odds of democrats
self-destructing is way higher
you know if you're going to look at the
next election
i will feel like it looks good for
democrats already
because the democrats will have to
either
not do the things they promised such as
opening the border or
they have to do the things they promised
and watch a disaster unfold
because if you open the border i don't
feel like there are two ways that could
go
i feel like that's one of those few
situations
where you don't have to guess which way
it's going to go
it would be a humanitarian disaster i
would imagine
i don't i don't see how it could go any
other way but
uh this is all by way of saying if
you're worried that the democrats have a
stranglehold on power uh
i think they're self-destructing because
when they were out of power at least the
presidency
they had the luxury of saying crazy
stuff
and not having to do any of it now if
they say
crazy stuff they're either going to
disappoint because they don't do it
or they're going to do it and show that
none of their plans work
that's all that's left they don't have
a path to success because if you think
it well they'll get in there and they'll
they'll shut down the republicans and
and they'll do good work
because if they do those two things
they'd have power forever do a good job
shut down the republicans permanent
situation
but i don't think so i mean anything's
possible but it looks like democrats are
going to self-destruct
just by i mean look at that appointment
of kristen clarke
the the woman who had the 20 year old or
whatever
claim about the pineal gland making
black people superior
he appointed that woman that that's the
kind of
uh that's the kind of action we're going
to see out of the biden administration
it's literally laughably stupid
it's just laughably stupid now i'm sure
all democrats thought that of everything
that trump did but that's my point
my point is that being in power is hard
being a critic
which i am right now where i just get to
criticize people for whatever the hell
they're doing
real easy i just moved from the hardest
job in the world to the easiest
not really feeling any pain at the
moment all right
yeah there is stupidity on all sides of
the aisles
um i believe that is what i wanted to
talk about today
should the trump wing of republicans
form a new party now
now if if the republicans want any hope
of ever getting power back
they need to be one party the reason it
worked
with trump is that he managed to do the
near impossible which is
he unified the republican party
so now i don't think you want to start
another party
what are the chances of 2024 having
auditable elections i would say zero
zero as far as i can tell there is no
interest
in the government not real and just
there are people talking
but there doesn't seem to be any real
interest in fixing the election system
have you seen it i don't see uh
i don't i don't see biden saying i'm
going to make this my highest priority
to make this auditable
i don't see any chance it's going to
happen
so i'm seeing a question about uh the
patrick byrne
story i think that's the story about
italy being somehow involved in fixing
the election
so my my take on that just quickly i've
talked about that before my take is that
patrick byrne is like a really smart guy
if you look into his background and
credentials he's super smart
and successful too so you've got that on
one hand
super smart successful person making a
claim
but the claim is of a nature that i
don't believe
ever right so the claim is sufficiently
fantastical that i dismiss it as sort of
a
bigfoot kind of a claim which doesn't
mean it's not true
i'm just saying that if you were going
to look at claims that sort of
have that vibe you know it's complicated
and
you know you can't see nobody's showing
you the direct evidence it's
people who talk to people about a
complicated scheme
and another country anytime a story has
all of those
qualities to it you should bet against
it
so if i had to bet 10 to one odds is
if i had to bet but that's ten to one is
there a ten percent chance
it's real yeah maybe maybe ten percent
chance
um remember i've told you that any
individual
claim is almost certainly false but that
doesn't change the fact that you have a
big system that involves software
and the odds of a big important system
that involves software
not being hacked is zero
now i don't know if it was hacked this
year i don't know if the hacks
if they happened changed any results i
don't know if there were just as many
hacks for trump as against him
i don't know if there are any hacks i
just know that this system
has to be hacked eventually it's either
happened
is happening or will happen that's the
guarantee
because all systems get hacked all you
need is
an insider to be willing to take a bribe
that's all it takes
um somebody says it looks more real than
other claims i don't think so
i don't think it's more real than the
ones who have been debunked
on the surface i don't know what the
reality is just on the surface
doesn't look real uh there are no
techies explaining the vote switching
yeah
the whole the whole vote switching thing
uh
i just saw a reference to none of that
being real
because i guess the tv reporting
and i can't claim this to be true it's
just something i saw on the internet
that the way the tv reports the the
votes as they come in
is estimates and so as new information
comes in to change their estimate
it is actually completely normal and
built into the system
that since their estimates sometimes
they go up a little and sometimes they
go down a little
but on average they mostly go up
so it would have happened to both
candidates and there's no story here
except the estimates were showing on the
screen which you interpreted to be
actual votes
now i don't know if that's true
but if you if you told me yeah which is
more true
that version that those numbers were not
dependable and they were just estimates
or that right in front of us votes were
being taken from one candidate and given
to another
on national tv while you could watch it
maybe maybe that happened
but i would bet against that right i
would bet against
that you could watch it happen in real
time and it was just on television
uh it feels a lot more likely
that they were working with estimates
that were being updated and
sometimes they went backwards but not
usually
somebody says we saw it happen what i'm
telling you is you didn't
you didn't see it happen what i'm
telling you is that if the alternate
explanation is correct
i don't know if it is but if the
alternate explanation is that you saw
estimates then no you did not see
the vote count decreasing you saw
estimates which of course
will move back and forth as new
information comes in
dr schieve has one part of election
fraud in massachusetts court
i don't know that story but i'll be
interested in it
uh you think it was a major vote
harvesting
yeah benford's law somebody saying
that's been debunked
so one of the problems is that a lot of
things that you heard
as claims you did not hear the debunk
and i i felt that problem too and i
complained about it
there should have always been some
master list of all the
allegations along with what was at least
presented as a debunk whether it was
real or not so
if you've never heard that the benford's
law thing was debunked
ask yourself if you're getting good
information
because it was debunked all right
um that's all i got for now
and um somebody says benford's law is
not debunked
it's just not definitive that's uh i
think that's an accurate statement
but doesn't really disagree with
debunked
meaning that there's a claim that
rather than saying yeah this is really
strong evidence of something
it just means you can't tell so
i would call that debunked but i accept
your clarification
that's all i got for you and i'll talk
to you tomorrow
all right youtubers i don't have much
else to say
uh yeah benford's is a
invitation to investigate right it would
be good to have an audit so
all of these things are aired out
matthias says this was a horrible
periscope
i give a zero out of one
i'm going to put you out of your misery
we'll hide you on this channel
um i need a micro lesson on finishing
projects
i might do that one actually i've gotten
a few
uh requests for something in that
category
all right that's all for now
