hold on hold on
not yet not yet
this is the part of the show The locals
people usually see but you don't see on
YouTube
this is where I'm fussing around
to my checklist of everything and get it
right in two minutes
that sound you hear is my notes printing
out for the best show you're ever going
to see
let me tell you
we got a good one today
I won't say that every time
but today oh yeah it's a good one
all right just a couple more steps here
and we're good to go
let me grab my notes
all good news it looks like there might
be another
uh twist in The Saga
that instead of my normal show
you might get to see me
take that HP printer
see it there that's my HP printer
it's trying to do something trying to
print my notes for the show
it's making noise
looks like it's begging for cartridges
or something I don't know but what did
my last HP printer is in pieces on the
floor of the garage
yeah I don't even think it knows it
because obviously hey what the hell is
going on
obviously if my printer knew what its uh
fate was going to be in about five
minutes it would be printing a lot
better than it is a lot better
because his predecessor is in a lot of
pieces that I keep in a container next
to the door in the garage so I can see
it every time I walk by
and I like all of my equipment to know
that it's this close to being destroyed
in public
let me push this button and see what
happens
now
might be just out of paper hold on
this is kind of exciting
because if this doesn't produce anything
like my notes
in about 60 seconds I am going to rip it
out of the wall and throw it over my
balcony onto the sidewalk
now see a lot of you a lot of you think
it's senseless
a lot of you think is senseless to
threaten your technical devices
but no
you can see it working right in front of
you
yeah those of you who say it doesn't
make sense to threaten technology that's
not going to make a difference but you
see it yourself
see a few threats boom
well I also don't want to say this is
the worst to start to the show of all
time
because I've had some pretty bad ones
I might even put the camera on me
welcome to the worst simultaneous sip of
all time
oh are you kidding me come on
come on technology
come on
my iPad was teasing me but I think now
there we go there we go
take a deep breath everybody I know
there was a little bit of panic there
when you thought
to yourself I don't know if they'll be a
simultaneous up today it's not looking
good because it almost went off the
rails but we saved it we saved it with
what threats yeah a lot of people don't
don't think threats work but they do
even on technology and I think we're in
good shape now
so I can't claim this will be the best
thing that happened all day because I
had such a bad start but it's going to
be in the top ten even with this bad
start and the only thing that could make
it better well just one way would be the
simultaneous Sip and all you need is a
copper among our glass of Tanks or
Chelsea style the canteen jungle flask a
vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine at the end of the
day the thing that makes everything
better
including your antibodies and that's
science
go
you can feel your antibodies a little
more active now right
you can feel it
now you feel yourself getting stronger
yeah I think you do
well there's all kinds of fun news today
let's Jump Right In
Jump Right In and I'm going to do that
by uh
showing you a little video here that
some of you may have seen but it's so
damn good I gotta show you again in case
you missed it
just in case you missed it there's a uh
a new meme video going around
I don't know if you get how well you can
see
 damn
I'm sorry
all of my technology is sort of acting
the way it's not supposed to this is
something they should have taken oh 10
seconds and now I'm boring you forever
all right I'm going to try to do
something simple here
there's a photo on my phone and now I'm
just going to touch it with my finger I
tried that before and all all kinds of
bad things happen and I'm going to
try it again because I'm pretty sure
that touching a photo
uh worked that time all right here's a
photo of uh Joe Biden
uh greeting uh
uh Boris Johnson
now here's the funny part
look at the expression of Boris
Johnson's face
can you see the expression on Boris
Johnson's face
but also look at his right hand
it turns out that
Cornholio disease is actually
transmissible by touch
you know what I mean you remember the uh
you remember the uh Joe Biden where
you're standing like he was frozen
like cornholio well apparently you can
transmit that because it looks like
Boris Johnson just immediately went into
Cornholio mode
as soon as Biden touched him
well that's got to mean something I
think our medical professionals should
look into that
all right but that wasn't even what I
was going to show you
uh I was going to show you one of the
best political ads I've ever seen
and I'm not
I'm not really following the Virginia
Governor's race
enough to have a favorite
but Glenn Glenn Younkin is running as a
Republican
against Terry McAuliffe and I just
looked at a campaign ad put out by a
young kitten so again I'm just showing
you his work I'm not promoting him or
whatever I haven't looked into any of
these candidates enough to have an
opinion but
um
except the school choice of course
whoever whoever's in favor of school
choice I'm probably for
but I want to show you this I don't know
if you'll be able to see it well enough
on my little phone but it'll give you
the idea
let's see so this is Glenn young king
oops
try it again
[Music]
more government control is the answer
this election isn't about them it's
about us all right now watch this video
the need works for us this is our moment
on November 2nd a new day begins in
Virginia
all right so you missed the first part
that makes it brilliant but it's the
first few seconds is what makes This
brilliant
there's a crowd of all white guys in
suits answer they're all white
I realize that's a terrible audio visual
but the point is it starts with this
Army of boring zombie-like uh older
white men in suits
and they sort of represent you know the
government or the power or the people in
power and they're just sort of marching
zombie-like and then you see regular
citizens beginning with a police officer
you know walking through them sort of
violating their there are powerful
whiteness I guess now they were all
non-white but the clever way that they
set it up is that it's all these old
white guys in power and then you see
people who some white some black you
know you've got a mix of men and women
and stuff and you see that they're all
sort of violating that row of old white
guys
but here's what happened
here's what happened what you said bye
you should wait for the uh wait for the
payoff
the payoff is that he reframed the
situation from race which is where the
other team was going with it
to power
which was very clever
because he made it look as though the
old white guys are not about big white
because the people violating you know
their their power visual were some
whites some black some men some women so
he basically reframed it from race
to power
somebody says my locals mic is off but
it isn't is it
um so they're are you having a trouble
with the sound on locals
all right let me see if I can change
anything here
let's see I am plugged in
I'm going to pull the mic
all right I pulled the mic on uh locals
and let's see if you can hear that now
it's the same
um
no difference is there anybody who can
hear it well
okay looks like we've got a problem here
in locals I'm going to kill this feed
which means ending the app
and I could try to restart it
all right
um over on YouTube apparently we have
good sound if you want to run over there
and
not have to worry about it
what
uh
looks like I'm not going to be able to
do this all right let's see
let's try it on my other device
oh God what a nightmare this morning is
oh my God
it is just everything going to network
um
seriously just just everything's not
going to work today
all right
well
let me try another one
I'm going to try a test one
sorry YouTube you're just gonna have to
sit this one out because I gotta fix
this right now
this will take a second
see this is in trouble with uh all live
streaming if you've never tried to live
stream
the technology never works the same
twice which is why
um
which is why it's just really hard to
live stream on two platforms at once
all right
um
let me see if I can fire this up
so in theory
I'm firing up another uh
locals feed
but you might not be able to see it
you might not be able to see it so we'll
see if they can find it and I'll go on
um
so I doubt you can hear this
all right
um
there's a uh have you seen the LGB meme
video uh let's go Brandon
uh
yeah I'm kind of kind of surprised that
my uh locals app wouldn't learn
something from the printer
all right
um
still not a all right let's try this
permission denied that didn't work
see uh all right screw it
go to YouTube
go to YouTube
sorry
locals we're still in beta
God oh my God I'm gonna have to break
something now I'm trying to just type a
message to the locals platform to go to
YouTube and every time I type it's it's
it's just changing the words as I type
them into something else so I can't even
type go to YouTube
and if I can't type that in the next
minute I'm just going to destroy
everything in this office I'm literally
going to start ripping the technology
out and throwing it all out the window
in about 60 seconds
I'm just going to try to write
go to YouTube on an iPad while it
continually tries to correct me go to
Capital
y o u
t u b e
send
all right
all right
honestly I'm so pissed off right now I
don't know if I could talk
laughs
what a day all right
so have you seen the uh there's a great
meme called uh let's go Brandon and uh I
was going to play it for you but the
odds of that actually working seems so
low right now
that sure enough I can't even find it
all right it's just
if I were you I would just give up on
this you know normally I'm I'm pretty
happy about the content I'm producing
here but today you should just give up
on me
you should just freaking give up on me
hahaha
I I have failed you completely I'm the
Joe Biden of of podcasters today
all right
anyway somebody made a great beam in
which they blah blah blah wouldn't it be
great if you could hear the thing I'm
talking about
is there anything more boring than
somebody describing a meme that they're
not showing you no nothing there's a
well there is one thing describing a
dream
or telling somebody about a good meal
you had
those are worse than this so it could be
worse you could be listening to a
co-worker telling you about a great
potato they ate that one time that's
worse all right let's talk about
something that doesn't require any
technology
um have you seen that Facebook is doing
these ads in which they're asking for
more government regulation have you seen
that it's pretty clever because both the
left and the right are mad at Facebook
for different reasons and some similar
reasons
so Facebook is very cleverly doing
persuasion in which they're producing
ads saying we'd like to you know have
the best uh the best control of bad
content while letting good content
through
but it's tough for us to do would be a
lot easier if we were more regulated
they're actually asking to be more
regulated
and I think it's brilliant in terms of a
way to manage the problem I don't know
what could be better than asking to be
asking to be regulated
all right
um
yeah so
apparently Roe versus Roe v Wade might
fall because of the nature of the
Supreme Court people are saying that I'm
not predicting that's going to happen
but let's say it gets chipped away at to
the point where it's difficult to get an
abortion in I think there could be up to
20 states that would restrict it if if
they could
so if Rovers Wade Falls let's say 20
States or so
make it illegal to get an abortion you
should expect people would drive to
neighboring states where they could and
here's my prediction which I predicted
before but I'll re-up it
I will predict
that um
there will pop up a solution to the
transportation problem
so right now if you were low income and
you ordered an abortion in a state that
let's say in the future they restrict it
you could in the future also I'm pretty
sure arrange to get a ride and maybe
even a place to stay overnight until you
come home something like that and I
think that'll just it'll just pop up
spontaneously from uh abortion activists
who will just say all right I'll take a
turn you know today will be my day to
drive 100 miles I'll take a couple of
people so I have a feeling that it will
get really complicated to get an
abortion but I can't see it going away
I feel like the system will just adjust
um
all right
so uh
here's something that you wouldn't
expect
you know that Joe Biden likes to raise
your taxes right you've probably heard
of that he wants to raise your taxes
but Biden loves taxes so much he's
actually trying to raise taxes on other
countries
I'm not even making that up
I'm not making that up Biden is at the
G20 meeting right now
and he's going to be pushing something
called the global minimum tax he's
literally
not making this up he's literally trying
to raise taxes in other countries
now
if you had told me that could happen I
would have said that's pretty funny
that's some hyperbole right there hahaha
He loves raising taxes so much that he's
raised all the taxes he can in this
country and now he's got to go to other
countries to raise their taxes
uh except that it's happening it's
actually happening
oh
um
but
don't you feel good that instead of
sending a leader that would embarrass
the country somebody who's embarrassed
the country with Mean Tweets
don't you feel better knowing that we
sent an empty bag of meat instead of a
mean tweeter
I don't know about you but as an
American
I feel pretty pretty good about Joe
Biden being there a brainless sack of
meat and the good news is I don't think
people are going to mock him like they
did Trump for his Mean Tweets and things
he said I think they're going to let
Biden off the hook because you don't
really
want to be seen as mocking the mentally
handicapped
and well you think that might be a joke
it isn't
because I do think
that Biden is so obviously mentally
degraded at this point that it's a
little hard for any leader to make fun
of him because it would be making fun of
somebody mentally handicapped and no
leader wants to do that in public
right so Biden has somehow solved the
problem of our president being mocked by
being so degraded that he's Unworthy of
mocking at this point or at least you
wouldn't do it in public
so good work for those other leaders not
mocking our our degraded present
um
how much how much must is Sting to be
Trump
did you ever get uh let's say you leave
a job are you fired or something and
then you're replaced by somebody
who's really good
you don't really like that do you
because you're like oh damn it I got
replaced by somebody who's better than
me that really stinks same as if you
have a breakup
you get replaced by somebody who's on a
better looking younger richer whatever
it is you're like ah damn that stinks
but it's worse
if you get replaced by somebody terrible
I mean it's bad both ways but if but if
you're running for president and you get
beaten by a brainless bag of meat
that's gotta sting
well who beat you
well it's almost a human being there was
a sort of a
semi-sention bag of meat
and beat me pretty heavily
that's gotta sting no wonder Trump's
having a hard time with it
um
Apparently one of the big topics that
the G20 will be climate change
and
I remind you this is a perfect example
that the public runs the government not
the other way around
the public runs the government not the
other way around now it's different than
maybe a dictator situation but in any
Democratic Republic kind of a situation
the people are in charge and why is it
that the politicians all have to say
good words about climate change when
they get together
is it because they as leaders
decided that's what they want to say
nope
nope they have to say these things in
public because the public requires it
The public's in charge the politicians
have to give the public what they ask
for or they can't stay in their jobs
here's the here's the catch though
we do delegate to our government
decisions that are close
in other words if the country is a
little bit closer to you know having
a mixed opinion on it
well then we say all right okay we can't
figure it out ourselves
so government you know go make a
decision and we'll live with it because
at least we'll we'll respect the system
even if we don't like the result
but
the public does that intentionally in a
sense because they can't make a decision
on their own but when the public wants
something let's say 90 to 10.
does the government have any any
flexibility
none if the government wants something
by a 90 majority the the people will get
what they want the government has to
give it to them
so if you're trying to guess something
don't convince the government
they're just listening to the people
you need to convince the other citizens
so so your power
play is to convince other people and
then other people when they get to some
majority will convince the government
but convincing the government of
anything is probably a waste of time
they're just responding to the the
biggest forces
never forget that you're in charge if
you need to be and if it's 50 50 well
maybe you just need a different system
and the government satisfies that
um
apparently Biden's playing the forgetful
old man card at the G20
so of course it was sort of awkward when
he meets France's head macron because it
was that thing where the U.S Australian
UK put together some submarine deal with
Australia
and uh cut cut France out of a you know
multi-billion submarine deal now France
was quite mad about that and here's what
Biden said to mccrone
um he said
uh that I'll give you his exact words
which are I Biden said he was quote
under the impression that France had
been informed long before
uh that the deal would not go through
meaning the French deal
so Biden actually used as his excuse
he didn't know that they hadn't been
informed
his excuses that he was uninformed about
some major thing happening in the
government
and that's
that's his excuse
um and he got away with it apparently
people could say yeah that makes sense
he probably did forget
um
so I guess we got that going for us now
um what do you think of Bitcoin anybody
um
what do you think of Bitcoin
and what do you think of Bitcoin in the
context of uh regular money being
inflated and and debt and all that
now I think it was uh uh Jack Dorsey who
was tweeting about Bitcoin and its
association with inflation
and he had some provocative tweets that
I thought were really good because they
were provocative you know really gotcha
it forced you to think about the
question so it was some good tweeting
there and
yeah Bitcoin is an outlet for inflation
so if you're worried about the value of
your regular money what would you do
you know how would you play that if you
were worried about your regular money
well some people are going to put their
money in Bitcoin but Bitcoin has its own
problems right because Bill Bitcoin is
not risk-free
um
and
but some percentage of the public is
going to put money there so what are the
odds that Bitcoin will grow
as inflation grows what do you think let
me give you let's get your prediction
rather than mine because I don't make uh
Financial advice here so nothing I say
should be Financial advice
uh what do you think
do you think that Bitcoin goes up
because it's a inflation
uh Escape valve
I almost all of you are saying yes
aren't you
now of course crypto is a psychological
money right and in in some ways or a lot
of ways regular money is psychological
too but not as sensitive to it
probably
um
some say Bitcoin is an inflation gauge
yeah
if I had to guess and again this is not
Financial advice and I should tell you
that I do own some Bitcoin not a ton so
Bitcoin is not a big part of my
portfolio but it could be someday it
might be most of it if things go the way
they're they're going so so my Bitcoin
exposure is small not enough to you know
really care
um and I do but I have more eth yeah
I have a much more eth than Bitcoin now
I think that those two cryptos just
because
um people know them the most they've
been around for a while I think people
go with what feels familiar
and while there will always be lots of
frothiness in the alt Coins world
uh the crypto coins I think the two that
people are just comfortable
hearing and using the most are just
going to grow because people are
comfortable hearing them and they better
out and that's all anybody's going to be
able to understand so if you expect the
public to understand that the
intricacies of cryptocurrency well not
many of them two percent maybe tops the
rest of the public is going to say I
guess I got to get into this crypto
thing
tell me the least amount you can tell me
that will let me get into it and you
know stay out of trouble
and now if you're going to give somebody
advice and you couldn't educate them
completely and you just wanted to make
it simple what would you advise them
here's what I would advise them
it is the time to at least diversify
into some crypto
anybody agree how many would agree that
it's the time maybe it wasn't always but
it is certainly the time now that if you
don't own some crypto probably a mistake
you know if you're 90 crypto that's
probably a different mistake you could
it could work out well for you it might
work out really well but you know in
terms of uh statistically it would be a
mistake
so here's what I think I think because
the uneducated
masses are likely to start looking
around for alternatives
I think they're going to go to the the
big names just like people buy Apple
because it's safe they buy IBM because
it's safe they buy Microsoft because
it's safe they shop at Amazon because
it's safe
relative to something they don't know
anything about so if I had to guess the
psychology of this is that inflation
will make crypto seem like a smarter
move a less risky move because the
alternative is more risky now and that
the
Bitcoin and East will be the big Winners
there will also be some minor coins that
do well but those will be exceptions
all right let's talk about something
else the uh Lincoln project
has taken responsibility for a I guess a
fake demonstration in which they had
people with tiki torches pretending to
be conservatives
um pretending to support uh Glenn
youngin the Republican now what they
were trying to do is associate Junction
with the Charlottesville fine people
hoax because most of their voters don't
know it was a hoax
most of the Democrats still think the
fine people hoax was something that
actually happened they don't know it was
a fake edit of the video and if you ask
them they'll say Scott you're so wrong
about this because I saw the whole video
I saw it with my eyes I heard it with my
ears but of course they didn't they saw
an edited version that they thought was
a complete one
now
um here's the funny part
somebody named Lauren Windsor tweeted in
my capacity as a communications
consultant I worked with project Lincoln
which is a weird thing to admit in
public
if you were trying to sell your services
would you admit you had worked on the
Lincoln project
it feels pretty dicey I'm not sure I
would admit that if I wanted to sell my
service to anybody else
and she said that she worked with them
to coordinate today's a young kin action
in Charlottesville
meaning the fake protest thing uh and
she says I joined them in the fight to
defend our democracy from right-wing
extremists and call for Glenn youngkin
to denounce Trump's quote very fine
people
so she's a communications consultant who
either doesn't know that the fine people
hoax was a hoax which is a big problem
if you're in the political world and you
don't know that's a hoax that's a pretty
big problem or
doesn't either knows it and is lying or
doesn't know it which do you think
in the comments
tell me do you think that uh Lauren
Windsor is lying
when she references the fine people hoax
or do you think she doesn't know it's a
hoax
what do you think
most of you think she's lying I'm going
to go against your opinion
it has been my experience that the left
actually believes it's true
and I can tell you from one personal
conversation with one person in the news
business
uh you know your prominent news person I
won't mention a name because it doesn't
matter but I've had an extensive
conversation with somebody who reports
the news for for a living
and that person absolutely believed it
was true absolutely it was a long
conversation and there's no way they
were lying it was somebody who
absolutely believed it was true
now when I was done
I'm not sure he believed it was
completely true
and I'm not sure he believed
that Trump was completely off the hook
but I probably changed at least the way
he was thinking about it I think at the
end of the conversation yeah it doesn't
matter who your guesses are
I'm not going to respond to your guesses
because because the person the
personality doesn't matter
it's not about the personality it's
about the fact that somebody in the
business really thought it was true
genuinely really thought it was true
and I think that's probably what's going
on I think they do
all right uh somebody named uh Sean Puri
if I'm pronouncing it right probably not
I was writing about the metaverse
uh you know of course that's uh the
company formerly known as Facebook now
called meta they're they're going to
build these Virtual Worlds it's going to
be Facebook's new big thing but here's
what uh this tweet thread which I
tweeted and I recommend from Sean Curie
how do you pronounce s-h-a-a-n
Sean or do you do you give some love to
each of the A's sha on
how would you pronounce it
I don't know we'll work on the
pronunciation but he points out that um
our real lives you know in the in the
physical world are gradually being
sucked into the digital world and and
his argument is just really elegant and
he's talking about how when TV came
we we sort of got a little bit of our
attention got absorbed into television
and then computers came and a little bit
more of our real life got pulled into
the digital world in terms of where our
attention is and then phones came and
suddenly like 75 of your life is now
like a digital virtual life about things
that are happening digitally he says
meta will just put you over the top
it will be the the crossing point
where the virtual world is your real
world the one you prefer the one you
care about the one you're interested in
and your real world the one you think is
your real world will be one you try to
avoid as much as possible
you're going to have to spend some time
there to you know do some basic stuff
but you might be able to work and live
and have sex in in a forum uh you might
be able to have relationships foreign
families have lives in in the
um in the digital world
and here's the thing for those of you
who have not experienced VR yet even
just to demonstrate it for a minute put
on the goggles and see what it's like
if you think
it will not be
um addictive enough to get you
you haven't tried it
yeah I tell you the experience of
actually trying it will change
everything you think about it even with
the current technology that's not so
great
um
I think you're going to block the uh
I'll just give you one warning here I'm
going to start blocking whoever is doing
the the red herring comments there's
somebody over there who wants to say red
herring red herring uh about something I
don't know what it is so I'm not going
to comment on it but I'm going to start
blocking you because you're really
annoying
okay
um and by the way you could just tell me
what it means or what it is and I'd be
happy to look at it but just saying
those words over and over again
uh if I see it again
um I'm just going to make you go away
okay
I'm sure I'll see it in half a second so
I can make you go away
all right I guess somebody doesn't want
to go away
um
and I love this argument that we're
being dragged into it but all I'm going
to warn you is that I've spent some time
in the virtual world and it's good
and in many ways it will just be better
than regular life pretty quickly it's
guaranteed
um
AOC doesn't like meta the company
formerly known as Facebook
and she says it's a meta as she tweeted
meta as in quote we are a Cancer to
democracy
um metastasizing into a global
surveillance and propaganda machine for
boosting Authority or Thera
authoritarian authoritarian
easy for you to say authoritarian
regimes and destroying Civil Society
for-profit
now
Facebook is hated by the left and the
right
and yet growing like crazy
so I don't think anything can stop it
because I think both the left and the
right complain like crazy and then use
it
they complain and then they use it so as
long as they use it it's going to keep
being whatever it is
um here's a topic that I have avoided
for uh
personal emotional reasons
so there's an important topic and I just
haven't been able to talk about it
because it kind of still hurts too much
if I'm being honest Michael
schellenberger is doing great work
trying to get something done about the
the homeless and the addiction problem
in San Francisco in particular but you
could generalize this to other other
cities and one of his main points is
that because we're so Progressive
progressives have said they would rather
addicts die on the street in effect
than to be forced
into something they didn't want to do
which is to get treatment and medical
help where do you where do you stand on
that because I know a lot of my audience
is pro
um make your own decision and a lot of
you are hey the government shouldn't
Force anybody to do anything
but what if you're an addict and your
brain no longer is your own brain
because I don't know if you understand
this but an addict
doesn't have a brain in the way that
regular people are brains and addicts
brain is it's like effectively like an
alien took it over but the alien is the
drug
so a person who's an addict can't make
decisions
let me just say that as clearly as
possible if you expect an addict
to make a decision
you don't understand what addiction is
they don't make decisions
the drug does
the drug makes them do what they do
so there's no the concept of some free
will decision making it doesn't apply to
an addict now I would argue it doesn't
apply to anybody but it definitely
doesn't apply to an addict the addict is
just responding to what the drug is
making them do
so the thought that the progressive
thought that
um addicts should have the same let's
say
civil rights
as other people I know it's it's a dicey
situation right
the fact that addicts have the same
civil rights as other people I think you
have to question it
because they're not like other people
we don't treat people with a functioning
brain
the same as someone who doesn't have one
and I would argue that an addict doesn't
have a functioning brain because it's
now dysfunctional because of the the
drug
um
yeah you could throw you could throw
alcohol in here if you wanted but the
the overdoses are mostly from the other
kinds of drugs
so
I think I'm on board and having gone
through this and the reason it's a
sensitive topic if anybody doesn't know
my stepson died of an overdose in 2018
at age 19. so this topic is just so
painful for me that I've I've ignored it
you know even though I should be an
activist and have been uh it's just hard
for me to
spend time thinking about this stuff
because it just hurts too much but
um
and by the way
let me tell you something that you might
not be aware of I I've had a number of
people who died you know in my lifetime
parents grandparents you know usually
older people when when somebody who's
elderly dies in your life you'll you'll
be sad
but it's not a tragedy and you don't see
them everywhere you go like in your mind
you know because when people are ready
to die you know you just accept that as
part of the cycle and you move on
when a child dies and this would apply
to a stepchild who's you know been part
of your life for a long time when a
stepchild dies they never die
they just don't stay dead
that my stepchild is everywhere I go all
the time
he's he's just there and I don't know if
that's the case for everybody who loses
a child
but uh three years later
he's everywhere
he's
no
still change the topic
that's why I don't talk about it
all right
um here's my favorite story of the day
I'll start with this as a lead up to it
um ATT
um they must be experiencing a lot of
cancellations because if you haven't
heard ATT decided to go full racist
I it's really shocking so in particular
they've decided to be anti-white and
they're actually training the employees
to consider white people the enemy and
the source of all racism Etc and you
know while there's some
factual truth
of course that white people were behind
slavery and lots of other things I mean
I'm not arguing the factual the reality
of it I'm just arguing that if you're a
major company you can't Target an ethnic
group and get away with it you can't
Target an ethnic group I don't care
which one
and get away with it okay and what have
I told you about the public The public's
in charge
ATT doesn't won't do this if the public
doesn't want them to in large enough
percentage and in this case it's not
going to take a large number of people
to cancel their service if 10 percent of
people cut canceled their service over
this
I think the CEO would be replaced
wouldn't they you don't think you can
get 10 percent of the public to cancel
ATC service
um over the fact that they're blatantly
racist and uh and this is not even an
interpretation
I'm just telling you what they say
right they're demonizing white people
uh I'm not making it up you can check
for yourself
and
I would have to think that by now just
just based on the number of people in my
own
follower base the number of people who
told me that they canceled ATT this week
it's pretty big on YouTube now on on the
locals platform a lot of people canceled
ATT this week how many of you are
looking into it or on YouTube
uh the followers there how many looked
into it
um at least considered it
and I see a yes looking into it I'm just
reading some I'm considering it
uh hell yeah I canceled it today I am
now yes
uh too much hassle yeah yes I'm looking
definitely gonna do it looking yes me
okay so look at the comments a lot of
yeses now we can't get a sense of the
percentage right because the people who
are going to cancel are the ones who are
going to answer here so I don't know if
that's a big number or not
but given that there are
3 200 people on here that's a lot of
yeses isn't it
um again I don't know that that's a lot
of yeses because I don't know how many
no's there are but it looks like it I
mean anecdotally it looks like a lot but
we can't be sure
all right so here's the point
um I wonder if their board has
taken up this issue yet
because they have to be noticing it
I think they're going to notice the
cancellations and in my opinion the
company needs to be driven in a business
I think that this is a big enough
offense that the actual the company
needs to be bankrupted for it
and
um the alternative would be for the CEO
to resign or or be replaced I would
accept that but you know if they change
the policy at the same time but uh you
can't let a major American company be
overtly racist and stay in business we
we don't do that in America
that's just not American
so if you want to be anti-American and
sell to Americans good luck
good luck and by the way I don't think
it's just white people are complaining
like don't you think that some black
people are saying um
this is what we were fighting against
racial profiling
you don't think there's some black
people I mean I've heard from them so I
know I know that there are
there's some black people who don't like
ATT targeting white people
because as soon as you say it's okay to
Target a group
you're causing some problems
all right
um and I'm going to dovetail from that
story into this one my favorite story of
the day by far do you all know who uh
Ibrahim uh Kennedy is
Abram Kendy apparently a very smart guy
I think he's uh
some uh award-winning scholarly person
so very smart guy
and he's one of the major
forces behind
let's say educating people about
systemic racism and and pushing the
education of the public on race
Etc
and he tweeted something
uh
which he had to delete
this is so delicious I'm doing it slowly
I want you all to get a good dose of
this one
so here was his tweet
which he deleted quickly he said more
than a third of white students lied
about their race on college applications
and about half of these applicants lied
about being Native American
more than three-fourths of these
students who lied about their race were
accepted
do you know why he deleted it
now I I don't know that the information
is wrong the information is probably
right I haven't seen it challenged but
why would he delete that tweet
well Andy now has an opinion about this
Andy no uh responded by showing the
deleted tweet and he tweeted himself
Andy did race activist Ibrahim Kennedy
tweeted out a report claiming High
numbers of white students falsely
identify as people of color to reap
benefits he deleted the Tweet after
realizing it didn't Advance his argument
that whites are privileged in every way
how delicious is this
the white people who were lying about
their race on college applications were
doing it for money
they were doing they were lying for
money
meaning that they would get into a
better College have a better job or they
would maybe get a scholarship
they were lying
for money
can uh can white people get money
just by saying they're white people
apparently not but if you say you're
another race you can get advantages
like really big ones
like being accepted into a college you
wouldn't be accepted in maybe or getting
a scholarship you wouldn't forgotten
otherwise maybe
this is a pretty big advantages
so uh
I don't think
uh Mr Kennedy got exactly what he wanted
with this comment and it's funny that it
took him a moment
to realize it was counter to his entire
reason for existence
his entire reason for existence
is this now as many of you know I also
identify as black
why
why
because I can
that's one reason no so first of all
there's no there's no limitation because
the the current rules the 2020 run rules
uh that you can identify with wherever
you have the most affinity
and I feel a strong Affinity to the
black population in America
partly because I was so discriminated
against in my own employment for my race
partly because I just like black people
and uh I like
sort of being on the team I liked how I
like to be on a winning team exactly
so uh
so I identify now
do you think that these students were
lying or were they identifying
were they lying
or were they identifying because if they
were identifying as fine
if they were lying well then they're
Liars nobody can support that
but I don't support that you lie about
it I support the I support that you
literally identify as whatever group
gets you the most benefits
and here's the cool part
you can change it anytime you want
so you could be filling out your college
application and identify as Native
American or black or whatever you wanted
and as soon as you've handed it in
you could say I'm going to the store now
I'm going to go shopping I'm going to
identify as white so people don't follow
me around and think I'm going to steal
something
and then as soon as you leave the store
and nobody has followed you around for
suspected stealing
and you've got to apply for a job
identify as black apply for the job get
the job keep your identification
identification as black until you need
to change it
now I don't see any problem with that
under the current rules do you and I
didn't make the rules
I'm not suggesting a rule change I'm
saying those are the current rules have
I ever told you how to destroy a bad
idea a bad policy
in the comments tell me what's one and
maybe the only way to destroy a bad idea
that's policy or or a law what's how do
you destroy a bad idea
you embrace it exactly
you can't do it by criticizing them
you can't you can't make a bad thing go
away by criticizing it because whoever
did it in the first place still thinks
it's a good idea but you can adopt it
you can embrace it
and you can use it for all it's worth
and you know what happens when you
embrace it
the system collapses because it was a
bad rule the reason it's a bad rule is
that if everybody embraced it things
would go to hell
so if you want it to go away just
embrace it
embrace it what do you think these
college students did when they uh they
said that they were Native American or
some other person of color what do you
think they were doing
lie
were they lying
or were they embracing it
probably a little both
but the ones who were embracing it hard
they're my heroes
yeah it's hard to know if anybody was
doing anything but just lying for money
but if they were if they were
consciously embracing it to break the
rule
and they got away with it
Heroes total Heroes so if you get to the
point where 100 of the students identify
as people of color
problem solved
problem solved it's the bulworth theory
except accelerated do you know the movie
bulworth it was a uh eccentric
politician
who said a lot of outrageous things that
he was running for president in this
movie
and one of the outrageous things he said
is that and I have to use the f word
here because it's a quote right so send
send the children away there'll be an f
word here but it's somebody else's
he said why don't we just all until
we're all brown
just just everybody until
everybody's Brown and then problem
solved no racism
of course it would be racism because we
just find other reasons to dislike each
other you know the left-handed people
would be in trouble or something we'd
find some reason to discriminate because
that's who we are
uh but I think I think if a third of
students said this and many of them got
an advantage from it
what's it going to look like next year
next year if you found out that three
quarters of the people who lied on their
application got a financial benefit from
it and no penalty
what's going to happen next year
well it's not going to be one-third
might be two-thirds so next year it
might be two-thirds of all the
applicants are pretending to be or
identifying with another race
so I think that's the most delicious
story of the day in my opinion all right
here's a question for you
um if you get a for the people getting
booster shots
if you've already gotten two shots of
the same type let's say two modernas or
you got two pfizers apparently now
they're going to open it up they're your
booster shot could be a different
vaccination
and I think the idea is that they've
tested and they found your antibodies
still look good no matter which you
boost whether it's the same or or a
different one
but on top of that on top of that
um you know might make it easier for
supplies more availability because you
don't have to worry about which one
you're getting Etc so there could be a
whole bunch of benefits for that
but there's one obvious problem isn't it
isn't there one obvious problem
and that
if you were worried about the safety of
the vaccination itself
aren't you doubling your risk by doing a
second one
am I wrong about that so I need a I need
a medical opinion on this
medical opinion so I've taken two
modernist shots if I were to get a
booster I would personally this is my
own thinking so I'm not recommending
this to you but my own thinking says I
should get the same shot again
here's why
because the first two didn't kill me
I had no known side effects from the
first two shots
would you get a separate vaccination
if you were a little bit worried about
the side effects knowing that the first
two you got didn't hurt you
wouldn't you get the same kind of third
time
am I wrong about that
I'm seeing lots of no's so but I don't
know which question you're saying no to
now I get the idea now I would imagine
that there's a benefit from getting a
separate one which is that if if the one
vaccine protects you in a particular way
and another vaccine added a different
way to protect you
a little more protection but don't you
open yourself way up to one of the
vaccinations being more dangerous than
the other
and you you switch to the one that gave
you a specifically a problem
okay so I see some people agreeing with
me but I don't know if we're medically
smart about this this is the type of
question where you can where your common
sense can
get you to the wrong place my common
sense says do the same kind
but I don't know if the medical
community would agree with that because
they're recommending the different kind
here
so I'm a little confused about why
they're recommending this without a
caveat
uh somebody's sent to me on Twitter
a long text thing by an Australian
engineer he's an engineering PhD so
somebody who's really good at analyzing
things and this gentleman I think he's
Australian did a deep dive into all the
covid data you know really went to like
base you know fundamental uh data you
know really dug in further than any of
us would or probably could
and
um he had a number of questions now if
you read the questions they're very
provocative like huh if this is the data
then why is this true
and there were so many of the questions
that it turned into what somebody called
a uh
a Gish Gallop which I'd never heard of
have you ever heard of that term a Gish
gallop g-i-s-h
uh maybe it was named after somebody
called Gish but the idea is that you
overwhelm with so many points that if
somebody tries to argue with you they
can only they only have time to argue a
point or two and then you can say oh
well okay maybe you win on that point or
two but I had all these other points so
I still went
so basically it's a way to win an
argument by overwhelming with so many
points that the other team just can't
deal with them all and then you could
always go away and say well you didn't
deal with them all
and I've called that the laundry list
approach the laundry list
and I've recommended that there is a way
to deal with it the way you deal with
the laundry list
is you ask for the most um the most uh
let's say powerful Point what's your
best point
give me your best point and if I can
debunk your best point can we agree that
all the rest of them are are weaker than
that and this one got debunked
so you should go back and rethink your
other points I think that's the only way
to do it
um now when I first heard this term a
Gish Gallup the first thing I thought is
it sounds like uh any weekend for Tiger
Woods
uh but that's just me
I'm just gonna let that sit there for a
moment
the Gish Gallop is like any weekend for
Tiger Woods
anybody anybody
no no nobody
does anybody appreciate that joke
nobody apparently apparently that was
just for me okay
um
but
here are some of the questions that the
engineer asked
uh why is it that so many old people
were dying right after the vaccination
if the vaccinations are safe
why according to some data source were
so many old people dying right after the
vaccination how can you explain that
that's the question right
well I can answer that
is there anybody here who can't answer
that why did so many old people die
after getting vaccinated
it might have something to do with the
fact that the order of vaccination was
people closest to death first
I'm just going to guess
that if you were almost ready to die
anyway
wouldn't you expect that group to have a
lot of deaths after a vaccination
because you could walk into any old
folks home and juggle let's just say
you're a juggler and you go to the old
folks home and you just start juggling
do you think any old people will die
within two weeks after you juggled
probably probably
yeah so I don't know if that's the
answer but
it seems obvious to me
um one of the questions was why did the
regular flu disappear
why did all indications of the normal
seasonal flu just disappear no I've
asked this question myself
what do you think is the answer
why did the regular flu
disappear now one would be that the
regular flu
is being misdiagnosed as covet
that seems likely right good chance the
regular flu is being misdiagnosed as
covid maybe but I would think a hundred
percent of the people who were who had
the regular flu and thought it was
covered
would get a test wouldn't they wouldn't
everybody who had symptoms get a test
these days at least in the United States
so I'm not so sure that's the
explanation and I don't think he was
suggesting this explanation
um here's why I think the regular flu
disappeared
somebody says kid's not in school but
there were a lot of places where kids
were in school
right and doesn't seem to make a
difference
so in other countries the regular flu
disappeared and in other countries they
went to school
do you think it's because masks are
really good against the regular flu
maybe the masks are really good but only
for the regular flu not for covet
do you think
I don't think that's the answer
Robin says here we go
all right yeah the the people
the people who think that I'm cleverly
trying to convince you to wear masks or
to get vaccinated or anything you're all
wrong you're all completely wrong
so you can't read my mind but let me
tell you what's in there nothing about
telling you what to do
and and I'm anti-mask at this point in
the pandemic I'm anti-mask
except in special situations
um here's why I think the regular flu
disappeared
it was never real
that's why I think the regular flu
deaths disappeared because they were
never real
there were always estimates based on the
seasonality there would be a seasonal
bump in total deaths and people would
say well we don't have any other way to
explain it it's probably those flu
deaths
Maybe
but I think when you started counting
and you couldn't find any you know once
we got really serious about oh you got
some symptoms we're going to test those
symptoms and then they tested them it
wasn't the regular flu
I have a feeling that the regular flu
was always in terms of the
deaths not in terms of whether people
had the regular flu
yeah and I've never known anybody who
died from it now if you talk to doctors
doctors will tell you they do see people
die from flu so it's not like it didn't
happen
but
um it's also very old people frail
people
Etc
all right
um
that
was just about everything I want to talk
to talk about today I'll uh try to
figure out what's
um
CDC reports pin deaths weekly what
uh
oh did I recover did I recover well
enough to salvage this terrible live
stream
oh I have good news on the cat being
asked on an update on the cat so my cat
had a uh tentative probably cancer
diagnosis that turned into
absolutely no cancer so when the most
sensitive test was run it was not there
so Boo the cat will go on to a long
healthy life we think
we think
um
you wanted to see a printer
defenestrated yeah well you missed it
when I did my last one
yes and um the person least surprised
was me
here's why I didn't think it was real
cancer have I ever told you to follow
the money
yeah I didn't have to tell you that
right well you're trying to figure out
what is true and what is not
follow the money works so often
that it's amazing and I'm not even sure
that it's people making a conscious
decision to follow the money because I
don't even know why it works because I'm
pretty sure a lot of people don't do
that here's why I thought it was not
true from the start
the so-called maybe cancer was
discovered while fixing a different
problem
which is she had some polyps that she
had some surgery to remove them in her
inner ear
and it was causing some balance problems
and stuff and
when they did the surgery they found
some suspicious stuff and they said this
could either be a signal from the
surgery itself just inflation yeah
inflammation or it could be cancer
now what are the odds
that they would find this cancer in a
youngish cat she's not that old
what are the odds they would find this
cancer and the Very place that they were
looking for something else and found the
something else
and that in the process of finding and
removing the something else definitely
would cause something to look exactly
like cancer which I think was more white
belt blood cells or something
now how expensive is it to figure out if
you have cancer for sure
really expensive
and what happens if you do have cancer
really expensive
if you're going to treat it
now
so we did more tests follow the money
the money you would have suggested that
there would be more tests sure enough
there were more tests next test run was
ambiguous
it was ambiguous
because it was an insensitive test so
what do you do if you get an ambiguous
test well you got to do the expensive
one you got to do the expensive one and
so that's what we did now all along I
said to myself it seems like this would
be a very big coincidence
a very big coincidence that we discover
cancer
well here's another fact a cat that has
this particular cancer
is going to die in a few months
right this one will get you in a few
months
what are the odds that that little
period of the cat's life those few
months would be exactly the only time we
did a surgery
and discovered this this cancer and not
only discovered it but discovered it so
early that there were no symptoms
right there are no lumps or anything
like that what are the odds so I said
from day one follow the money it looks
like this is not real and sure enough it
wasn't
it wasn't
so I don't know that
um I actually like my veterinarian a lot
and I don't believe
that she was just following the money
but I do think
that it's weird coincidence that you
could predict it always goes that way
now she has another problem which says
she still has the infection that caused
the original surgery to happen
but there's some drugs you give her you
could give her drugs
but you have to give her to her for two
months and then she'll be fine
the alternative is a hyperbaric Beric
chamber
and the vet explained to me yesterday
you if you want an even better result
you could take her to a hyperbaric
chamber frequently for two weeks
for these what I assume are super
expensive treatments that traumatize
your cat
and then you could be a little more
certain that the antibiotics work
but the antibiotics will probably work
even without that
now I said stop stop stop I'm not going
to drive to Oakland many times in the
next two weeks
to do or this really expensive thing
that I could do at home and just give
her drugs every day
so
the fall of the money just works almost
every time here's a little experiment
for you next time you can't decide what
to eat at a restaurant
ask the server which of the two things
that you're you've narrowed it down to
which is the two things they recommend
are they ever going to recommend the
less expensive of the two items you say
which one which one is better do people
like this one or this one more
I've been tracking this for decades 100
of the time the server recommends the
expensive one
one hundred percent of the time
now are they lying
I don't know I actually don't know
because I don't think it makes that much
difference to them that the customer
gets the one that's a dollar more right
you know their tip goes up by 20 cents
but they're certainly going to sell that
one
and it's you know and maybe the
restaurant requires them to upsell that
one
but but watch for this watch how many
times you can't identify the mechanism
for why following the money would be
predictive
you look at it you say yeah I get what
you're saying follow the money should
work but the people involved definitely
don't care about the money in this case
because that's quite often right you can
identify a lot of people who as far as
you can tell are not in it for the money
it could be the the pope you know just
you can imagine lots of situations where
you're convinced it's not about the
money
still make your prediction as if it were
and you're going to be right not every
time
but a lot
yes it explains the hostility toward
Ivermectin
even if it's not the reason
that's
that's a perfect example all right
Ivermectin is a perfect example I I
don't have any evidence that the reason
Ivermectin is being crapped on is that
some Pharma company will make more money
if that's not available I have no
evidence
that I've seen
to suggest that's what's happening
however if you made a prediction based
on follow the money and that would be an
obvious way to follow it you would get
to the same you would get to the right
conclusion which is that it would be
diminished by everybody who's you know
got a got a foot in that world
yeah
um
I think if you're dealing with you know
the Pharma companies is is definitely
about the money
uh
what do I know about January 6 and who
planned it well I know what's in the
media
um
but I also know more about the world
so you're never going to know you're
never gonna know what I know about that
that will never come out but I don't
have any information that says the FBI
was behind it
so I have no information to suggest the
FBI was behind or that they weren't I
have no information on that I don't
think it's part of the story
uh if it is it's a small Spark
if Trump ran as a Democrat he could uh
blow up the progressives in the party
interesting idea he won't do that but
uh will Tucker be canceled I don't think
so
uh I think Tucker is a pretty big part
of fox news's uh profit model
uh
Ray Epps I don't know who he is
The Lazy Man's Guide to Enlightenment
sounds good
um Trump should run as an independent
now they never get elected
yeah Tucker might be too big to cancel
that's right
you know and the other thing that Tucker
has going for him is that when he's
wrong he tells you
that's a that's a good production uh
protection
now I said this the other day and I
don't think Tucker Carlson gets enough
credit for this that when he's wrong he
says it directly and he says it pretty
quickly he doesn't make you wait for it
and I think that keeps you safe
because he can say something that was
pretty outrageous as long as it was you
know an honest opinion and I think you
say okay I was wrong about that
yeah now now that you mentioned it I'm
wrong
um
look into ray-ups he incited the crowd
somebody says I don't know who's Ray
Epps
somebody says Tucker is pro-white
well I'm pretty sure Tucker is pro
people
and some of them are white
um if if his beat seems more pro-white
than some other person that probably has
more to do with the audience
oh Epps is a fat informant okay
uh rayups was a director of provocateur
and and he was not arrested
and he was uh so Vernon tweet somebody
tweeted about this
rayapse was paid by the FBI to cause the
Insurrection ah okay I'm gonna doubt
that story let me let me give you some
let me tell you what it sounds like
a little bit too too on the nose
like
I'm saying that if you hear that story
for the first time
and you hear that there was in fact a
specific FBI agent who was paid to
incite a riot
the first thing you should think is is
probably not true
that should be your default assumption
probably not true and why it's two on
the nose
doesn't mean it's false
right I'm open to the possibility
doesn't mean it's false
all I'm going to say for sure
is that it doesn't sound true
I could be wrong but if you always bet
against everything that sounds too
perfect just always bet against that
you'll be right ninety percent of the
time
but you know 10 is real so maybe it's
real
uh watch the video oh is this based on
the uh
Tucker Carlson video did that come out
the special he did
he's on several videos inciting the
people to go in
and has he been confirmed to be a FBI
asset I assume sour you wouldn't be
saying this
um
I have a
uh
yes old people die from the flu
I think it happens I don't think it
happens in the numbers we've been told
um
all right I'll watch the uh Tucker
package on it
yeah I heard about the Whitmer situation
but fill in the blanks for me why why
would the FBI do me doing that complete
the picture for me in the comments I
think you have enough room in the
comments can somebody complete the
picture let's say it's true and I'm I'm
not stipulating that but let's say just
to think it through
imagine if there was an FBI informant
let's say it's this Ray apps guy and
let's say the FBI paid him to help
encourage the they're saying why do you
do it
why would he do it
FBI works for China
you know I don't see that
to draw out the righties
that doesn't feel like a good plan Maybe
um
to hates FBI hates Trump I don't know
that's a weird plan
for somebody who hates Trump
yeah so you've got a problem there don't
you
to blame the psy up on Trump
um that's kind of assuming too much
intelligence and foresight if you
imagine that the FBI informant did it
for the purpose of making Trump look bad
that maybe that's a pretty big stretch
and I would say that's not a plan any
rational person would try to do
now I do know the you know
various agencies have done a lot of
clever things but that feels not certain
enough in other words you couldn't know
with enough certainty that you would get
a good output from that so that the risk
of doing it would be greater than the
the likely payoff
somebody said didn't say he was rational
so you think there was an irrational FBI
agent irrationally
okay you see you see where this all fall
apart
I think you're watching it
yeah false flag
so all right to do a false flag to do a
false flag you'd have to have reasonable
uh reasonable confidence would work
right so let's say in Syria if somebody
did a false lag about a chemical attack
would they have a reasonable
reasonable chance of getting away with
it and not much uh penalty if they
didn't
so let's say you you staged a false flag
chemical attack in Syria I'm not saying
that happened but let's say you did
if it didn't work would there be any
penalty to you the people who put on the
hoax no no there would be no penalty it
would just be a hoax that didn't work
now suppose it did work there'd be a big
payoff right because you might change
the military balance there so it makes
complete sense
that somebody in Syria would try to fake
a chemical attack do a you know a false
flag attack complete sense because the
payoff is obvious there's no downside
but the potential payoff is huge and
it's hard to see it going wrong
it's hard to imagine how that could have
gone wrong
but now take the alleged Ray Epson
convincing people to attack the capital
could he have known with reasonable
confidence
that that would result in people
disliking Trump more without collateral
problems such as deaths
I don't think you could do that
now explain the steel dossier yeah I can
do that
so now explain the steel dossier because
in some ways that that look like a an op
the steel dossia dossier only had to
convince the fake news
to tell a fake story that was bad for
Trump
what are the odds that that would
succeed anybody it's a fake story
and they only have to convince the fake
news to tell it that's it it doesn't
have to be true
that's easy right so it's easy to do a
fake flag attack and you could even
predict it if the upside is tremendous
and predictable all right it's very
predictable that the fake news is going
to report this story even if they
retracted it later it would still work
because they would report it up to that
point
now what are the odds that Christopher
Steele thought that he would come out
behind by doing this
well he was getting paid
there was every reason to believe it
would work
and
he didn't go to jail
right
so he did something that was a low risk
to him
that a huge potential payoff and it was
very predictable the payoff very
predictable that would work under those
conditions what are the odds of a false
flag really good
really good it's a perfect condition
but I would argue that the September the
January 6th stuff
is exactly not like that
you wouldn't know what could happen from
a march on the capital
because that's the whole problem right
you didn't know if it'd go peaceful you
didn't know if it'd go dangerous and if
it went dangerous how dangerous and you
just wouldn't know
so I don't believe
that anybody rational would have done a
full slag of that nature because it
doesn't fit the model that you would do
a false flag for
um
Scott's assessment of odds are not
convincing well you know the beauty of
my argument when I put it in terms of
the odds is that you can take the the
structure of the argument and just put
in your own odds and then you might get
a different you might get a different
opinion
uh
not a false flag merely a framing
well it would be a false flag in terms
of who initiated it but yes I think I
would take that I take that correction
it might be more of a framing situation
framing as in framing somebody for it
but I guess that's a false flag isn't it
um
top three ways to detect fake news
okay number one
it's reported uh as true on only one of
the big Networks
if CNN says it's true and Fox News says
it isn't probably isn't true
but also the other way around if Fox
news says it's true and CNN says that
never happened probably didn't
so that's the first rule both networks
have to repeat it have to report it the
same or it's probably not true
uh secondly is it too on the nose
it's just a little too perfect that
story is a little too perfect right
number three
follow the money
right if following the money suggests
that the news uh is probably fake
it's very predictive
very predictive now not always you know
not a guarantee in fact none of these
rules are guarantees but they're I think
you get to the 90 range ninety percent
uh predictive
let's identify a h
all right
uh
here's somebody who's coming back with
the red herring stuff
so let me hide you on this channel
all right um
oh here's one the payoff of January 6
was that the FBI did not have to
investigate voter fraud
uh that's that's maybe too clever
because I don't think
well I see what you're saying
I see what you're saying but that would
be pretty risky
I just don't see the FBI doing risky
plays
it's the wrong Organization for risky
plays
um
FBI is dirty well
every
open your eyes Scott
so Z3 gurgling says open your eyes Scott
in all caps I'm going to close your eyes
as you are now
hidden from this channel
um
what's the risk you have a guy what's
the risk the risk is getting caught and
then finding out that the FBI was beyond
it that's the risk
um
by the indicators is Hunter's laptop
fake
um no because although CNN was at first
trying to sell you the idea that it
might have been a Russian plant they
have backed off that so I don't believe
CNN is reporting it's a fake
so now you have both networks reporting
it was a real laptop
so I think that works
uh so certainly
um
when did the FBI get in court ever
matter
well I don't know the history but it
would have to matter
um
everybody who's
doing this gets hidden on the channel
now all references to that
okay
um
just trying to get rid of some more of
the
everybody who's saying the red herring
thing I don't I don't care if you're the
troll or talking about the troll I'm
hiding all of you
just annoyed because you don't tell me
what that's about if I knew what it was
about I probably wouldn't care
um
all right just spend a moment looking at
your comments because there's a lot of
a lot of pushback
now
but hear me clearly
I'm not saying it's impossible that the
FBI
did some kind of a weird false flag or
they're guilty of something
that's possible I just don't see it yet
meaning that the the story's got a hole
in it doesn't kind of hold together to
me
um
I don't think there's zero risk to the
reputation of the FBI there's only zero
risk to the agent
so if it was an FBI thing as opposed to
you know independent actor the FBI would
never I just can't see them authorizing
that too easy to get caught
too much of a downside
unclear that the upside even exists I
don't see it
um
you will be persuaded Ellen says
possible
I'm open to being persuaded on that by
the way if you think I've closed the
door on that I haven't I just what I've
seen is not persuasive what you've seen
seems to be persuasive maybe there's
something else you've seen but I'll look
into it I'll watch the uh Tucker Carlson
package by the way that's up now right
explain the Whitmer plot
um I believe the Whitmer plot was not
intended to actually kidnap her was it
now the I don't know if I have the
details right but wasn't the story that
an FBI informant
was getting getting a bunch of uh
um who were they militia
to come up with a plan to kidnap Whitmer
but I don't believe there was any
intention that they would actually
kidnap Whitmer right
isn't it uh
isn't it routine for the FBI to maybe
get people to plan a crime and then stop
it before it happens
have you read anything by Nasim Talib
well yes I read I read the Black Swan
stuff
um but later after listening to him on
Facebook I'm sorry listening to him on
Twitter I ended up blocking him and uh I
don't consider him a useful voice
um he has I don't want to diagnose
somebody I don't know and I'm not a
doctor
but whatever Talib has going on
is influencing his
um opinions and communication there's
something going on with him that doesn't
have to do with the art the arguments
and I I don't know what it is but uh
I don't see him as being a useful voice
at this point
um
same Whitmer agents said to Insight to
January 6.
it might be the same people
but
um I don't believe that the FBI gets
people to do actual violent crimes just
so they can accomplish something
is there any precedent for that
is there a precedent for the FBI getting
people to do the actual crime as opposed
to arresting them before it happens
has that ever happened
um
the Whitmer kidnapping
Crews lead agent and two of his
underlings have been kicked out of the
FBI one for being a wife beater that
seems coincidental
did I hear Michael schellenberger on Joe
Rogan you know I love Joe Rogan and I
love Michael schellenberger I think I
know the arguments so I'm not sure I
would have to follow all three hours of
it my only problem with Joe Rogan shows
is three is is long
now if you want long content that's
exactly what you want but I rarely can
consume long content
um
see
Craig Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto
all right
how would we know by the nature we can't
know if it worked well maybe that's a
good point but also uh
the people doing it couldn't have known
it would work out there's no way they
could have known that
and it didn't work out did it
um
many of the islamo plots were done the
same way
um
Martin Luther King well that's sort of
ancient
yes FBI agents in Boston uh John Conley
I don't know that story
um
there's a bunch of people in jail right
um yeah Rogan and Chappelle have been
doing the rack together for a long time
wake up Scott
uh I'm just gonna block you
I do
anybody whose best comment is wake up
I don't want you to follow me I'd rather
you just watch other content
wake up
I don't believe that I'm unwoke I
believe I'm uh I believe I'm influenced
by
evidence
is that okay can I be influenced by
evidence
AB scam now Abscam was they got to
getting people to do a financial crime
you can definitely let them do the crime
and then arrest them because nobody got
hurt and they can unwind the financial
part but I don't think there's any
precedent for the FBI getting people to
do a violent crime or even a potentially
violent crime like a protest
um
aware do you watch
Barnes yes
any bison had to be balanced in hobbies
and Fun Stuff nope I'm the worst person
in the world without
all right
Vega shooter now I don't think there's a
plot there
do I know who Craig Wright is nope
I don't
what's this
feel comfortable sharing your East to
bitcoin or radio no I'm not going to
take any invitations for Media stuff
until I get my life under control
I'm not getting until I can get more
than three hours of sleep on a regular
basis I'm not going to accept any
invitations
uh
only burners in the buildings I tried to
watch that I couldn't get into it
so believe without evidence until
evidence to the contrary no I simply
believe that the ordinary is the best
explanation until the extraordinary has
been proven
is that I always I always just make the
assumption that the the most ordinary
thing is going to happen yes I'm still
drumming would you like to see what I've
come up with as my intro
to this program
I want to hear the uh the drum intro all
right here's the drum intro
now
what you need to know is that the drum
intro is based on my morning routine and
the name of the piece is called coffee
all right so this is my own drumming and
it's supposed to Repro is supposed to
represent me sleeping
it starts with a heartbeat
that's my sleeping heartbeat and you'll
hear uh a little bit of noise that's the
alarm you'll hear my two feet hitting
the ground getting out of bed two two
you're going to hear me going down the
stairs
and then you're going to hear me going
on with my day
until I had my first drink of coffee all
right so going from uh sleeping down the
stairs getting a cup of coffee here is
what might be some form of this my new
drum opening
heartbeat
alarm
going on with my day
[Music]
and then I match that with the the Sip
anyway that's my first draft I'm working
on
um
you think it needs to be Jazz ugh no
uh you like it
steel drums would be nice huh
it sounds better of course not played
through my phone not to
onto my iPad
um well I'm going to work on that I
might actually I might even ask somebody
who's an actual drummer to drum it
better so it sounds better
but I also wanted to write a song
I wanted to write a song so I I guess in
some ways it's like a
it's like a uh I guess it's a song
now uh you want to hear a uh a tragic
story
it's tragic not very tragic
um small small tragic
so back when I was doing the Dilbert TV
show it was ran on UPN for two half
Seasons uh we needed a an opening and so
I I designed the opening and the design
was it would be you know Dilbert you
know evolving YouTube like Evolution and
then he'd evolve into a cubicle dweller
and then you'd show him you know in the
cubicles and stuff now that was just
sort of the first draft okay I I sort of
asked the creative people okay go make
me
go make me an opening that has these
features in it where Dilbert has evolved
like Evolution you know from a creature
into a monkey into a human and then into
a cubicle because it's funny to show
that people evolved into something so
weak as living in the cubicle
so we hired uh uh I think the top
person in the field to make the music
and then the animators put together the
animation that that achieved that Etc
and people liked it
um and I'm I'm blanking on the name of
the famous composer Danny Elfman
if you ever heard of Danny Elfman
a very famous composer for uh music or
movie scores and stuff like that
who was he with originally
uh Davao DeVoe I forget who he was with
originally but he's he's one of the most
successful people so he did the music uh
oh ongo ongo Boingo is that where he was
yeah
um
oh interesting Chad asked do you know if
they can determine if you've got natural
immunity or vaccine immunity
uh to know if you have a natural boost
interesting anyway so I put together so
the uh the the introduction uh is a big
hit and uh it is submitted for an Emmy
and it wasn't an Emmy
so the just apparently there's an Emmy
category for show introductions and the
show introduction that I designed and
then was executed by the animators and
Danny Elfman won an Emmy
so do you want to see Miami
anybody would you like to see Miami
it's uh it's right here behind me
if it looks like a blank Shelf
it's because there wasn't enough room on
the Emmy application for my name
true story it was submitted without me
knowing it I didn't know it was
submitted for the Emmy but the people
who submitted it
left my name off
because it wasn't enough room
so I didn't win an Emmy
for the thing I designed
now to be fair
all of the creative work was done by
other people right the animators
definitely deserved an Emmy and Danny
Elfman definitely deserved a Debbie for
their work
but I did design it
it was my first draft and typically the
person who does the first draft no
matter how much it changes but typically
in the creative world whoever does the
first draft gets some credit
some credit so I actually wanted Emmy
without winning an Emmy
uh I think that's special
do I use blue light blocking glasses no
that's the weird question
yeah Elon Musk tweeted that he wants to
create the Texas institute for
technology and science so that the
acronym could be tits
and you know of course he's named his uh
the models of his uh his Tesla cars so
that the letters will spell sex you know
this models S and E and X I guess or you
plan to do it I forget but
I love the fact
that Elon Musk is the richest person in
the world
and also a teenage boy
I don't know I can't stop loving that
that that he's not above this joke
I love that he's not above this joke
haha
I just love it
um and I'm not sure it was like it
wasn't it wasn't so funny I guess it's
funny because he said it I that that's
what makes it noteworthy if anybody else
said it it would have been yeah
but the fact that he could fund it and
actually create it it actually might
just for a joke
it's hilarious
uh by the way if you haven't heard
Elon Musk uh mocking uh
uh Warren Buffett
yeah you have to check that out
yeah check out uh how dismissive Elon
Musk is of Warren Buffett because
apparently Warren Buffett also doesn't
think much of Tesla
so uh you know that they conflict a
little bit but hearing uh Elon who's you
know taking us to Mars and building
electric cars and changing the world
hearing him talking about Warren Buffett
as a guy who just looks at numbers
which is pretty close pretty close to a
good explanation of who he is yeah he
reads balance sheets and financial
statements and it's very boring and uh
that's all he does that's what that's
his contribution to the world is he
reads balance sheets and financial
statements better than you
what is Elon musk's contribution to the
world
freedom
my God
Elon musk's contribution to the world is
freedom
it's not even close oh yes I do I am a
big Elon Musk fan
uh and I do have some small amount of
Tesla stock that I bought in the past
year
so that's my full disclosure so a very
Pro uh
Pro musk and Tesla but
here's what I mean by freedom
we probably will only be free if we
could leave the Earth
you know long long term Freedom pretty
much requires leaving the Earth secondly
you're not going to be free unless you
have some uh energy sources that don't
completely depend on the government
that's what he makes he makes your solar
panels and your solar battery
to make you free from the government
right now you could argue it's you know
not enough blah blah blah you need your
nuclear power and I agree but he is
giving you freedom you could ignore the
government and be your own power company
with your house it's possible depending
on the design of the house
um
and he's also building a starlink that's
his right starlink the satellite Network
what will starlink allow you to do
avoid the inner the avoid the phone
companies avoid the big companies
probably also avoid the government
in some ways
because if you have more competition in
how and how information is distributed
the more competition
the more freedom probably
so I would say that Elon Musk is
directly and substantially
altering the very nature of humankind
in terms of the amount of Freedom we'll
have now and in the future
and Warren Buffett
is just taking money from Bad investors
and giving it to himself
because that's what he does he just
invests smarter so that some people are
buying the wrong stocks he's buying the
right stocks on average and he makes
more money than you do but it's at
somebody's expense it's at the expense
of the people who made the wrong
decisions
he's just taking money from one pocket
and putting in another now you could
argue that he creates a more efficient
system blah blah blah that's true but
you can't compare the impact that musk
has on humankind
to what Warren Buffett did for himself
and and his investors right but
basically they were just moving money
from one pocket to another and musk is
moving you from Earth
to the Moon
right those are not the same
conversation
right
so I just love that and by the way I I
have a
I have a
prediction about Warren Buffett you want
to hear it and I can only give it to you
in partial form
and the prediction goes like this
that when he and Charlie Munger who's
also super old when both of them have
passed
you're going to hear some stories about
one or both of them that you never heard
before
and it might not be good
you know what I mean
I have a feeling
that the major Publications the people
who could maybe find out if Warren
Buffett has ever done anything bad
probably stay away
partly because he's so lovable and you
know genuinely he's just terrific in
public
and but I can't believe that somebody
with that money doesn't have a skeleton
or two in the closet
I don't know in what domain or anything
like that no I'm not thinking of you
know any Epstein stuff or anything like
that I think financially
I would be amazed if after they both
passed and I think both of them have to
go Charlie Munger and and Buffett and by
the way I'm Pro both of them I think
they're amazing amazingly successful
good Role Models based on what we know
about them and you should listen to
almost everything they say because it
makes sense uh
but I I just have this Intuition or
something
that there's something in that story
that we don't know the Warren Buffett's
success story just something we don't
know
we'll find out
um
could you do a podcast on reframing I
you know I was thinking of writing a
book on that topic
because unfortunately you would uh might
overlap with too much of what I've
already done but I think that if people
understood reframing as a technique and
so lots of examples of it and how to
reframe some you know basic things in
your life it could be life-changing
do I own more than one house no
uh I own one car and one house
because
I just in order to own two houses you
need to have a staff I think and I don't
want to staff
um
micro lessons on decoupling and
divesting from woke companies now I
think that doesn't doesn't belong in the
micro lesson
list so the micro lessons I do I've got
over 190 of them now on the locals
platform so it's behind a subscription
wall but there are 190 lessons in two
minutes to four minutes generally each
one of which would give you a new
superpower
it's just something you hadn't thought
of a new way of framing things in many
cases and they're all designed to give
you a power right they're not inert
everyone is like a power pack and there
are 190 of them
if you consume all 190 and again it's
just two minutes a piece you can just do
it while you're on the toilet one day
one day each until you're done
somewhere oh here's an interesting point
some work for money Scott works for
ideas and the Money Follows I would say
it a different way I would say that I
have a system not a goal my system is to
follow the energy and apply my talent
stack in a way that helps the most
people
if you do that money will follow but
it's not a process everybody can do
because I have the advantage that I have
Financial Security so I can wait for
things to come to me
um you know I did this this live
streaming was just a huge money loser
for me it was just a money loser it was
just drive away drive away you know
Dilbert fans and didn't make any money
it wasn't even monetizing it and for
what five years
I think I did this for like five years
just because I was following the energy
and it seemed to have a value that
people appreciated
and now it's monetized so between the
YouTube ads which you can skip if you're
subscribed to either locals or to
YouTube
um and now it's actually producing money
now it's not life-changing money that I
didn't need it but it's doing it I mean
it's actually a a genuine
um
what would you call it a a genuine
business line of business I guess
did it help Book Sales probably
probably
yeah so so I didn't have a goal of being
this I had a system where I followed the
energy I experimented I listened to the
audience input change change change and
I just followed it where it went
and applied and and built my talent
stack at the same time and if you do
those things
and you improve your production quality
apparently not well enough today if you
just chip away at all these things five
years later you've got a business
that you didn't plan on exactly
uh
the Hershey CEO said water is not a
right
that's true
that's just a definition of the word
rights
now if you say to yourself having access
to water should be right I would agree
with you
if you say it is a right you have to
point to it somewhere in a law or you
know God's word or something like that
but a right is not is not just you think
it should be something for everybody
the the definition of a right is that
it's codified or at least comes from a
religion in some way that you could
point to objectively say oh there's the
rule
um
somebody says in Texas water isn't right
but I would imagine that that's a
limited right
uh but abortion is a right
no I don't say anything's a right until
it's codified
so abortion is a right if you're in a
state where it's a legally defined thing
you can do
Biden said her rights are just there he
doesn't acknowledge they come from God
well
it's better not to acknowledge they come
from God because then you're limited to
whatever's you know defined by God and
not everybody's following the same one
uh am I talking too long somebody's
running on a beer
uh you know your rights when you're
alone in the wilderness I don't know
yeah I think you should always talk
about what should be your rights
somebody says Craig Wright invented
Bitcoin and he has a huge trial that
starts on Monday
now why would I not be aware that the
founder of Bitcoin
had been identified
if that were true if that were true or
you told me that wouldn't be the
headline story
I don't believe that I don't believe
what you're telling me there's something
left out
um
Insurance are not rights but yeah
yeah I don't think anything is a natural
right I don't believe in natural rights
they're just things you want things that
make sense things you would like to be
right but there's no natural right in my
opinion
um
god-given I don't I don't know that God
gives you any rights
right to life
you you have a right to life because
it's illegal to be killed and it's in
the Constitution
um
yeah there are things you need but that
doesn't make them right
all right that's all for now I'm gonna
go do something else
I'll talk to you
