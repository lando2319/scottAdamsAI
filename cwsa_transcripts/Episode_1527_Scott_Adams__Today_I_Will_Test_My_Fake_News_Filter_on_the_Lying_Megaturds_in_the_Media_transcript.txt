everybody and welcome to the best thing
ever the best thing in your entire lives
it's called the
it's called coffee with scott adams and
that's why you're here
because today we're going to be taking
on the lying mega turds in the media
with
that's right
the fake news filter we're going to test
it out
but before we do that
let's go brandon and let's have the
simultaneous zip and all you need is a
couple of mugger glass attacker chelsea
fan canteen geoflask vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the dope
media of the day the thing makes
everything better
you know it it makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous step it
happens right now go
i feel connected
the meaning of life has been restored
for a moment there i was just sort of
floating
did you feel it
you felt a little disconnected
didn't feel like the meaning of life was
was
having any impact on you
but now
now you feel good don't you yeah the
meaning of life has been restored and
let's talk about all the news
how many of you saw my
dead on impersonation of kamal harris
talking to the nasa
space program kids
i hope you suck
i don't like to say
instant classic
about everything but instant classic
and
it was even cringier than i had imagined
you've probably heard by now that the uh
the child
uh the kids in the video
were child actors
they were not in fact
any members of this nasa space board
that's right
what you saw was kamala harris being
really excited
really excited for these
kids who are actors
that someday they're gonna they're gonna
answer all these questions about space
and they're gonna they can see
with road eyes
things on the moon the crater you're
going to see greater
except
no you won't because you're child actors
it was the cringiest fakest
most ridiculous thing you've ever seen
but did you notice the composition of
the kids
did you notice
anything no anything interesting about
the
composition of the kids
somebody said multi-racial
that's almost what i'm looking for
i don't believe there was a white boy in
the group
am i wrong
i didn't see one in the pictures
did they really assemble a multi-racial
stem group and basically people
interested in science and they didn't
include
a white male kid
they didn't have enough kids to spread
around the
ethnicities
really
no white male kid could even be part of
that
you just shake your head
like what the hell is going on and how
the hell
could the democrats ever win another
election
i mean
the republicans have to go pretty deep
into awfulness to lose against that
seriously
i could throw a dart into my audience
and hit somebody who could do a better
job
than the democrats are doing right now
it doesn't look like it's hard
well
speaking of disasters how many of you
follow the
the gossip news and especially the
celebrity stuff with megan fox
and her new boyfriend
machine gun kelly
is anybody as hooked on on that as i am
it's one of my guilty pleasures
by no means is this important and by no
means should you bother
paying attention to it
but
but
let me say this they are one of the best
examples you'll ever see of the basket
case theory
the basket case theory says that other
people seem pretty put together and
lucky and
hey things are going pretty well for
them
until you get to know them
and then you find out that they're just
basket cases
well we got a little glimpse of that as
if you couldn't tell already that megan
fox has
body dysmorphia issues
fairly serious you know mental disorder
if you've got that you're not happy at
all
and her boyfriend says he's got ptsd
from you know past drug use and other
experiences
so these two people who look
like the most
lucky people in the world
they're rich they're famous they're
beautiful they found each other
all good stuff right
and you you go down this deep you know
you just scratch
a little bit of the surface off and
immediately
massive mental problems
yeah somebody's saying tommy lee pam pam
anderson
2004
yeah now this is nothing against those
two people they are two people doing the
best you know presumably doing the best
they can trying to make this world work
but i like to point that out for those
of you who feel less
lucky i don't know if you would trade
places with him
i mean i say that about myself
if you look at my life how many people
would think
wouldn't mind having his life
things it looks like things worked out
pretty well for him
how many of you would trade for my life
well you don't know my life do you
if you had to take the whole thing
you you don't get to pick and choose
right you don't get to pick the good
parts
you don't get just the money and the
fame you got to take it all
would you trade with me
if you're dumb you would
i got some issues too
more of my issues are in my past than my
present but if you had to take my whole
life no you wouldn't take it trust me
but at the moment it's pretty good
relatively relatively speaking
i'm not sure what pretty good even looks
like because you can't
do any of us have a problem-free life
i don't think any of us don't have any
major problems that we're dealing with
right
pretty much all of us have some major
problems
and if you don't have major problems
your minor problems feel like major
problems so we're
we're largely in similar situations even
if it doesn't look like it
it's always good to remember that
business insider has a
story about
teachers reporting just massive mental
health problems with kids
now this is the least surprising story
of
2021
that the children
apparently have been quite damaged
psychologically by the pandemic
and here's the question that i ask you
we have gym class
did you ever think gym class was sort of
doesn't really fit exactly with school
i mean i get it you know you want to
teach them to be physically fit
you need to get them you know standing
up and away from their desks and you
know they can socialize a little bit
better in gym than they can in the rest
of the classes there are tons of reasons
that gym class is good so i'm in favor
of it
but
don't we need a mental health class
don't we need the equivalent of gin
class for your brain
right it's not good enough just the the
reading and writing and arithmetic i
mean that stuff's good but
yeah we have health class
which is good
i think the content in health class is
probably very beneficial
but
how many of the kids are being taught
the techniques of good mental health
because there is technique
and i always get in trouble for this so
i'll be as i'll be as clear as i can
because people are going to conflate my
opinion with some opinion that's not
mine and suddenly i'm in trouble
it goes like this
i want to be very clear
that if somebody has a you know organic
serious mental disorder
that they're not going to fix that by
you know getting more sleep and
improving their nutrition probably
as far as i know that doesn't work
so we're not talking people who've got
the real serious you better see a
medical professional right away kind of
problem i'm talking about the people who
maybe think they ought to need to see a
professional but they're not quite there
and and maybe it's not a
organic problem maybe it's
situational
that's a lot of people
there's a lot of people so i'm not not
talking about the deep depression stuff
where you know you really need some help
i'm talking about the people who just
couldn't get through the pandemic
without some mental damage
and can't get through modern life
and managing their smartphones and their
social lives and everything
without
actual mental damage
why can't we teach kids the basics
of good mental health
let me ask you this how many
just in the comments let me know how
many of you have
kids let's say between
10 and
17.
how many of you in the comments because
i i don't know if this crowd has a lot
of kids oh they do
a lot of kids i'm seeing lots of yeses
and the answers especially on locals
so a lot of you have kids in that 10 to
17 range so so you know exactly
what i'm talking about here
how many of those those kids between 10
and 17
have wildly different sleep schedules on
the weekend
than they do during the school week
in the comments how many of your kids
have wildly different sleep patterns on
the weekend
than the weekdays
um i'm seeing i'm actually seeing more
no's than i thought
interesting
i think that suggests maybe a more
conservative audience here
but yeah it looks like most of you are
saying yes to that
now are the children being taught in
school
that having those wildly different sleep
patterns guarantee that they'll be
depressed
guarantee it
it's not even it's not even
statistically oh you're you've increased
the chance that you're going to be
depressed and sleepy and unhappy and
have mental problems i'm not talking
about
increasing the odds
i'm talking about you got it
you you you messed up your sleeping
pattern
and now
you have some mental problems one-to-one
correlation now ideally they're
temporary right
they're more the kind that you could fix
with lifestyle and then some work
what about nutrition
do you think that kids are completely
unaffected
mentally
by
a bad diet
of course they are
of course they are and again
i'm not even sure that you'd say that's
a statistical thing
as much as a one-to-one thing right it's
not statistically true that if you
overeat you get
you get fat
it's true for every person who does it
right every individual if they eat twice
as much as the caloric
recommended intake they'll get fat
so
why are we not teaching kids if you do
the things on this checklist
you're going to feel exactly the way
you're feeling right now
do the things on the checklist
you know have have sleep that's wildly
different on the weekends eat junk food
and i could fill out the rest of the
list
but here's the checklist it's just a
checklist it is that simple
did you do these things
no no you didn't do the things on this
list that everybody has to do
to feel good you didn't do them
nobody can feel good unless they do
what's on the list and all of it really
all of it
you can't eat wrong and then try to get
the other stuff right it works
probably won't work
right you can't get no exercise
and think well i did everything else
right
nope
nope that's not going to work
you have to do all of those things
because we're not so naturally happy
that you've got any like
slop
in the system you kind of have to get
everything right
at least in 2021 i don't know if it's
always been the same
but we should have a class where we
teach them if you do these things you're
going to feel this way if you do this
set of things you'll feel
a different way
at least know that you're choosing it
because my observation is the kids don't
have any connection
in their minds they don't connect
the things they do with their bodies and
their minds
with how they feel
not really i mean they know that they
feel better when they hang out with
their friends
and they know that if they're hungry
it's better to eat
but that's about it
they're not connecting their mood
their entire mental
framework
to the things they do
it just feels like they're disconnected
things
so we should teach them to connect those
things
well there's a publication and i use
that term loosely
called the verge
here's a headline from the verge
headline on twitter anyway it says
netflix suspends trans employee
who tweeted about dave chappelle special
so netflix suspended a trans employee
who i guess complained and tweeted about
the dave chappelle special which was on
netflix
that sounds terrible
doesn't it it sounds as if
netflix suspended somebody for having an
opinion
well i mean that's not unusual for a
company to
fire a disgruntled employee who's
complaining in public
but
given the issue you know it's an issue
of you know general societal interest
seems inappropriate doesn't it
except
it didn't
happen here's what did happen
it is true that netflix suspended that
employee
it is true
that that employee also tweeted about
dave chappelle special
those are two true things
except one didn't cause the other
according to netflix
what did cause it i think was the way
she did it maybe she i know she did
something like attended a meeting she
wasn't supposed to be at or something so
it wasn't her opinion
it was the way she managed her you know
interactions
right
so
when the verge reports this they make it
seem as though these two things are
connected
when in fact they're just two facts
they're not connected they're indirectly
connected because i'm sure her whatever
her behavior wasn't gotten fired
probably sprung from that but it wasn't
because the opinion
they i and i actually think that netflix
does genu this you know who knows i
can't read their minds but i think
netflix probably
genuinely appreciates hearing from their
employees on the stuff like this that
matters why wouldn't they
why wouldn't they right i mean if you're
a big company you do
you do want to feel out what the
employees are thinking especially the
stuff that they're really hot about
of course you want to know that so of
course netflix wanted to know what his
employees were thinking about of course
and do they mind that the employees
are making a statement
against discrimination against the trans
community
probably not i don't think netflix cares
let me say it more positively i'm sure
netflix management
would support
people speaking out in favor of treating
everybody well
now it's a difference of opinion
about whether chappelle was treating
people well or not
but nobody's
disagreeing with the concept at least in
netflix i don't imagine
nobody's disagreeing that you know you
shouldn't be unkind to people for no
reason
so um for the verge i'd like to offer a
headline of my own
it goes like this
two things that are true
uh all of the staff of the verge
and i'm and i'm pretty sure this is true
maybe not a hundred percent
but close to a hundred percent
a hundred percent of the staff of the
verge
masturbated after the holocaust
that's true
that is completely true now not 100
but almost every member of the verge
masturbated after the holocaust
i don't think we can feel good about
that
can we
now i'm not saying because of
not because of
it was just after
they're just two facts that happened
i'm just reporting two facts
you deal you do what you want with the
facts if you're connecting them in your
mind well that's on you
i'm just telling you that the entire
staff of the verge masturbated after the
holocaust
i don't know how you feel good about
that
um
david
leonard
which is a cool name because it's i
assume that's
based on lion heart
at some point in history but david
leonhart who's a senior writer at the
new york times and therefore we should
all listen to him
he did a tweet thread in which he's
showing
he's making the point that science
doesn't know why the coveted cases
suddenly dropped
they also don't know
why they spiked
and they won't know why they dropped
next time and they won't know why they
spiked next time
now of course the delta
variant
is part of the story but
even if you factor in all the things we
do know
according to a senior writer at the new
york times who i agree with and
therefore he must be right
using my confirmation bias i agree with
him so therefore this must be true news
um
so basically he's making the case that
we don't know why it plunges up and we
don't know why it plunges down do you
believe that
how many of you accept the the beginning
premise
how many of you accept the premise
that the experts don't really know why
things are going up and down the way
they're going up and down
everybody on board with that
yeah so anybody who says it's because of
masks it's because of mandates it's
because of vaccinations
those are all variables
we don't know what weight to put in all
the variables exactly
but we don't know why anything's going
up and down
now if you agree with that
here's the next part
you should agree with
logically
that the
two people who got the nobel prize for
economics
didn't deserve it
and i do
and i'm not kidding
who was the person who told you often
and publicly and i think the only one
and
fact check me on both of these claims
number one claim i'm the only one to say
this
and i said it early and publicly
that we'd never know
how much impact
leadership
had on different countries outcomes
because it would be too complicated
who else said that
name one other person who told you at
the beginning of the pandemic
that at the end we wouldn't know who did
a good job
nobody else
i'm the only one who told you that
pretty sure
and it's completely opposite
of what the uh
of what the guys who just won the nobel
prize in economics would have told you
they would have told you because this is
what they won their prize for
that you just take two areas that are
largely the same
you say oh this one had this policy and
this one had this one and then because
the areas are largely the same you could
observe the differences
and then you'd know something
and i told you exactly the opposite
i told you that in complex systems
there's no way you can compare them
because you're just guessing that the
other stuff doesn't matter
and guessing's the opposite of science
it's the opposite
it's literally you could not be more
opposite of science of just sitting
there and guessing
well i'm looking at norway and i'm
sweden and i'm gonna guess
that there are no variables
except the ones that
i've decided are important i'm just
going to guess
because you know i don't know of any
so i just guess there aren't any
that's not a real control group
that is somebody guessing
and then laundering their gas
with science
that's right
the guys who won the nobel prize in
economics
are teaching you how to launder fake
news through science
and they got a nobel prize for it that
prize should be mine damn it
no i don't really mean that
except it's true
i don't mean it but it does it also has
the benefit of being 100 true as far as
i know
all right um
i tweeted and got just a huge reaction
to this tweet i said dear government
what level of virus risk do we need to
reach before ending all mandates and
restrictions
if you don't have a target
don't expect compliance
don't expect compliance if you don't
have a target
what do you think
a lot of people retweeted this so it
looked popular
but i would say this is basic
leadership
it's the most basic leadership i'm going
to ask you to do this really hard thing
and the reason we're going to ask you to
do it
is to achieve this goal
win a war
for example
stop climate change
from you know getting above a certain
level for example
pretty specific if somebody asks you for
a sacrifice
and they say i need you to get this out
do the sacrifice because we're trying to
achieve this specific thing
you can say to yourself yes or no
i would like to help you achieve that
specific thing
but if your so-called leaders
say i would like you to make this big
sacrifice
and you say great until when
and what target are we going for and
they say
we'll let you know
we'll get back to you on that we'll see
how it works out
it's flexible it's fluid
you know situation is fluid
we don't know will there be another
variant don't want to make any promises
because it might be another variant
don't know
right so we don't want to make any
promises
because we don't know what the future
looks like but we'd like to make this
big sacrifice
to get to this future that we can't see
nope
not acceptable
not even a little bit acceptable
you need to tell us what you're shooting
for
now will i forgive you
if you have to change later and modify
it and say oh damn we thought we could
get to this but now we're a little
smarter we learn something we have to
modify the goal okay
okay
that would be just normal
how many projects in your big
corporation
end up exactly the way you planned them
none none
but every corporation tells you you
better have a you better have an
endpoint
i'm not gonna i'm not gonna give you a
bunch of money unless you show me a
business plan with a specific target of
how much money or roi you're gonna shoot
for
right there's no leadership in any
country in any company
that lacks an endpoint that's described
pretty specifically
but also everybody knows you're not
going to hit it
you need it
even if you know you're not going to hit
it because it gives you
a direction
now the government would like you to be
happy with well we're going to save as
many lives as we can
no
no
try that in your corporation
oh we don't need a business plan we're
just going to make as much money as we
can
we want to be flexible don't want to
lock ourselves into a specific thing we
just want to make as much money as we
can that's our plan
that's not really a plan
right
so
um
don't expect
massive compliance with no target
now if we made a target what are the
likelihood that we'd have to revise it
later i think it's a hundred percent
but has nothing to do with
whether or not you should have one
right because that you always miss your
target
if you're a corporation or anything else
you just need them
so john gruden coach of the raiders
resigned some
emails from his past were made
public and they uh had things which
people are calling misogynistic and
anti-anti-gay and
a little bit racist they thought
now
here's my
take on that
i do not
defend
or condone
anything that john gruden said privately
likewise i do not defend or condone
anything that any of you
have ever said
privately
i don't condone it but i also don't
condemn it
anything you say privately with the
expectation that it would remain private
is okay with me
it's okay with me what if it's really
really offensive
okay with me what if it's really really
insulting to me
like just really racist and sexist and
totally insulting about me specifically
in your private communications
okay with me
100
i want you to be able to say anything
you want
privately
if you say it in public then we have
something to talk about
but privately no you can say anything
you want about me it could be the
darkest most insulting
deeply offensive thing you that
anybody's ever said about anybody
i'm cool with that
just don't tell me about it and you know
ideally don't tell other people that
might tell me about it
right you know now i get that sometimes
things get out that you thought would be
private but i'm not going to blame you
for that if you had an expectation of
privacy
you know who i'm going to blame
i'm going to blame the mofo who told me
that's the author of the message
the author of the message is not the
person who sent it first privately
because the expectation of privacy was
there but the the mofo
the a-hole
the mega turd
who told me about it
that's who created the damage
the person who creates the damage
is the mega turd who tells you about it
period that's got to be the standard
we can't let ourselves have a standard
where people's private communications
affect their job
or their standing in society
no
that that's a hard no
so
um
i
i see why the raiders had to do what
they do because you know they they have
to respond to
the fact that their you know customers
will
um
you know they're gonna
the customers are gonna have
you know some reaction and they don't
want to lose their customers et cetera
so i think big companies sometimes just
have to
do things that aren't fair to employees
because it's good for the you know to an
individual employee because the
stockholders or the bigger picture
requires it i guess
so
i don't love what the raiders did
but i understand it
right i'm not sure i would have gone the
same way if i'd been in charge of the
raiders maybe i would have
tried to take a stand but i don't i
don't blame them you know companies got
to take care of themselves that's what
they're designed to take care of
themselves and you wouldn't want to
change that
so here's the
here's the standard i say number one
private communication should stay
private or
if your private communications are not
going to stay private
the who leaks them
is the author
the who leaks them has to take
responsibility for all of the racism
misogyny
everything else
now
if you look at the actual content of the
messages
did did they
look racist to me
nope
nope
they did look exactly like the things
you should never say in public
let me give you one of them one of them
one was
that i guess
john gruden in an email said something
about a black
player's the size of his lips
and that was considered racist
do you know when that would be racist
for sure
as if he said it in public
i would call that racist
because you would be saying something
that you know would be offensive to you
know an entire ethnicity plus anybody
who has you know any sense of decency
but not privately
not privately when you change the
context to privately it's just an
observation
there's nothing in this story that
suggests he has a bad feeling about
black people because one of them
has a feature
which is notable
i just don't see it
but now do you see the point
that that exact thing he said privately
doesn't have a trace of
of racism in it
but if he had ever said that in any
mixed crowd or in public yeah a very
racist
very bad move
let me give you another one
he used the word queer
when referring to a gay person who is
going to be drafted i guess
drafted
does the word queer
suggest that he doesn't like or doesn't
respect gay people
maybe i don't know
i mean you could certainly interpret it
that way if he had used that word in
public
what would i say about him
i'd say he's very
apparently very
anti-lgbtq or at least anti-gay
and he needs to he needs to you know
have some consequences
i mean that would seem pretty racist or
i'm sorry it would seem pretty anti-gay
to me
now i know what you're thinking you're
saying that the gay community uses that
word themselves exactly
that's why
when he used it privately
it didn't look the same to me
privately people use words that are
offensive just because they're more
interesting
have you ever used an offensive word
with somebody who's a friend
just this more interesting word that's
it no real intent behind it it's just a
more interesting word
this is more fun
it's more provocative
right
so um
again i don't condone anything that john
gruden said because i don't want to be
you know tarred with any of that
but i'll say that as a consumer
of this information i looked at the
things that were noted and i did not see
the things he was accused of
but had he said any of that in public of
course it would look awful
all right
um
i saw an article in the new york times
i guess it was written a while ago
about uh
microsteps and micro micro goals
and they mentioned the uh
they were influenced by the book atomic
habits by james clear
and
um the idea is that you
that you if you want to get something
done getting started is the important
part
and that if you can get any kind of
momentum
toward your goal
um
that it's self-reinforcing you get a
little dope being hit for making any
progress
so the atomic habits a big part of it
was just do something
a small little thing get a phone number
you know make yourself a note just
whatever's the smallest thing you can do
toward your goal
and eventually it'll get a little
momentum going and it'll it'll be
self-fulfilling after a point
very good advice now that was in the
atomic habits in 2018.
now um
james clear
has always from the beginning
credited the micro steps idea
as part of the systems versus goal idea
from my book had failed almost
everything and still went big it came
out five years earlier
now i think it was very smart
of
james clear to
pick that you know pick that part of um
part of what was in my book and amplify
it
because you know i just
sort of mentioned it
and described it a little bit but it did
deserve its own book and i and i think
that
let me say as clearly as possible
there aren't that many new ideas
yeah almost any time somebody has an
idea that's like this you know this
game-changing idea and they make a book
and it's popular you can almost always
find out who who influenced that person
right there's always something before it
same with music
seems like all musicians were influenced
by somebody else
but
as i often say an idea is worthless
the value of an idea
is zero
ideas don't have any value so if you say
hey this was your idea and then you know
james clear took that idea and made a
great book out of it
well
you know maybe in some sense he was
influenced by it but
the value in the book is how he
expressed it
the value is the packaging the design
the communication
so i mean that's all that's where the
value comes from so likewise even when i
have something that looks like a new
idea
probably isn't
but the value is i communicated it to
you that's where the value is
but
i i'm starting to think
that this one thing might be one of the
most important things that
i've ever done
because to the extent that it's
influenced other people
who then influence other people
this is a really good technique you know
the micro step idea especially in a
world where everything's um complicated
and we're busy
it's that complication and busyness
that stuns us into inaction because
there are too many things you could do
and there are too many things you could
do instead
so finding some way to beat the
complexity of modern life and finding a
way to take that first step
did maybe it wasn't always important
but right now it's critical so it could
turn out to be one of the most important
things i've ever done
or the most important thing
and
you know it was one chapter of one book
uh let's do the uh
the fake news test on an axio story
well it's it's a national story but i'm
going to use axios as my example now if
you don't know
i created a first draft and this is just
a prototype so we'll be testing we'll be
testing the filter as well as the story
right if the filter says the story's
fake
it could be the the filter is
the problem not the story so keep in
mind that this is all experimental at
this point but we'll see what happens
so i did a google sheets which i tweeted
the link to
and you can so you can all go look at it
in which uh i've just got a column of
sort of a checklist
of what to look for to decide if
something is fake news
and let me first run through it because
i've added to it since the last time i
told you about it
okay
so these are it's a growing list of the
checklist of things to ask
i'll just do them quickly because
they're self-explanatory so if you see a
new story say ask yourself these
questions is the source anonymous
is it a disgruntled employee or
ex-employee is it only being reported on
cnn but not fox or vice versa
is it too on the nose it's like too
exactly the narrative
you know what i mean
is it
is it confusing correlation with
causation
is is still the fog of war phase of the
story where where we don't know all the
facts
is it too man bites dog meaning it's
just too unbelievable to really really
be true
is it only covered by the lesser known
news sites
does the journalists have a grudge
against the subject
are you still waiting to hear the other
side of the story
in other words is there somebody who's
accused of something
and they haven't told you what their
side is yet
does the story give you a percentage
without the raw number
that's another one i added
does it report a percentage but it
doesn't tell you any raw numbers that's
a flag
and vice versa does it give you
raw numbers without putting them in
context of what percentage of something
that is
um
let's see does the story have
uh sources that have ties to some
industry
is a story uh from a serial debunker
who's selling a book
here's a new one i added
is the source of the claim
a serial debunker somebody who keeps
debunking things
and writing books about it i don't trust
the serial debunkers
because once they become the debunking
person
they have to keep debunking
because that's who they are
they become the debunking person that's
how they make the money
so be careful of the serial debunkers
not so much somebody who only once is
debunking something
is the story source politically active
you can't trust them and is the primary
evidence
and is the primary evidence of video
so here's one i added that's just
mind-blowing
one of the checklists to see if it's
fake news
is if there's a video so you can see it
with your own eyes
in 2021
if there's a video
and you can see it with your own eyes
it's probably fake news
you would have thought the opposite but
in 2021 if you just look at all the
examples
you can see time after time it's just a
video edit they leave out a qualifier or
they leave out some context so if the
primary evidence is a video
there's a good chance it's not true
which is weird
right all right so that's the filter
um let's run this story through it and
here's the claim the claim is that
southwest airline pilots
are intentionally
um
intentionally basically calling in
personal days or sick days i don't know
which one
definitely some personal days but i
don't know if there's sick days too or
they're not or they're not accepting
flights et cetera so they're basically
responding to the vaccine mandate
so it's basically a work slow down
if you will
because they're so many of them don't
want to get the force to vaccination to
continue working
now
here's what southwest says
there's no
pilot action happening
no
this is weather
it's weather
duh
we just got a weather problem it'll take
care of itself we'll be fine next week
one of those things isn't true
one of those isn't true but let's take
the claim that the pilots are
doing this intentionally okay and we'll
run it through the fake news filter
all right so here's the claim
is the source
anonymous
kind of yes
but kinda now
who exactly is your source
who told you that the pilots are
organizing this
well i've seen reports about individual
pilots saying yeah this is happening
but they seem to be speculating
they didn't seem to say the the ones i
saw maybe you saw something different i
didn't see anywhere the pilot said yes
i'm calling around i'm organizing people
we're definitely doing this
have you seen that
i haven't seen it
i've seen
unknown sources and
something close to anonymous
so i'm asking you so somebody says they
saw that last night on tucker
one on tucker didn't seem to be guessing
okay
so
i'm going to take that as a fact
that there's somebody who is not an
anonymous source okay
or same page so far
that it did not it's not an anonymous
source
okay
uh is the source a disgruntled current
or ex-employee
disgruntled employee
disgruntled employee is a big flag
so there's one
uh i'd watch out for that one
disgruntled employee
is it only being reported as a fact on
one of the networks or neither is cnn
and fox news are they both reporting
that the pilots are doing an action
that the pilots are intentionally doing
that anybody does anybody know that
is cnn saying that the pilots are doing
this intentionally and also fox news
cnn is reporting the weather angle
can can i get a confirmation on that
because i'm only hearing it in a comment
can i get anybody else
who watches enough cnn
uh
it looks like cnn's not reporting it is
a pilot thing
all right you need a time filter
maybe
all right interesting
so we don't know axios is reporting it
all right
so i'm going to put a question on that
one but we'll circle back to that one um
is it too on the nose
is it is it too like right
on yeah it kind of is isn't it
isn't the story kind of perfect
the airline pilots are often military
people
and they're ex-military people
and they're
fighting another you know freedom
thing for the united states
it's not complicated though it's sort of
straightforward hey we don't like this
so we're protesting so i'm not going to
say it's too on the nose because it's
too ordinary like it would be easy to be
on the nose in such a simple situation
is the correlation being treated as
causation hmm
i don't think so
does it look like there's a correlation
versus causation problem i don't see
that are we still in the fog of war
phase
are we in the fog of war where you're
not quite sure what's going on
yes we are
yes we are still in the i'm not so sure
what's going on here phase which
is a big flag for fake news
all right um
is it two man by his dog now is it only
covered by lesser known news sites no
does a journalist have a grudge no are
you still waiting to hear the other side
of the story no
does the story give percentages without
raw numbers
does it
what percentage of the
pilots are protesting
do you know
that would be the biggest part of the
story right
what percentage
of the pilots
yeah we have percentages of flights
somebody said
six thousand out of 140 000. does it
look as though the percentage is being
left out of the story or under
underreported
um
yeah
so
so i do think there might be a little
bit of playing with the raw numbers
versus percentages the stories i saw
didn't seem to do a good job of sorting
this out
um is the story source of serial
debunker no is this is a politically
active people now
is the primary evidence of video no
so
we do have several flags
there are some flags that would suggest
this is fake news
doesn't mean it is
because remember this is just giving you
an indication you can't prove anything
with this
but
how could it be the southwest which does
not have a reputation as a big lying
company right
correct me if i'm wrong southwest
actually has a pretty good reputation
one of the best right isn't it isn't it
often one of the best places to work
voted near the top all the time
so do you just
i i think it's fair to distrust
corporations
but wouldn't you say southwest is a
little bit more on the reliable
you know non-lying side of the equation
wouldn't you say
i feel yes
right which doesn't mean they're not
lying in this case
but i think reputationally
they're pretty solid company
so how could it be true
uh simultaneously
that southwest is telling the truth that
it's not a pilot action while the pilots
are saying oh it's a pilot action
trust me i'm a pilot and this is a pilot
action how could both be true
well
let me tell you
what if
nobody has said to southwest management
we're doing this thing what would
southwest say
if every time they talk to a pilot hey
are you doing this because of the
vaccine mandate
and the pilot looked at them and said
vaccine mandate
no i'm just
i'm just taking my personal days that
you've allocated
and then the southwest says oh
well we heard people are doing this
because of the mandate
and the pilot looks at them and say yeah
i've heard that too
i think i'll take my personal days
see where i'm going
i think they're both true
i think that from southwest's point of
view
they have not been informed there's an
employee action
so from their point of view there isn't
now
furthermore they said it's weather
could it be true
that the problem is weather
but also true
that the problem is the the pilots
yes
it can be both
here's how
suppose there are enough pilots doing
the personal days
that it puts a strain on the system
but not a strain that they couldn't
normally handle
except
the weather was bad too
it could be that they had two problems
either one of them they could handle
because they've got enough flexibility
so let's say you've got some bad weather
in one place but you need to move some
pilots around to adjust for the bad
weather
you could do it
but now they didn't have the flexibility
because so many people took personal
days
do you think that when each pilot went
to their supervisor and said i'd like to
take a personal day
did all the supervisors immediately
coordinate with all the other
supervisors to find out if too many
people were asking for personal days at
the same time
probably not
right
so don't you think that if if management
asks the supervisors what's going on
they say
not much few people ask for personal
days but that's not that unusual
you know wanted to get it in before
christmas
i i feel as though southwest is maybe
giving us a little bit of a weasel
answer and that they would certainly be
aware that the pilots
may be acting in a way that is reducing
the number that are available
but not so overtly
that they're saying we're doing this and
on top of that the bad weather may have
taken that little bit of you know little
extra cushion they had and removed it
so could you say the weather is the
problem
because if the weather had not happened
they would still have enough cushion to
get things done
yeah see it's like it's not so clear is
it so i'm not so sure that the the
filter works in this case because it's
just a murky situation
um but i would say there's at least a
possibility that both stories are
completely true there is a pilot action
and from southwest point of view
the weather was the problem because they
could have handled the pilot action okay
without the weather problem
see what i mean it's sort of like saying
cove had killed you
the cove had killed you because you've
done everything wrong in your life up to
that point
you over ate you didn't exercise
right so you've done everything wrong
and then the last thing that happens is
the covet well likewise it's entirely
possible that the last thing that
happened
was the bad weather
but they would have been able to handle
it should you know if all the other bad
things like the pilot actions hadn't
happened anyway that's just speculation
uh biden is failing on getting us
rapid tests
i don't know if trump would have done
better
but this is a clear case of biden
failing
i mean i think even his
friends would say he's not getting it
done on the testing
so
that's a gigantic failure for the biden
administration
gigantic
now would trump have done better i don't
know
i don't know
but we'll never know
uh ben and jerry's
was defending why it's i don't know
boycotting someplace
um was it israel
or someplace
and was asked why don't you stop selling
your ice cream in texas because they've
got that abortion law and you don't like
that
and i don't know if it was ben or jerry
got really shall we say befuddled
because they couldn't answer how they
can continue to stay in business selling
any ice cream at all when everywhere you
sell the ice cream
everywhere you sell the ice cream
there's somebody doing something you
don't like
and uh i saw somebody make a comment on
twitter that looked like an episode of
curb your enthusiasm and boy did it
once you hear that comment it didn't
look like an episode of curb your
enthusiasm
the ap is fact checking this claim see
if you heard this fake news
there's an anti-vaccine website
a study on a vietnam
and it says that vaccinated people carry
more virus than unvaccinated have you
ever heard that
have you ever heard that unvaccinated
people
carry more i'm sorry have you ever heard
that vaccinated people
if they do get infected would carry more
of the virus than an unvaccinated person
has anybody heard that that
because it's not true
somebody says obviously
yeah so that's fake news here's and
here's what the study actually said
that compared to the original virus
the ones that people are getting these
days is the delta variant
and that's far more far more infection
in especially your mouth and nose i
think
how satisfied is scott adams with where
we are and now of course not i ask
because i have considered us to have
mostly returned enormously oh
well
um i can't travel
i mean
right i can't travel that's not too
normal
um it looks like our
supply chain
is pretty effed up i don't know how
quickly we'll fix that
um and i still wear a mask at the
grocery store where i live
so
anyway so the point is that
while it is technically true
that people who are getting the virus
lately
even if they're vaccinated the
vaccinated people have tons of virus
compared to the
last
variant
but the comparison is the old version to
the variant that's the only thing being
compared
the delta variant gives you more virus
it wouldn't matter if you were
vaccinated or unvaccinated the delta
variant gives you more varia more virus
so it seems as though
people are vaccinated and they get the
breakthrough case it seems like they
have more virus than the old days but
that's because the delta variant it's
not because of anything about the
vaccination all right so it's fake news
and speaking of fake news
i'm gonna have to go that is all for
today i am late and i think today was a
tremendous
live stream i hope you liked it too and
i will talk to you
tomorrow
