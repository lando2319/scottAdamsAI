hey everybody
come on in come on in it's time for
coffee with scott adams the best part of
the day
every single time and today will be no
exception
well unless it's better than usual
that's possible
and all you need is a copper mug or
glass a tanker gel system a canteen
joker flask have a vessel of any kind
then you need to fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day thing
that makes
everything better except those blurry
ufo photographs
it's called the simultaneous sip and i
think you'll like it
go
ah yeah oh yeah oh yeah
i feel my body healing in a variety of
ways
the covid can't touch me now say you
need a vaccination
but maybe you just need coffee that's my
medical advice
so rasmussen is reporting on some
results of their polls
some interesting stuff so raspbian
says most voters say it's more important
to prevent
cheating in elections than to make it
easier to vote
by two to one so twice as many people
think
it's better to prevent cheating than to
make it a little easier for people to
vote
they also say that
just 29 of likely voters say the laws
requiring photo id
discriminates against some voters while
62 percent
say voter id laws don't discriminate
now it seems really really clear what
the public wants
the public wants voter id laws
um
but how much can we allow our
politicians to ignore the will of the
people
when it's this much see i'm very much in
favor of our politicians overriding the
public
if the public is trying to discriminate
for example
is that what's happening because it
feels like there are awful lot of people
who are on the same page they must be
from the left and the right to be this
many
majority a majority this big has to have
lots of people crossing over
and i'll tell you again if i ran for
president
this is what i would do i would say
uh i'm just going to agree with the
public
that's it i'll just agree with the
public unless i have
secret you know military information
they don't have
because this is really just sort of a
public
confidence question and the public is
very clear
you rarely can get a poll on anything
important in which you would get a two
to one result
on politics when you get a two to one
result
if i were president i would just say i
don't even think it matters what my
opinion is
two to one is just done that's just done
you know i don't think you can you know
unless
unless the leaders come up with you know
well we have secret information
or something like that i just feel like
when the public wants something by two
to one you just
kind of gotta do it right you better
have a pretty pretty good reason not to
and they don't uh obviously it's just
politics
um here's a little question for you i
would like to see your answers
in the comments and i'm going to offer
this because i think when you read
stories about famous people who get
accused of
various improprieties that you might not
have the right
context and so i was thinking to myself
how many times have i personally just me
been accused falsely of a felony
how many times do you think just just me
just one person
i'm a public figure how many times have
i been falsely accused of a felony now
keep in mind
i would know if it's falsely right you
maybe you don't know
but i would know i mean you know if you
did or did not commit a felony
how many times
uh i can't tell if you're saying for
yourself
or me so your answers are confusing
um i could think of five times right off
the right off the top of my head
five times that real people have made
real accusations about
felonies like really serious stuff
i'll just give you one example you know
one crazy person who
believes i traveled to canada to rifle
through her house and
sexually molest her never met her she
lives in another country
have no no contact ever even once
that's that's normal for famous people
if you're in the public eye being
falsely accused
five separate times of felonies like i'm
talking about some serious stuff
it happens all the time you just don't
hear about it
you know it's just privately handled etc
so when i hear a story about
whoever it is is accused of some crime
or impropriety i say to myself well
they're a famous person
five to one it's not true it's like i
write out the
write out the shoot i say well it's five
to one not true
just based on experience um
recently i got rupard uh you know
roopart is where
somebody takes something out of context
usually referring to a video but
today somebody came at me uh insisting
that i have a history of being a men's
rights advocate
and saying terrible things about other
people
none of that ever happened i once wrote
a blog post
in which i made fun of men men's rights
advocates
that's it and because i once made fun of
them
it got taken out of context by somebody
who didn't understand what i was saying
and turned into i'm a men's rights
activist
and i barely hate all women and stuff
like that
who is that so remember i told you that
most
news stories involve at least one person
who doesn't exist
and once you see the pattern you can't
unsee it it's just all the big stories
have a person who doesn't exist as an
integral part of the story
in this story about me apparently
there's an imaginary person
who once wrote something supportive of
men's rights groups
that person doesn't exist is literally
an imaginary person
who is central to my story
how about the president who was
colluding with russia to win the
election
uh called nazis fine people in
charlottesville
and suggested drinking bleach
that person doesn't exist there's no
such person
and yet most of the stories for the last
four years were about that person
who is imaginary that that person
doesn't exist
never has so once you start seeing the
non-existent person in each story it's
hard to unsee it
neil degrasse degrasse or is it degrasse
degrasse tyson who
i think does a great job of popularizing
science
and because he happens to be black i
think he
adds a little extra you know for the
popularizing science so i think he's a
real good force
in the world that doesn't mean i agree
with everything he says for example
uh he tweeted that the good thing about
science is that it's true
whether or not you believe in it
for what he's trying to say i would say
that's a fair statement
the science if you do it right and
you've repeated it
and peer reviewed and you know you've
waited long enough
yeah science is about what's true uh but
here's my problem
here's my problem you and i
we have no direct contact with science
do you know how many times i touched
some science
this week never even got my hands on it
do you know how much science i'm holding
in my hand
nothing do you know how much science
i've got in my pocket
uh none
i don't have any contact with science i
don't do any science
i don't even talk to a scientist so the
only thing
you and i know about science is what a
human told us
now let me tell you about humans
there is no less credible biological
entity a human being
let's do a little test let's say my
little remote control here
how many times has it lied to me never
never how about my pen
how many lies has my pen told me
none but how about human beings
well human beings have a little bit less
of a good track record if you know what
i mean
and the only science i'm ever seeing is
from one of those
so yeah science is probably true
unfortunately it gets filtered through
the most
non-credible biological entities
ever known to humanity people
people so let me say it as clearly as
possible believing in science is a
stupid thing
because you're really believing in
people and trusting people is stupid
really believing in people and trusting
people is stupid
can i just say that so that's
my opinion all right here's another
rupaur alert
uh if you don't know being rupard
usu usually means that somebody took a
video
and clipped down parts that reversed it
really means that somebody took a video
and clipped down parts that reversed its
meaning
and that happened again yesterday how
many of you
saw the video of the
military the service member who got
pulled over
by two police police people
and they got into a little war of words
and the next thing you know
he wasn't getting out of the car and he
got
pepper sprayed and etcetera how many of
you
saw that video if you saw the one that's
on the news
you got rhubarb
you should see the whole video it
reverses the whole
situation if you watch the clip
you'll see a guy who's saying sort of
reasonable things
you know what's this all about my hands
my hands are showing can you explain
what this stop is all about
and he's a he's a member of the service
and the police look a little irrational
if you see the clips that are on the
news it's a real clear case of bad
police work and that's all
bad policing but
if you happen to see the whole video it
starts where he sets up
the the person who was stopped sets up
his cam
his phone before the police even come up
to the car
and you could tell how happy he is
unfortunately
you can tell that he's kind of happy
about the situation he's going to create
so long story short if you watch the
whole video
you can see him creating the situation
for an altercation
very clearly i mean you couldn't
possibly watch the whole video
and not believe that he wasn't
intentionally creating a conflict
the police thought to themselves hey
this guy looks like he's intentionally
creating a conflict
and they were right now did they handle
it right
nope i think i think probably one of the
police has already been fired
i said when i saw it i think he needs to
get fired
all the people saying check your sound
the problem's on your end so just reboot
um i'm not gonna do anything
so just just know that when you ask me
to fix the sound i'm never gonna do it
i'm just never going to do it i will
sometimes end end the broadcast
but if you ask me to fix the sound i'm
never going to do it
okay just know that i'm never going to
do it
i won't change anything to fix the sound
once the broadcast has started okay
so you can stop saying it um
so yeah so we got roopart on that
um then we've got this other tragic
situation
with dwayne dwayne wright i'm sorry
not dwayne duante right
and he was shot by a
police officer who believed that she
was uh using her uh
she believed she had her taser in her
hand but she actually had her handgun
and you could tell from the video that
it's very obvious
and i'm glad they released the video as
soon as they did if you watch the video
it's
obvious she mixed up the taser and the
gun and apparently that's a thing
i didn't realize that that's happened a
number of times so
it's exactly what it looked like it was
a mistake
a bad one somebody died but
i feel like we always dance around
the following thing i've not yet
seen one of these police shootings that
would have happened
i know they exist there's some of that
type but the ones that always are in the
news
seem to find to have the same
characteristic
which is nobody would have been dead
unless at least
two people were stupid one of them being
the
person who died and the other being at
least one police officer doing something
stupid
we don't really have any deaths that
seem to be the you know the ones that
are in the news
in which even only one person was stupid
it's a double stupid the cause of death
is stupidity
because none of it would happen without
a double stupidity happening in the same
place at the same time at the same time
somebody had some deadly force
because you can imagine any one of these
cases could have been different
if either the person stopped had acted
differently
or the police officers had been a little
smarter
i don't think i've seen an exception to
that there are exceptions
so let me be clear there are exceptions
where just one person did something
stupid
in that case usually a police officer
unfortunately
um but mostly it's the other kind it's
the double stupid
and we're just when the person when a
person dies
it's our natural instinct to be
respectful
and and never say well i think they sort
of contributed
by being stupid now that doesn't mean
they're stupid in general
everybody's stupid sometimes right i'm
stupid sometimes
more than i like so we're all stupid in
pockets
but you have to have two pockets of
stupidity hitting at the same time
to end up with somebody dead most of
these times
i asked the following question because
it just feels like this should be a
thing
so there's a quote from back in 2000
and i think it's real and it goes like
this the
it is from former cia director
um william colby and he is quoted by
david mcgowan who wrote a book called
derailing democracy in 2000. so
so there's a quote reported by somebody
so you don't
know you can't be 100 sure it was really
said
but it's reported that this former cia
director said and i quote
the central intelligence agency owns
everyone of any significance
in the major media
first of all do you think you really
said that
maybe but do you think it's true
do you think that the cia owns
every major person in every major media
in 2021 well here's how to figure that
out
uh to answer your question yes the
tasers do have a trigger
some of the tasers are have the form
factor of exactly a pistol
with the safety in the same place and
the trigger in the same place
there's a little weight difference
especially in the trigger i'm told
but you wouldn't detect that in a you
know in a moment of
chaos so yeah it's a thing other people
have
have pulled the trigger on the taser
when thinking it's a gun so that's
that's actually something that happens
so much so that there's training to
avoid it
if you have training to avoid it it's a
thing
all right so anyway if this if it's true
that the cia
has basically owns every major media
figure
meaning news figure i assume um
wouldn't that extend because this was
back in 2000
would that not have extended to social
media by now
so that people have large blue check
accounts on twitter let's say
would they also not be owned by the cia
by now
or worse a foreign entity
it's only a matter of time right and so
i asked the question of any
blue checks out there for the ones who
talk about politics and have lots of
followers
i ask how many of them have ever been
approached by a domestic or foreign
intelligence agency
as you might imagine nobody said yes
nope now that doesn't mean it's not
happening but
it's not something somebody's going to
say in a tweet now
people ask scott why are you asking this
is it because
you were approached well i'll tell you i
wouldn't have a way to know
which is the the sort of fascinating
part about it
um yeah the fascinating part is that it
wouldn't necessarily be somebody who's
on the payroll
of an intelligence agency it would be
somebody maybe
associated with or you know
working in coordination with or
something like that
so i wouldn't know
all i would know is that people have
contacted me
they've sent me links that they want me
to retweet which happens every day
how would i know
so yeah i mean as far as i know i've
never been aware of anybody who had
you know who got their paycheck from an
intelligence agency
i'm not aware of anything like that but
you have to assume that you're being
influenced you just don't exactly know
how
um yeah he he drowned mysteriously
didn't he
am i somebody says am i a double agent
what would that be in this case a double
agent
uh conspiracy theory much oh
paul let me speak to that so it would be
a conspiracy theory if i said
it definitely is happening because i
don't have evidence
but here's my my point and i've said
this in a different context
whenever you have a situation where
something can be corrupted
and doing so would be a major gain to
somebody
and you have lots of people involved
that thing will always be corrupted
not sometimes always a hundred percent
of the time
because you just have to wait it doesn't
mean you're corrupted on day one
it means you'll eventually get there if
you keep that situation
because always somebody is going to take
the chance
but they might fail somebody else will
take a chance
they might fail but the point is people
are going to keep trying
until they get away with something you
always
you always have enough
um where do you get the full video
uh i don't have a link candy but it's
out there
all right um
that's just a question i put out there
because you know most of your opinions
are assigned to you by the media but one
one wonders how many of those opinions
were
assigned to the media by an intelligence
agency
it's not zero i mean i feel like i can
say that
some of your opinions came directly from
the cia
some of your opinions probably came
directly from foreign intelligence
agencies
it just got it just got
laundered through the media
but you think it's your opinion now all
right i guess the
johnson johnson vaccinations were paused
because they had just a handful of
some problems as nate silver who
again you have to follow nate silver
there's
there are a handful of people that are
just sort of
must follows if you're going to be a an
informed person in the world and nate
silver is one of them
you know even if you don't like anything
about his politics or whatever
you got to follow him just for the math
all right
because people can't do math they can't
do statistics they can't do
risk management but he can so follow
follow nate all right he says in a tweet
six cases out of seven million people
what a disaster this is going to get
people killed
it's going to create more vaccine
hesitancy oh yeah well
these people don't understand
cost-benefit analysis there it is
so nate is saying that
this is just an obvious case of people
who can't do math
i'm saying math but you know it's risk
management
and how do you argue with that it's six
people out of seven million
uh i just don't see the argument for
what they're doing or at least the way
they're presenting it
but i guess the public once they hear
there's a problem they're going to want
to get an answer to it
so i have still not taken my vaccination
it's just still too hard to get it where
i live
and we don't really have much of a hot
spot here
so i'm just sort of waiting to get more
information than
certainly waiting until it's available
locally and i'll make a decision then
remember i told you about court packing
and i said that biden
putting that to a committee was probably
a clever way to kill it
and it turns out that harry reid
prominent democrat believes the same
thing
that the committee is not going to
recommend the change
in in packing the court and so it's just
a way for biden to
cleverly get past the question without
insulting anybody who wanted it
so pretty good i mean i i gotta say
that if you were if you're even a little
bit objective evaluating biden
there are things he said he would do
that he is absolutely doing
you know and i used to give
i used to give trump a lot of credit for
doing what he said he'd do even if he
didn't like it
at least he tried as hard as he could to
keep his his promises
he definitely tried and you see biden
trying too
and i give him credit for that he's
trying to do the things
but in those cases where he would be
trying to do the wrong thing
such as packing the court the way he's
finessing this
and sort of pacing them oh yeah
yeah we should do something we should do
something i'm with you all the way
let's do something hey let's give it to
this committee
and then they'll come up with some good
ideas because we want to get something
done we want to do something
oh the committee said don't do anything
you know i was with you i was with you
all the way team
but new information
this committee is not so hot on it and
listen to their arguments i
i didn't hear it at first but now i hear
it
it's just a it's a pretty elegant way to
handle it i think reparations
is going to go the same way it'll get
thrown off to a committee the committee
will say we can't think of any way to do
it
that would work and then biden will look
like the guy who
took it seriously it's pretty good it's
a pretty good technique
i mean it's weasely but it works
apparently biden administration has
reached a deal with mexico honduras and
guatemala to increase border enforcement
so that the migrants don't leave the
country that they're in in the first
place
does that sound familiar
does it sound like exactly trump's
solution it does doesn't it because it's
exactly trump's solution did i tell you
that
uh biden would be forced to do what
trump has already done
in a variety of ways and that trump will
just look better and better
every year that goes by well another
example
here's another example biden is
basically just recreating
both the policies and the problems that
trump had
at the border
uh why not use plausibility instead of
conspiracy theory
yeah it's a plausibility theory it could
be true
that's a that's a good adjustment the
problem with conspiracy theories is that
people believe them whereas the the
proper approach would be
what are the odds it's plausible it
could be
yeah that that's worth saying well
once again the headline is that uh
uh the u.s government or the military
have confirmed
ufo pictures that sounds
way better than what it really is
and how clear do you think these
pictures are
pretty clear like you can see the
license plate on the ufos
no no not not so clear
more like a blurry smudge a blurry
smudge that looks like a plastic bag
that
just blew up in the air with the wind
that's what it looks like
but the news reports it as ufos
confirmed
yeah they're unidentified that's
confirmed
but no there are no pictures of alien
spaceships
there are some pictures of smudges
that apparently fly um
all right uh uh there's a great
article on breitbart today from nolte
n-o-l-t-e and it says rural trumpers
already live in
tolerant utopia that leftists want
and he makes a good argument that
everything that would be on the list of
what the people on the left want
you know low racism
everybody gets along no no crime
everything's clean
that that already exists
the place that exists is wherever trump
supporters live
the place that those things don't exist
is wherever there are lots of democrats
and is run by democrats and
this matches my experience precisely in
fact it matches my
experience at this moment how many times
have i told you i've left a bernie
how many times have i disagreed with you
on
transgender sports how many times have i
disagreed with you on
you know everything from universal
education
ubi uh health care
all right whole bunch of stuff that i
disagree with you
on politics but i've never felt more
accepted or comfortable
than i am with you group of people who
are almost entirely
politically different from me complete
acceptance
yeah i'm kind of like an outsider in a
sense
now of course we we did come together on
support of trump but for sometimes
different reasons
right you know what i liked about him
might have been completely different
than what you liked
i liked you know he was tough on china
and a few other things
but i don't i don't identify that as
left or right
and and why is it why is it
that we can get along completely while
we have different opinions
and i think it's easy i show you respect
and then you show it back
am i wrong that's the whole thing and
what i was reading nolte's
uh article which is pretty great good by
the way you should read it
um i was thinking well that's like the
whole magic sauce
the magic sauce is treating everybody
respectfully
just having good manners
that's it it let you solve so many
problems
just treating people with respect
because most
you know i was telling you that most of
their news stories are about people who
don't exist
well the person who doesn't exist is
usually a
caricature of a person who does and then
they just
somebody just gives it bad intentions
right the bad intentions are what make
you hate each other
it's not even what you're doing it's
what you think
people are thinking so if you get the
thinking part right
and people understand your intentions
you can get along with anybody it's only
when they imagine your intentions and
their
evil they just can't get along so
i make it very clear that you all
understand my intentions
and then we don't have any problem and
certainly
i'm completely respectful for
right-leaning
opinions and quite respectful to
left-leaning opinions so but i can tell
you that the left
the left has my guts
and i and i've probably helped them as
much as anybody's ever helped them
but the right as long as i treat
their opinions with respect as i do
i get respect back it's just that easy
and it's like it's like a magic thing
all right i'm gonna speaking of respect
i would like to
further my um trend of defending the
hard to defend
so if there's anybody in the news who
has been accused of things
um and they don't really have the
platform to defend themselves for
whatever reason
i like to help defend them now that
doesn't mean i'm right
so i'm going to be acting more like a
defense attorney here now you heard me
do it in the
uh you heard me do it lots of times with
trump you've heard me do it with
matt gates talking about the system not
about any
anything he may or may not have done
that that's up to him to
to to handle right but just talking
about making sure that the system treats
him right
the same way you would want to be
treated i'm going to use the same thing
for the
story about the black lives matter
co-founder
who apparently owns four pieces of real
estate totaling 3.2 million dollars
now the story is that she is a trained
marxist
and that black lives matter it gets lots
of donations that
there's not enough transparency about
where that money's going
and suddenly this blm blm co-founder has
four pieces of real estate worth 3.2
million dollars
and people are saying
one of the people saying that is hawke
newsom
so hawke newsome who's part of the new
york
chapter of black lives matter is is
criticizing
this co-founder now and saying a little
more a little more transparency about
where this money is going please
now here's a little insider news
this is not a new thing that hawk newsom
just started worrying about
all right i never told you this when i
was
having conversations with hawke a few
years ago
i never told you that privately and i
can say it now because he's saying it
publicly
privately he was always concerned about
the lack of transparency
that money was coming into the
organization but
he wasn't seeing any and when i say he
wasn't i mean his organization
so when tons of money were going into
the you know the
the black lives matter national whatever
new york city obviously one of the most
important black lives matter
franchises if you can call it that he
got none of it
right now he probably wanted to
you know not make a thing about that
until this news story broke
and it gave him a it gave him an opening
and he took it
quite smartly and so i would uh back
hawk 100 on this like
like i would back it in the elections
like i back it everywhere
you need full transparency to trust
anything
the only kind of trust we have in this
world is transparency
everything else you don't trust so hawk
is right on
target but let me defend the blm blm
co-founder she is a successful author
with a best-selling book
she's probably the kind of author that
publishers want to give in advance
and say we'd like your next three books
that would be very typical
the amount that you know just being
involved as an author
the amount that she would have been paid
for a best-selling
book in the assumption that maybe she
even got more money or
some is coming for future books
is pretty significant and certainly
enough to pay for all this real estate
because i doubt she paid cash you know
she probably has loans on it or whatever
so there is no evidence let me say this
as clearly as possible
there is no evidence that this blm
co-founder did
anything wrong none
similar the same argument i made for the
the matt gates situation we don't know
what
information might come up in the future
but at the moment
i'm not aware of any evidence that matt
gates did a crime
i hear people talking from sources that
we don't trust
but that's not really evidence right
that we don't trust
unnamed sources say they know something
right um
same thing here there's literally no
evidence of of a
crime now there is evidence that as a
trained marxist
people are saying oh this doesn't seem
very marxist
shouldn't you be giving your money away
instead of keeping it for yourself
to which i say i do not think that is a
fair criticism
it's a fair statement that she's not
acting like a marxist
that's a true statement but i don't
think it's a criticism and here's why
and i and i'm going to be really
consistent about this next statement
on all situations it's within the rules
she lives in the system that she didn't
create that has a set of rules that say
you can buy things and keep it
and so she bought things and she kept it
i'd never blame anybody who is within
the rules
likewise as much as i've been critical
of governor
newsom the one thing i did not criticize
him for
is going to a restaurant that was open
if it's open he can go there now he was
masterless with too many people
and he's apologized for that blah blah
blah
but as long as it was legal to go out to
eat still
he had every right to do it just like
everybody else right i just i just don't
think
that just seems so small to say that the
person who wants the system to change
can't use it until it changes that's
just too small of a
criticism for me so anyway we might find
out that
the co-founder has done any number of
terrible things but there's no evidence
of it and i support
her uh presumption of
no crime unless something changes
all right let's see
uh there's a fake news about this uh
uh the shooting of uh duante
wright apparently some people think it's
because he had an air freshener
it took me about five seconds from the
moment i first heard that the air
freshener
was the cause of the confusion for me to
tweet
i would like to see this air freshener
because that was the least
believable news story you've heard in a
long time
the moment you heard it was something
about an air freshener
what did your brain do nope
right how many of you heard that and
said yeah i can't wait to hear the
details
because i'm i'm sure this air freshener
had something to do with it
question uh
for uh jay foreman i see you're using
the word sophistry
if you're referring to me could you let
me know so i could block you
because anybody who uses that criticism
is too stupid
to be on my live stream
but if you're talking about somebody
else i don't care
so we got that fake news about the air
freshener we know that's fake now
uh apparently he had an arrest warrant
and he resisted
rest and you know
i'm going to be honest i just i can't
generate his sympathy for people who
resist arrest you know as a human being
i have you know empathy that's just sort
of natural and certainly empathy for the
family
and empathy for the person who died but
sympathy is different like you have a
natural reaction just as a human
but i can't get my my rational brain
to see an injustice it's just people
acting stupid
the police as well as somebody who
took some chances they shouldn't have
taken
all right uh so let's talk about the
chauvin trial so the uh the prosecution
was going most of yesterday and i
thought did a
a really good job the prosecution did
now it doesn't mean anything until the
defense
does their case because as if i've told
you anything
too many times it's that each lawyer is
completely convincing
until you hear the other one who is then
completely convincing
until the other one talks again so
you should not be influenced by how
persuaded you were by either of the
attorneys you just sort of have to wait
till they're done because you're
you know if you're experiencing what i'm
feeling the
the sense of whether he'll get convicted
is just going see-sawing back and forth
as it normally would as each lawyer gets
involved but let me
pull out a few key things number one
george floyd's
brother i didn't get the spelling but it
sounded like philonous
philonous floyd was really good
his testimony was really really good
and what i mean by that is that he was
likable
he was in pain and he painted a
very favorable picture of his brother as
a loving brother
supportive liked sports etc
so effectiveness of that was extreme
very good but no facts were presented
does it matter when i listened to his
brother talking i said to myself
we're not even pretending that the facts
will matter are we and
and why was uh and why was
why was it even loud i mean i guess it's
normal right but why are why is a purely
emotional
presentation allowed i don't really
understand that
could be because if you don't understand
who floyd is
you wouldn't have as much insight as to
why he acted the way he acted
maybe but it feels like a
blatant attempt to make the facts go
away
and to replace them with an emotion um
as somebody in the comments pointed out
if your brother is going to testify onto
your behalf
you hope that your brother does not have
a name that reminds you
of felony now i didn't like i said i
didn't see the spelling of the name
but it's something like philonous or
felonious or something like that
and it's an excellent name i mean as
names go it's kind of cool
but it reminded me of felony and so that
wasn't ideal
but what can you do that's his name um
so the the use of force expert that the
prosecution had
uh i don't know if you caught this or if
or if i'm imagining it but i felt as
though he said something that the
prosecution didn't want him to say
and it went like this the expert said
that
um the position alone
the with the knee in the neck and being
on his uh
on his stomach and the pressure on his
back etc would be enough to kill him
but that expert also said that if there
were other issues
that you should have taken him into
account and the prosecution very quickly
tried to cover up but he failed
he tried to cover that by saying oh
other issues
such as the knee on the back
that wasn't what his expert was going
for
the knee on the back was another
variable
but it wasn't quite what the expert was
going to talk about
and the expert to his credit
you know to his credit the expert did
not just
take the cue from the from the
prosecutor he actually finished his
thought
and said that since it was reported that
the floyd was
inebriated that would affect his
breathing
and so the officer chauvin should have
known
that a person who was inebriated would
be at
extra risk put in that situation
so i don't think the prosecution wanted
anybody to say
that something that floyd did i.e taking
drugs
could have contributed to the outcome
but the prosecution's own witness said
that
and he tried to save it by like moving
it over to the knee on the back
but the expert again to his credit he
this was a
you know a little bit of honesty that i
appreciated
seeing and he just said no the
inebriation now the thing that
uh chauvin couldn't have known
is that floyd also had a heart issue
and what he would have seen is a big
strapping athlete
now when the brother testified he talked
about how much they liked to
play sports and apparently floyd was
quite athletic and successful played
college
actually college basketball and
that makes you think that floyd looked
like a big strapping healthy guy
which is sort of supportive for chauvin
isn't it
because we have a testimony that he was
on drugs
and that would have affected his
breathing now this is the prosecution's
case
saying this and and that he was a big
strapping athletic guy
which would would have doubly made you
think he would not be in danger
you know if a 140 pound guy was on top
of him
so i feel like
maybe even though the prosecution's case
was emotionally excellent factually i
think they hurt themselves
but i'm not a lawyer so you know maybe
that's just how it looks to me
um i'm trying to understand manslaughter
in this case
but i think the the a simple definition
is killing somebody
because you're stupid meaning so it's
manslaughter if you had no intention of
killing somebody
and you were also unaware
that it was going to happen but the
reason you're unaware is that you're
just
kind of stupid you just weren't thinking
or you didn't connect a and b an example
given
of one type of manslaughter and the
specifics are different by state
but one kind is a drunk driver
you know that if you drink and get in
your car you're putting other people in
danger and if somebody actually dies
you were stupid you weren't trying to
kill anybody and you didn't
you know you weren't immediately in a
situation that was dangerous
but you were heading toward one
manslaughter
so i'm not sure that um
that chauvin can get away without at
least the manslaughter
because the case that he acted uh
less than smartly is looking pretty
strong
but he does have a good defense which
we'll see and i think you will be
surprised how
well it is how good it is and uh the
defense is that he was distracted by the
crowd
that he didn't show any any knowledge
that he knew what was
happening etc so we'll see if there's
some lower degree charge that sticks
it feels like they will at this point i
think i would agree with
dershowitz that i don't see him getting
away with
no conviction but i don't see him
getting
third degree or second at this point
we'll wait wait to see now given that
the prosecution i believe also
introduced
and the jury has seen it a few times by
now that floyd was complaining about
breathing
long before he got on the ground
now somebody's complaining about
breathing
credibly because when they let him out
of the car the first time
he thanked them and it looked like his
breathing problem
had been at least a little bit
remediated
there's a real question of when they got
him out of the car he was on his knees
handcuffed
why they put him on his stomach and if
if it turns out that they don't have a
good reason for that
looks like manslaughter to me we'll see
what the jury says
but let's wait for the defense because
the defense may say
yeah we had to put him down and here's
the reason
and you know maybe it'll make sense
we'll see
but i don't know of a reason so as long
as he had breathing problems before he
was put down i think that
andy we also know that he lied to the
officers by saying he did not take any
drugs
which would have been an obvious lie to
a police officer
if they know he's lying about not taking
drugs
why would chauvin believe him when he
said he couldn't breathe
in a situation that didn't look like he
had anything to do with breathing
he said it was he said it was
claustrophobic but i'm not sure that
looked
quite credible because he was in a car
you know he was stopped being in a car
so i'm not sure being in the backseat of
a squad car is that much
worse um
and it's illegal to lie to a police
officer is it
i don't know is it is that right is it
illegal to lie to a police officer
i didn't know that uh it's not a good
idea
but so yeah we don't know if he would
have died anyway i don't think that
that's
can ever be an evidence but we can
certainly know that
here's where i think the case is going
to have to go to i think you're going to
have to show that a reasonable person
and that's the phrase being used that a
reasonable person
could have been just as confused or made
the wrong decisions
just as chauvin did if they were wrong
so i think that the reasonable person
defense still has some life we'll see if
we'll see how far that gets them i hear
that
science the national academies
said we must study the technology of
blocking out the sun
with some kind of you know special dust
we would put in the atmosphere
or some kind of chemical spray to
literally reduce the impact of the sun
and people have said quite reasonably
that sounds like a bad idea because it
seems like you go too far
and you destroy the earth i'm not as
worried about it as
you are here's why
i'm not worried because it would be easy
to test as small
you know you just put a little up there
and say all right
did anything change if it didn't put a
little more up there
see if that makes any difference and
it would be nice to simply have the
technology available
so that let's say 20 years from now
things are getting really dire
if it goes that way temperatures have
increased we're getting more
bad impacts well then maybe you use it
then because
at some point your risk reward changes
right
it blocking out the sun today
probably a bad idea blocking out the sun
in 25 years
you know taking a little edge off it in
25 years
is that still a bad idea if if it gets
into an emergency situation in 25 years
i think it changes and it might take us
you know a decade to test anything and
even know if we have something there
so i'm not worried about us overdoing it
we're not going to do it right away
but we definitely ought to know our
emergency
options it doesn't mean it happens
just because we studied it but i'm not
as scared of it as you are
because i think we could look at it
small see what happens
what about farmers losing sun for crops
the whole point is you would not lower
it
below the point where you couldn't grow
crops
nobody's talking about that we're only
talking about
getting rid of the the hellacious heat
apparently new news came out that
california is more likely to burn this
year than any year in the past
meaning that even though the sky was
darkened in california
all summer last year uh it looks like
this is going to be worse
it has to do with the dryness of the
forest they reach some kind of
extra dry state uh that's pretty ugly
so california is going to burn again
we know that and i don't know how we can
keep our governor
i just i just don't know how we can keep
him if california catches on fire again
it's not like we didn't know it was
coming it's not like we lack
you know human power to go i don't know
whatever they do
clear out the underbrush or whatever it
is we got plenty of labor
uh indeed i would like to see an option
where um prisoners don't go to prison
but go to some
geography where they just can't interact
with non-prisoners
much like the australian model but
i feel like the the most the most humane
solution that is in prison
is to just have all the people who can't
be with regular society because they're
too dangerous
maybe just the dangerous ones and just
give them their own
island or give them their own zip code
with a wall around it
something like that and let them work it
out
somebody says alaska yeah maybe
all right that's all i got for now and
i'll talk to you tomorrow
