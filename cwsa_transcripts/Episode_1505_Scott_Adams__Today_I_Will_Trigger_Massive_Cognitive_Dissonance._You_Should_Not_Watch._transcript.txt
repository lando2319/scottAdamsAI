[Music]
good morning everybody
welcome to the most provocative
and annoying live stream you'll ever see
for the rest of your life
today unlike
most of my live streams
where i try to entertain you and
make you happy
today will make you very unhappy
in fact so unhappy i recommend you turn
it off right now
this will be the i don't know maybe i've
done this before
but
quite literally
it's going to make a lot of you really
mad
like really really bad
if you don't want to have that happen to
you
just turn it off because you don't need
that kind of trouble in your life
probably
here's what's going to happen
i'm going to
take apart some of the arguments
about covet we'll do that at the end so
i'm going to do the general stuff first
if you want to hang in here for that
but when we talk about
the cove and stuff
i'm only going to be talking about
decision making
i don't care let me let me be as clear
as possible about this
i love you all
and i don't care if you live or die
can you accept that
i love you all
and i don't care if you live or die
as long as you're pursuing your life the
way you want to pursue it if you want to
do some extreme sports and you die
i love you
but i also don't care because you did
what you wanted to do you died the way
you wanted to die
and i'm all for that completely
so if you can't accept the fact that i
love you
but i'm totally okay with you killing
yourself any way you want to really
that's just your business
so i'm not going to try to shield any
vaccinations or anything like that
and and let me even go the extra
distance
i am so much into your personal freedom
that i will risk my life for you to have
that right because in some small sense
you know we we all take a little extra
risk if you take a little extra risk
with the virus anyway because if you get
if you get sick maybe you get other
people sick etc but
i'm not going to stop you
because your freedom might cost me a
little bit or be dangerous to me i let
you drive a car
and yet you might take a drink and drive
your car into my car
but that doesn't stop me from letting
you drive or trying to stop you from
driving as if i could
i don't care that you
do dangerous sports
even though i know that raises my health
care costs you know if you hurt yourself
and it raises the expense of health care
for everybody in the country
i'll take that i'll take that risk for
your personal freedom
so i'm very very strongly in favor of
your personal freedom
even when it affects me or has a risk
that i accept
because i figure you do the same for me
right
i take risks
you pay for my risks too
part of the deal
all right let's talk about some other
stuff
rasmussen
asks people if they think the economy
will get will be getting stronger or
weaker in the coming year
29
thank you hannah
we will do this up in a moment i i have
not forgotten
um
29 said the economy will be stronger but
47 said they expect it to be weaker
next year
47 of the country thinks the economy
will be weaker next year
remember what i told you about economics
one of the few things i know something
about my if anybody's new to me i have a
degree in economics
and an mba
so one of the things that economists
know is that economics is a
optimism machine
optimism
specifically your expectation that next
year will will be okay
is what drives economics because you
won't invest in anything
if you think it won't pay off
so you have to have optimism in order to
invest
and you have to have investment in order
to have an economy so optimism drives
everything
i if i make a deal with you any kind of
a business deal
it's based on optimism
that you will pay me back or you'll do
your part of the deal you know without
optimism everything falls apart
so
i've argued that trump brought the
optimism in a way
few people could right he was a
salesperson from the economy for the
united states america first
and i feel as if trump was unambiguously
the better optimism president he said it
directly
i'm going to be the cheerleader for the
country and for the economy and then he
went out and did it
and even people who didn't like trump
still thought the economy was going to
do well
so
i i don't think you can ignore this
that the president is pretty directly a
cause of what you think about the
economy now suppose trump had been
president but we still had all this debt
you know debts
it's something you got to worry about
it's not exactly like personal debt we
don't quite understand national debt
economists
i think would agree that they were
completely wrong
about how much debt we could take on
completely wrong i mean like
maybe by a
a factor of 10
they've been wrong
or were they wrong maybe we can't handle
the debt maybe we'll be surprised but
certainly
you know national debt doesn't operate
the way personal debt does with personal
debt you kind of know what's too much
you know at least within a narrow range
but with national debt we don't know
you know as long as you have nuclear
weapons and people like your currency
better than other currency i don't
maybe you can just inflate away most of
your troubles and nobody notices
um
somebody's suggesting that we all pray
for rain
worth the shot pray for rain for the
whole country
um so how about this woodward book so
the the book peril that we're all
talking about
uh i learned yesterday that in that book
woodward treats the fine people hoax as
though it's a historical fact
not a fact that it's a hoax
woodward
treats the fine people hoax
like it's not a hoax like it actually
happened and he reports it as one of the
reasons that biden was so interested in
being president
now
there are many sketchy things in this
and other woodward books things which
are quotes that people say i didn't
really say that et cetera
but
here's the thing
i'm starting to wonder if watergate
really happened
right
because everything we knew about
watergate came from woodward and
bernstein
at least originally
and
they don't have any credibility
i mean i guess i suppose they did when
they
did the watergate stuff
but at the moment
we know that woodward at least
is not a credible character he's not
even close
i mean if you believe the fine people
hoax and you put it in a book
in 2021 it's in a book that's
embarrassing really
it doesn't seem like there's any
interest in the truth
and
i'm i'm semi joking about doubting
watergate but here's what i do think i
wonder if the details of watergate are
even close
probably the big pictures right
well i bet the details are all wrong
if these guys were the only source of
those details i suppose a lot of it
could be independently checked
all right we got a little mystery here
with excess mortality who knows if the
data is right but it comes from our
world indata.org
and adam dopamine was tweeting about
this apparently the numbers showed that
2020 was a much higher than normal
excess mortality completely
understandable because we had a massive
pandemic
so the 2020 numbers make complete sense
way higher than the baseline we had a
pandemic
perfectly explained
but 2021 is below average
can you explain that
how do you explain
that we're below average mortality
how do you explain
well let me give you an explanation that
i think makes sense
uh that the people who are gonna die
this year died last year
right
the the pandemic took out all the
the people closest to death
and if you take out all the people who
are closest to death
the obvious
outcome of that should be a lower than
normal death rate for the next
three to five years
probably three
wouldn't you say yeah the vulnerable
died early right so i think this number
actually makes perfect sense
doesn't mean it's right could be there's
a lag could be the date is wrong any of
those are possibility but but it makes
sense based on what we know
it's a perfectly sensible outcome even
if it turns out later to be wrong
um
that's some weird things happening with
my printer here oh here we go
all right
um we're going to talk about
cove into stuff now so those of you who
don't like this conversation i would
invite you to leave because
you don't need to have any bad feelings
about me just come back when i'm not
talking about this now i did hear your i
i have heard all of your
uh complaints yeah we will do this
simultaneous sip before i do this that's
a good idea
thank you uh on locals for reminding me
actually why don't we do that now
you know if you'd like to enjoy this
morning
to the maximum potential what you need
is a simultaneous zip and all you need
for that is a couple of marker gossip
tanker chelsea steiner candy jugger fast
a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now
commercial free
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine here of the day the thing that
makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip it
happens now go
yeah
yeah so good
all right we're going to talk about
covet stuff but as you know my beat is
not health
my beat is not health so none of this is
about your health choices okay it's only
about how you think about it
the only thing i care about
is how you think about it don't care if
you die
as long as you're living your life the
way you want it
all right
so
here's the first question
if hearing that some percentage of
vaccinated people are still getting
covered
makes you conclude that vaccinations
don't work
i've got one question for you
how does confirmation feel when you're
in it
now here's the thing you need to know
about confirmation bias
the people who have it
don't know it
but the people who don't have it because
for whatever reason they're uninterested
in the question usually
they can see it it's like really obvious
to the observer
if you're being irrational it's just not
obvious to you
so
i'm telling you
that if you have this opinion you're
experiencing confirmation bias i'm a
third party
and i'm not terribly interested one way
or the other because like i said i don't
care if you live or die
don't care if you get vaccinated and not
moreover
i'm not even so sure i made the right
decision
hear this really clearly
i got vaccinated
i made that decision
am i sure i made the right decision nope
nope
if i were sure i made the right decision
then you could say to me hmm
might be confirmation bias but i'm
telling you i'm not sure
that's almost a guarantee to get out of
jail card
if you can say unambiguously i don't
know
i could be wrong it could be that
getting vaccinated was a big mistake
maybe
i mean i don't think so i'm playing the
odds i think the odds are strongly in my
favor
but i don't know
and the people who are skeptical are not
crazy
are they
are they is anybody who's skeptical
crazy
we do have a vaccination that
you know we don't know
you know if anything could pop up in the
long term
who knows
i don't think so i think the the risk
was worth it but i don't know
okay so here's your first tip
remember
i'm not telling you anything about
vaccinating or not vaccinating i'm just
talking about the psychology of it
if you can say out loud
i made a choice but i really don't know
if it's the right one
you might not have confirmation bias
that would be one way to tell
but if you say to yourself i didn't get
the vaccination and damn it i'm right
i'm really right
you might you might be right that's one
possibility but you might have
confirmation bias the person who says i
don't know if i'm right or not almost
certainly doesn't
because the the conditions for it don't
exist
but here's the problem
what if
and i'll
i'll just put this the way i put it to
my critic it looks like page didn't
print here or something in my notes
if if you think that the vaccinations
don't work
because you need a booster does anybody
think that is there anybody here
who would say to me the vaccinations
don't work
because you need boosters
or i'll modify that they don't work as
promised
because you need boosters does anybody
think that
who has that opinion
that vaccinations don't work or at least
don't work as promised
because of boosters
well do you know that tetanus shots are
vaccinations
and they require boosters did you know
that
there are other shots which require
boosters
it's not the only one
now
if you get a tetanus shot
uh you might need it only every 10 years
or some say even 30.
is the tetanus shot just as good in
let's say the eighth year as it was the
first year
what do you think
is that tetanus shot
just as good in year nine
as it was in year one
well apparently not
unless unless booster shots are a
hundred percent until the day they're
not
i don't think that's the case
seems like they probably just wear off
slowly and after 10 years it's smart to
get another one
but could you say that somebody who has
the
tetanus shot could still get tetanus
well yes right
because otherwise there wouldn't be
boosters would there
if you couldn't get tetanus
while you also had a boot a tetanus
vaccination
you would never need a booster
somebody fact checked me on that i mean
it sounds logical but with this medical
stuff there could be some non-obvious
explanation for things
all right
so
um i would say the fact that the
vaccinations do not work perfectly
and for as long as you'd like them to
is not uncommon
and therefore not a question of whether
they work or don't work
all right now if you disagree with what
i just said probably you're having some
kind of confirmation bias problem
right
and some of you said but wait scott
10 years for a booster that's way
different than six months
yeah that's way different
not in a way that matters
it doesn't matter to the argument
i mean it matters to your life of course
but it doesn't matter to the argument
the argument is
can it be called a vaccination if it
doesn't completely stop the thing as
fascinating and the answer is yes
that is the standard the standard is you
can call it a vaccination even if it
doesn't completely stop the thing that
you're trying to stop
does every person who get a vaccination
not
get i know chickenpox
are there any doctors on here who can
answer that do you think that everybody
who got the chickenpox
vaccination
do you think none of them got chickenpox
i bet some dude
i bet they did
so the fact that a vaccination is not
100 doesn't mean it's not a vaccination
it just means that
it's a little less than it could be it's
a little it's leaky
right it's a leaky vaccination
now
did they lie to us
here's the next question did the experts
lie to us
i'd say no
because
they probably were optimistic
and might have actually thought it would
be closer to 100 than it is
now do you think that they knew
that you need a booster
let me ask you this how many uh trials
of the vaccinations were there
like moderna how many trials did they do
in pfizer how many trials did it do
because if they only did i don't know
one or two however many each of them did
how many doses
different doses did they test
probably one or two
right and how did they know what to test
like how do they know what dose to test
they didn't
they didn't they couldn't have
educated guests
it was an educated guess
so what are the odds that their educated
guests get exactly the right amount of
vaccination you need
very low
very low common sense tells you that
they were guessing a little bit
a little bit and that there might be
some adjustments needed
so if they guessed on the low side
meaning they didn't want to kill you
with the vaccination itself so they made
it low enough
that you know maybe it gave you some
side effects but didn't kill too many
people
yes i know the vaccinations have side
effects yes i know that every
vaccination kills people and that more
of them apparently with this vaccination
perhaps than others
but there's no such thing as a
vaccination that they can guess
accurately the right amount
test it once
and then they just got lucky they got
the right amount
so the fact that they have to
um i'm seeing
the vares database being
shown to me about all the
alleged
adverse events
most of you know the vares database
should not be used right
do any of you think the vares database
gives you
useful information
about the adverse side effects
it does not it's not for that
it's self-reported
so
what it is is to raise flags
such that
you would more quickly notice if there
was something to look into
so the vera's database tells you there's
something to look into
it doesn't tell you there's a problem
it's not meant for that it's not
designed for that
right the reason you have controlled
experiments is because
self-reported stuff is so wildly
inaccurate that's not useful for
for scientific decisions
yeah so would we all agree that the
vares database has raised important
questions which we should really look
into
everybody agree with that
the vares database where people
self-report the side effects it
absolutely
raises a flag
that we should look into
there's nobody who disagrees with that
right
but do you also also agree
that it's not intended to give you the
answer it's just supposed to raise the
flag so you look into it
we're all on the same page on the varis
database
and if you weren't you are now because
if you thought that it was telling you
something it isn't it's just raising a
raising a question basically
all right um
isn't it kind of too late well
that's an important question too
so here are some
cognitive dissonance
that got triggered when i started asking
these questions on twitter today and
i'll tell you how to recognize cognitive
dissonance in case it happened to you
here here are some of the comments from
people who are all almost certainly
experiencing
cognitive dissonance you ready
uh
a tweet that just says
i had a bad take
it's a bad take no other reason it's
just a bad take when you see an attack
on the person without any
any reference to the reason that's
almost always cognitive dissonance
because people will include a reason
if they have one
and if they don't have one it's
cognitive dissonance
so
why would you say i had a bad take
instead of saying for example you're
underestimating
something something
um hey norwood
norwood says i have two states and
they're both boring and yet he's decided
to stay here so we're going to hide you
from the channel because you're an
 also very dumb because you do
things that you don't like repeatedly
like listening to me
very dumb if you don't like it
probably stop doing it probably
all right um another comment i got today
somebody said you should have thought
this through before sending in other
words before tweeting
do you think that this person couldn't
have put
any reference to what was wrong with my
thinking in a tweet wouldn't fit not
enough alert not enough words
no easily you could put what's wrong
with it you underestimated this
you have a wrong fact
your logic connecting this to this
doesn't work lots of things you could
have said
another one i got today was that's not
how it works
and then a reference to my dilbert
cartoon career
that's not how it works
or that's not how any of this works
the dow is down 600. geez
um
so these are the uh arguments that uh
are pretty much tip-offs for cognitive
dissonance
here's an economist's tip
how to compare things one of the things
that economists learn is how to
accurately compare the right stuff if
you're comparing the wrong things you're
always going to get the wrong decision
right you have to compare the right
things that's just basic here's what
people are doing wrong in their
comparisons
if you're comparing
the coven vaccination
to your original belief of how good it
would be
you haven't done anything good or useful
right and most of you are doing that
right a lot of the anti-vaxx people the
vaccination skeptics are saying scott
scott scott
if you compare what they
they led us to believe about the
effectiveness of the vaccination and its
safety if you compare that to what we
got
whoa
we didn't get what they promised
so therefore it's all a scam and a shell
and a
and uh it'll kill you does that make
sense
no
that's the wrong comparison because the
thing that you imagined it would be
never existed
you get that
the thing you imagined it would be 100
effective or whatever you imagine that
never existed
that was in your mind it wasn't in the
real world
in the real world here's the comparison
that makes sense
getting vaccinated
versus not getting vaccinated
that's the comparison that matters
because your decision is vaccinated or
not vaccinated that's all that matters
vaccinate or not vaccinate if you're
still comparing
how you felt about it in the beginning
to how it turned out a little less than
you hoped closer to you know 80 to 90
effectiveness against hospitalization
and death
um maybe 80 effective and keeping you
from getting it in the first place but
not 100
and not 99
we hope for that
so don't compare it to your expectations
that's nothing
that's nothing and i saw people doing
that today and it's just purely
irrational
your expectations are always
disappointing
compared to reality
so there was a troll this morning who
learned that the find people hoax was a
hoax
for the first time
and
that was kind of fun watching somebody
fall into that trap um
and here's how you know that you've
triggered somebody into cognitive
dissonance now it for the anybody who's
new new to me
live streaming i'm a trained
hypnotist
and so i know how to trigger people into
cognitive dissonance i can do it
intentionally and i can do it almost at
will
most of you do it too
but
less directly and less intentionally
anybody can trigger somebody into
cognitive dissonance
but when
a twitter user named who radiation
found out today that the fine people
thing was a hoax
here's one of the tells the word salad
word salad so they will say something
when they're experiencing cognitive
dissonance
but they're the only person who thinks
it makes sense
everybody else reading it would say
all right here's another example of a
cognitive dissonance right here from el
diablo loco poco so here's the classic
one scott scott scott it sounds like you
are suffering cognitive
dissonance and are rationalizing your
decision to be vaccinated
now what's now what's wrong with that
comment and why do i say that is
cognitive dissonance i'll read it again
and see if you can if you can feel the
sound with me
scott scott scott it sounds like you are
suffering cognitive dissonance and are
rationalizing your decision to be
vaccinated
did i not just tell you
that i could be totally wrong about
getting vaccinated why do i need to
rationalize it
i told you what i looked at
i told you what the odds were
if the facts were wrong that i used i'll
say oh damn those facts were wrong so i
got the wrong decision
would be my trigger for cognitive
dissonance you have to look for the
trigger
i don't have a trigger
there's nothing that can cause me to
have cognitive dissonance because i'm
not committed to a side
you have to be committed to an opinion
before you can be triggered i'm as
non-committed as you could possibly be
now
i'm also allowing that i could have made
the right decision
and had the wrong outcome
will you allow me that let's say i
looked at the odds and the odds were um
hypothetically you don't have to agree
with this but let's say i looked at the
odds and i thought the odds were uh that
i should get vaccinated
and then maybe i'm one of the people who
has a bad outcome from the vaccination
itself did i make a wrong decision
i'd say no because if you make a
decision based on the odds it's the
right decision it's just a bad outcome
now
given that i make that distinction
that i can make a good decision and
still have perfectly reasonable to have
a bad outcome
i don't have anything that can trigger
me into cognitive dissonance
because everything that can happen is
within my model
right that's the best way to say it
everything that's possible
fits within my model of the world
because my model of the world says well
i followed the odds as best i understood
them
data was probably wrong
maybe even some of my thinking was wrong
but you know i had to make a decision so
if it turns out i'm completely wrong
about everything it's still in my model
it's still consistent with everything
i've said oh i could be wrong on those
facts i could have made the wrong
decision
but if your model says
that what you did is the only thing
that's possible
as soon as something outside of your
model happens
you're triggered into cognitive
dissonance so you've got to make sure
that your model
of reality
incorporates all the possibilities
that's the only way you can keep
yourself at a cognitive distance
did you get that
so now how many of you are asking
yourself
hey
i think i trapped myself
i created a trap for myself
by creating a world view
that doesn't allow the other one in
did you do that did you create a
worldview that just doesn't let the
other one in
because if you did
you're setting yourself up
you're setting yourself up
our comments off no comments are on
comments are on i am reading them
i don't comment on all the comments but
i'm reading them
um
find somebody says find the clip of norm
macdonald saying how he wants his
funeral to be
you know i i actually had some
instructions in my estate
and my will at one point for having a
funny funeral but i took those out
uh would you make the same decision
today yeah i would
because i don't think the data changed
enough
um and remember i'm in a higher risk
category
so any decision i make about
vaccinations doesn't apply to any of you
you get that right
do you get that my decision
about vaccination should not apply to
any of you like you shouldn't be
influenced by it at all because my you
know i'm in a high risk category
right and and my high risk is different
that you're high risk it's different
than everybody else's so you definitely
should not be influenced by my decision
that would be irrational
you don't have the same variables
here's a
here's a comment from
mr janice esquire a lawyer i i assume
first name hugh
last name janice
his lawyer
uh how does that sound if you say his
first name and his last name together
first name hugh
last name janice
huge anus
huge anus
esquire so hugh janus
says uh
to me he goes uh that scott is having
another one of his vax spells
where he thinks if people don't vax they
will die
does that sound like me
does it does this sound like something
that happens to me on a regular basis
that if that i get under this vac spell
where i think that if people don't vax
they will die
nope
i think you're all gonna die
me too
i think you'll die if you get vaxed i
think you'll die if you don't get vaxed
i think you're all going to die
and do i care if you die soon
nope long as you're happy long as you
made the you live the life you want to
live i'm good with that
so a complete hallucination of my
opinion
by hugh janus esquire
um
and he says that i'm a vax shell do you
know any vax shills
who advise you to
do whatever you want and die
i would be the worst vax shell in the
world
if i told you i don't care if you get it
you can die
any way you want
any way you want
as long as you'll allow me the same
let's talk about uh hunter pepper the 19
year old council member
who vowed to quote fight to the end
against a masked mandate in decatur
decatur i guess decatur alabama
revealed he's been hospitalized with
shallow breathing
and of course the photo of hunter pepper
and we do not do fat shaming
no fat shaming on this channel
we don't do addiction or alcoholic
shaming either they're all in the same
category in my opinion
which is we think we have free will but
addiction
addiction is kind of a different thing
and i do think people can be addicted to
food and addicted to all kinds of stuff
so i don't make fun of people have
addictions because i don't believe in
free will the way other people conceive
of it and i would appreciate if you did
not make fun of people who are
overweight just for being overweight
because
they just have an addiction you don't
have
if you're lucky
but how in the hell
i mean i just have to say this every
time they do that how in the hell do you
not mention his weight
you know he's clearly quite overweight
and
every time they show this picture i feel
like it's doing the opposite of what
they want i feel like they're doing
these
i feel like they're doing these
these uh anecdotal stories about the
person who
thought the vaccination was
bad and then got hospitalized but it's
all a story of overweight people
they're all overweight stories
and if we don't treat them that way i
don't know what i don't
i don't know how we
get through this any smarter
like if we're trying to get through this
alive and smarter we're not doing the
right thing for that
so
i got a tweet from uh
d
d o genius
so this is somebody who puts the word
genius right in their twitter twitter
handle
may i make a recommendation
brief recommendation
if you're going to brand yourself with
the word genius
it does
sort of give you the responsibility to
up your game a little bit you know to
act a little geniusy
because people are going to be watching
if you call yourself a genius
so let me explain what this genius
tweeted today
he said to me if learning that eighty
percent of people dying from covent in
the uk are fully vaccinated according to
the public health blah blah
makes you conclude that vaccinations
work
how does confirmation bias make you feel
scott
so here he's calling me out for my own
confirmation bias
by saying that 80 of people dying in
great britain or uk
are fully vaccinated
so how does that work scott
how does that work
well let me ask you some questions
in response
deo genius
i'll ask you your question after you
answer a couple of mine
number one
why do bank robbers
rob banks
why don't they rob let's say trash dumps
why why do they go to banks
could it be
that's where the money is
yeah that's where the money is
willie sutton allegedly said that but
probably didn't
yes
um here's another one
um
did were you aware
that
uh
almost 98
of all the people who die in china
are chinese
did you know that
why
why is it that almost everybody who dies
in china is chinese
like what causes that
is it some kind of weird disease
i'm all confused
and so would a d o genius be confused
now let's take the uh
let's take the uk where most people are
vaccinated
let's see
in a world where most people are
vaccinated
um
what kind of people would be dying
could it be the people who were
vaccinated because that's almost all
there is
if
if all you have is people who are
vaccinated
who the hell else is going to be dying
right
my expectations were there were zero
percent chance it would be completely
safe yeah well
zero percent chance is completely safe
um
so here's the thing
if if your country is entirely
vaccinated then only vaccinated people
will die of covet because we do know
that people get it and they die even if
they're vaccinated
so
don't call yourself genius
if you don't understand why most of the
people in china who die are chinese
they're chinese
because that's who lives there
let me take it to the next extreme in
case in case mr genius wasn't following
that
i'll make it a little simpler
if a hundred percent of the people in a
country whatever country it is
are vaccinated 100 are vaccinated
what percentage of the people who die in
that country would be vaccinated
work on that and get back to me if a
hundred percent are vaccinated
what percentage of the people dying in
that country would also be vaccinated
i know it's a tough one but see if you
can get that right
all right
um
that
is my lesson on cognitive dissonance and
confirmation bias
now
um
i think i touched all my incredibly
important points yes i did yes i did
so
um
let me look at your comments scott if
you get covid will you get regeneron yes
i will
and you know i'll get regeneron
will it be because regeneron was
tested in long-term trials
did did anybody do a long-term test of
regeneron
as a treatment for covet
what
what there's no 10-year study of
regeneron for covenant patients
why would you put that in your body
it seems a little experimental to me
doesn't it
so you would put regeneron into your
body just because all the experts say it
works
even knowing
there are no long-term 10-year trials of
regeneron
for covet you would put that in your
body
i would
yeah i probably would
but
your only your all of your options are
untested stuff
does everybody get that
every one of your option
is untested
for the long term
for the short term you actually know
your your vaccination risk pretty well
because we have you know millions and
millions of short term experiences
it's the long term you're worried about
right you're worried about uh
being
infertile or whatever
yeah same thing with ivormectin same
thing now we do know that a lot of these
have been
safe
for
other conditions for years
but who exactly was tracking the
long-term effects of ivermectin
is that a study
did somebody ever do a 10-year study of
vivermectin
for for the other problems not for a
covet
i doubt it
right do you think somebody did a
10-year study
to follow up and see if ivermectin was
for anybody 10 years later
no
no didn't do it for the vaccinations
didn't do it for anything you're going
to put in your body
somebody says maybe i don't think so
merck is coming out with uh therapeutic
to replace ivermectin yeah a little bit
we know ivermectin is not 100 fatal
after 10 years well we know it's not 100
fatal here
um
yes ivormectin's been used for 10 plus
years in other countries why does that
matter
they weren't studying it
were they
nobody's i don't think any country
studied
how do all the people look 10 years
after taking ivermectin
now what do you think is the period
beyond which a vaccination
is almost certainly telling you
everything that you need to know about
side effects
how long do you think that period is
in the comments we'll see if you see how
well informed you are
how many days weeks months or years
after taking a vaccination we'll say
vaccinations in general
uh how long do you wait before you
really really know you've got just about
all the side effects
somebody says two weeks
i'm looking at all your uh
i see one month
one month 20 years
36 months 15 minutes
48 hours
why don't you all know the answer to
this
this is one of those uh
oh my god this is one of those facts
that should be
the most important fact in your decision
about getting vaccinated
if i had to say there was one fact
that you should know
to make a decision about vaccination it
would be this and none of you know it
none of you know it
not one of you is right
none
i'm watching all your answers i'm seeing
two years a lifetime 15 minutes
none of you are even close
it's the number one most important
variable
the number one most important variable
in your personal decision about whether
to get a vaccination
and not a one of you knows the
answer to it
this is public information
i've seen it a number of times
the answer is two months
two months
after two months
the odds of anything bad happening to
you in the long term
become really small
they don't disappear
but really small
and that first 15 minutes tells you a
whole lot right that's why they make you
wait but two months
typically for all other vaccinations
that's where problems
appear
now
i'm seeing robert laughing now i'm not
saying that uh
that everything has to fit into that
model i'm saying that if you didn't know
that and you made your decision on
vaccinations that was a very irrational
decision
if you were not aware
that two months gets you pretty much
everything you need to know about side
effects not all of it not 100
but close
oh somebody said two months sir good for
you
all right so
i'm kind of blown away by this i really
am i'm kind of blown away that the most
important variable nobody know it was
like one person who knew
and that's it
i would say that was the thing that made
my decision
i would say i based my decision on the
thing that almost nobody knew here but
was public information
that after two months you know you know
remember i told you in the beginning
people asked me from day one am i gonna
get the vaccination do you remember what
i said
yes but not in the first two months
right
and i waited uh
six months i think i waited six months
before i get or five or something before
getting vaccinated what was my risk
after waiting five months for other
people's experience to tell me if it was
dangerous enough pretty low
pretty low i mean i don't know how to
calculate it there's no way to do that
below
now that's low based on
living life and seeing that usually it's
two months or so tells you everything
you need to know it doesn't mean it's
true with these i mean mrna stuff might
be different
but
um
oh and the fact that i'm in yeah i'm fit
and healthy but i'm also 64 and i have
asthma
so i'm on the short list of people who
die from covent
right if you have asthma you're in your
bad shape i'm pretty sure the people who
died from it had asthma and were fat if
we're being honest
probably
so
yeah um
thalidomide
thalidomide would be the the counter
example of something that took a while
for uh people to realize
but
correct me if i'm wrong
i believe that current medical processes
i need a fact check on this
okay this is an important one so so if
you could really give me a fact check on
this my understanding would be that we
would not make the thalidomide
mistake today
that we have safeguards that would have
caught that early in other words we
wouldn't have had to wait
to find out it was bad
give me a fact check on that i think we
would we would have caught that one if
it happened today i think we would have
caught it right away
but maybe not
yeah and let's say you only had one
example
in which the vaccine did have some bad
outcomes and they were pretty bad
later
still that would give you lots of
vaccinations that didn't have that
problem so you'd still be looking well
one did but 20 did not 1 in 20 5 chance
um
smoking a lot of weed is protecting your
lungs you say
that might actually be true we don't
know
yeah
and then yeah i think there is a
separate question about pregnant women
that's a whole different calculation but
you know pregnant women don't want to
have covet either so
um well i think locals comments are
quite responsive whoever said they're
not
because they're they're in real time
it's not a vaccine
it is a vaccine tetanus is a vaccine and
you need a booster for tetanus too
all right
um
40 booster what
all right i gotta run and i'll talk to
you
tomorrow um
how many of you
i'm seeing people suggesting different
uh
drugs or things that may have had
long-term
um
consequences i'd love to see a summary
of that a summary of
any meds or vaccinations that did have
long-term consequences in relation to
all the meds that have ever been
improved you know is it one percent
i don't know
five percent have no idea
all right um
i will talk to you
tomorrow
and i see your
