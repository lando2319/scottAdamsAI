good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization it's
called
coffee with scott adams and it features
something you may have heard of
it's called the simultaneous sip that's
right
and it makes everything better
uh probably going to need some extra
sips today if you know what i mean to
make everything better but let's let's
just jump right into it
are you ready all you need is a copper
mugger glass attacker chelsea's time to
can't you juggle flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite beverage
i like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine of
the day thing makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous
sip
it happens now go
ah
yeah
well
um
my favorite story of the day in a day
with
not so much good news happening
is do you remember the canadian lady who
was a protester in the truck convoy
and she was trampled by horses
well i guess she's okay
and she has a twitter account called
trampled lady
or candy
parentheses trampled lady
and she tweeted today that after getting
trampled by horses by trudeau
i decided i would be moving to florida
with my family
now i wish i had a nickel
for every time somebody who had been
trampled by trudeau's horses moves to
florida
i don't know it's some kind of a trend
you get trampled by trudeau's horses and
you're like florida i'm out of here
so look for more of that because i
expect two of those horses will be doing
some more trampling
well here's the big story that's not
ukraine we'll get to ukraine in a minute
but
biden's nominating it looks like not
looks like he is nominated
um
katanji
i'll have to hear how her name is
actually pronounced before i know i'm
doing it right but i think it's katanji
brown jackson
are
reputed to be a highly qualified
human being
who in any normal world would probably
just
glide right onto the supreme court but
we live in a contentious system and so
the republicans will fight it to death
or something
do you know what they should do
what's the smartest thing for
republicans to do
well they should ask all the tough
questions that they're supposed to ask
because some of those will become you
know clips and
you know they can use it for political
reasons so they'll probably do
questioning that tries to invite some
kind of an embarrassing
or compromising answer to make biden
look bad if nothing else but
once they've done their questions
anything short of unanimous approval
is going to look stupid
am i wrong
because i i think everybody believes
that there shouldn't be any trouble with
the actual
candidate
now we could be surprised but assuming
there are no surprises no surprises
whatsoever
aren't we going to be in a situation
where the republicans are just going to
look like racists if they vote against
her
all it does is return the same balance
to the court that was there before
same number of liberals same number of
conservatives and if she is not the one
who gets
on the supreme court
it's going to be somebody with similar
views
because you can't keep the supreme court
unoccupied or a seat open forever
and i don't think we're that close to
getting the next president
so this is one of those cases where we
can see if the republicans are working
on
reflex
or strategy
this will be like the clearest example i
think you'll ever see
if it's reflex they'll do everything
they can to stop the nomination
for no good reason it won't be good for
republicans it won't be good for the
country won't be good for democrats
won't be good for the candidate it won't
be good for anybody
so will republicans do something that is
unambiguously bad for everybody
i think they will
i think they will
i actually think that republicans will
be so stupid that they fight
this tooth snail to the end what do you
think
i i think i've lost
all faith in everybody
just everybody
you know maybe not maybe not elon musk
elon musk is still cool
right but everybody else just everybody
else
is useless at this point
so
by the way do you disagree with my
analysis of this
that fighting it tooth and nail would be
the dumbest thing anybody ever
did
am i wrong
i'm not seeing agreement or disagreement
with okay i see some agreements
that this is about the simplest
political question of all time
now of course i'm making a big
assumption here that she's gone through
some vetting before and that there are
no surprises
i think that's reasonably fair but if
there are no surprises
the republican strategy is crystal clear
because what do they want for their next
nominee
they want their next nominee to go
through
because they know they're going to be in
power in a few years
you think they want to not not get their
nominees through no they want that
so i think that the smart thing is to
give balance back to the court same
balance they had they still have the
majority
set a precedent
that says if there are no big problems
you're going to you're going to vote yes
do your job which is vetting of course
and then next time the republicans want
to
pick somebody say look
when you had your candidate
when you had your candidate we gave you
100
support
we're looking for the same now that
doesn't mean they'll get the same but i
think it could help and there's no gain
whatsoever for fighting the nomination
unless we have some surprises
all right rasmussen is asking the
american public about uh biden's
handling of the russian aggression
toward ukraine
uh 49 of americans who answered the poll
said he's doing a poor job
and 53 said defending america's borders
is more important than defending ukraine
so normally when war breaks out
it's good for the leader
you know even if it's an unpopular war
at least the first week or so
the leader usually gets some support but
it's not exactly our war is it
it looks like a war that we uh
if i'm being honest
i think the united states caused this
war
does anybody else think that
i think the u.s caused this war
i'm seeing some yeses
now
you know one argument against what what
i just said
is that
it requires everything to be true in
order to get where you are now
so the us's actions are just you know
part of the variables everybody else
would have to do exactly what they were
doing
to get where we are so it's not like you
could change one variable and know what
would happen you don't
anything could happen if you change one
variable could go the same direction it
could go a different one but at the
moment
it looks like the united states created
a situation
in which we said we would
you know guide and protect ukraine
and instead we turned it into a threat
didn't we
did you see the video of
adam chiff
in 2020 i think
saying that we wanted to support ukraine
so we don't have to fight russia here
we'll fight russia there so we don't
have to fight him here
that sounds like an offensive mood
doesn't it
that sounds like an offensive mood so
we've got a member of congress who said
in public
that we have offensive intentions about
russia
and that we would fight fight them in
ukraine we actually said we're fighting
russia
like one of our politicians said that in
public oh yeah we're fighting russia
over there so we don't have to fight him
here
how's that sound in russia
sounds like an offensive
move
do you think that putting a nato cap on
ukraine is a defensive move or an
offensive move in the comments
is that a defensive or offensive move
to bring ukraine into
i see it as offensive
i see it as offensive
now i'm not on russia's side
do you believe that first of all
i'm not sure if anybody but he believes
anything at this point but do you
believe i'm not on russia's side
i hope you do
but even though
to me it looks like america caused this
problem
i also think that trump wouldn't have
caused it
i don't think he would have
because i think trump can read the room
better
right i'm not saying trump is perfect
and biden's all bad
i don't do that game
i'm just saying that trump can read a
room like nobody can read a room
like he can really read a room
and i feel like he would have figured
out
some way past this
because it's a psychological problem
it's not a physical problem
it's a physical problem if the
psychological part you know spills over
into it which it usually does but if you
solve it psychologically
you don't get the physical part
and i don't think biden has those
capabilities
i think trump did
i think trump had the ability to just
shake the box
until the box lined up the way he wanted
so it's not like he would just do like a
strategy that's different i'm not saying
that
i'm saying that whatever trump did
wouldn't look anything like this
it would just be different
he would say different things he would
push different buttons
what would we get
i don't know i think he'd shake the box
and see what happened
and if we liked it we'd keep it if and
if he didn't like it he'd shake it again
i think he'd just keep shaking it until
he got a situation he liked
and that's just not a capability that
biden has biden has the
we're the adults in the room
so the way we've always treated things
is the way we'll continue treating them
be nice and predictable so they know
exactly what you're going to do trump
would have been unpredictable as hell
unpredictable as hell
you wouldn't even know what side he was
on after a while
you don't think that would help
of course it would help
of course it would help
you don't think trump could get a
message uh
land in the
that would land on the public
of russia
yeah he could
can biden
can biden create a narrative that
actually takes hold in the people of
russia
maybe but he's not good at it
who's good at that
trump
trump is good at that
yeah he wouldn't have to get all of
russia to believe him but if he got 25
of them that's a pretty big problem for
putin
all right
now of course it's always unfair to say
you know the other person would have
done it better it's sort of the grass is
always greener sort of thing so you
should be aware that there's a bit of an
illusion that follows all of this
we don't know that trump would have done
a better job we don't know that it's
just that his personality
appears more fit for the task that's all
that's all you can say for sure
all right here's the thing that is
making me wonder how much our own fake
news is faking us on this story
let me do a fact check with you
fact check for those who've been
watching the news
is ukraine
infiltrated or
does it have too many neo-nazis in the
government and military itself
yes or no
is that a real charge
that the number of neo-nazis actual
neo-nazis
in the ukrainian military and in the
ukrainian
government
true or false
all right most of you are saying no
oh a few yeses now those of you who are
saying no where did you get that
information
what is the source of your information
that the ukrainian government and
military are not
um
not filled with but let's say
let's say does not have a significant
amount of neo-nazis in it
where did you learn that
did you learn that from western press
you did right
so if you believe that there is not
not
an important neo-nazi problem with
ukraine
you got that from your own press
are they credible
not really
not on war stuff especially anything
about war there's no press that's
credible
basically nobody
but we all believed it didn't we
i believed it
i would say that it's just one of those
things that didn't rise to the level of
questioning it
but
here's the counterpoint
i got this from
uh brian burletik on twitter and i don't
know what his background is
and let me say something very clearly
i don't know who this individual is
brian burletik
but he he promotes an argument or a
point of view that i think you should
see
now when i tell you this
you might think that i'm a russian spy
you might also think
that poor brian burletik who did not ask
for me to talk about him you might think
he's also a russian operative
just because the way the argument's
going to go okay now i'm not going to
claim any of that is true certainly not
about me
but i don't know anything about brian so
i'm not going to accuse him of anything
i would just want to acknowledge
that it's going to look like propaganda
when i tell you what he said okay
so he's using only sources from the west
he's using uh
he's using the united nations as a
source reuters you know basic standard
news sources and he says
uh the following
that russia didn't start a war in
ukraine again this is the part that
sounds like propaganda you can use your
own opinion
uh he said the war has been going on for
eight years spearheaded by literal nazis
killing fourteen thousand including
three thousand civilians in other words
that the ukrainian military
has neo-nazis and or actual nazis and
they have killed 14 000 people including
a lot of civilians
in the
i guess the so-called independent
the donbass region i guess mostly
now
is this true or false
is it true or false that the ukrainian
military
forget about the nazi part for a moment
we'll get back to that but is it true
that the ukrainian military killed 14
000 people in the dunbas area
now
did they have a good reason
in other words if the don bass
if the donbass area was in fact
let's say occupied by enemy troops
doesn't the country have a legitimate
you know war there
so i'm not sure there's anything wrong
with fighting to uh capture back
territory that was captured from you
but you know brian puts it in a way that
sounds like it sounds like an offensive
instead of a defensive thing
um
and then he gives his sources bbc united
nations nbc etc
so
and
here is something that blew my freaking
mind
we're used to uh fake news
on cnn and other outlets so you know
what it looks like but when you watch it
you don't always know how fake it is
sometimes you need some context to know
how fake it is
but
i was pointed to the rt russia today rt
website or actually the youtube feed
and if you watch 10 minutes of rt which
is
a propaganda organ
from putin which by the way
can i let me pause to give you a full
disclosure
i have appeared on rt
so rt has interviewed me and included my
content
now at the time we were not having this
kind of problem with russia
and this was early in
i don't know if i had to guess a year
might have been 2016
something like that
2016 i'm guessing now at the time i knew
it was called russia today so i wasn't
really
surprised
that they would have you know a
propaganda element to them but at the
time i didn't have any trouble with
russia
and i thought oh it's just more
publicity it doesn't matter where it
comes right so i was just
you know i was just doing any anybody
who asked at the time because i thought
i thought what i had to say was worth
saying so i didn't care who who asked me
to say it
now subsequently
once it became more obvious
what rt was up to they've also asked me
for content since then
and i've turned them down
so i want to give you that's that's my
context
that i have appeared on there
completely
aware of what the situation was and what
the risks and rewards were but at the
moment i wouldn't take that chance
so i would never appear on rt again
everybody okay with that decision
that makes sense right
now i'm not sure i regret having done it
the first time because it worked for me
it worked for them and i got my message
out didn't matter
but i definitely wouldn't do it now i
mean i wouldn't give them any attentions
whatsoever
and by the way the only place you're
going to see rt.com right now is on
youtube
because
uh i tried to look at their website last
night and it was
in trouble
so apparently anonymous
the anonymous hacker group that is
international and don't know too much
about them have targeted russia and
russian related websites including rt
so a number of websites in russia are
down
and
i don't know how long anonymous is going
to keep at them but
that's worth watching
the thing i don't know is does anonymous
have the good tools
like
how close to a government hack
could
anonymous get because i think
i think there's a big difference right
between the best
amateur hack and the best
military hack there's there's no
correlation there is there there like
worlds of difference apart
so i don't know how much difference they
can make there it's probably just denial
of service attacks that sort of thing
i doubt they can take equipment offline
in other words i doubt anonymous could
crash their grid
would i imagine
oh rt is up again
let's see
this will be interesting all right let
me let me test it right here
uh rt
you're probably doing this right as i'm
doing you already are printing the
answer in your comments
um
nope
[Laughter]
is is rt up where you are
because i'm getting a blank page
oh you're on it now really is it just
rt.com
it's rt.com right
so apparently it's it's offline in
certain places
let me refresh see if it changes yeah
now that
refresh didn't work
it's up in florida
it'll be darn
all right so some can reach it and some
can't so what does that mean does that
mean denial of service
uh your isp blocked it that's what it
looks like it doesn't look like a denial
service it looks blocked
it looks blocked yeah it's up on youtube
because
and why why
wait a minute
[Music]
wait a minute
are you kidding me
youtube
youtube is running russian propaganda
during the war
are you kidding me
oh you think it's only the iphone that's
the problem maybe
i mean i'm on wi-fi how should that make
a difference
wow
um
i think you'd have to say that youtube
is supporting russia in the war wouldn't
you
isn't the number one thing that youtube
does is get rid of content that's
inappropriate
what is more inappropriate than war
propaganda during a war
from
from the other side
youtube you've got a lot of explaining
do you know who got demonetized a few
times this week
or last few weeks
i did
i did
youtube is censoring me
are they not doing any censoring of war
propaganda from russia
like i hope i'm wrong about that
but
hey youtube if if you censors are
watching me right now and i know that
they have to do manual reviews almost
every time
but
what the hell is going on
i think you need an explanation for the
public
i think the public would like to know
why my content is often demonetized
without any reason that i can see
at the same time that
rt is just up and running with their
their feed
seriously
and that's okay with you
youtube's okay with that
google is okay with that
i i think we need an explanation
don't you
don't you think somebody needs to ask
youtube what the is going on
what the is going on
seriously
and that's
mind-boggling just mind-boggling
um well you think this war in ukraine is
bad but is way worse than you think
joy behar
is concerned about
the effects it will have on her
vacation to italy that she's planning
this summer
and she's been trying to get there for
four years damn it and the the pandemic
slowed her down and
and now
in somber tones
appropriate to the situation she
complains
that her vacation to italy
might be postponed
might be postponed
so if we could have a moment of silence
for joe behar joy behar's vacation
moment of silence please
okay that's enough
all right here's something else that the
fake news caused
war in ukraine
war in ukraine
have you wondered why putin can get away
with saying ridiculous about
why he's going into ukraine
have you wondered why he can say such
ridiculous things
that are so obviously untrue
and apparently half of his country
believes it
so like half of the country believes it
now why is that
could it be because there are no sources
of legitimate news
yes it could be that
because even russia has access to the
internet
you know there's some things censored
etc but they can get to cnn
dot com can they not
can somebody do a fact check
if you live in russia
you can get to cnn.com
is that true by the way it is true right
so if you can get to western news
sources
why don't those western news sources
reprogram the russian public
into
a more accurate view of the world
well maybe it's because when they watch
cnn they can tell us fake news
because it is
maybe
there are no sources of reliable news
so when the russian public sees rt
they don't see it as any different than
anything else
because everything's propaganda
that's a pretty bad place to be
wouldn't it be a better world if there
were at least one place you could see
both sides and the russian public could
say you know i don't believe rt i also
don't believe cnn
can i just go look somewhere and find
out what's true
i think that the fake news industry in
the united states
the fact that it lost all credibility
is a much bigger problem than we imagine
it's not just about who believes
 and votes wrong
it's about starting wars
that i would argue that this is a war of
disinformation
meaning that the soldiers fighting it
don't know why they're fighting it
maybe putin knows but he's not saying it
directly
so
if you could fix
disinformation you could probably take a
big bite out of any future wars because
they depend on disinformation
the entire thing depends on that
all right
um
what do you think of temporary sanctions
on stuff as a way to stop a war
it doesn't really work does it
because everybody thinks well it's
temporary
i i can keep ukraine forever but the
sanctions will be temporary
if i just told you that doesn't it look
like a good investment for russia to
conquer ukraine
if the only thing you knew
was that the sanctions whatever they are
are probably temporary
but the ownership of ukraine is probably
closer to permanent
that looks like a good deal
so why do we why do we create a
situation that makes it look like a good
deal
to conquer your neighbor
maybe we should create a situation where
it doesn't look like a good deal anymore
now i floated the idea
that maybe some of the sanctions should
be permanent
like as in forever
as in never change
now one of the questions somebody asked
me was but scott
what about if you know putin leaves
office and
if you could imagine he's he's replaced
by somebody who's not a problem we don't
have a problem with them
then would you drop the permanent
sanctions
to which i say no do you know what
permanent means
permanent means you don't drop them ever
now the financial ones of course will
get dropped eventually
that would make sense
um you know propaganda could get dropped
yeah there's lots of things that could
get dropped eventually if if the
government became more friendly to the
united states etc or to the west
but here's one i think you have to give
them one permanent stain
take germany as an example
did germany bulldoze the concentration
camps from world war ii they did not
they did not and wisely i think
instead they kept this concentration
camps because they never want to forget
and
germany rather than running from his
history
has simply embraced the shame and said
that's who we are now
that's who we are we just have to deal
with that
that's who we are now meaning the brand
of the country
and i feel as though um we should
consider we the the rest of the world
uh banning international sports from
russia forever
because international sports
doesn't change your finances or your
access to energy or your you know
national security
those things have to be flexible because
people are going to do what makes sense
always
but if you tell the population of a
country
that
you will be banned from international
sports forever
that actually is something that will
touch them on a regular basis
because i'm pretty sure soccer is
popular i'm pretty sure
you know sporting and being part of the
sporting world is unpopular is is
important but if it were me i would say
and of course there's no way to do this
because all the sporting groups are
independent people
but i would say um there will never be
another international game in flor in
russia
nor will you ever be invited to any not
not the olympics not anything you're
just adam sports forever
now you might say to yourself but scott
how much does putin care about that
that's not going to change anything
to which i say it's about the next one
i i agree that it wouldn't change
anything on this war you're right
but it's about the next one
i think you have to
set a standard that some things are
permanent and that those things should
be things that affect the public but not
in a life-or-death way
let me ask you this
suppose you're just an american sitting
at home watching the ukraine situation
how much do you care about it
it's different right people care people
don't care
but
suppose you found out that supporting uh
the war in ukraine would mean you could
ever watch professional sports in
america again
how much do you care now
well you might not care about ukraine at
all or the war at all
but how many people build their lives
around watching sports
a lot
it would actually really really affect
people
that wouldn't affect me because i don't
don't watch sports but it would really
affect a lot of people who it's their
only entertainment and it's free
if you take away their only free
entertainment the thing they care about
and look forward to it's a big deal
it's a big deal it's just not life or
death
so i think you could find some things
which are big deals
that you could say you know this one's
just permanent
this this one's just permanent there's
nothing you can do about it
that might get their public involved
but
if not who cares
um
who cares in the sense
that it's about the next public it's not
really about this public
all right so uh ukraine
uh officials have told the public to
make molotov cocktails and get ready for
the russian incursion into kiev
so it looks like it's going to be a trap
and burn strategy
and i don't know why this wouldn't work
but if you could imagine that every
third window in ukraine had a molotov
cocktail and you and it seems to be tall
buildings
on the sides of these streets
wouldn't they be able to trap you know
you blow something up in the beginning
and the end of the
the troops coming in couldn't you trap
them there and just and just throw
molotov cocktails out the window until
they're all burned up
or
what is the defense against it
is the defense that the military would
just like blow up every building
because they'd have to right they'd have
to blow up all the buildings
or even just like spray
gunfire into them but
i don't know would that stop the molotov
cocktails would they just blow
everything up
they'd probably start executing
civilians or doing something pretty
pretty big
blow up the pipelines
now apparently ukraine has also asked
for a private
drones to be donated to the
to the cause
so one thing that's possible
do will the city of kiev have
communication
because i'm not sure that a molotov
cocktail attack works unless it's
coordinated
you know somebody throwing one once in a
while doesn't change any
anything
but
if you trapped
if you trapped the soldiers into a
street
you trapped the beginning in the end
and then you just rained fire on them
from above
and you took video of it on your phone
and you made that video available to the
russian public
do you think the russian public would
like to see
their young people incinerated in a fire
slowly on a ukraine's street because
that's the video you need
the video you need is of young
russian soldiers on fire and running
around and no place to go
you give me that video
and the russian public will turn on
putin
if you have more than one of them
if you can do that twice
you probably will protect kiev
because i don't know that the amer the
russian public could handle
watching the slow motion burn of their
young people on on the kiev street i
don't think they could handle it
and i don't think that even putin could
keep that image out of russia
but we'll see
now
let me be very clear
i'm not even sure i care who wins
is that fair
is it fair to say i don't care who wins
because so far ukraine has been nothing
but a pain in the ass to america
am i right
so far ukraine has been nothing but a
thorn in our side
if russia owned it it would just be sort
of the same risk we had with russia just
more of it i guess
but not more of it enough in the way
that matters
i don't know
are we worse off if putin owns ukraine i
don't know
i have no idea
but i do think it's interesting
that putin and biden both shut down each
other's banks
you know what i mean
biden shut down business with you know a
number of the top russian banks
uh and putin is closing ukraine
so that the bidens can't use it as their
personal bank anymore they both ended
banking for each other
how much do you care about that
i don't
i'm happy that putin can't bank as well
and i'm happy that the bidens don't have
that bank anymore
so
i don't know
does the united states come out behind
check the stock market
let's see how's the stock market doing
and i'll tell you if the united states
is going to come out behind
it's up
it's up so russians are in kiev and the
american stock market is
up
now it was down a lot so this this might
be just the fluctuation so you can't say
anything from this uh one day
change um but uh
is ethereum up or down today
crypto is up
um i saw something about ethereum as a
trending story how much is ethereum up a
lot
we'll find out anyway this molotov
cocktail situation
uh is going to if
they need to produce video
it's all about the video
so if you hear molotov cocktails that
doesn't mean anything molotov cocktails
plus
trapping them
plus getting phone video
that's the way to make a difference
eath isn't mooning
it's if that's what you mean it's at
2800. so it's just up a little bit
ethereal
all right
so apparently rt is showing a tucker
carlson show pretty much
pretty much every day
um
so
that's interesting i i
the one thing i think you can be happy
about in the united states
is that you could have somebody in this
country who's you know that much
against war as
tucker is and tucker's been pretty
consistently against war
so um
somebody's worried about being getting
canceled for being a russian puppet
i don't think that's a risk
i think you could actually be a russian
puppet and you wouldn't get canceled
but i'm not
all right
uh one of the things that tucker
mentions and there isn't enough talk
about it and i think it's because it's
complicated
is that the real risk is to the american
dollar
as the currency of choice
because if
anything that comes out of this causes
china and russia to say you know
let's use the chinese one as the
you know the main currency for buying
oil and stuff and then the middle east
starts accepting the juan instead of the
dollar
then the value of the us dollar tanks
and our debt
crushes us
and we become
a
third-rate country
and it looks like we're heading in that
direction
so i'm not smart enough to know how big
of a risk this is
because this is a little above my pay
grade and i've got a degree in economics
and still unless you're unless you neck
deep in this stuff you don't really know
what's going on
all right
so i guess that's the scariest part of
this thing at least for the united
states
um did russia capture chernobyl early on
in this move so they captured the
i assume it's a completely
decommissioned
site there's nothing happening there now
right chernobyl
but one of the things that was reported
is the radioactivity is higher in that
area
and that might be because the military
operations are kicking up some
radioactive dust
are there russian soldiers who are in
the middle of that extra radiation dust
are they all going to die
or
has mark schneider been right all along
that we always
overestimate the danger of nuclear and
it's fine
maybe you can just
you know obviously the russian army
thinks they're safe
why does the russian army think they're
it's safe to be there of all places i
mean i don't even know what i can't even
imagine what military benefit they get
from it but must be some
they've become russian mutant soldiers
and
they have spider powers and they're even
harder to beat
um
so and i also wondered if uh maybe
russia was capturing chernobyl
to make sure it didn't become a source
of dirty bombs
is that even a thing
is is there anything left at chernobyl
that somebody could have i know
harvested to turn into a dirty bomb
i've seen a lot of people say yes
but i don't think i know enough to
confirm that that's true
i'm seeing some no's
seeing some yeses it sounds like the the
technical
without knowing anything i would imagine
that the technical complexity of that
would make it impractical
like i don't think you want to let any
of that out you know in order to get to
it
you're probably going to less of it out
and i don't know that anybody would take
that risk
maybe as a psy up
nuclear waste from the leak could be
dispersed if it's bombed
um
dirty bombs are a great terror weapon
but not great to use them at home well
that's a good point you don't want to
use that kind of a terror weapon at home
but
does the ukrainian military
shell the
chernobyl to kill the military there
what if they did
is that even a thing or is chernobyl
hardened against attack like if you hit
it directly with a
with some shells or some missiles
would it leak its
would it leak its uh
contents
the soldiers can wear protective suits
they're not enough protective suits
i don't think they brought enough
protective suits for that
it gets boomers to care about war
boomers always care about war
you can't stay in the chernobyl area for
more than six hours i don't know we'll
find out because i think they will
watch the mini-series about it okay
um
all right what do you think of
the usefulness of temporary sanctions
you would agree that any temporary
sanction looks like it won't work right
because if the other side says i'll keep
ukraine forever but your sanctions are
temporary okay that's a good deal
but what if any of the sanctions were
permanent
according to jeffrey miller he says game
theory says that a permanent
sanction won't change anybody's behavior
because it won't change the sanction
which makes sense
oh well if the sanctions are going to be
permanent no matter what why would i do
anything
differently than i'm going to do
so i guess that makes sense
but
it depends on the sanction like i said
if the sanction is permanent is no
international sports ever
that might work
that might work
but at least work a little bit
nothing's going to change what's
happening
all right
yeah this swift
you know i i think there was never
really an option for turning off
russia's gas because we didn't have a
backup plan
there's no backup plan
right russia will sell energy to europe
especially germany
that's just gonna happen
and
uh yeah and blocking the swift could
damage the u.s as well and blah blah
blah blah and probably at least part of
the reason that the
stock market in the u.s is going up
is that we
i never finished the nazi story
what part did i not finish
what did i not finish
i guess you don't know
well okay the let's see if i can finish
it
the point is that uh russia says it's
nazis
maybe it is maybe doesn't but since we
don't trust the news
and we don't trust russian propaganda
i don't know how do you factor that in
let me give you my bottom line
because
i have literally been called a neo-nazi
for six years or i guess i've been
called a neo-nazi sympathizer for six
years because i said anything good about
trump once that's all it takes
what do i think when i see somebody else
call the neo-nazi sympathizer
right
so this is another cost of the fake news
if the fake news spends six years
calling people who are clearly not
neo-nazis
such as myself
if you spend that much time
that's more social media than uh the
news
but
i think the neo-nazi lost all of its
power
i i think that in the united states if
you look at some other countries saying
that there's some neo-nazis in the
government that you just yawn
not because you're not worried about
neo-nazis but because you don't believe
it
do you believe it
now i know there's plenty of reporting
about actual nazi sympathizers in
ukraine but do you believe it
and and what percentage
have you ever heard a percentage
because do you think there's is there
any reporting that says the number of
neo-nazis in the ukrainian military list
for example is greater than the number
of neo-nazis in the us military
you don't know that do you
you don't know that
i'm hoping we have fewer neo-nazis in
our military but if it's one percent
right if it's one percent in the ukraine
military and maybe it is and it's one
percent in our military why are we even
talking about it like that's not the key
issue it's an issue all right don't
ignore it
but
it has nothing to do with why we have a
war or anything
so
my take on the neo-nazi thing is that
it's effective because it gives
putin some excuse to do what he's doing
i think some of his public will believe
it and that'll be enough to cause
confusion
um
but i don't think it's the real reason
and i think the only reason he can get
away with it is that we're so
we're so accustomed to being calling
each other neo-nazis in the united
states it just lost its meaning
i just don't think it means anything in
the united states anymore
not compared to what it used
to wake up they are desperate
doesn't the military have one percent of
everything yup
yup
okay oliver stone has a documentary on
the 2014 coup in ukraine it's called
ukraine on fire
explains their radical right militias
like as of battalion they carried out
the coup
so it was well the radical right
was
instrumental in the coup
but they weren't the only ones in the
coup right
did did the don bass get controlled by
neo-nazis
actually i don't know
well let me ask you that so before
russia came in was the donbass
controlled by neo-nazis
no the opposite right
yeah defined neo-nazis
uh ukraine is
doing memes about russia
nazis were attacking the donbass
all right
well
you know this whole nazi thing works so
well for putin because he can just say
i'm getting rid of nazis and 50 of the
public will just say that's fine
i don't need the details getting rid of
nazis that's fine
so
it's looking like uh putin will be
successful in taking ukraine
uh i think he's
his public opinion will take a hit of
course
uh but he'll stay in office looks like
it
all right
good day for a booster sip i think
you're right shall we end today's
program
with the additional sip
yes i think we should
uh oliver stone's facts aren't meant to
be trusted somebody says i i would echo
that thought
a person making documentary is not a
credible source
this has nothing to do with oliver stone
in general
person makes documentary
not to be trusted
don't trust it and now
the closing simultaneous sip
in which afterwards i will
uh
stay with the locals people for a minute
and
excuse you on youtube but it's time for
the closing simultaneous sip go
of course my mug is heated if you don't
have a mug heater next to your
computer
well you're not even trying to work hard
you're not even trying
um
a documentary on the war that apparently
just started two days ago well that's
not what it is
um
just got back from shoveling oh my god
oh the ember mug yeah i have one have
one of those too
mug heaters exist oh they do
all right and that's it for now and i
will talk to you tomorrow youtubers
