hey everybody
come on in come on in come on in gather
around it's time
time for coffee with scott adams
and how good is this going to be well i
i don't want to get your hopes up or
anything but
probably the best one i've ever done
probably
we'll see but how to make it better well
let me tell you what you need is a
copper mug or a glass of tanker tells us
to stein the canteen
flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i
think you know i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine of the day the thing that
makes
really everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip
and watch this people all around the
world
sinking up go
could you feel that could you feel it
yeah
that was people all over the world doing
the same thing at the same time
you are now connected oh yeah
well i promised you that i would uh in
in addition to
informing you that i would make you
smarter every time you watch my live
stream
in other words i'll tell you something
that maybe you hadn't heard before that
would be useful
or maybe reinforce something that you
already knew but it helps to have it
reinforced
um and let me uh start with this
dana preno has a new book called
everything will be okay the life lessons
for young women
i got an advanced copy and i guess it
goes on sale
and early march so you can pre-order it
now
and here's what i want to give you for
your
lesson for the day have i told you that
writing
is it's really important to start out
right
and this book dana's book i haven't
i haven't read the whole book but i
wanted to call out
one of the best openings of a book i've
ever seen
so i've told you many times if you
followed my writing advice that you
should write
and rewrite the opening of your book the
first
first few sentences you should just
rewrite that
a hundred times no matter
how much how many times you rewrite it
you could probably make it a little
better
and you want to get people hooked and
interested and
curious and also get like the whole idea
of the book in like the first paragraph
that's a lot of work to put into a
paragraph right
if you can get all of that done in one
paragraph
you probably have a good book let me
read the opening
from dana's book to see to see how to do
this right
uh introduction so i got a call from a
young woman in washington dc
seeking some advice she had a problem at
work and was quite upset
her office supervisor wanted her to do
something that she was very
uncomfortable with make a public
statement
under her own name using language and a
tone
that she thought was disrespectful and
unproductive
and then i guess she said on the phone
oh then
dana advised her then don't say it
absolutely
do not do it i said
quote i don't think i can refuse she
said she was afraid
she'd be fired if she didn't comply that
she didn't have the gravitas
to decline quote i'm not dana perrino
she said
and then dana preno responded quote well
how do you think i became dana paredo
how do you think i became daniel perrino
that's one of the best
opening openings of a book that you'll
ever see
that by the way that advice
is worth the price of the book just that
advice
and you got it in the first the first
paragraph and let me add to that
one of the pieces of advice i give more
than
just about any other piece of advice is
that when people get in some kind of a
negotiation
usually somebody wants a job or they're
trying to get a deal
or in this case somebody's negotiating
with their boss potentially
in all of those cases people who are low
ranking
imagine that they don't have any
leverage
and that's an illusion it's a complete
illusion
you have lots of leverage if you're an
employee
even if you have a boss because your
boss doesn't want to hire a new employee
your boss really really
really doesn't want to have to get rid
of you and find a new employee
that's like one of the worst things a
boss has to do it's just hard
i mean just everything's everything is
wrecked if you have to go find a new
employee
so if you're good at your job you have
all kinds of leverage with your boss
all kinds of leverage but nobody when in
their let's say in their 20s
just to pick a time range nobody in
their 20s knows that
they don't know that yet you don't
really know that until you become the
boss
once you become a boss then you realize
how much leverage your employees have
because you really need them right you
know you don't have an option
where the employees don't exist or don't
do good work and you're still a star
so you always have more leverage than
you think
that is some of the best advice you'll
ever hear all right
now this assumes that you do good work
right
if you're bad at your job you don't have
any leverage
right it's only if you're good at your
job uh the best news of the day
lady gaga got her dogs back i gotta
admit
i didn't see that coming i kind of
thought
those dogs were not going to have a
happy ending
because i thought that once it became
obvious they were lady gaga's dogs
somebody would have to get rid of them
but maybe they were dog lovers
you know oddly enough obviously they're
not human lovers since they shot one
but uh they may have just said oh
crap we can't kill these dogs we can't
keep them
there's no way you can really sell them
you know not get away with it
so maybe we have a good outcome
and let me tell you if there were some
kind of academy award or
let's say a national medal of honor or
nobel peace prize
for the best dog walker
lady gaga she got a good dog walker
i'll tell you if you're if you're
looking for a dog walker
best one i've ever heard of this guy
gave his life
or or he risked his life he got shot
protecting dogs can you do better than
that
can you do better than that no no i
probably would have given them
given them the dogs right away okay not
my dog
if it had been my dog i would have
probably risked my life
but if you're a dog walker it's pretty
good performance
let's talk about lebron he is my
favorite big dumb guy
um and
somebody will turn that into something
racial right
you can be dumb of any any ethnicity
can't you
i'm pretty sure i'm pretty sure i've
seen big dumb guys
of every ethnic group so
keep it in context another
athlete a major soccer star is
latin ibravovich criticized
lebron for being political
lebron responded by saying that he he
does his homework
so he's not just a big dumb athlete he
does his homework
he digs in and after doing his homework
he had concluded at least in the past
that he believes the fine people hoax
really happened
glad he did his homework he couldn't
even tell
that the biggest hoax in the country
never happened
so that's what he got when he did his
homework
i also wonder what exactly is lebron's
take on generation
4 nuclear power
does he see that as a key variable in
the
climate change topic
he probably doesn't know what it is and
if you don't know what generation
iv nuclear is do you know much about
climate change and what to do about it
and what the options are and what
what energy is really green and what is
really dangerous
probably not so how much how much
research is lebron doing now
before you say scott you're just dunking
on an athlete
and you're telling him to basically stay
in his lane
and and don't you scott tell us
all the time that that's the worst
advice
ever telling people to stay in their
lane
because that's what the soccer star told
lebron you know stick to
sports you've seen me
criticize that right a lot of times
well let me tell you when people should
leave their uh
lane and when they should not
it's just a general rule you know there
could be some exceptions but as a
general rule
if you're in the top 1
of people who are brilliant and
effective
leave your lane leave your lane
because elon musk had never
sent a rocket to mars
but i feel like he can figure it out
because he's in the top one percent
elon musk had never built an electric
car
but he figured it out because he's in
the top one percent
bill gates had never started a major
company but he was he's in the top one
percent
of intelligence and capabilities so he
figured it out
if you're not in the top one percent
well then it gets a little bit more of a
gray area doesn't it
i don't think everybody should change
their lane
right not everybody should change the
lane
but i'll give you another example i
think it was mark dice
was tweeting about how bill gates
is making medical um i wouldn't say
recommendations but he's making a lot of
statements in the medical field that
you'd sort of expect a virologist
or a doctor to be making right
and so the criticism is hey bill gates
you know you're good with software and
running companies but
why don't you why don't you leave the
medical stuff to the medical people
is that good advice nope
it's not now i see people believe the
conspiracy theories about bill gates
being evil and he's going to put a chip
in you and
and all that that's all ridiculous by
the way it's all ridiculous
but it's a different topic
the question is if you saw
bill gates disagreeing with some doctors
on the question of the pandemic who
should you trust
would you trust bill gates his opinion
on the pandemic
or a doctor now let's say that the
doctor
is a gp general practitioner
very skilled at doctoring not maybe not
a
virologist but a doctor bill gates is
not a doctor
let's say they had different opinions
who would you trust
the doctor to have a medical opinion
or bill gates not a doctor who would you
trust
if you trust the doctor it's a suckers
play
i would trust bill gates every
time
all right if you if you if you're making
this mistake
then you don't understand what it means
to be in the top one percent
all right uh i say this not as an insult
to anybody watching this all right
not as an insult your dog
doesn't understand how you turn on the
lights
would you agree your dog knows the
lights often come on when you enter in
the room but doesn't quite understand
that
something you do with the light switch
or maybe you talk to your digital
assistant or something the dog just
knows the lights come on
a dog cannot understand
a human with an iq of let's say a
hundred
average a dog has no idea why that
person makes those decisions
but would you say that a person with
average intelligence a human
would make better decisions than say a
dog
not about dog things but about human
things and the answer is yes
not only would you guarantee that a
person with an iq of 100
would nail it better than a dog at
making decisions for
humans but you know the dog doesn't get
it
the dog wouldn't know that the human is
that much smarter but the but the human
knows for sure that the dog is that much
dumber
it's not a two-way awareness it's a
one-way awareness the smart person knows
the dog doesn't
now take that to humans let's say you're
pretty smart
you got an iq of 120 130
pretty good iq you are not
in the same range as bill gates you're
not even close
you're not even close you're as close to
bill gates
in intelligence if you have like a 120
130
you're not that far off from the dog
to a person who have normal intelligence
you have no idea
how his brain works how effective it is
the things he can do with his brain that
you just can't
and by the way i put myself in that
category of somebody who's
uh substantially less intelligent
than bill gates when bill gates looks
into a topic
i would i would go with him now what you
don't see
is bill gates necessarily uh saying
something different than the top
virologists that's different right the
top
virologists like in the world are
probably also in the top 1
and they also know their topic but on
top of that
and so so i would listen to those and i
think bill gates does as well
but if you are comparing bill gates to
your family doctor
and they had different opinions i would
take bill gates
every time over your family general
practitioner if they were different
now i don't know if there's any case
that they ever wouldn't be different i'm
just saying
that you can't judge lebron leaving his
lane
with bill gates leaving his lane they
are not even a little bit similar
so that's the next thing that you
learned today
leaving your lane is good for the people
who can do it
and most people can't let me give you
another example
some years ago the ceo of
intel who was andy grove i think he's
passed
but andy grove wrote a very long article
i think it was
for forbes or fortune or something
it was one of those magazines and what
he did was he had
prostate cancer now andy grove was an
engineer
would you trust an engineer
to give you advice on prostate cancer
well your first impression should be no
right
why would you trust an engineer to give
you medical advice
but the reason it was a major
article that really made an impact i
think
in the country is that andy grove did
what the doctors
couldn't do he looked at all the
research
and then he put it in context and then
he explained it to the public
so anybody who was in the same situation
had prostate cancer
could see all of their surgical and
other options
in the clearest possible way for the
first time
for the first time why did andy grove
have to write an article about prostate
cancer
because there wasn't anybody could tell
him
there were there were no doctors who
knew
what andy grove knew when he was done
doing the research
none of them they they probably knew
what they knew more than he did
but they didn't see the whole field he
he did
and when he wrote it doctors said all
right that's a real service
that's a real service because even even
we're not seeing it
you know in that detail so would you
trust
andy grove to make a medical
recommendation
in that case in that specific case
yes yes i would trust him
over the doctors i would i would listen
to both of course
but uh don't count out the the top one
percenters they're just not like other
people
all right amazon's announcing it will no
longer sell books that are quote
that have a material we deem
inappropriate or offensive
so how long before one of my books
is deemed inappropriate or in or
offensive
take my book that's behind my head here
win bigly
win bigly paints a a positive picture
of uh ex-president trump's
performance his skills what happens if
history decides that trump is such a bad
character
that you can't have a book saying he did
anything good
because imagine if somebody wrote a book
that said you know hitler
certainly had his bad qualities but what
about his good qualities
nobody could write that book and if they
did would amazon
carry it would amazon carry a book that
said hitler had some good points
probably not right it would be easily
categorized as
offensive or inappropriate but
is it possible that my book which is
perfectly acceptable in the time it was
published
could trump's reputation reach a point
where they say you know
i don't even think we can have a book on
the shelf
that said he had any good qualities
could it i don't know
let me tell you what i think is
happening to me and again you can only
speculate about these things because
there's
is sort of opaque it does appear to me
that
at just about the time of the election
and after it that the uh social media
companies put the clamp down on me
pretty hard
now i can't i can't distinguish how much
is
maybe people you know leaving my leaving
my universe because they came for the
the trump stuff
and there's not as much of it anymore
and how much of it is some kind of
weird algorithm or shadow banning
i can't sort it out but i will tell you
that
on uh let's say youtube
which had been pretty much allowing uh
every all of my content to be monetized
they got to the point where pretty much
all of it was monetized
uh which is different than earlier in
the year
but right after the election or so they
reversed it
and i watched the monetization just
plunge
be plunged enough that i'm not sure it's
worth doing
right so i mean at the moment it is but
if it keeps
if they keep the uh the clamps on and
the way that looks is that
um my live streams this in particular in
fact this is probably demonetized right
now
uh i'll ask my brother uh well
never mind uh we'll get to that later
but chances are
that this is demonetized right now
at least the youtube feed not the
periscope
and they they demonetize automatically
is that something that you do to
somebody who uh
after review gets approved almost every
time
and even the ones that are not approved
don't violate any rule
i have violated zero rules of youtube
as far as i know i'm not i'm not aware
of anything now i do use some
language but i also note that this is
not for children
so youtube has a box you check so do you
think that i get demonetized because my
language is bad
i don't think so there's plenty of bad
language on podcasts
do you think i get demonetized because i
say things
like i'm going to say right now
this is i'm guessing this might be why
uh cnn's here's here's a report on cnn's
fake news today
this is a direct quote from cnn's web
page facts first
colin the election was not rigged
joe biden was the legitimate winner
there is no evidence of widespread fraud
or malfeasance
and cnn is reporting this as a fact
well there are actually uh two separate
claims in this fact
one is that there is no evidence of
widespread fraud or malfeasance
well i don't know that's true but i know
that no court has ruled
that there is widespread fraud or
malfeasance
so you could argue that this this one is
true-ish meaning that they left out the
fact that the court has not found any
evidence
as opposed to people alleging there's
evidence
so i would say this is misleading but
what about the first
sentence the election was not rigged
that's
reported as a fact that's fake news
that's not a fact that's an assumption
they reported a fact that's really just
an
assumption now do i have any evidence
personally either you know court
sanctioned or even just something that
i've seen
that i would say is proof that there's
some kind of widespread
fraud in that election the answer is no
no i have not
now should i be demonetized
for saying what is obviously objectively
true
that there is no i don't have any
evidence
that is direct evidence of widespread
fraud lots of allegations
lots of statistical things that make my
eyebrow go up i'd certainly like to know
more about it
and i have a general feeling that any
system will be corrupted eventually
so you know i i have suspicions
but i have no evidence of fraud none
zero should i be demonetized for saying
what i just said
that i personally am aware of no fraud
in the election
i will be probably probably already
demonetized while i'm talking
is anything i'm saying dangerous or
offensive or inappropriate
not even close so here's my main point
about
cnn when they say the election was not
rigged
that is simply not a fact nor is it a
fact
that we know it was rigged neither of
those effects
anybody pretending that those are facts
can't tell the difference between
a reasonable assumption and something
you know
is it a reasonable assumption that the
election that the election was not
rigged
is reasonable it's reasonable i think
reasonable people might disagree
but it's not crazy but it's an
assumption
you can't prove something didn't happen
when you didn't look for it
all right so if i say something that is
objectively and obviously true that you
can't know
something doesn't exist in the context
of you didn't look for it
is there anybody who disagrees with
either those two statements
that we didn't look for it except in
those few
cases that courts you know around the
edges there's some things that got
looked at
but we didn't look at the whole system
for sure
and if you didn't look can you be sure
now if that's true that
not looking allows you to reach
certainty
i'd like to hear that argument that'd be
a good good argument
it could be that we have in chat in fact
checked enough places that statistically
you could be pretty darn sure nothing
happened that's possible
but i haven't heard that argument i'd
like to
because if it's true i'd certainly like
to know it all right
so i believe i'm being squeezed uh
and i'm getting lots of reports of
people having to
re-follow me on twitter by the way in
the comments
if you've ever had to re-follow me on
twitter
or you can't find my tweets say so in
the comments and for those of you who
believe i might be exaggerating watch
what happens
it'll take a take about a minute for the
comments to catch up
here they come look at all the people
who had to re-follow me
that no they never unfollowed me in the
first place
when you see the number of them you kind
of can't think it's a coincidence
and it doesn't look like a bug
uh somebody says you are not
exaggerating just look at the comments
these are people who who follow me
enough to watch my live streams
regularly so they're not casual
followers
just look at just look at all the people
who are saying this
do you believe it's a coincidence that
this many people who just happen to be
on this live stream
look at all the yeses now i'm seeing
more of them on uh periscope than i am
on youtube
for the youtube people uh i i could just
read the comments from periscope it's
like yes yes
refollow there are no's of course but
a lot of yeses you think that's a bug
i don't do you think they're all wrong
and they just had some perceptual
problem where they
they somebody did it twice in one week
do you think they
accidentally unfollowed me twice that
week
no no that didn't happen
for a while i used to think it was a
coincidence but it is now
somewhat obvious that both youtube
and twitter are squeezing me
probably politically my guess is that
it's politically motivated but how would
i know
so uh the odds of this getting monetized
by youtube are
probably zero i don't think they could
handle this
all right uh so biden has a new gaffe he
went to texas and in the middle of his
uh
opening remarks he said and i quote
what am i doing here i'm going to lose
track here
because he literally forgot what he was
doing while he was talking
now we add to that the following clues
we know that
his vice president is talking to foreign
leaders something that even
biden didn't do you know at this level
so there's something going on in which
harris is clearly being
you know groomed for the top job because
the talking to foreign leaders would be
the main thing you'd want to
do to get ready and then we also heard
the reports that the nuclear football
the democrats don't necessarily want
that in one decision
they might want to get more more control
on that so you say to yourself wait a
minute
don't these all have that same quality
uh of it's obvious now that biden
is being you know managed out of the job
for
obvious cognitive problems but
i will give you this one caution
remember i introduced the word
apophenia a-p-o-p-h-e-n-i-a-apophidia
it's the phenomenon where people see
patterns
where there are no patterns similar to
confirmation bias
but a little bit different and
is that a real pattern or a fake one
all right so here are the three things
tell me if it's a real pattern or a fake
one number one
biden makes lots of verbal gaffes so you
think he has a cognitive problem
number two harris is talking to foreign
leaders as if she's getting ready for
the job
the top job and there's some concern
even from democrats about who has
control of the nuclear football
put those three things together proof
that biden is being managed and at the
top job
no yeah we want to believe that
and if i had to bet on it i would bet
yes
but not necessarily because of these
three pieces of evidence
the nuclear football thing could be just
a general concern
it could be uh harris talking to foreign
leaders seems a little bit more
on the nose in in the right way not i
sometimes use that as a indication of
something that's not true
but in this case that's exactly what
you'd be doing
and i don't see another reason for it do
you
what would be the other reason harris
would be talking to foreign leaders
so i would subtract out the nuclear
football question
because it might be part of the pattern
but it might not be
um and the biden gaffe what am i doing
here
you could argue that he's just always
been that way it's no different
but the part about harris talking to the
foreign leaders
i don't have a second explanation for
that
you know i mean you could argue she's
getting ready to run
after four years but it feels a little
early
so anyway be be mindful that it could be
a fake pattern but
i would also bet on it being real so i
would join you in betting is real
but you can't be 100 sure um
the funniest thing about the news today
is how much of it is about bill maher
you know you're used to uh seeing the
news talk about whatever bill maher said
on his
show on friday night each week and
you know i'm not surprised that you know
something he said made the news
is very very normal but i felt like he
made a lot of news
like he made a lot of news like we don't
have anything else to talk about
but it's part of this trend of uh people
who maybe leaned left i'm not sure what
you would
how you would classify bill maher
progressive i guess
and they're you know eating each other
so he he came out strongly against
cancel culture
which um is why bill maher is a voice
you should listen to
because there aren't that many people
who can come out against their own team
as it were and he does regularly when it
makes sense
so even when you don't agree with bill
maher and i don't agree with him
on a number of topics but i got
you have to admit he is capable
intellectually
of seeing an issue on either side
uh without being blinded by it i do
think tds had him a little bit blinded
but that was a special case so
um he also is saying that trump
is the presumptive nominee for 2024
that you know and he's warning people
don't imagine this won't happen because
it's almost positive it's going to
happen
remember if there are a number of other
candidates who are running
let's say trump you know has a primary
challenger which of course he would
it depends how many there are if if it's
ten challengers again
he's he's definitely gonna get nominated
because it will
you know distribute the popularity he'll
still have
you know 30 to whatever so he'd easily
get it
but what if he only ran against one
person
who was a pretty good candidate well
then it may be
a little close call but who would be
that one candidate
name name one uh candidate
who if it were one-on-one against trump
for the primary
all right not for the not for the job
but for the primary
what republican would stand a chance
there's there's no one-on-one matchup
that would even be close
would there somebody's saying pompeo but
he's
he would be identified as you know sort
of trump's guy
yeah i mean i'm seeing all the usual
names matt gates hayley
et cetera i don't think matt gase is
going to primary trump
do you i don't think so
andrew yang would not run as a
republican
ted cruz ted cruz i'm not sure he had
his best week he's still
still fighting off the uh the cancun
stuff he made a joke about it as cpac
i'm not sure that joke landed but
i like that he's treating it as
as a joke taking full responsibility
but then also minimizing it because it
isn't that important
so those are the two things that you
would look for
for somebody handling it correctly right
so the mistake is the mistake
but he handled it correctly by coming
back completely saying this was a
mistake
no ambiguity it was just a mistake i
like that
either you didn't shade it just a
mistake
and and then he then he minimized it
which i think in this case you should
minimize it all right
here's my question what does bill maher
think about biden's mental capacity
so now we've watched bill we've watched
biden
you know operate for a while what does
bill maher think of that
because remember the the the ordinary
team player democrats are just not going
to mention that
but bill maher can because he's
not you know he's not a hypnotized
team player if he sees it he's going to
call it out
i don't know how much longer he can go
without
sort of making this a featured point
that biden's
capacity is diminished
the other thing that seems uh and i've
been predicting this but it's funny to
watch it come
come true how many times biden will be
forced to follow some kind of a trump
policy that he had already been
criticizing so we're seeing it with
kids in cages right technically
biden is not doing as much as
as trump did in terms of putting kids in
cages and that they're not cages per se
they're they're uh what are they they
have some other name that makes them
sound not like cages but they're
walled units etc but they will soon be
overwhelmed
and biden will end up probably doing
something pretty
close to what trump had to do because
you sort of have to
what about biden bombing syria
sounded very trump-like didn't it a lot
of democrats said
hey we we didn't vote for you so you
could be bombing syria
um how about uh biden's uh response to
the khashoggi killing so now the
official report comes out
in which the united states is blaming uh
mbs the head of saudi arabia for
directly
ordering the khashoggi killing now what
would trump have done
if trump had been in charge and this
report came out
what biden did was he issued the report
i think trump would have done that too
because it would be an official report
yeah it would somebody would issue it so
that would happen the same
um and then biden decided not
to punish the person that they called
responsible
so mbs will not be sanctioned
won't be disallowed in the country
nothing and biden says the reason is
that we need him
we need him you know as just as a
practical
as a practical matter we we need
his support what would have what would
trump have done exactly the same
freaking thing
trump was playing it exactly the same
way
he was letting people you know sort of
know it was mbs but he was
treading lightly so he could get other
things done such as
abraham accords and basically anything
else
you need their help so biden basically
took a trump
policy on the khashoggi thing trump
policy on
bombing syria um
yeah i mean he's and and he will be
forced into a trump policy on the border
at least in terms of the kids and cages
part so watching this come together is
interesting
and watching the democrats watch it with
horror
when they thought something different
could happen
now i think biden's also pro-nuclear
right
so when are the progressives going to
have to deal with the fact that they
elected a pro-nuclear guy
now he should be pro-nuclear as was
trump
right biden and trump not that different
except for tone
all right rand paul is being accused so
here's some more
fake news reports some fake news from
cnn
so they're uh they're reporting that
critics
are blaming rand paul for being quote
bigoted and deeply offensive and a
transphobic attack
when he questioned dr rachel levine she
because she would be
the first transgender cabinet
uh person if she gets through this
nominee nomination
and he was asking about puberty's
puberty suppression drugs for minors
now if you watched it did you see
anybody say anything bigoted or deeply
offensive
did you see rand paul say anything
that was anti-transgender
no nothing not a single
and thing it's reported by cnn and
instead of saying they say it
they say critics are saying it's bigoted
and deeply offensive
is that fair is it fair to look at
something that didn't happen
and then say the critics say it happened
and just report what the critics say
without putting in the part where none
of it happened
right none of it happened but they still
report that the critics say it happened
i think you need to add the part about
none of it happened
if you're a real news organization
here's what he did do
he questioned who makes the decision
that's it he questioned whether children
should make the decision and or their
parents like who should make the
decision
the most basic question we ask about
everything in society
who gets to decide who gets to decide
has nothing to do with the base question
of what you do
he didn't even deal with that it wasn't
even the topic
it was a how to decide topic given that
there are long-term consequences
now this is as fake as fake news can get
to cnn
so that's two cases of fake news there
um and of course in conservative media
to be just as fake
you did you see the hashtag about the uh
i guess the house passed
the uh what do you call it the stimulus
bill
that's 1.9 trillion dollars
and it's being reported uh the
republicans are saying that only nine
percent of that is actually going to the
primary purpose of fighting the pandemic
have you seen that yet only nine percent
of this money
goes to fighting the pandemic this is
fake news none of us that's not even
close to being real
that nine percent thing anybody who says
that it's nine percent
you should just write them off as being
an honest
broker it's just a lie now what they're
doing
to make this lie sound like a little bit
technically true
is they add the part like medical
but most of the bill is about paying
people directly
you know back stopping businesses and
all that stuff
so most of it is economic and the the
pandemic requires an economic response
the the whole nine percent thing is just
is just a lie now at the same time
at the same time is it true that it's
filled with pork and progressive
wish list yes yes that could be true so
it can be true that it has too much pork
while it's not true that only nine
percent of it is what you wanted
right they can both be true
um so
i don't have an opinion about whether
the bill is good or bad
because i don't know if anybody can tell
but uh
i don't know if it'll get passed either
i don't know if
kamal harris will approve the you know
the
minimum wage part or that gets stripped
out so there's a lot of unknowns we
don't know how this will go
all right but don't believe the fake
news about the nine percent part that's
just
political talking points apparently 83
million people
um in the united states had coven by the
end of 2020.
does that sound right to you yeah if
somebody
asks you how many people in the united
states out of our
[Music]
370 million how many people do we have
in the country now
i don't know the exact number but it's
well over 300 million
and 83 million have already had the
the virus by the end of 2020. does that
sound right
i don't feel like 83 million people got
infected
but that would be about 25 of the public
do you think 25 of the public already
had coveted it doesn't sound right does
it
i'm not saying it's not right but it
doesn't
this is one of those cases where the
statistics and the observation are
matching
and i and i always teach you that that's
the first thing you should look for
i'm not saying that the statistic is
wrong but you at least have to figure
out why the observation doesn't match
right because if it were one and four
i feel like things would look real
different
don't you right so if it were 83 million
and one percent of them died
it would be what 800 000
i don't know maybe we have 500 000 dead
so maybe that's not too far off
um but
the good news is the we've got eight
percent of the population vaccinated so
add 25 to eight
and we're uh maybe a third of the way to
some kind of herd immunity with the two
causes put together the vaccinations
plus the
already infected and we've got a new
vaccination
vaccine coming here's an interesting uh
hypothesis i love conspiracy theories
that doesn't mean i think they're true
but
they're always fun which is how they
become popular right
it's a fun conspiracy theory but you
know the story about
china used uh anal swabs to test for
covid
in our in u.s diplomats
now of course there's a big controversy
because it was considered humiliating
that china
basically shove something up the ass of
our diplomats
but as twitter user whose name is
hillary for prison
hrc number four prism
made this uh interesting observation
and i don't know if i want to believe
this or not but i love a good conspiracy
theory are you ready
and hillary for prison says the gut is
the foundation of health china just
data mined these diplomats they now know
any health conditions and medications
they're taking
this is a security breach and all these
diplomats
should be called home that's not bad
now i don't know if that's true but
it feels true doesn't it if if china
could get a hold of the
the you know the waste of our diplomats
couldn't they tell what what their
medical conditions are
and what uh drugs they're taking and if
they knew what drugs they were taking
and what their medical conditions were
would that give them some
leverage in some way over those
diplomats
i feel like it might this is an
interesting hypothesis
that you should just have out of caution
they should call all the diplomats home
but then does china win because we want
those diplomats they're there for a
reason
right they're not randomly picked
they're good for that job
so i don't know what kind of uh
credibility to put on this
speculation but i'm not ruling it out
it feels like the sort of thing that can
happen
all right let's see what else we've
talked about here
um here's another dog that's not barking
uh as cpac apparently there are a number
of breakouts or
events centered around the allegation
which
no courts have proven that there was
election fraud
now that's not the interesting part
the interesting part is as far as you
know
as far as you know is is our government
working on fixing the election process
at least the credibility of it so that
we'll feel confident in it
for next time i don't feel like that's
happening is it
so why are you even talking about i
don't know that
but you have my questions enabled do you
want to open it
my digital assistant started talking to
me that's spooky
um all i know is if your government
doesn't have a plan floating around for
fixing it and maybe there's an argument
between the democrats and the
republicans
but they all want to fix it nothing like
that's happening
i don't think i don't think i want to
listen to anybody
in the political sphere talking about
any election allegations for 2020 unless
they're personally working on the fix
if you're not working on fixing it i
don't care about what happened in the
past
i don't care i don't care if you think
there was fraud in the past
if you're not fixing it and again when i
say fix it
i mean the transparency of it that's not
not an allegation of fraud
it's an allegation of insufficient
transparency
i feel like we should just stop
listening to everybody
who is a politician who's not working on
fixing it
for next time i just don't care about
what happened last time that's over
right biden's the president you don't
have to like it it's just done
it's time to move on here's another
question
all this talk about the capital assault
and was it a resurrection was it a coup
and how q anon was a big part of this
and
qq so the biggest national story right
biggest story where's the part
where we talk about who q really was
especially toward the end there's some
suggestion that q
started with some group of people but
may have evolved into a different group
of people
how do we have a capital assault in
which
everybody thinks q had some role in it
and we don't know who q is and it's not
even a question in the news
where's the headline that says still
looking for a queue
where's the headline that says we found
q and
he he's a republican or he's a democrat
or he's
american or not american or there's
several of them
yeah well some of you are getting ahead
of me
what would be any explanation you could
think of
in which the biggest story isn't even in
the news
what would be a bigger story than who is
the actual identity of q
seriously what would be a bigger story
than that i mean
coronavirus yes but
the q thing was our biggest story for
months and nobody even
asked who is q
now let me ask you a second question do
you believe
that in our world of universal digital
surveillance do you think that our
intelligence agencies in the united
states
do not know who q was do you think the
cia
doesn't know who q was
is that even possible because of course
they were interested
of course they're interested that nobody
doubts that right
nobody doubts that the cia or maybe it's
the fbi i don't know
whichever entities get involved with
this sort of stuff
nobody would doubt that they'd be
interested right
or that they would look into it
do you think they couldn't find out
do you think that somebody could hide
and just say i'm cute
they'll never find me i'll i'll use my
clever
you know work around so they can't even
track me
really because that alone would be a
story if
there were somebody who was regularly
publishing and our intelligence agencies
couldn't figure out who it was
that would be a story so here are the
things
that we know it's not a story anywhere
it would be highly important to know the
answer to it
our intelligence agencies clearly know
who it is
clearly they have not told us who it is
why why
would our intelligence agencies not want
us to know
who is behind this you know at least
part of the variable behind this capital
assault that we're all so concerned
about
you don't think they'd want us to know
who it was
of course they would yeah and we should
we should know for example that there
might be a you know
they're talking to him or maybe some law
is broken
and there's a possible arrest i don't
know
suppose it's yeah
the only reasonable assumption is that
it is our intelligence agencies who are
behind cue
now i probably get kicked off of all
social media for even saying that right
this would be a good edge test isn't it
i think i just went too far
so i probably am cancelable now so let
me state it
in the the in a way that there's no
inaccuracy
i'm not saying that that's the case i
have no information
to directly suggest that intelligence
agencies
were behind cue at the end i don't know
about the beginning
but it does
explain everything we're seeing and i
don't have a second explanation
for why it's not even in the news do you
right it's just speculation but
ask yourself that question if you don't
know the answer to that question how
much do you understand about what's
going on
and when i say what's going on you know
i mean behind the curtain
i mean that's that is really really
obviously missing in the conversation
isn't it
and until i brought it up did you notice
until you heard me say it today were you
ever thinking to yourself
hey who is that cue person why don't we
know that yet
probably not because the media tells you
what to think about
and they didn't tell you to think about
that the media
tells you what to think about and that's
their job right and they simply didn't
tell you to think about it so you didn't
that's how well they can hide stuff they
meaning whoever is behind the curtain
and what entity would be able to get to
both
conservative news and uh and left
learning
leaning their news what entity could
could force both left and right leaning
news
to be silent on the biggest one of the
biggest topics
of in the country well i can't think of
anybody except an intelligence agency
can you imagine anybody else going to
fox news let's just take fox news or you
can do cnn
it doesn't matter can you imagine any
other entity going to them and saying
hey you know want you just don't cover
this q stuff
if cnn
wanted to figure out who q was or even
make a story about
we can't figure it out don't you think
cnn wants to report who q
is now you could make an argument oh
maybe
fox news doesn't want to report it
because it'd make i don't make
conservatives angry or something maybe
not be good for their customers
so you can make an argument that maybe
the right leading entities
just sort of want to ignore it because
it would make things worse for their
supporters
maybe i'm not saying that i'm just
saying you could imagine that
but what would cnn's reason be why would
cnn not report it because obviously
this would be somebody associated with
the right and they would like the right
to be deeply embarrassed
it's just so obviously missing it has to
be
well i won't say has to be i can see no
other explanation
which doesn't mean there isn't one it
just means that my imagination
you know taps out at a certain point
everybody's imagination taps out at a
certain point
you just can't imagine anything beyond
that point
thank you tj you were you were way too
nice and i appreciate that
all right um somebody says welcome to
the party pal
you've been there for a while huh all
right that's what i have to say today
now i'm going to try to keep my uh keep
my promise that each of these
live streams will tell you something you
didn't know or reinfor
reinforce something that maybe is better
to be reinforced
so i hope i did that today and uh i will
talk to you
oh before i go um i just tweeted and
it's
it's pinned to my profile all of the
it's an updated list of all the micro
lessons
on a whole bunch of things uh it's
getting pretty long right now
that you could learn within the locals
subscription
um world where you could follow me and
be part of my community it's a
subscription
site but the intention of that is
that you will learn a whole bunch of
skills to add to your your skill stack
and i will teach you each of these
skills really briefly
so it'll be the shortest most useful
lessons that you can immediately add to
your talent stack and that is what i'm
trying to do over in
locals and i will talk to you later
um somebody said i agreed but the
speculation is built from an overblown
narrative i don't know which one you're
talking about
oops your comments are fast
uh
nano lessons please
how will the cancel culture end i think
it's like everything else
you know it'll look like it's too much
for a while and then it will normalize
you know the
the reason that canceled culture exists
is that we have we do not have a leader
who has the right skill to make it go
away
bill maher is doing a good job arguing
against it but i don't know that he has
the weight
to make it go away
yes the q thing was used to claim that
trump supporters were nazis which makes
me suspect
that uh there's some dirty tricks going
on there all right
that's all i got for now and i'll talk
to you later
