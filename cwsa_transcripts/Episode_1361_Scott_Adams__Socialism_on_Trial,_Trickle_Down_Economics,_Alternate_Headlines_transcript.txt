hey everybody

scott adams
the absolute best part of your whole day
and there's no doubt about it and all
you need is a copper mug or glass attack
your tell us a steiner canteen jug of
flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure that the dopamine of the day
thing makes everything
better and it's happening all over the
world at the same time
it's called the simultaneous step and it
happens now go
stop it daniel stop it
troublemaker all right
let's talk about all the news most of it
is fake
who would have known i could make an
entire uh
job out of just pointing out how fake
the news is every single day
wouldn't you think that there would be
days at a time
when i would try to talk about fake news
and i would look at the news and i'd be
like darn
there's no fake news today to talk about
but no we never have to worry about that
we never have to worry about that
there's always fake news
here's uh at the top of the list
did you hear the poll that's found that
85 percent of the viewers of biden's
joint
session address liked it
85 percent liked his address
wow that's pretty high isn't it
totally real news there isn't it
well of course they they only polled
not only but almost overwhelmingly they
pulled democrats
who wanted to watch a biden's speech
what type of result do you get if you
do a poll of mostly democrats
who liked biden enough to watch his
speech
i feel like 85 is just about what you'd
expect out of that number
so it meant absolutely nothing because
they just
pulled the people who said exactly what
you think they would say
um rasmussen had a uh
has uh some poll results just came out
that by more than a three to one margin
voters say
capitalism is better than socialism
i have questions
wait a minute are you telling me that in
the year 2021
in the united states it's only three to
one
don't you feel like that should have
been a little higher as in
21 or 100 to one
are there really that many people who
said huh
capitalism versus socialism capitalism
versus socialism
yeah socialism but apparently yes
how can you explain this well i have a
potential explanation that goes like
this
there's nobody in the world who has the
same definition of what
socialism means
people just have different definitions
if people use the same definition
i feel like you'd have a lot more
agreement
but as long as people think socialism is
everything from
lots of it to a little bit of it then
people just answer
whatever political direction they think
their answer on it ought to be
but if you ask me is socialism better
than
capitalism i would say i don't know what
you're talking about
because they're always paired is there
any place in the world any country
in which there is capitalism but there's
not also socialism
i can't think of one maybe i can
saudi arabia maybe because i'm trying to
think of a situation where they don't
have
taxes because if you pay taxes
you're a socialist country right
is anybody going to disagree with this
statement that if you're
if you have a capitalist system but you
also pay
taxes that you're functionally you're a
socialist
country yeah it's just a definition
we don't like to think of it that way
but it's sort of a definition
you take taxes from some people you
use it for the betterment of the whole
socialism how about public school
socialism roads
pretty much everything now somebody's
saying that's dumb
so you're going to see what i call the
word thinkers
pouring in and once once you see this
distinction
in the way that people think you can't
unsee it
so i'm going to ruin your brains here
for a minute
there there is a big hunk of the public
who believes that words and the
definition of words
are a complete replacement for logic and
reason and facts now that sounds
ridiculous doesn't it
and you're thinking yourself there's
nobody like that everybody knows the
difference the difference between
a logical argument and something where
you're just arguing about what a word
means
there's nobody who can't tell the
difference yeah there is
watch the comments you're going to see
all the people get really mad
when i say well for all practical
purposes paying taxes
is socialism and those people are
no no the word
the word hurts me oh
i'm out i'm out i'll never listen to you
again
because you use the word in a way that i
didn't like
so the word thinkers usually are the
first ones to to bail out of any
conversation that
looks at cost benefit or nuance or
anything else
word thinkers first out
um but i would say that the everything
from social security
even though we pay into it blah blah we
don't pay enough to cover it
uh we have socialism all over the place
in our system
here's a better way to ask the question
are you ready for this
here's your payoff and by the way if
the rasmussen folks are listening i
don't know if there's a way to make a
polling question out of this but i'd
love to see it
uh instead of saying what's the better
system socialism or capitalism
and then you just get into word thinking
and what do words mean
instead ask this which gets away from
the whole
what words mean problem all right here
would be my poll question
to the public what is a better system
one that focuses on human motivation
or one that focuses on equitable
outcomes
that's the question because you know the
socialism just means too many things to
too many different people
but if you said what's a better system
one that focuses on human motivation
or one that tries folk to focus on an
equitable outcome
how do you think people would answer
that well i asked that question
in my highly unscientific twitter poll
as you might imagine 98 of the people
said
you want a system that focus on focuses
on human motivation
let me go further name a system
that doesn't take into account human
motivation
and still works i don't think he can
i mean it'd be fun to see if somebody
could there must be you know maybe
there's some special case or something
but i don't think there's any any
history any situation any example
in which somebody designed a system that
works against
human motivation and it worked out fine
i can't think of one so
that's the way i'd ask the question now
let's say
you were a uh a capitalist or republican
let's say you're a conservative and you
wanted to warn people away from the
risks of socialism
how would you do that would you
go on social media and say socialism is
bad
useless because the person you talk to
doesn't even know what you're talking
about so when you say
socialism is bad the other person hears
what's wrong with public education
you're not even on the same conversation
so social media is useless
for changing anybody's mind about
socialism
you'll just be caught up in the
definition of things so how would you do
it
let's say you wanted to be a high-level
persuader
and you wanted to persuade people but
you know you can't do it directly
you can't just argue with them they'll
never change their mind
nothing you say in public is going to
make any difference right
so what do you do here's what i would do
if this if i were trying to be the
master manipulator here
i would create a one-minute video
about socialism and focus on just that
human motivation element
and say whenever you create a system
where the human motivation is right
you get good results but put it in a
little one minute package
that can educate people really quickly
so it'd have to be interesting visual
probably have to have good production
values maybe
maybe something funny but not
necessarily something that everybody
could get just the one minute
description of what the problem is
now let me tell you let me show you how
bad this
this is i'm seeing in the comments
somebody saying
we'll just show them venezuela done
right worst persuasion ever
try it on me try it on me see if you can
convince me i mean i already
i'm already a capitalist but let's say
if you could convince me with that
argument scott
we don't want to become like venezuela
to which i say the problem with
venezuela
was how they picked their politicians
meaning that they had a dictator the
problem with venezuela
was a dictator and then everything else
you say about venezuela
is just yak yak yak because you're done
venezuela had a dictator everything that
comes after that
you don't even need to to debate it
you're kind of done
dictator equals bad
so anybody who says we don't want to
become like venezuela you should be
talking about
how we pick our leaders we're not going
to slide into their economic policies
you know like nationalizing companies
and stuff i don't see that coming
so that's a terrible argument because
venezuela is too different
on the political element to compare them
in any way on an economic
argument it's it's just apples and
oranges
they voted for their dictator somebody
says sure they did
allegedly maybe they did
it doesn't matter how they get there how
they got there they got there
so yeah one minute video showing that
there's no such thing as a system
that can survive without human
motivation
calculated in that would be one thing
all right
um see you then i think it was cnn in a
opinion piece
yesterday maybe talked about how
joe biden was different than trump in
terms of the
lying and fact checking now apparently
even the left cnn specifically
is in fact calling out biden for a
number of things he says which are not
accurate
so i'll give him that right it would
have been sort of hard for them to just
never fact check biden you know i don't
think they could have gotten away with
just not fact fact-checking them and
indeed they found
you know a bunch of things he said that
were not correct
now given that the reason he ran for
office
one of the biggest ones was that donald
trump was a big old liar
it's kind of weird that he's also
getting fact checked
and lots of stuff he says is not true
but as cnn points out
he does seem to have one pattern
which they would consider an improvement
over trump
which is that when he gets fact-checked
he typically backs off the fact
which would have been a lie not a fact
now
would you say that's true first of all
have you observed that have you observed
that he's made
claims that didn't pass the fact
checking but then fairly quickly
maybe not the same day or something but
fairly quickly
modified off that claim
and i'm looking at your comments to see
if you've noticed this
i would say i have but only by reading
the reporting i haven't noticed it
directly
but i've noticed that the reporting
seems to say it
i've seen it in a few different places
all right most of you are saying no no
no
hell no hell no no no no all right let
me ask you this
when was the last time biden used the
find people hoax
because remember he used it every single
time he talked
in the campaign every time how many
times has he used it
lately none
all right can you think of a time that
he used the find people hoax
lately it went from his main theme
to doesn't exist anymore
do you know why well it got fact-checked
yeah he got fact-checked
now not by cnn because they can't
fact-check it because they're part of
the lie
but it got fact-checked by enough places
that it must have been embarrassing
after some point
what about the trump said drink bleach
you don't see biden saying that he may
have said it at some point
but i don't think he says it anymore so
um there might actually be something to
this
i hear what you're saying that you don't
you don't believe he is backing off his
lies
but keep an eye on just just clear your
history cash and just say all right
starting now
let's see if he does back off anything
that gets fact checked
we'll see but i think we did some good
work
making him back off of the fine people
hoax and the bleach oaks
and when they say we i mean literally
we you know people who followed me and
amplified etc
all right cbs news
reports about a new paper by david hope
of the london school of economics and
julian lindbergh of king's college
london and they said the following
they examined 18 developed countries
from australia to the united states
they looked at a 50-year period from
1965 to 2015 and they were trying to
figure out
if tax cuts were good or bad
right you know did you come out ahead
because you cut taxes especially
on the rich and they looked at the
reagan tax cuts etc and the other
countries as well
and here's what they found they found
that the per capita gross domestic
product and
unemployment rates were nearly identical
after five years in countries that
slashed taxes on the rich
and those that didn't so what do you
make of that
this says that the gdp was no better
whether you cut taxes on the rich or not
and also unemployment was no better
so here's how this was reported if it's
no advantage to cut taxes on to
cut taxes on the rich then maybe you
shouldn't do it
because you didn't get any gdp benefit
and you and you got no i'm sorry
opposite i'm speaking uh upside down
right now
so the study would it would suggest and
i'll use the word suggest
that cutting taxes on the rich does
nothing good
because it doesn't help your gdp
doesn't help employment uh
is there something wrong with this do
you see it
do you see something wrong with this
here's another way to say the same thing
and i'm not going to change any facts
i'll just use the facts as they report
them
there's no reason to take money from the
rich
because it doesn't help anybody
right according to their study if you
take money from the rich in terms of
cutting their taxes i'm sorry
increasing their taxes if you increase
the taxes on the rich
the rich will have less money but the
gdp
will not be improved nor will employment
i believe that their study shows the
opposite of what they wanted to show
that there was no benefit of taking
money from people who had earned it
legally under the rules of capitalism
for whatever reason some people get
lucky some people inherit
but it showed there was no benefit for
taking their money
and in a free country allegedly
why are you taking money from the rich
if it doesn't make any difference
now it does i would say that this does
if the data is accurate you always
wonder about that
but if the analysis is good and the data
is accurate it does argue against
it argues against trickle-down economics
working
meaning it doesn't say that the gdp went
up if you cut your taxes
but it did let people keep more of the
money they earned
and didn't make any difference that's
better
it's better to let people keep their
money now
um let's see
and it says the incomes of the rich grew
much faster where the rates were lower
so the rich got richer
but here's the other thing that this
analysis i'm pretty sure left out
which is the differences in tax shelters
and write-offs and all that
when taxes were highest in the united
states
were rich people paying the most or were
they using the most tax shelters and
really not paying much at all
i don't know if you can look at tax
rates
and say you've got some kind of apples
to apples
because if the tax rates are this but
all the rules of how you hide stuff and
avoid taxes are completely different
from one to the other
those are that's an apple and an orange
you can't compare them so i don't think
there's anything useful in this economic
analysis
except that it didn't find any big
difference when you
steal the money from the people who
earned it so
why do it the other thing i think
i worry about is that cause and effect
might be backwards
because when are the situations in which
you can raise taxes on the rich
when is the time you can raise taxes on
anyone
when the economy is good right so
is it the tax change that causes the
economy or is it that the economy is
good
and this is a good time to pay down some
debt so you raise some taxes hey
economy is looking good sort of the bill
clinton
situation clinton could raise taxes
because the economy was good the economy
caused
the tax change it wasn't the tax change
that caused the economy
so i don't think this economic analysis
has any value whatsoever
just none but it's in the news people
are going to make all kinds of
assumptions about it let's do some
alternate headlines i'll tell you how
the news was reported
and they'll tell you another way you
could have reported the news
with the same facts so i won't be adding
or subtracting facts
i'll just be describing it differently
and you
you're the judge if the original
headline or my headline is more accurate
all right here's something from the
hollywood reporter this is in a tweet
but the tweet described the situation
this way
it said a group of 467 purported former
participants on the show this is uh
jeopardy is the show
wrote an open letter uh medium accusing
the
the game show's producers of failing to
catch
what they allege is a white power hand
gesture
now i'm not going to do an impression of
it
because then somebody takes a screenshot
blah blah but
suffice to say that his thumb and
forefinger were together
and his uh three remaining fingers on
one hand
were exposed all right so that's what he
was doing so he was
he was definitely making an intentional
gesture
so nobody is questioning that it's just
what was the gesture his claim
because he was horrified so the person
who made the claim
no he wasn't making the okay sign that's
the
automatic thing you think but he wasn't
doing it because you didn't see the o
so normally the o part see i'm not going
to do it with my hand
let's say let's use these scissors
let's say this part of the scissor was
where your thumb and
and for your index finger would cause a
little o
like the okay that wasn't there because
his hand was like this
right so the audience and who he was
presenting it to
couldn't see the okay part of the okay
all you can see is that three of his
fingers were below it
all right now he says it was the third
time he won
and each of the other times he won he
did a gesture
he did one gesture for one when he won
once
a gesture for two when he won the second
time and a gesture for
three when he won the third time but
wait a minute
why did he have to do it that way how do
people typically say
three like that right
this is the way you say three but he
didn't do that
so why did he do that weird other thing
where these two fingers
are together but the other three are
giving the number
have you ever seen that before in
baseball
in baseball they do that so if you're a
baseball catcher
and you're indicating a call to the
pitcher
you do that signal it's one of the ways
you indicate three but
baseball players tend to do it now that
doesn't mean that's why he did it
i have no idea what's in his mind but as
far as i know there's nothing on social
media
nothing his friends are saying nothing
he said
that would even come close to making him
a white supremacist which is the
accusation
right nothing in his background any
suggestion that there's anything like
that
right so pretty unlikely it was true so
that's the headline that all these
people are accusing him of making a
alleged white power hand gesture let's
see uh let's see
the alternate summary could have been
the same tweet
in other words it could have been the
same facts here's how i would have
written it
man holds up three fingers to indicate
three victories in a row
mass hysteria ensues
is that an inaccurate statement of what
happened
he held up three fingers and people lost
their
that's a fair statement based on what we
can observe
right there's no indication he has any
connection with any racist
anything so the only thing we know is he
held up three fingers
and there was a bunch of mass hysteria
that happened how is that not accurate
same story all right here's another one
um you remember the nexium uh so-called
cult that wasn't really a cult but
people
calling it that uh the new york times
once wrote this headline
and uh you know so this is a while ago
but
the headline was inside a secretive
group
where women are branded so you know the
story that
there was some small group of people who
um
got a brand a little little brand uh
they had the
the leader's name initials you know sort
of embedded in it etc
so that was the story now is this
accurate
inside a secretive group where women are
branded
well i would say that's accurate
statement
it was a semi-secretive group that's
true
and that women were branded
but don't you assume they were branded
beyond
outside their their uh their willingness
to do it
doesn't it sound like they were victims
that's what it sounds like right here's
another alternate headline
and uh i believe the this is all true
so it's just a another way to look at it
it's all true
so first of all these brands have a name
i don't know if you've heard it
but it's called scarification have you
heard of it
so giving yourself a little brand
or scars with a quarterizing pen so
there's actually tools to do this
it's a thing so it's a growing trend
where you'll get like a little bit of
scar instead of a tattoo
right now how many of you knew that
how many were you how many of you were
aware
that this thing called scarification
already existed
it's a it's a growing trend with
professionals
who use professional equipment now did
you know
that prior to this so-called branding
that the people who participated did you
know that they called in an expert on
scarification
to learn how to do it safely and
voluntarily
did you know that did you know that they
got expert advice so it'd be
safe and that nobody did it unless they
wanted to
did you know that the uh
well let so here's the alternate
headline
is scarification the new tattoo we
report on a group of friends who are
part of this growing trend
that could have been the headline right
is scarification the new tattoo because
that puts it in context
that is the thing most of the public
doesn't know it's a thing
so if you just heard somebody got
branded and you didn't know that
there's a name for it it's it's a safe
growing and popularity you know
thing uh then uh
you would think of it differently and it
was a group of friends
who decided among themselves
to put these brands on each other
now have you also heard that it was a
sex cult
for keith uh renier renery
keith renery you heard it was a sex cult
right
did you know that the people having sex
with him
were already having sex with him before
any of this happened
and that the people who are already
having sex with them who all knew about
each other
it was completely open do you know that
they were the core
of the people who recruited the other
people but there was never any
requirement of any kind of sex or
anything
that was never even part of it so when
it's reported
it's that this you know they'll call it
a cult
and they'll say that a bunch of women in
the cult were having sex with the leader
is that true yes
it's also true that they were having sex
with them voluntarily
before any of the the group was even
formed and that they were part of
forming the group
so now of course i'm also dealing with
information that you know comes from the
group
i wasn't there so you have to factor in
you know
whether there's any context i don't know
but
look at the way this stuff gets reported
when you see that the headlines are so
disconnected
from anything that actually happened and
by the way
just because i know this will get taken
out of context
i'm not defending anything that anybody
did i don't know what keith
renery did or did not do with anybody or
whether he
did or not did not break any laws i do
know that
everything about the prosecution was
sketchy
i do know that there's a lot of
sketchiness about how he got prosecuted
but that's independent of whether he
broke any laws i wouldn't know
so i have no personal knowledge of any
of that so i don't defend anything i
don't know about
uh by the way the dilbert nft is up to
the biddings up to twelve thousand six
hundred dollars with one day left
i imagine most of the bidding will be
the last day
because there's not much reason to do it
before the last day so this is the day
this is the last day so if anybody was
thinking of that and by the way
i don't know why anybody buys
collectible anything
but if you wanted this one it's
available
the disturbing story about rudy giuliani
being
raided at his uh new york apartment i
guess
by federal agents who had a warrant for
all of his electronic devices
they're trying to figure out apparently
if he had some kind of
foreign agent unregistered
help he was giving to ukraine to lobby
the united states on their behalf but
apparently at least
giuliani says he's never done anything
like that and he had also
offered all of this stuff without being
asked for it
everything that they took he had already
offered to give them
now that's his version so i don't know
if that really means everything
but the weird part of the story is i
heard this on tucker carlson's show
is that rudy giuliani says he tried to
give them
hunter biden's hard drives because that
was covered
in the warrant the warren said get all
of his electronic devices
some of his electronic devices were had
hunter biden's information on it
and he was trying to give it to him
please
take this your warrant says it's for you
here and they wouldn't take it what's
that tell you
what's that tell you well it tells you
that
there must be some kind of agenda now
everything about this is disturbing but
keep in mind we also don't know exactly
what their motivation was the federal
the people who served the warrant
and it's not their job to tell us
because it's a you know it's a legal
action
they shouldn't be telling the public
everything that they're doing right
but we can't really trust them anymore
if we ever could
so i don't think we're in that world
where our intelligence agencies can do
stuff like this
without a real good explanation to the
public
so let me speak to our you know law
enforcement people
in the department of justice you have
seriously degraded your credibility with
this
i mean a lot you know every everybody
has their line
you know maybe it was the the roger
stone raid was your
where it crossed the line for you i said
okay i'm out that's
that's way too much showmanship for
whatever they were trying to accomplish
but until we hear more about this rudy
giuliani case
maybe there's something we don't know
i'm going to say that
this has really taken the department of
justice's credibility
down a whole other level to me
but we'll say maybe there's maybe
there's something else we learned about
that
so this tells you uh this next story
tells you a lot
you know you heard the joe rogan story
and he had he had said that if a 21 year
old
healthy person asked him
should i take the vaccination that he
would say maybe not
now how did that get reported by the
illegitimate media
that immediately got reported as the
he's some kind of anti-vaxx person
not even close to true he plans to get
the vaccination or already has
you know he's happy his parents got it
he has no objection to it
he does however have a cost-benefit
opinion about whether an individual
would be better off in a special case
special cases
you're healthy and you're 21.
now the experts weigh in and say you
anti-vaxxer
the reason that the 21 year old should
get vaccinated
is that that's the group of people who
are spreading it
so it's not about the 21 year old's own
health
it's about the spread to which i say
that wasn't the question the question
was
whether the 21 year old should get a
vaccination
the question wasn't whether the 21 year
old
should do a solid thing for the rest of
the public
and of course joe rogan
clarified that but in my opinion
that clarification was unnecessary
because that's what i heard the first
time
the first time i heard it i did not hear
him say
that he was he was saying that the 21
year old should or should not
protect other people as he said that's a
separate question
it's a separate question the question is
is the 21 year old making the right
cost-benefit analysis
for their own situation and i did not
see
the experts push back on that except
that
there were some long haul problems but
how many of the long haul problems
happened to 21 year olds i don't know
do you have you seen any statistics
that told you that a healthy fit 21 year
old
would also have lingering you know the
long haul problems that
some of the older people are getting
again
i think joe rogan made a perfectly
reasonable statement
that that captured all of the nuance it
captured all the nuance
he understood that you know there's a
spread question from the people who
don't get vaccinated
but that wasn't the question he was
talking about this one person's
cost benefit analysis so
the fake news is trying desperately to
turn this into a story
but the real story should be joe rogan
agrees completely with experts
on the scientific part there's no
difference
between what he's saying in a
cost-benefit way
and what all the experts are saying
there's no difference but they they try
to make it into one
by uh acting as though you know he's
talking about something that he isn't
which is you know blocking the spread to
other people
which is an important question it just
wasn't what he was talking about
are you as weirded out as i am by
biden saying let's get out of
afghanistan and suddenly everybody's
cool with that
does that bother you because it's
bothering me
because i'm pretty sure if trump had
said as he did
let's get out of afghanistan it looked
like the world was going to end
and all bad things were happening and
then biden says it
i feel like people just said all right
okay yeah yeah
now that you mentioned it there's no
reason to be there
now of course the reason would be you
know we're seeing stories in the news
that
al qaeda is already you know going to
take over afghanistan
and the taliban is going to let them and
whatever
who do you think is planting those
stories
do you think reporters are saying to
themselves hey
i've got an idea for a story i'll go
research what's going to happen
after we pull out maybe
but that's not exactly how the world
works
it is slightly more likely that whoever
is planting these stories about al-qaeda
taking over afghanistan is somebody
roughly associated with the
military-industrial complex
probably right or somebody who has an
interest in
staying there or furthering warfare so
uh but biden gets a pass he just says
we're getting out because there's no
reason to be there
and there's no metric we can measure to
even know if anything's working
we don't have anything to measure over
there to say
it was good or bad better or worse
apparently it's hard to tell
so if you can't measure your progress
get the hell out
here's a here's a good general uh
statement of truth
it's like a management uh
i guess a it's just a given anybody who
studies management
if you can't measure that the
things you're doing are affecting the
things you want to change
if you don't have any measurement get
the hell out of there
you don't want to be anywhere where you
can't measure
that you did something that makes a
difference if your actions appear
random get out
you don't need to be there you only want
to be
where you know your actions have some
kind of a
you know likely predictable outcome and
there's nothing like that
in afghanistan there's just no way to
predict that anything we do makes any
difference in the long run
so get out and i i think in a way that
that's what biden
you know i'm paraphrasing but i think
he's basically saying that
that we can't see any reason so get the
hell out of there
i'll give biden credit for that and of
course trump as well he started that
so trump more than biden i think in this
case
all right i owe you this private
information one of the
pitfalls of being a public person such
as myself
is that every now and then there's a
private thing that happens in your life
that any any reason to appeal to
the greater good requires me to tell you
this which is i am going to get
vaccinated
uh monday so i have decided
finally i can get it close enough that i
don't have to wait five hours
so only recently it became available
somewhat easily
so i'm going to get vaccinated on monday
and
i owe you my reasons because it's a
topic we talk about all the time right
i'm watching the comments you haven't
heard my reasons yet have you
don't you think you should hear my
reasons before you have such strong
opinions
how do you know you disagree with me
until you've heard why
i'm watching all the people am i scared
all right let me give you my reasons it
goes like this number one
um i'm in i'm in a uh category
with some comorbidities right so i've
got
a little high blood pressure
and you know it's under control but a
little bit high
and i've got asthma which i've had for
many years
so in my case i've got a little extra
risk
uh number two at this point it's obvious
the vaccinations work there's nobody who
disagrees with that right
i think the i don't think there's any
question at this point no reasonable
person could say
that they don't decrease the number of
deaths
are you right does anybody disagree with
that so far
that the vaccinations do at least what
they said they would do
decrease the number of deaths okay so
that's the first thing
now i didn't know that for sure
two months ago two months ago if you
said
are you sure these vaccinations even
work
i would have said well i'd like to wait
a little bit longer
just to be sure now we're not talking
about the risks yet
so far we're only talking about whether
they you know they help against the
coronavirus
i think at this point it's unambiguously
true
there's no expert anywhere in the world
who says they don't work
as far as i know next
let's talk about my personal risk versus
social risk all right if i were
if i were looking at only for my
personal risk
maybe i'd make a different decision i
don't know but
i don't like the long-haul risks
and most people just ignore that when
they talk about the risk of dying from
covet
i'm not as worried about dying because
the wrists are so small
i'm definitely worried about a long-haul
problem
and i think i'm in the age group where
that's worth worrying about i wouldn't
worry about it at 21
but i do worry about it at this age
right so i've got a little bit of
personal risk here of of the covid
that's bigger than most people
um and i judge without having perfect
information
because we're all making decisions with
imperfect information right
there's a little bit of guessing going
on my
feeling and that's about as far as i can
go with it is my hunch my feeling
my common sense if any of those are real
things
is that my risk would be
similar and maybe a little bit better
you know lower risk if i get the shot
right
now i'm unlikely to get blood clots
because i'm male
so there's that
but then the second part is the social
part
as a patriot as a member of
the american family a member of the
world let's say
as a as a citizen of the world
i'm sort of in that category where if i
get sick
with covet there's a little more chance
i'm going to give it to somebody
because if you're older you might get a
worse case if you get a worse case
you're more of a spreader maybe you
don't know it
so um as a patriotic
i'm not going to say duty i'll say a
patriotic
preference and as well as for the world
which is not patriotism
per se um i think that there are people
who
are in the category where they should
take a risk
for the other people and i'm in that
group
meaning i've had a good run i've had a
good run
if i die yeah
it's gonna happen sometime if it happens
now i've had a good run
you know honestly i really think that
and everything i do now is just bonus
you know if i get another good year out
of my life hey that's great
so um if i were just doing it for myself
i probably would
because i think i think i have a little
bit better risk reward getting the shot
than not
and for the benefit of the public
there's no doubt
that people like me especially public
figures
so if a public figure gets the shot and
i'm in the older person category
it probably reduces the risk for the
rest of the public
is good for the economy
somebody says aren't you a recluse well
i'm largely a recluse but other people
are not
meaning that people come in and out of
my environment even if i
uh even if i'm relatively reckless
take a selfie and post it i don't think
i'll be doing that
yeah and if there's the other thing uh
if you would like to uh put your money
where your mouth is
for those of you who think i'm taking on
the risk of death
i guess everything's a risk of death
probably i have higher risk of
oh here's a good question for you let me
see if
let me let me see if you can calculate
these risks without you know knowing the
data
do you think my risks of dying are
greater from the vaccination
or from the drive to the vaccination
site
which is the higher risk of dying
this is a legitimate question no no
hyperbole
i actually don't know i feel as if and i
don't know if it could be calculated
exactly
i feel as if the drive to the
vaccination is more dangerous than the
vaccination
or we're that's the point we're at right
because i don't and i think you maybe
you could calculate that if you said
all right let's say my vaccination is
five miles away
you can figure out your risk of dying
per mile
you could compare that to the risk of
dying per millions of vaccinations
somebody should actually do that by the
way that's actually
a really good calculation if you want to
if you want to convince people to get a
vaccination
do that calculation do the calculation
i want to know the actual risk of
driving five miles
compared to the risk of somebody my age
and demographic
of getting the shot now of course if
you're saying you can't really know
yeah i get that but it feels like it's
similar
it feels like it's in the same
neighborhood all right
um the other reasons i'm doing it is
that we're seeing a number of businesses
are going to require it uh here's my
prediction
uh if we look at what the experts are
saying they're saying that even
vaccinated people
need to wear masks and it looks like
that would be the case through maybe the
end of the year
if you're only listening to the experts
it would feel like that right
that even when we're fully vaccinated or
as close as we can get
you're still going to have to wear a
mask all year
here's my prediction no way
there's just no way the public
will take some pushing you can push the
public
quite a bit but you got to have a reason
as soon as the reason goes away the
public
is going to turn on you like a
and we're getting closer and closer to
that point aren't we
like you're hearing plenty of people
complaining and saying why do i have to
wear a mask if i got the vaccination
but wait till 80 of the country is
vaccinated and has to keep wearing a
mask
once you get about 80 vaccinated good
luck
good luck telling the 80 percent they
got to wear a mask
i don't think it's gonna work if you
tell me i have to
wear a mask during a scary pandemic
where there's nothing else i can do
about it
yeah i'll wear a mask even if i'm not
positive it works even if i'm not
sure the cost benefit's worth it i'm
going to take that guidance
if smart well-meaning people tell me to
do it i'll take that
but you get me vaccinated and you tell
me
that my wrists are nil my risk of
spreading it or nil
and i still gotta wear a mask i don't
think that's gonna fly
so whatever you think about the official
people telling you you're gonna need a
mask until the end of the year
i don't see it i i think it's
somewhere around mid-summer by
mid-summer
my guess the mask thing is just gonna
have to
go away imagine if you will two
restaurants one is right
next to the other one says if you're
vaccinated come on in
no masks the other one is being a little
cautious and they say
well the experts still say masks are
good so
maybe should do it which one do you go
to it's just
it's going to be easy so i wouldn't
worry about mass in the long run
so i don't know what the hell is
happening in india there's certainly
something we don't exactly understand
but
the we have terrifying numbers that up
to 30 000 people
per day could be the death rate pretty
soon
based on what they believe is the
infection rate
the 30 000 per day
so if you're saying to yourself gosh i'm
glad we helped out india a little bit
that's not enough that's not enough
if you want india you being the united
states let's say
if the united states wants india to be
its ally
for the next hundred years we need to
step up to this
right because allies don't let allies
lose 30 000 people a day if there's
anything you can do about it now who
knows you know what you can do about it
who knows
how much we would be taking from
americans
if we were to help them more but i got
to say
that 30 000 people dying in india you
you pretty much have to treat that like
it's happening in your backyard
if they're an ally all right and even if
they're not
right a human just being human means you
should care about it
but when you're talking about your most
important strategic ally
vis-a-vis you know china your most
important ally for the next hundred
years
we should we should just drop everything
not
not do anything that would hurt our
domestic effort but man we should
we should do everything we can to help
on this for our strategic benefit
and for humanity really
um here's a matt gates update
it's good thing we have matt gates
because otherwise it wouldn't be any
good news
like interesting news not good news so
here's the latest on that so apparently
this uh
the fellow greenberg who's part of this
story
and uh you know was pells with matt
gates
so there's a story that uh there's some
documents that have
come up in which uh greenberg had
been talking about some things and
mentioned that there was a 17 year old
girl according to greenberg
so we only have one person saying it we
still don't know
that there's a real girl or she would be
a woman by now
so we don't know that there's a real
person but we know one person's talked
about this real person
if it's real and said that
that greenberg had just learned that she
was not really 19 that had been lying
about her age and she was 17.
now here's the question we now have a
document
that looks reasonably credible that
would say with
with certainty that matt gates did not
know if it happened
he denies that anything like this
happened but if it happened
the greenberg documents would indicate
that he didn't know
that greenberg's the one who told them
and he was horrified
now does that make it not illegal if it
happened
which matt gates says unquestionably did
not
right so keep in mind the person who
knows for sure
says it didn't happen in any form right
not not just that he didn't know that
just didn't happen
so keep that in mind because we just
assume guilt when we hear stories like
this
but uh if we know he didn't know how
illegal would it be
so we'll talk about the exchange of
money part separately
but just the underage part how illegal
is it
if you didn't know does anybody know
how many of you know the answer that
how illegal is it if you didn't know
and the person who is involved lied to
you
somebody says is still tactically
illegal
is it well the answer is it depends
let's say for example the uh the woman
and this will be a hypothetical this has
nothing to do with matt gates this will
be a hypothetical example
in a hypothetical example let's say the
underage 17 year old
had a fake id if you saw a fake id
but you're not some expert on id and it
looked real to you
you would be in the clear did you know
that
did you know that if you had really
strong evidence
that she was of legal age such as a fake
id that looked real to you
you'd be in the clear now i just read
that this morning
on some legal website so if i'm wrong
about that
i'll expect the real lawyers to weigh in
and get me now
if you're saying that's not true here's
what might be
the difference if the if the female
in question is under 14 there's no
defense
all right let me say that again if the
female is actually under
14 there's no defense no defense
no there's nothing you can say you can't
say you didn't know
because if you're with somebody who's
even anywhere in the neighborhood of
under 14
you've got some explaining to do right
that you didn't know
so i think we all agree that there has
to be some
age below which you just can't use any i
didn't know defense
right even if sometimes somebody goes to
jail for that
you just sort of have to have a standard
for that but at 17
simply being deceived is actually a
complete legal defense
it may be a difference by state it might
be a state difference
but i think probably it'd be similar so
what would happen if what we find out is
that
the greenberg document documents quite
clearly
if there is actually this person even
exists that
gates didn't know so i would say
is that like looking at a is that the
same as looking at an id
i don't know if you date somebody
do you do you ask to look at their id
i don't know did they go to let's say
did they go to a restaurant and order
drinks
and again none of this isn't evidence we
have no reason to believe any of this
happened
but just hypothetically suppose matt
gates had gone on
a date and the woman had bought a drink
took out a fake id the server looked at
and said all right and served him
would he be in the clear if he observed
a waiter looking at a fake id and say
yeah you're 21.
i don't know that would be sketchy
because i think she claimed she was 19
so she still couldn't drink so i guess
that example wouldn't work in this case
but this gets a little less clear than
you think now what about the question of
exchange of money so apparently there
there is acknowledgement by all parties
that money has been exchanged but was it
money for sex
and where do you draw the line when it's
money for sex
let me give you uh an example let's say
a billionaire who has never had sex with
you
invites you to take a private jet to
france
on a date and then you have sex
did the billionaire pay for sex because
he just provided you a value of let's
say fifty thousand dollars because the
jet plus the high end accommodations
whatever
pretty expensive would you say that's
the case of buying sex
well if you live in the real world you
probably do legally no
right legally no no agreement of money
for sex happened
all right let me give you another one um
suppose uh
there's a millionaire who buys some
diamond jewelry
for a woman he's never he's never been
intimate with
and then soon after that they have some
sex
no there's no discussion of money for
sex or diamonds for sex
but they've never had sex he gives her a
real expensive gift
and then some sex happens soon after did
he pay for sex
yes in the real world absolutely
it was part of his package it wasn't the
only thing
i mean presumably was not disgusting
but it's part of the package so
it's really the problem here
is that beyond a certain level of income
men are always paying for sex they just
don't talk about it that way
so let me say this again so you don't
miss this point above a certain income
all men are paying for sex all the time
no exceptions
because unless they don't know who you
are and
you know a rare case where somebody just
didn't know you had money or something
if they know you have money that's part
of the decision
i've never met a woman who was
unaffected by what a man did
for a living i've never i've never seen
that
you know they even if they say i don't
care about money
they certainly care about what he does
for a living and whether that
you know whole package is attractive or
not
so i'm not uh casting aspersions on
the men or the women or anybody in my
examples
these are all just free people making
free decisions
money is always part of big decisions so
i feel as though
the the dividing line should be this let
me just put this out here
for discussion suppose we found out
that the girls that this greenberg and
matt gates
were involved with suppose we found out
that none of them
were prostitutes because there's no
information that says they are right
so far i'm aware of no reporting that
says they
that they were working in that capacity
do you think that you could convict
somebody for paying for sex
if the person who accepted the money for
hotels and
you know tuition or whatever things were
going on if they accepted these gifts
but they did not work as a prostitute in
any other form that you can identify
is that is that paying for sex because
it's really murky isn't it
who knows i would say that if if money
is involved and it's a rich person
you're always
paying for sex and there's no way to
avoid it it's just you don't always talk
about it that way
new york times has a story about this
arizona audit
and i just love the fake news way they
talk about it
here's an actual quote from a story in
the new york times it's almost
unbelievable that this is even written
down
it says quote almost half a year after
the election donald trump lost
the audit that arizona republicans
promised has become a partisan
snipe hunt
what do you know what a snipe
hunt is how many of you even know what
that is first of all
i'll tell you while i wait for your
comments
a snipe is a
is a bird that doesn't exist and
a snipe hunt is a reference to a famous
historical prank in which you get
somebody who's new or young
or dumb and you convince them that
there's this thing called a snipe
a certain kind of bird and that you're
going to go hunting for them
and then hilarity ensues right
so you try to get people to go hunting
the snipe that doesn't exist
so the new york times refers to the
audit as republicans
uh on a partisan snipe hunt
how do they know how the audit ended
because that's not part of the reporting
now if the reporting came at the end of
the audit
and the whole audit had found nothing
improper
then calling it a snipe hunt after the
audit
when you didn't find anything perfectly
appropriate
perfectly appropriate a good analogy
actually somebody looking for something
that they believe exists but is just
imaginary that's a sniper
but if you say it before the audit has
any results that's not news
that's just propaganda how in the world
do they know it's a snipe hunt
they don't know how it ended now they
also make reference and this is the
other part of the the fake news
they say the other audits they have
nothing to do with this one
other audits showed nothing well those
were different audits
they were they were limited in scope
they weren't really anything like this
one
but the new york times would like you to
believe that because
completely different situations
had had a you know an outcome that we
know
that this completely other different
situation is now predictable
and it too will be a snipe hunt nothing
like that isn't evidence
now it might be true that it's a snipe
hunt when we're done
um how what would what would be your
bets let me test your
uh predictive abilities
all right in the comments i want you to
commit
after the arizona audit and we assume
that whatever they find would have to be
verified by
somebody else because nobody trusts the
auditors but whatever they find is
something they could just show you
and then other people can look at it and
say it's either true or not
but do you think the arizona audit will
find enough
impropriety to reverse any outcome
or at least the outcome of the state how
many of you think the audit
will reverse the outcome in the comments
i'll just read them
find nothing yes no absolutely not
some but not enough uh yes no
yes don't know 60 chance well
the the smartest person here gives
percentages by the way
if you said yes or no you're not as
smart as the person who said 60
and i don't know if 60 is a good
estimate but
but if you fell into the binary it's a
yes or no
you should have gone with the statistics
all right but in terms of prediction it
does have to be yes or no
so i'm looking at your predictions and
uh they're actually kind of mixed
kind of mixed yeah and now i'm seeing
people
uh saying slightly more than half
percent chance that it's wrong
you know um i'll tell you what
if i had to bet
i don't know this was a tough one
statistically speaking
this is something matt brainard said uh
based on
everything we know about other elections
based on everything we know about
mail-in votes so based on all of that
if you just looked at the sheer number
of votes
in in the millions and you said to
yourself
if this many millions of votes had
happened just like
they always happen if it was similar to
the past
you would have more than twelve 000
votes that are
you know sketchy and that would be
enough to change the election
because the election was you know kind
of close so
is matt brainard right that you wouldn't
have to know much about anything
to know that if there are this many
votes there are
always always it has nothing to do with
arizona
has nothing to do with democrats or
republicans
has only to do with a type of system
that has a certain kind of
uh frailty to it which is it's imperfect
the size of the votes guarantees that
enough of them will be wrong
that it could change the outcome but
it could be wrong in the other direction
right we could end up
at the end of the audit one of the two
possibilities
is that biden won by more votes than we
thought
nothing would there's nothing that would
make that impossible
right so just because there's close to
100
chance that there are enough sketchy
votes to change the election
that doesn't mean that they're all in
the same direction
it does mean that there might be
problems right
so i'm going to take your uh 60
estimate uh based on the matt brainard
uh estimate that there are so many votes
you
will have a question about whether the
the election was affected
i'm going to say i'm going to go with
the 65 percent
i'd say there's a 65 percent chance
that it doesn't matter if it's arizona
or any place else there'll be at least
enough sketchy votes that they'll be an
issue
at least a question about the result so
that's my final answer
65 chance that we will have some
question about the accuracy of the
outcome when we're done
um
so that
is what is exciting today now here's a
question for you
will i be demonetized for what i just
said
what do you think now it would be uh
grounds for demonetization if i were to
say
that i believe the election is um
fraudulent but i didn't say that right
all right everybody's clear i am not
alleging
fraud in the election i made a statement
about accuracy of elections in general
and a statement about how large the
number of votes is that's all i've done
that's all i've done so i don't think
anybody
has much pushback on those two things so
i'm hoping i can stay
stay on youtube for saying that
um
somebody says that i insinuated fraud
did i
did you hear me insinuate fraud in
in this broadcast because i feel like
maybe
that was in your head i definitely
insinuated
inaccuracy right
you heard me insinuate that anything
large
of this nature will have a certain
percentage of inaccuracy
that's all that's the whole story
inaccuracy doesn't mean fraud
and it doesn't even mean it changes the
election
all right that's all i got for now and i
will talk to you
tomorrow
