dude
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization will Scott
wake up
I don't know we'll find out
but you've come to the place that's the
most amazing place and the best place
you could ever be forget about that
Apple announcement that's happening at
the same time you don't care
it's unimportant but if you'd like your
experience to go to levels never before
seen all you need is a copper mug or a
glass a tank of Chelsea's time I can't
eat Jagger flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine of
the day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous set
that happens now go
good
ah yes you can see behind me there will
be a white board today which means it's
the best guy today there's nothing
better than whiteboard day
sounds racist
but it's not it's not
we'll get to that way Borden
uh well today Apple's got a big
announcement they're making a wearable
birth control for men
that's a pretty big deal wearable birth
control for men
um I think they call it a mixed reality
headset
you put that on and you have no chance
of mating whatsoever they say it's good
for AR and also VR
AR and VR
stands for
uh it's got to be ar it's got to be a
low reality and VR would be virgin
reality
I think it covers both
but they say it will be used for uh the
valuable
processes of gaming messaging and
tracking your health
in unspecific ways
now here's a question I have for you
we'll go private here at locals
uh my question for you is has Tim Cook
introduced a new product that was a
whole new category before that succeeded
has he ever done that because
I feel like it's just been iPads and
phones and new software a watch that the
watch the watch was just sort of
uh
I don't know I've got a feeling this is
the kind of product category that Steve
Jobs could make into something
uh but I don't think Tim Cook can
all right I completely changed my
opinion erase everything you just heard
my new opinion is Steve Jobs would not
have created mixed reality headsets
what do you think do you think Steve
Jobs would have even tried
or whatever said no you don't want that
on your head get that off your head
I don't know well I actually the uh the
actual the Apple earbuds earbuds or
whatever they are the Apple Air buds
came under Tim Cook and those are
amazing
so that's a pretty good technology by
the way do your do your earbuds make or
your earbuds make your ears itch
does anybody have an itchy ear problem
I can't even use them
I I can only use the uh the earbuds for
maybe one day in a row if I use them for
two days in a row my ears will itch like
insanely I can't even use them there's a
reason for that I saw a study that
there's some kind of vibrational thing
that happens there
no it's not about washing them it's
about the vibration
not about washing them you can say it a
million times but it's not about washing
them it's just about the sound
all right Jack Dorsey has endorsed RFK
Jr
I don't know if that'll make any
difference but he said he seems to think
that RFK JR could beat both of them
Jack Dorsey also tweeted
cryptically end of an Empire
we don't know what Empire he's talking
about I'm guessing America
what do you think
I think you say it's the end of the
American Empire
I don't know
could be maybe you talk about Twitter
but probably America
well there's a study out I saw Ashley
Sinclair was tweeting about this
uh it shows that 53 percent of mothers
of boys with gender identity disorder
have borderline personality disorder or
depression
these mothers also had a child rearing
attitudes
and practices that encourage symbiosis
and discourage the development of
autonomy
are you surprised that 53 percent
of boys who had gender identity disorder
had a crazy mom
and but crazy in a specific way
all right but that but that would still
leave about half
you know roughly half of the kids
who were not influenced by the mother
what do you think influences the other
half
it's they're born that way and then
they're just
you know expressing who they are
probably for some
probably some are just born that way and
they're expressing who they are
but
um we might look for some other studies
that says left-wing activists
um
also have mental illness
the study out of the University of bird
in Switzerland has revealed that those
who partake in far left activism were
likely to exhibit narcissistic
personality and Psychopathic tendencies
all right so you got your
mother's half of the mothers of boys
with uh gender identity disorder have
mental illness
many of the left-wing activists had
mental illness
is there any other mental illness in the
news oh yes there is
so there are over 2 000 families who are
suing social media
for making their children's children
mentally ill
right so now we know that three things
associated with mental illness mothers
of boys with gender identity disorder
left-wing activists
and anybody who watches social media
who's a child anyway
so
are we finally at the point where we can
say that politics is
rarely about politics
it's almost entirely about mental
illness isn't it
it's almost entirely mental illness
because the stuff we talk about is the
stuff that's interesting
what is interesting well what's
interesting is you know when some far
right or far left group does something
because everybody in the middle is busy
being boring that's what makes us
average we're all boring in the middle
but the two extremes cause all the news
they're the ones who drive the news and
it's all mental illness it's mental
illness the the trans debate is mostly
mental illness but there's a core of
real people who have real issues and
you know I wish them the best and hope
they can get all the support they need
and I hope they don't get discriminated
and all that but it looks like it's
mostly mental illness mostly
so it's
um
you know some form of uh Mass hysteria
persuasion
parental effect but I don't want to take
away from the fact that there are real
people I think as far as I know there
are real people with gender dysphoria
and they should not be they should not
be thrown under the bus just because
other people are a different situation
so I want to show some empathy there but
it's clearly
um
the parth is real is really concealed by
the part this mental illness at this
point
all right um
try to bursts
here's some numbers you already know
that the population is a problem in
China population collapse
and also the U.S but here's the numbers
that were kind of shocking I saw today
um Chinese births have gone from around
18 million a year in 2016.
and that's when the one child policy was
scrapped in in China
and now it's below 10 million
to hold that in your head for a moment
when it was 18 million
they immediately stopped the program
because they had a danger of destroying
the country because there weren't enough
birth that's a 18 million it's at 10
million now and they don't do
immigration do they do they China
doesn't do immigration except
do they never right right so
the U.S
weirdly as a robust immigration program
which has kept us you know above the
replacement level but the U.S has the
same problem listen to this
um about 3.7 million babies who were
born in the U.S in 2022.
now that's not much unchanged from 2021
right so it's not that different from
2021 just down a little but it's down 15
from the peak in 2017.
however our population keeps growing
because we're you know adding a lot of
immigration
uh robust isn't the right word try
virulent
uh oh somebody's saying that I'm the
only channel that YouTube
has a problem with I don't know about
that I think other people would have
said it
all right
so yeah not enough bursts
uh Vivek ramaswamis making some news
talking about Ukraine it is very clear
that it's not an American priority
and what he would do as president would
he would freeze the borders the way they
are which would give you know Russia
control of some stuff they didn't have
before the war
and uh
he would agree to not support NATO for
Ukraine
in return and
not in return but these are things they
would give Russia to stop the war or he
would
um and you would ask Russia to break its
ties or his military deals not his ties
but his military deals with China
what do you think of that
day one the fake becomes president and
by the way I think Trump would do
something similar
now Trump hasn't said the details he
just said he'd stop it on the first day
by threatening both of them but would
this stop the war
would freezing the borders
um
probably freezing them after Russia gets
control of all the Russia territories
because I tweeted today a an opinion
that says Russia is totally winning they
have all the artillery in men and that's
all you need
basically that's the whole story more
artillery more men
we're done here they're going to win
now
maybe I'm not sure I buy into that yet
but it's a reasonable hypothesis
and it looks like Russia has a good
chance of capturing all of the
russian-speaking territories
do you think it would be the worst thing
in the world
if Russia captured all of the
russia-speaking territories in Ukraine
and just kept them
how would that affect you
it wouldn't affect you at all
Not only would it not affect you you'd
probably see it as the end of the war
because there's some uh there's some
beliefs that Russia doesn't want the
rest of Ukraine because it would be too
hard to manage it it's ethnically
different it's going to be a pain in the
ass but they probably could manage to
control the russian-speaking territories
I know I I feel like Ukraine maybe needs
to lose a little bit more territory
so that Russia has something to
negotiate with
and then I think we're done but I don't
think it's a war anymore
would you agree can I get you to agree
with that it's no longer a war that
we're in advanced negotiations because
it doesn't look like there's going to be
any gigantic territorial change there'll
be little ones but maybe nothing
gigantic
yeah we'll see anyway nothing's nothing
is predictable there but
we'll see
um test of your intelligence put your
intelligence
hat on
that's correct
I got the right answer before I asked
the question
that is correct 25 percent do you want
to hear the story
you got the answer the answer is 25
percent
and the question is what percentage of
Democrats want Biden to run
25 percent of Democrats will abide in to
run
what are they saying that we're not
saying
it's such a consistent number if you're
new to the channel 25 is what I say
uh is the percentage of Americans who
get every question wrong it's a
different 25 for each question but 25
will get every question wrong
very consistent
all right
um so the
the Ukraine County offensive has begun
or or not because apparently if you were
a Ukraine counter-offensive person the
last thing you want to talk about is the
counter offensive it's like Fight Club
so they might be starting but they might
not be maybe yes maybe no
but there is fighting of course
uh and there's one theory that they're
going to try to cut off the land bridge
to Crimea
we'll see Russians say they've already
already repelled the counter-offensive
and you believe nothing about that area
as you should
all right
now the most important thing I wanted to
do today was oh I have one story I
forgot before we get to the Whiteboard
um there are did you know there are over
90 reparation committees that have been
created in the U.S since the death of
George Floyd in 2020.
so apparently the death of George Floyd
created calls for reparations
do you know why there were 90 of them
after George Floyd died but maybe fewer
none before that
what changed it
what changed it was that after George
Floyd died you couldn't say anything to
black people anymore
so criticism against anything that any
black person wanted to do just went away
so everybody was like how about
reparations and then all the white
people said
uh I'm out
I'm out I got nothing to say leave me
alone leave me alone
so as long as you've got no pushback and
as long as white people are willing to
lie to you you can create 90 reparations
committees that collectively have
created
not a lot of reparations I think there
was one example wasn't there was it
Minnesota or something
but I think there was one
one actual reparations happened but not
enough people collected it it didn't
exactly work out
yeah some people got paid but that it
was hard I think it was difficult to
prove that you were eligible
so there weren't many people getting
taking advantage of it
you know somebody says they know a white
guy named George Floyd
oh that's got to be terrible
wow
so again I would say one of the biggest
problems for uh Black Americans is that
they've trained white Americans to lie
to them about anything important
would you agree
that black people have taught white
people to just lie to them oh yeah
reparations totally go do that like
that's really going to happen
it's just nothing but lying but if you
want us to lie to you all right I guess
we will
all right now let me show you on the
Whiteboard
uh how to how to identify a hoax
how to create a good hoax and then I'm
going to predict the summer hoax
right there's always a summer hoax for
Trump
so we'll start with how to create a good
hoax
right if you were if it was your job
to do a dirty trick and create a trump
hoax
what criteria what do you use I would
use first the Tucker rule Tucker Carlson
you remember the Tucker rule that
whatever the Democrats are doing
themselves
they will blame you off
so rule number one The hoax has to be
something that Democrats are doing
that's sketchy that they're going to
accuse the other side of doing so it has
to have that quality accusing you of
what they're doing
it needs to be unverifiable
the alternative to that is a video that
they can clip right so there's two kinds
of main hoaxes they use against hoax
against Trump one is the anonymous
source
and uh the other is uh the anonymous
source goes along with I've seen
something that you haven't seen oh yeah
I was in this gif and I saw something
secret that you can't see but oh it's
bad always bad until you see it it's not
so the unverifiable sources are uh good
because all summer long the pundits can
say well we don't know what's true but
if
if the reports are true that he urinated
on a hooker's bed
if they're true and so all summer long
when it's slow news you could have if
it's true stories so that's the other
requirement
now um as you know
a good hoax would play to people's
biases
what do I mean by that well remember
when Trump was running the first time
yeah and even when he was president the
claim against him was he was a big old
racist
so the best kind of hoax would be a hoax
that shows him looking racist that's
what the fine people hoax was so the
fine the fine people hoax
was to play to the bias oh you already
think he thinks this way so we'll create
a hoax by leaving out some of the video
that makes him look like he was praising
neo-nazis of course he wasn't if there's
anybody here who still thinks that
really happened
you need to do your homework
right there was no he never called any
neo-nazis find people in the real world
he said the opposite the video was
edited to make it to reverse it now
likewise do you remember when the
pandemic hit and the big complaints
about Trump was what was the biggest
complaint about Trump when the pandemic
hit
well he's not a science guy right he
yeah what does he know about science
so you need a hoax that plays to the
bias that Trump doesn't know enough
about science
so they did the drinking bleach Oaks oh
yeah he recommended drinking bleach
which of course never happened nor did
he recommend ingesting a household
cleaner of any kind that never happened
he was talking about light therapy that
was a thing it was added to take out the
light part and so people thought he was
talking about drinking bleach
so whatever the new hoax will be
it's going to be Tucker rule it's going
to be unverifiable or
or it's a video that they added
misleadingly Could Be the One
uh it plays to the bias so you're
already the the people who don't like
Trump would already be primed to accept
it because Ah that's what we thought
that is exactly what we thought he was
like
and
here's the best one
it should be designed to remove a trump
advantage
what would be an example that
well I would say that a trump Advantage
would be his ability to work with Putin
wouldn't you say Trump's ability to get
along with Putin would be a trump
advantage
but you can take that away by saying
that he's actually colluding with with
Russia so you don't just say it didn't
happen
you don't you don't just say oh that's
not a good idea that he's he could get
along with Putin you go right at it you
say oh it's not only a bad idea but he's
colluding with Russia he's an actual you
know treasonous present
right so
given all these things can you predict
what the uh what the hoax will be this
summer
you should because it already started
Trump is trying to help Iran
with secret documents that would be bad
for uh bad for uh Israel
who's the prime minister of Israel right
now who's the prime minister of Israel
Benjamin Netanyahu
who gets along with Benjamin Netanyahu
better than any president
Trump trump and Netanyahu are are
classic Buddies
so if you are if you're the Democrats
you want to put some distance between
Trump and Netanyahu but also Trump in
Israel you'd like you'd like Jewish
voters in the United States to say oh
that Trump guy he's kind of anti-israel
but Trump is the most pro-israel
president of all time
and the only way they could take that
away from them is with hoax
so they're going to have to come up with
a hoax that a document you can't see but
somebody did oh yeah if it's what we
think it is if if those boxes we don't
know for sure but if
if those boxes have an Iranian attack
document and if he took that it was to
give it to Iran
because he's not really on Israel's side
what do you think
and already we're seeing it right I'm
not making if I had made this up you
know just a few months ago you would
have said that's crazy come on that's
just crazy yeah and he also had the
success with the Abraham Accords so but
it's already happening this is literally
in the news already that there was some
Iranian attack document that's really
the one that's sensitive in these
Mar-A-Lago boxes oh sure maybe the other
stuff was just souvenirs but oh oh the
Iranian attack document that you've
never seen and it can't be confirmed and
it's not even in this gift so anybody
can look at it and say what they saw oh
but what if it exists what if
ladies and gentlemen I give you
the summer Trump hoax
now I hope you've also learned how to
make a hoax
I'm giving the DNC ideas no I'm not you
don't think they thought of this
that this is the classic Trump hoax and
they always do it in the summer
ideally they want to do it in the summer
because there's nothing else to talk
about so people will just talk about
this all summer long
uh you have to admit
you have to admit this is good hoax
spotting
you've seen all the hoaxes you know how
they do it but now I've pulled it
together so you can see all the elements
of it and by the way you might see a lot
more of this
I mean this might not be the one you see
you'll probably see lots of them
and that is why you follow me because
you won't see that on CNN
or MSNBC
you're welcome
all right
um there wasn't really much news today
it was all just repeat news
there's more drone attacks in Ukraine or
something I don't know
were drone attacks
um
Iran has been kind of quiet lately
haven't they
don't you think
uh
there's still some people who are
arguing about whether those hoaxes are
hoaxes I would like you to reveal
yourself
uh on YouTube I know on on the locals
Channel they're better informed so they
don't believe any of those hoaxes but I
want to see if there's anybody at
YouTube who actually believes that Trump
called the neo-nazis fine people
we won't even argue about it today I
just want to see if anybody actually
believes that
just reveal yourself in the comments
anybody who actually thinks those words
came out of his mouth and that that was
the meaning of those words
oh this is interesting it's a wall of
nose so you don't want to admit it do
you if there's anybody there who still
believes that hoax it'd be kind of
embarrassing at this point
okay well there's not a single person on
YouTube saying they believe it
are you surprised
could I can I take a minute to Pat
myself in the back for that
how in the world did I pull that off I
mean I wasn't doing it alone but you
know got a lot of help from Steve Cortez
and Joe Pollock and a number of you who
are retweeting stuff but that took a
long time to kill that hoax didn't it
all right
how about the next one how many of you
believe that the president suggested
injecting some kind of a disinfectant
that was maybe liquid or chemical
like into your body how many people
think that actually happened in the real
world that you suggested
you did so and Andy says he did all
right so we have a Believer there
now Andy uh and Sample says true so you
you've never seen that debunked
yeah but I want to ask yourself ask
yourself do you feel smart
for believing that any president whether
it was Trump or anybody else suggested
injecting bleach in front of a crowd
just just think about it as if you'd
never heard the story before I won't go
through the whole detail of how they
faked it but the the clip is edited so
he doesn't talk about light
so he mentions light they cut that out
in the front and then he goes back to
light to make sure that they knew he was
talking about light and they cut off the
clarifications so if you saw the clip
without the clarifications it looks
exactly like
he wants to inject a chemical into your
body
but ask yourself this
do you really believe
that a president of the United States
any president Trump any president
would have gone up in public and
suggested putting a disinfectant into
your arm that wasn't light because the
light therapy was actually being tested
do you really think that
that like where were you convinced by
your fellow Democrats that he was so
dumb and so unscientific and so reckless
that he would actually go in front of
the public and suggest a radical medical
treatment
that couldn't possibly be smart
yeah but so don't you don't even need to
go and research how they did the fake
just ask yourself how you ever believed
that in the first place
because that's the amazing part the
amazing part you see you ever believed
it in the first place
to me that was just shocking when it
happened
how about the one where he mocked the
guy with uh the guy with a disability
with a bad arm how many of you believe
he mocked a guy
with a bad arm by doing an impression of
having a bad arm himself how many think
that actually happened in the real world
I see one yes
because you saw it on video right if you
saw it on video there's there's no
questions is there
I'll tell you how that one was done
that's also a hoax
almost none of you this is weird
so most of you do not believe it
he kind of did no he kind of did not
he kind of did not
now what you don't know is that he did
that same mocking
you know arm impression a number of
times before that just when he was
talking about dumb people it's his
standard dumb people oh he does that
when he's talking about dumb people
now did you know that
the the people who believed that he had
really mocked the guy with the bad arm
did you know that that's his standard
way of mocking people no matter what
their arm looks like did he know that
and did you really think that the
president United States mocked a
disabled guy in a speech
you should ask yourself why did you ever
believe that happened
that that should have been ruled out on
the surface
you never should have had to think about
that
it's kind of amazing uh you know once
we've got some distance from the old
Trump era and we're going to look back
and we're going to laugh so hard at what
the Democrats have made people believe
and actually believed they actually
believed he mocked a disabled guy while
running for president
praised neo-nazis
who were literally chanting anti-semitic
you know stuff that he would have
actually praised them on TV actually
believe that and that he suggested
injecting uh like household
disinfectants
you really have to ask yourself
how far in Trump derangement syndrome
you were if you believed any one of
those from the start from day one if you
believed any of it you have to ask
yourself how gullible you are
I didn't believe any of it not not one
of those things sounded right to me when
I heard that doesn't sound right it's
obviously something wrong with that
story
but I saw Greg says
yeah the the people who said but I saw
it with my own eyes or heard it with my
own ears you're you're the most lost
if you think you saw it and heard it
you're really really lost
because you did see it and you did hear
it but it was fake
you saw what you saw it was just a
edited to to deceive you
if you look at the original transcripts
you can tell
all right
you never use the word bleach yeah but
even even disinfectant was fake news as
well
um
and PJ says in all capitals Scott I
suppose he never said he could shoot
someone on Fifth Avenue how was that
edited
BJ is that outrageous
was that an outrageous thing to say now
did you believe it was literal
is that your problem do you believe he
literally said I think I could choose
somebody and get away with it
and you believed it because you you took
it at the time to mean literally shoot
somebody right
PJ would you like to admit that that you
believed that that was literal
I'd like you to see that say that in
public that you believed he actually
meant that in the real world
go ahead come up BJ you're you're
yelling at me in all caps I'm sure
you're not shy come on come on tell us
you really believe that come on PJ
come on PJ you could do it tell us you
really believed it
all right
uh
somebody says Scott some people's use
all caps because they old and can't see
okay
good enough
all right so ladies and gentlemen uh is
there anything else you'd like to talk
about talk about mgg's tweet about feds
posing as white nationalist
demonstrators yeah so there's a new
group of supposed White supremacists
yeah all these stories look alike to me
so I I choose to uh treat them as
they're all one big hoax it's just all
the same hoax
and the hoax says that there are all
these uh active and vital white
supremacy groups
they can muster like 12 people
and they all look like feds
and you know some people said I saw a
complaint on Twitter where somebody said
they're all in good shape so they
couldn't possibly be you know white
supremacists
and then and somebody countered that by
saying are you telling me that white
supremacists couldn't be in good shape
well yeah I suppose I could
it could be in good shape but I've got a
feeling that the uh the white
supremacists in that group were at least
at least half feds
when you see the number of Feds that are
part of every uh
every uh
radical organization
it's kind of hilarious I have to admit
they do a good job of infiltrating
they're good infiltrators
and no tattoos yeah and people keep
saying that the that the so-called white
supremacists have no tattoos
is that a thing
would you agree that that is evidence or
not
it would it be fair to say that white
supremacists are universally armed
tatted
are their arms all full attacks is that
I mean I don't I guess I don't know any
white supremacists because I don't even
know how to how to judge that myself
uh some well I would certainly expect
that if you saw a group of 20 white
supremacists in short sleeved shirts
you would see some tattoos
but it's also possible since they they
were wearing masks
all right well let me take the other
side of this well I'm going to take the
other side for a moment they were
wearing masks which suggests they don't
want their identity identity to be known
would that be the same reason that they
would not show their tattoos if they had
any
because the tattoos are pretty
identifiable
so it could be that it's just they're uh
the ones who have tattoos don't
participate because they'd be wearing
short sleeve shirts and the ones who
don't have them on their arms are there
because they can't be identified
next time they'll plug fake tats on
there maybe
huh
do any of you know a white supremacist
watch this
so almost all of you are right-leaning
do any of you know a white supremacist
I don't know one
yeah all I see are knows I see only
knows
Now isn't it amazing to you that the
Democrats and Biden have decided that
the biggest risk to the country is white
supremacy
and none of us even know one and and
this audience is very right-leaning and
you don't even know one
you met one
all right so somebody says they met one
Patrick says he is one
I don't believe it
so out of the white supremacist explain
uh Asian American performance in schools
how do they explain that
I don't think there are any white
supremacists there are definitely people
who want white people to be left alone
and then they get called White
supremacists but the reason they want to
be left alone is in part because they
don't want to compete
I I think the whole supremacist part
that went away a long time ago
I mean because what do they do are they
looking at the NBA and saying I can play
like that no
are they looking at
you know the people enrolled in higher
education and saying well I could have
done that
no no I mean it must be pretty obvious
that there are groups that are far out
performing the white supremacists
themselves
yeah have they not noticed
they haven't noticed that the way people
are not killing it in every category
how do you not notice that
I don't think there are white
supremacists anymore I believe that
there are people who think white people
are maybe somewhere in the middle
you know somewhere in the middle on all
the different categories of things you
could be and that's it but they'd rather
be left alone
now I don't agree with them you know and
in their General philosophy but I've
never heard of one who thought they were
actually Superior
I've never heard of that
all right
they're just low-key
I don't know you say you've met one I
feel like I would have met one somewhere
along the line I would have met at least
one
but who's going to stand right in front
of you and say oh yeah white people do
better in academics than Asian Americans
and Indian Americans and
some types of Jewish Americans who who's
going to say that
there's nobody who believes that
yeah I think it's over
it's imaginary
you met one many years ago yeah no even
Nick fuencies
you do you think that Nick Fuentes
believes that white people do better in
uh let's say in school than Asian
Americans
do you think Nick Fuentes believes that
no he doesn't
no
uh
all right well enough about that
is there anything else we need to talk
about that I haven't mentioned yet
did I forget anything
please Biden is what yeah he's mentally
incompetent of course
f-16s
they seem minor
all right I think we've done it all
so ladies and gentlemen thank you for
joining on YouTube I'm going to talk to
the locals people for a few minutes
glad you were here see you tomorrow
