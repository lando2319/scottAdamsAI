good morning there
everybody why is a Regular Show come
after the
pre-show I have not figured out whether
the the locals feed is upside
down must be a reason for it
[Music]
let's get my
microphone let's get it all
together good morning everybody and
welcome to the highlight of human
civilization it's called coffee with
Scott Adams Saturday
edition it's really the same as all the
other editions but if you'd like to take
this experience up to levels that nobody
could possibly understand all you need
for that is a M Glass of tanker chel a
canteen sugar flask vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure of the dope IM Meed
of the day thing makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous Sip and it
happens now
go oh my
goodness sometimes the Sip is just
perfect it's a perfect sip shall we
check in with the
news I fixed my typo on my comic this
morning you'll be happy to know so if
you saw it with a typo it's already
fixed for those those of you
subscribing well on the Howard Stern
Show uh Joe Biden went on there and I
was reading a post by Greg price he was
summarizing some of the things that
Biden said on that show now I remind you
that Biden ran for president in part on
the Charlottesville FKS but also in part
because you couldn't have a lying
president no no you you can't have a
lying president you know like that mean
old Mr Trump you need a a president that
tells the truth every single time he
opens his mouth for
example um some of the things that Biden
told us truthfully is that he saved six
people from drowning as a
lifeguard okay that's a lie
uh but he did say he received what he
calls salacious pictures from women in
the 70s that he handed over to his
secret
service which he didn't have because he
was a Senator then and they don't have
Secret Service so that's a lie but okay
but this next one is
true he was arrested as a kid while
standing with a black family on their
porch as people were protesting deseg
okay that's a definitely a lie you don't
really get arrested for standing on a
porch standing on a porch with black
people he got arrested uh but but this
next one I'm sure is true that he was a
runner up in State scoring in football
okay that's definitely a lie all right
so everything he said was a
lie uh including the main thing he ran
on the the Charlottesville hoax but he's
also posting that Trump said that uh you
shouldn't that you should drink bleach
so basically 100% of everything Biden's
ever said is a lie and Democrats are so
happy they want to reelect
them so that's how that
works well General Mike Flynn has a
documentary that I believe is available
now so it's available this
weekend um I think it's named
Flynn is on
YouTube uh but if you just look for the
Flynn documentary it'll pop up somewhere
and here's what he says he says after
seven years of Silence I'm ready to
release my story to the public and you
won't want to miss
it the most shocking documentary of 2024
he says it's time to take our country
back now let me tell you the thing that
always was a mystery to me with the
general Flynn story so you know the
story that he got accused of some
Russian collusion stuff that was
completely made
up
and uh he ended up pleading guilty to
something because they threatened to put
his son in
jail that really
happened now during and then then his
attorney gets disbarred or something
right Sydney Powell so basically just
the worst things happen to this guy and
I'll tell you the thing that always
puzzled me the
most so here's a general
presumably any general in the US Army
has learned a lot about military tactics
is that fair to say or there some
generals that don't learn that they all
learn military tactics right kind of
basic for if you're a general and I'm
watching General Flynn go on Total
Defense for seven
years and I said to myself how in the
world are you a general in the military
and you go on defense for seven
years like what's up with that he he's
probably the least competitive person
who is being the most abused in the most
obvious way for the longest time and
said the least about it I mean he did
speak out about it but I felt like it
was the weakest push back you could ever
see I now have a new theory about
this I think it is tactics I think that
when he was in his initial bad situation
he realized that the entire intelligence
community and the Democrats and the
Press were against him and he couldn't
win if you're good at tactics you don't
fight the battle you can't win you pull
back and you
wait and you
wait and you
wait and you
wait and then you wait and then you
 kill everybody who did that to
you but you wait until the time is
right I've got a
feeling the time is right and you might
be seeing a you know a US train General
going on the
offense after waiting for seven years
for the right time oh this is the right
time oh this is the right time because
everything that you couldn't say
seven years ago you can say now at least
on some places right so our entire U
architecture of what is believable
what's true who did what to whom it's
all different now and he can come right
out and
say the bad things that happened for the
first time and it will be believable and
it will be additive to Trump's campaign
because the timing will be perfect and
and I don't know he he might be a
brilliant tactician and you're just
watching him play out in real
time so I don't know I mean I don't know
him well enough I don't know the
situation well enough but this is the
only way I can explain a a somebody
who's got military
training playing you know such a uh soft
first part of the game I think he's
going to go hard now
and I think it's going to be fun to
watch anyway so it's called the Flynn
make sure you see
it uh Dustin musk witch I believe he was
one of the Facebook Founders was it
Facebook Dustin MTS he's one of those
you know original founder
types and uh he went after Elon Musk
saying that Elon Musk and Tesla were
lying about some things and that when it
all came
amount uh that that musk would go to
jail and he he's saying that Tesla is
like a the Enron of
companies uh Elon Musk saw that and
responded on a post and I quote what a
 okay that was the entire
post now remember I said that
everything's different seven years later
with the the Flyn story here's something
else is different Elon Musk can say what
a on social media and there won't
really be any push back and if there is
nobody gives a a
grap so but of course you know it was
just off fan comment it's not like he's
going to uh double down or anything oh
he did Double Down okay uh so Elon
followed up with a
clarification because you know it's sort
of a
improper impolite thing to say in public
so so he softened it later and I I guess
that's a good thing he said what I meant
to say is that he is a pompous idiot
who's head is so far up his own ass that
he's legally blind I wish him the best
and hope that someday we can be
friends so now who just ask I would
like let me read it again and you tell
me who is influencing
uh Elon musk's tweeting style what I
meant to say is he's a pompous idiot
who's headed so far up his own ass he
legally blind I wish him the best I hope
that Sunday we can be
friends that's pure
Trump in fact it's almost Trump like one
day before that when Trump was making
fun of Bill bar and he said that you
know he'd called Bill bar you know five
different bad names but because Bill bar
backed him for president he was going to
remove lethargic
but only lethargic from his list of
insults and then mosus I hope that
someday we could be
friends classic yes
classic
anyway one of the things that must said
on a conference call is that I've said
this before that the robot portion of
Tesla could be the biggest part and I
think he's totally right at the end of
the year he thinks he'll have robots
doing some factory work and maybe in
2025 you might get your own robot so um
um I should tell you I have a Tesla
stock so just full disclosure and I have
it primarily because of the robot
play so I'm not you know I'm not
convinced that Tesla the electric car
company is the end all be all of
businesses especially with prices coming
down and you know all kinds of stuff so
it's very unpredictable business but the
robot business does honestly look like
the biggest thing I've ever seen and if
you had to bet on somebody being able to
manufacture robots in America I would
bet on musk and you know do you know
what the biggest um change is that's
coming China is in
trouble because the only reason that we
have anything manufactured in China um
besides lower environmental standards I
suppose is that their labor is
cheap but if you start making everything
with robots maybe not the kind that walk
around but you know robot arms and robot
Factory lines and stuff you can make
everything just the same price in
America and then you can get rid of the
shipping and delay that you would have
with China So in theory the robot
Revolution should put china out of
business as a manufacturing entity it it
should all become local because it just
make sense to do it locally you don't
have to ship it as
far so yeah robots robots are
everything um so Biden has uh created an
AI Advisory
board so he's invited the the leaders of
all the big AI companies except uh oh
one there's one leader of a major AI
company that was left off The Advisory
Board Elon
Musk yep yeah if you're uh if you're the
government in the United States and you
want to make one of these really big
decisions that affects
civilization you you leave Elon Musk out
of The Advisory
Board don't you think he'd get a better
result if he left everybody else out and
just had one person on The Advisory
Board it was just
musk I feel like that would have been a
better play than to be the only one left
out what what exactly are they watching
or seeing or hearing that makes them
think that Elan musk is the one they
don't want to listen to about
AI maybe he's the only one you should
listen to
maybe that's such a bizarre Choice
obviously it's political
all right uh Biden Administration was
going to ban menthol
cigarettes but they've decided to put
that on hold because it would make black
voters
angry so instead of saving the lives of
black voters I suppose he's going to get
their vote
first and uh maybe try to save their
lives for after
that everything about a government is
immoral every single thing about it is
just in
moral so let's see uh so Biden's plan is
to ban Tik Tock to make all the young
people mad ban menthol cigarettes
because I didn't know this but
apparently uh black cigarette smokers
like menthol
cigarettes I was I was not aware of that
but um yeah so everything's just like
you think so Trump is uh brilliantly
working his New York lawfare situation
and he met uh was it this morning or
yesterday uh early in the morning with a
bunch of construction workers at a big
construction site and it was
pandemonium um big crowd lots of
cheering and they were very happy to see
him and I'm I'm loving watching Trump
take back New York because I feel like
New York expelled him I mean in essence
it
did and watching him take back the state
if if he can actually push this into uh
Republican control which I don't think
but the fact he's going for it is just
wonderful I love the fact that when
there's a direct attack on Trump he
never
Retreats he he just finds the the higher
ground it's like oh you're going to come
after me with your little Das I'm going
to take your old
State I just love that I just love that
I I it feels like oh remember when Obama
was mocking Trump at that uh what was it
the reporters event that they do and you
saw Trump just sitting there taking the
mocking humiliation and instead of just
mocking and humiliating Obama back he
took the
presidency it feel this feels like the
same play we're gonna we're gonna pester
you to death with our
Das okay I'll take your whole state
thank thank you very much and that's
what he's trying to do can he do
it it would be quite a
r but do I think that he he read the the
room correctly yes I think he did uh I
believe so remember I'm from New York
state right so I I grew up in Upstate
New York so I feel it's been a long
time uh and Upstate is different than
New York City but I feel
like I feel like it's his
time it feels like the good let me tell
you about New Yorkers Upstate I can't
really speak for the city it's a whole
different deal but the the average you
know rural Upstate New York
person they don't like a lot of
 they they don't like a lot of
 and they've been seeing a lot
of
 and I think they're just done
yeah I think they probably reached their
limit of so I think his timing
is
perfect here's a good sign of the times
uh do you know Paul Graham of Y
combinator and he's one of the big big
names in uh the business World
especially in the tech world so if
you're not familiar with him it's
important that you know he's one of the
most famous you know
entrepreneur uh type people and why
that's important is that uh he just
posted this he said uh something I
didn't realize when I was a kid
institutions can Decay institutions seem
so permanent but it turns out that uh to
be very easy for them to drift from
their original Mission but here's the
interesting part here's the ones he
mentions as institutions that have
drifted from their original Mission and
become bad basically he lists the ACLU
the New York Times the Better Business
Bureau the
ADL and NPR he says none of them are
what they
were now I of course weighed in and said
that it's hard to pick a worst but I
would pick the ADL as the worst but here
is what I would consider the sign of the
times I don't think that a year ago you
would have said in public that the ADL
is a corrupt terrible
organization one year ago
but now it's just a
comment and now now it's sufficiently
obvious or
sufficiently you know talked about that
somebody who has a you know positive
reputation in the world just an ordinary
business person who I don't even know if
he's left or right honestly I don't know
if he votes democrat or republican can't
tell because when he talks about stuff
he's just talking about them in a
logical way which kind of hides your
political iCal feelings if you're just
talking factually so I have no idea if
he's left or right but I I I assume he's
somewhere in the
middle but the fact that he can just
casually say the ADL is
spoiled is a really good sign so I made
sure that I double dunked on the ADL by
suggesting that they might be the worst
of the bunch to make you stop and debate
who's really the
worst because I want you to pause on
that and think hm what is worse the New
York Times or the ADL or the NPR it's
the ADL they're much
worse there's a new study in Japan if
you believe any data in any studies and
you probably shouldn't it says uh there
were 115,000 excess deaths following the
third Co shot
W what so the study shows that there was
basically a bunch of aggressive
Cancers and uh they came after the co
shot now does that mean it's
true it
might might mean it's true but the
larger picture today is that data is
pretty much all
unreliable yeah pretty much all data
about everything is unreliable from
economics to science to health it's all
unreliable so would I be worried about
this study
yes I would love to see the studies
about the second Co shot because I
noticed a lot of the studies are
focusing on the the third and fourth
boosters but I'd like to know is it is
it like really bad after two and three
is even worse or is two you know sort of
average bad but not the worst thing in
the world but by the time you get to
that third booster is that the one
that's going to take you out I mean
according to the study
but uh again I'm not sure you should
believe in any
studies so there's that if it if if
there are lots of studies that all point
in the same direction then
yes well Christy
gome has made some news I guess she's
got a book out and one of the things she
talks about is shooting her own
dog guess they had a dog on the ranch
and it was killing animals and it was
poorly behaved and it didn't look like
it could be fixed so she killed her dog
it's not that unusual she's killed a
goat she killed a couple of horses she's
killed a lot of
stuff she's killed a lot of stuff
now what she was apparently going for by
telling this these stories and doubling
down on them is that uh she's lived this
you know tough farmers's life where she
had to make tough choices and don't you
wish you know you aren't you glad it
wasn't you now I don't have an opinion
about whether that dog could be trained
or whether it was dangerous and whether
she put it out of his misery before it
bit a child and maybe it would have I
don't know so I don't have an opinion on
the detail I'll just talk about the Pol
politics of
it um her her political career is
largely
over I mean except maybe she could be
Governor again but she's not going to be
vice president after saying she killed
the dog because nobody's going to be
able to say anything
else I mean it's basically Romney
putting his dog on the
roof and you know I don't think anybody
could ever forget
that yeah so it looks like a lack of
empathy for animals even though it
probably wasn't right so I'm not
criticizing her for what what she did CU
I don't know the
details you know maybe if I knew the
details I would but I don't so I'm not
criticizing on the details I'm just
saying politically it's I mean it's just
devastatingly
bad it's all I'll ever for I won't think
of anything else when I see her for the
rest of her career I will only think of
that when I see her I don't know about
the rest of you but that will never
leave my
head it's a bad
mistake
so so Biden wants to uh you know
increase the capital gains STX and
you've heard about this I don't think it
can pass because it's so it's so
absurdly uh rapacious I mean the the
fact that people would work all their
lives and have their little Nest EG and
then the government would say you know
what I think we'll just take like 40% of
it after you work all your life for the
purpose of having that money now do you
know how hard it is to spend money after
you've made
it now I say this because I have a
little
extra yeah I've made more than I've
spent so far yeah here here are some of
the things you can't
do you can't give your money away to
somebody who needs it did you know
that it it's illegal just to give you
you'd have to pay taxes on the money you
give
away so if you've got uh let's say uh
let's say you've got an adult child and
they need some extra help for any reason
you maybe they had a medical problem or
something and you give them money yeah
if it goes over the gift if it goes
first of all if it's below a certain
amount it could be called the gift but
you still have to do the taxes you still
have to record it and the reason you do
that is that I believe that becomes uh
an implication in your
estate so the reason you record it
just so that later they can ding you I
think um but you can't give your money
away you have to pay taxes to give your
money
away now I've got money in the stock
market and um almost all of the money
that I have now is stock
gains meaning that I spent all the money
that just sort of I made that I didn't
invest but I invested well so you know I
have stock gains
they're going to take 40% of it if I try
to cash out and just think about that
they'll take 40% of it if I just try to
use
it I mean the absurdity of that is is
crazy if I try to spend my own money
they'll take 40% of it or really 50 in
my case probably because state taxes as
well unbelievable yeah that's my fair
share my fair share is to save all of my
life and by the way I hit my savings
Target exactly like all my life I
thought okay if I have you know this
much then I'll feel like I'm comfortable
and now 40% of it just went away because
I can't spend it you know I mean I would
never I mean with that rate of Taxation
I would never even take it out I would
just keep working and just leave it
there and hope another Administration
lowers the tax rate it would be crazy it
would be crazy to remove money under
that that tax scheme I would just keep
it there as long as I
could all right so I don't think that
can get pasted but oh my goodness um you
can't even use your own money after you
earn
it so there's more information that the
uh these college protests the Hamas
Palestinian protests are funded by
Soros but it's not clear that Soros you
know wanted them to do any protesting
it's just that there are a lot of Soros
organizations and then they make their
own decisions after they get the money
and probably a lot of it's going toward
this but there's also thought that some
other the money is coming from the
Middle
East
and I saw some suggestion that you know
Soros wanted maybe wanted these protests
to happen I don't know about that
because I see Soros as joined at the hip
with uh the Democrats and with our
CIA now that's that's my current world
view it could be wrong but my current
world view is that the only way to
explain Soros is he's part of that
Atlantic Council CIA intelligence you
know
apparatus and and also part of the
Democrat machine as
well now why would any of them want to
cause this problem in an election year
why would
Soros the CIA
um Or
democrats why would any of them want an
anti-jewish
um protest in an election year that's
like the very worst thing that could
happen to to them so there's something
going on here that doesn't make sense if
you just think Soros is funding it it's
got to be coming from yeah it's got to
be coming from the Middle East Iran or
something like that
so how in the world could we have such a
big news event and not understand who's
behind
it isn't that
weird since when do we not know who's
behind things when money's involved you
can't just look at those tents and say
all right who who's behind all this it
must be that the whole NGO money
situation is so complicated you can
never
tell well anyway
um the longer those protests go on the
better Trump's chances of winning are
so there's
that
um I saw Patrick B David had some
numbers I didn't see the source of them
but he was posting about what would
happen if Tik Tok gets banned and which
of the social media companies would
benefit from it and uh based on what I
don't know probably a survey of some
kind um meta which is mostly Instagram
for this purpose 57% of Tik Tok users
would end up at Instagram YouTube 22%
the others 15% snap
6% now how many of you think that Tik
tok's really going to get
banned now you probably saw a news event
that China was acting tough and saying
that they'd rather close it at least the
American version of it they'd rather
close it than sell it do you think they
mean
that that by Dan would rather just take
no money and just close
it I don't think they mean that because
I do think they mean they're not going
to sell the algorithm the
software but I think there somebody
could buy the
customers maybe just the customers maybe
some IP of some sort and then build
their own algorithm in there
maybe I mean or or they could just take
the customer base and just give them all
Instagram accounts if if our meta what I
would do is I would have an an
onboarding service so you could just say
here's my Tik Tok account here's my
Instagram and it just
goes and just sucks all the data over
and turns it into whatever you want it
to be so if I were meta that's what I'd
be doing I'd find a way to just take all
your data and build you a new
account um and then I would also give
them some kind of a URL or address that
would be reminiscent of their Tik Tok
account so if you knew somebody's Tik
Tok account you could for example just
take the known Tik Tock account and just
put uh IG in front of it or IG colon you
know to so then you'd be able to find it
on
Instagram but um I'm going to say that
in the end Tik Tock will remain a
Chinese company and continue operating
in the United States I don't know
how but I think that's going to
happen they have so much money I have a
feeling they get to fight for it and I
do think that they're going to hold
tight on not selling it but there is
some possibility that minutian and some
other people will buy some part of Tik
Tok I just think it's
unlikely um
Tucker is talking about uh 2020 voter
fraud in a new video and here's
something else that you can say today
that you couldn't say a few years ago
without getting in trouble the 2020
election was definitely
rigged that's what talker says now he
gives his here's his
evidence uh number one the government
was censoring information that would be
important to voters 100% true the
government was sensory thing the laptop
thing being the obvious example but but
they were censoring you know the major
platforms uh we know about Zuckerberg's
$400 million to you know tweak the uh
the
process to benefit Democrats I would
call that
ring yeah it's legal but it's
rigging and then apparently uh so Dr had
a guest who had did some kind of a
survey of people who used mail-in
ballots in the that election so he only
talked to people who did do mail-in
ballots and asked them uh they didn't
ask them did you do anything fraudulent
they asked them specific questions such
as did you do your mail and ballot from
a state in which you um did you vote in
the state where you're not a resident
and a bunch of people said yes that they
intentionally voted in a state in which
they were not resident now that's
illegal and then they were asked did you
uh sign a name for somebody else and a
bunch of people said oh yeah I signed a
name for somebody else which is
illegal and then there was
[Music]
uh did you um fill it out so not just
sign the names but did you fill out the
mail and Bellow for somebody else and
then a bunch of people said yes now I
think if you dug into this there would
be a lot of people who did it for their
spouse and their spouse was okay with it
don't you think yeah there's probably a
lot of families where one spouse really
cares about politics the other one
doesn't and the one who cares about it
is sitting at the kitchen table and says
honey do you mind if I fill out your
mail and ballot and the spouse male or
female says yeah I don't care you know
what because whatever you've looked into
I'll probably be fine with yeah just
fill out mine do you mind if I sign it
yeah just go ahead and sign it nobody's
going to
check so I don't know how much of this
Pro by the way the the result was that
uh 20% of mailin bots were
illegal based on the survey 20% of mail
in ballots would have been illegal but
illegal is a tight
standard it doesn't necessarily
mean that it wasn't the will of the
people does that make sense cuz if
you're filling out the vote for your
grandmother cuz her hands don't work but
she really liked
Biden you technically broke the law
because grandma has to fill it on
herself she has to sign it herself but
is that really the is that the law that
you care about because grandma got her
wish and she's a citizen too so I'm not
sure that this 20% is a reliable number
I'd like to you know maybe see some more
on this topic but suppose it's half of
that 10% were illegal illegal in the way
that you would care about them being
illegal that's still a lot it'd be
enough to change the election by far
yeah the spirit of the law but not the
letter of the law might be a lot of
that the um in Ohio the police have
uh are in trouble again because there's
some uh body cam footage they Ed a
53-year-old uh black
man uh who apparently they have to tell
us he's black in the story that's
important um who died after repeatedly
telling officers I can't breathe and
indeed they had a a knee on his back and
he was saying could and he couldn't he
died so now we have uh George Floyd who
died from having a knee on his back
we've got the Daniel Penny situation
where he was restraining somebody in a
headlock and and that man died also
black and then this new Ohio man died in
a similar
way
now I I would suggest this I think that
black men need a warning
label um now this might apply to other
people but I don't know yet so we could
we could extend this and it should say
something like do not hold down for two
to five minutes because they will die
now it might apply to all the other
other groups and then they should get
warning labels too but the only one we
know about are that black man apparently
die pretty easily if you hold them down
that's all I know for sure if you hold
them down they're likely to die so don't
hold the black man
down could be fatal and I believe that
they should come with warning labels
there should be something they can sew
onto a shirt says something like do not
hold down with pressure on
back um we'll die in less than a
minute yeah warning
labels meanwhile over at uh speaking of
warning labels the CEO of craft
Hinds uh is reported in the Wall Street
Journal is a health nut let me say that
again the CEO of craft Hines the maker
of
Lunchables is a health nut
and
uh some say that he might want to remake
the processed food giant to make it more
of a a healthy
situation what kind of a living hell
would that be what did this man do that
was so bad in a prior life that he's a
health nut and apparently he does live
his life you know very much in a healthy
lifestyle he fasts and he does stuff
like that but uh what kind of living
hell would be to put you as the CEO of
craft hindes when you're a health
nut what what would be another example
of something that
bad it would be
like Mother Teresa being in charge of a
military industrial
company um it would be like Greta
tunberg being the CEO of of Chevron
none of this makes sense how do you get
how do you get a health enough to be the
CEO that's going to be
trouble here's what little I know from
having worked in the food industry you
know as you you know I famously tried to
introduce a food product that would be
healthy and compete against Lunchables
and stuff like that
but uh what I learned
is you really can't get there for from
here meaning that you say to yourself
you know I'd like my food to be full of
nutrition and and good for me and not
have you know a lot of chemicals in it
you can't actually get there from here
if you made such a food nobody would buy
it nobody wants healthy food that's also
processed let me say that
again
nobody
nobody nobody nobody not one person
wants healthy food that's highly
processed and comes into package and
they're pretty much the processed food
that comes in a package
company I don't think you can make that
healthy I mean I think it's actually not
possible um if it's not like a whole
food with no no fertilizer it's probably
going to you know be a little
unhealthy I think our whole food system
is
poisoned although I did see an
interesting comment by uh Mike cernovich
he was talking about people in prison he
said the people in prison are eating all
this you know horrible processed foods
and microplastics and you know they
don't they're not getting much vitamin D
and everything but they eat two meals a
day and they sleep a lot and they
exercise and they're all in great shape
when they get at
jail which makes you doubt literally
everything you've been told about health
I was like wait a minute why are these
people who are getting out of jail
looking so good compared to the rest of
us
yeah
so processed food is poison somebody
says sort of how many of you were
listening to the uh supreme court on the
presidential immunity did anybody get to
catch any of that I'll tell you that is
so interesting the the Supreme Court
puts on a good sh show because each of
the justices asks pretty tight questions
so it's not boring and it appears that
the lawyers arguing have been trained
that they need to make their point as
quickly as possible now I don't know if
it's because the whole thing is timed or
what's going on but the lawyers talk
really fast and the and the judges are
really good at asking the you know just
insightful quick question so it's a
whole bunch of well what would happen if
the president did this well according to
FR C plus Mass plus we we have to reject
that next question so it's really fun to
watch just the the the speed of
it but uh one of the questions that
Gorsuch asked is if a president led a
nonviolent sit in let's say he just
decided to lead a nonviolent sit in in a
government office and the purpose of it
was to delay or
let's just say delay a government
process and he's like so is that a
problem a nonviolent sit
in that was a really good question
because all the other questions were
like uh what if you try to assassinate
try to assassinate the other team you
know things that we probably wouldn't
have any problem making them illegal or
treating them as illegal so that was a
good question and um I have to admit
every every time I heard you know one of
the lawyers talk they tend to convince
you because they're good lawyers and
that's why I got to the Supreme Court
but when I listen to the
um what do you what do you call the
people who uh want things to be as they
are the not the
plaintiff so the plaintiff would be
Trump's team what's the other team
what's the word for that come on all you
lawyers tell me the word the it's the
plaintiff and the petitioner there's a
petitioner what what do you call them
when they're arguing at the Supreme
Court the defendant it's not really a
defendant is
it but is it a
defense
respondent So respondent Pro respondent
okay the
respondent so the uh respondents um I
thought had a confused terrible argument
so just listening when I listened to
Trump's attorney he
sounded good and sharp and all over it
when I listened to the other team it
sounded a little confused and flailing
but I didn't hear all of it so I I just
got a little taste of both did anybody
have that same same uh impression that
Trump's team looked like they did the
better job doesn't mean the win because
you know the argument's the argument you
can't you can't make the argument better
better than the
argument um but I thought they did a
good job
yeah and I think where it needs to shake
out is that if it's a gray area the
president gets immunity meaning if it
looks like it could be part of the
official
job even if it could help him personally
that's just got to have immunity because
otherwise presidents would get picked to
death oh you started a war to defend the
country but don't you also have a hotel
nearby in the neighboring country where
all the NATO people will stay when they
visit the war zone so it's sort of for
profit isn't it Mr Trump can't you see
that it's so easy to imagine that if
there's any wiggle room in that
presidential immunity thing if there's
any wiggle room they're just going to
use it to take Trump out so you got to
get rid of all the all of that and say
all right if it's really that bad you're
going to have to to you're going to have
to impeach and if you don't impeach I
think you can't I don't think you should
prosecute after the
office so if it wasn't important enough
to get impeached I don't think it should
be important enough to prosecute after
you R of
office that should be a good standard
now I realize that sometimes you can't
impeach because you don't have the right
votes so it doesn't mean that
impeachment gives you fairness but I
feel like you have to have at least that
much control over the the weaponization
of the process so I definitely give all
of the benefit of a doubt in the gray
area to our president no matter who it
is and but it's far more important with
Trump because the the law fair
risk anyway I um
time what's that
mean all right ladies and gentlemen
that's about all I have it's a slow news
day is there any story I missed
today had Fountain Blue for his Wars
Napoleon did
okay well it has to be a successful
impeachment in terms of the Senate being
impeached in the house doesn't
count um if the president is not immune
then neither of the
Das Noah icial element
yeah all right where's mayor Pete yeah
where is Mayor
Pete um all right RFK on Bill
Mah well I did I do any Bill Mah stuff
today usually in Saturday it's all about
Bill
M so Bill M had Don Lemon
and Don Lemon was saying how he's always
he's always sort of uncomfortable
because he's black and gay so every
every space is a little uncomfortable
and Bill Maro was like
what
what how dark will politics go if Trump
gets elected probably as dark as they
can
get uh Florida will not comply with the
new Biden title nine rules oh
interesting Florida's going to go uh
they're just going to reject the rules
so remember I asked you um the
percentage of men who were in who were
in favor of trans athletes on women's
teams and I saw some uh I saw some data
about women being uh in favor of trans
athletes by more than half so more than
half of women want trans athletes on
their teams but I i' love to see the
men because I think the men would be
closer to zero I mean not zero because
it's never zero but I'll bet the men
maybe 20% would be in favor of it and
80% would be against it so to me it
looks like a problem that women have
created for themselves and men should
just stay out of
it this is another one of those
situations where women should work it
out and let us know how it went it's
women sport right it's not my
sport so first of all I should not tell
women what they should do with their
Sports whatsoever you know I I don't
want women telling me what to do with
men's sports so let the women work it
out uh but like just take the men out of
it this is one of those that men you
could just take a pass I mean if you're
a father then yes of course be involved
if it's your daughter who's in who's uh
at risk but generally speaking
let the women work it
out and right now they they approve it
by a majority so there you
go all
right um I don't have anything else to
talk about so I won't keep you uh I will
talk to the uh locals people
tonight um I'm going to try the button
to see if I can talk to the locals
people after but if it doesn't work I
will see you tonight uh in the man cave
all right everybody in uh YouTube and uh
Rumble and X thanks for joining I'll see
you again tomorrow same place same time
all right let's see if this feature
works
today locals only let's
see
nope no the button doesn't even work
today
all right that button doesn't work so
I'm going to say goodbye to all of you
thanks for being here see you
soon oh I can't even end it so even the
button to end it's not working
today so
um what am I going to do I guess I'll
kill
