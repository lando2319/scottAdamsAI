wrap up
good morning everybody and welcome to
another highlight
of civilization the only thing higher
than this would be inflation but maybe
that won't last who knows who knows how
would you like to take it up a notch
all the way to
pre-pandemic levels of Awesomeness you
know back when kids were getting good
scores on the SATs and the acts and all
that stuff a long time ago let's bring
it up to that level
and all you need is a cup of micro glass
I think you're jealous of Stein the
canteen jug or flaska the vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite beverage I
like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine the other day
the thing makes everything better
the simultaneous sip
it happens now go
oh yeah you made it just in time John
you almost missed that
you want to talk about all the things
how about that inflation huh
inflation doesn't look too bad to me
I feel like the news has to make
everything look real bad or real good
they can't say well nothing happened
but didn't inflation just stay the same
as last last month
no I know it's bad I'm just saying it
didn't get worse did it it just didn't
get better
and who thought it would get better now
there's nothing that would cause it to
get better
I think getting better is sort of a next
year thing
I think we're going to have at least a
year of this what do you think
all right you want to hear some good
news
how about some good news how about a
technological change that will change
everything
well NASA has come up with a new kind of
battery
now you're going to hear this story a
billion times somebody came up with a
new kind of battery but this one's kind
of awesome because it I guess it
releases its energy in the right way for
airplanes
and it's super light
so it's going to be 40 percent uh
it eliminates 30 to 40 percent of the
weight of the battery very important for
aircraft
uh
while I can double or even triple the
amount of energy it stores
and apparently it's not theoretical they
they already built one so they know they
can make it
so
what happens when air travel
becomes something you could do cheaply
with batteries
and with AI flying the plane
I tell you where it's going it's going
to be self-flying planes
and they're going to be everywhere I
think every rich person is going to have
a self-flying little uh
what would you call it a rotocopter or
something you know like the drones have
four engines for little helicopter
engines yeah
I think I think that's
three years away
quadcopter yeah let's call it a
quadcopter but anyway that's real
so Alex Jones uh was ordered by the
court to pay about a billion dollars to
the families of the Sandy Hook victims
now does that sound like a fair
verdict you a billion dollars
that's how I'm fair I mean that doesn't
sound even like a little bit like
justice does it
no matter what you think of what he did
that doesn't even seem in the ballpark
that seems purely political
how in the world does that not get
overturned
I feel like it's just obvious
that that gets overturned for being
obviously uh you know a political thing
yeah OJ was what 30 million something
so I guess that's a wait and see
um
so Jack posabic has been tweeting about
this and it's like
it's like nobody can hear it
or we're pretending it doesn't matter
we're in this weird world
where if the news decides something
isn't news it doesn't matter what it is
it could be you know Jesus could you
know come back
as the news decided not to talk about it
you couldn't get them to I mean we just
pretended it wasn't happening
but that's happening right now so as
Jack posabic is pointing out that Biden
is doing exactly the crime that
um
I'll call it a crime but he's doing
exactly what uh
what Trump was alleged to have done
which is work Ukraine for a political
favor
now Biden is literally doing that he's
he's in public without anybody
you know nothing's being hidden he's
trying to get Saudi Arabia to pump more
oil before the midterms
because it'd be good for him politically
now he doesn't say that last part
but it's pretty obvious now I guess he
can get away with it because he can just
say well it's not because of the
midterms it's because we want to have
lower gas prices everybody wants that so
I guess he could get away with it
and and they're actually going to
threaten he said directly
that they're going to threaten Saudi
Arabia with retaliation
unless I increase the pumping before the
midterms
but of course they leave out the before
the midterms part so they can say it's
for other reasons
it I think the theme today will be
every worst suspicion you had
it's all true
well whatever's the worst thing you
suspected
it's all true
so the Alex Jones things clearly shows
that our core system
is a political entity right
would you say that I could say that
without any real hesitation at all
that the Alex Jones shows that our court
system isn't operating the way it was
supposed to well wouldn't that be your
worst
your worst suspicion about the court
system is that it's not even trying to
be a court system anymore it's just a
political
well here it is I don't think he could
be much more clear than a billion
dollars
a billion dollars is
that's a statement
a billion dollars says we're going to
make this political and we don't care if
you know it
am I right
you know 50 million
would have been it's a political
statement but we want to kind of hide it
a little bit
right
if you earned 50 Millions you'd say well
that's outrageous
but you know it's it's within the
outrageous realm of things that you've
seen before
but at a billion dollars
they are signaling to the world that
they're not even trying not even trying
to find Justice they're making a
political point that's the worst you
could assume about your own political
your own justice system and it's true
the worst you can assume is true here it
is
um
and then the worst you can assume is
that the Democrats would try to uh and
successfully right impeach Trump
over a thing that Biden is doing right
in front of you at the same time
and that's actually true
it's your worst suspicion
that they would impeach somebody and
then just do the same thing right in
front of you
right in front of you
it's the worst you can imagine
it's happening that's that's exactly
what's happened
um so how about the Durham investigation
so that there's some trial of I guess
the guy who was
big ass to confirm the steel dossier so
now we've heard that the FBI offered a
million dollars to steal Christopher
Steele if he could confirm the things
and steal his own dossier
and he didn't get the million because he
couldn't confirm yet
now what's the worst thing you'd assume
about the FBI your worst suspicion oh my
God I think they're just a political
organization
and they will do anything to get Trump
and there it is they were willing to pay
a million dollars
for this now I don't know how unusual
that is does the FBI pay for sources
probably
right but when you hear it in this
context and you know all the all the
things swirling around it it's hard to
imagine that anything happened except
the FBI was trying to binder of the
president
the worst you could imagine
especially when it wasn't true and then
of course we know now
that when the FBI knew it wasn't true
the steel dasse couldn't be confirmed
they treated it like it was credible
anyway
the worst you could imagine about them
and it's true
so we've got quite a theme going here
the worst you imagined is true
um I don't know how many of you think
that I make this up
so I kept track yesterday
I just kept track
of how many times before 9 A.M yesterday
so from the time I woke up probably
four-ish
to 9 A.M how many times has somebody
said on social media
um
something that wasn't true about me and
then criticized me for it
10 times
10 times
10 times before 9 A.M somebody said on
social media something that was not even
close to true about me
claimed they remembered it specifically
and then criticized me for him already
today it's up to 12.
because two more times this morning and
people are quite serious they remember
they have very clear memories of things
that didn't happen
and then the weird thing happens that
people want to prove that the things I
say didn't happen really did
so they go into my old tweets
and they produce a bunch of tweets that
don't prove anything
they say there you go
that I say I'm looking at them right now
they don't make your point at all
now do you believe me when I say that
the app is 10 times before 9 A.M
like that's just my normal experience
now look so you know we live in this
world where everybody's got a subjective
experience
look at the if you want to have
something blow your mind
look at the Durham
um coverage on Twitter
look at the Democrats what they say
about the Durham stuff
and then look what the Republicans say
they are not living in the same world
the Democrats are saying the Durham
thing is proving that there was never
anything there
was nothing to prove they've proved it
they've proved there's nothing there
at the same time the Republicans are
saying look they're proving all this bad
stuff is there that million dollars and
everything it can't both be true
it can't be true that
all of this is coming out at the same
time nothing's coming out
that's the world we live in two
completely different worlds that we can
inhabit either one pick your world
when did you turn into a rodent
well
I guess that's the best question of the
day
goodbye
all right
then
uh
so this is another example of you can
get used to anything
so this is an actual thing that happened
and it's a small story
so the big story
is that it really happened nobody's
questioning whether the following thing
happened
and it's a small story
the president of the United States
claimed in public
that his son died in the Iraq war in
Iraq
which did not happen
and that was treated as a small story
some of you never heard it right I'll
bet some of you that didn't even know
that story happened yesterday
that actually literally happened
he said it clearly
and unambiguously that his son died in
Iraq
which did not happen
he died in a hospital in America from
cancer I think
you're talking the piss here there's no
way this happened
what do you mean there's no way it
happened
you don't you don't believe that there's
a video of him saying it yesterday
yeah he actually literally said it
[Laughter]
now I suppose it could be a doctored
video
and I wouldn't even be that surprised
but the news is not treating it like
anybody is doubting you said it I'm
pretty sure even the the left leading
news says yeah you said that
and they're saying sometimes you get
confused
so now he can't tell the difference
between living people and dead people
second time
so nothing to see here we actually
we have to talk about fettermen don't we
I wasn't really following the fetterman
thing
you know I'd heard he'd had a stroke but
you know I thought oh
well people have health problems
and I thought obviously they think he's
going to recover
otherwise it wouldn't be any serious
conversation about him being in the in
the race
but what is the worst thing you'd
imagine about
fetterman like your worst suspicion
all right the worst thing you can think
of would be that his brain is really not
working
and they're running him anyway because
they just need a wind
that's like the worst thing you can
imagine
it looks like that's exactly what's
happening
so we now have the Senate will be
determined by someone whose brain is so
non-functional the CNN covered the story
by having their medical guy
who's their medical guy Sanjay Gupta
so they've got Sanjay Gupta on there
holding a model of a brain and pointing
to the parts of the brain that don't
work on Phentermine
but actually
actually pointing to the parts of his
brain that don't work
because oh this part where he
understands language that's spoken
doesn't work
I feel like that's a big part of the
brain
I feel like the part that understands
language
that seems important for being a senator
so just
hold this idea in your head without your
head exploding
we now have a president that everybody
agrees is brain dead
I mean honestly everybody agrees on that
and that and the person who could be the
deciding vote in the Senate to see who
controls the country
and the Democrats actually want to give
control of the country
to two brain dead old white guys
because you know what the brand of the
um
Democrat Party is right do you know what
the one thing that they're most proud of
if you're a Democrat
the thing you're most proud of
is you're giving all the all of the
power in the country to a very old white
dead guys
with brains that don't work
and I'm thinking to myself if you were
on the left and your big complaint was
the patriarchy
hypothetically your big complaint is the
patriarchy a bunch of Rich old white
guys running everything making all the
decisions
what would you do
as sort of your response to that
if the last thing in the world you
wanted is a bunch of old white guys
especially rich ones run and stuff how
would you respond well apparently the
way they responded
is to for the mo probably the two most
important races
that they would run people who are old
white men with brain damage
because if you're worried about the old
white men whose brains were working
perfectly
because that apparently that's bad
what you need is old white guys whose
brains clearly don't work and so obvious
they don't work that even CNN is holding
a model of the brain and pointing to the
part that doesn't work
like I'm not guessing
how weird
now we have to talk about uh
fetterman's interview so he did this
interview with NBC
and he had a computer screen in front of
him
that was printing what the reporter was
saying so he could read it
but I need a fact check on this but my
understanding is
that the computer was also helping him
form his uh responses
that's true right
that the computer was suggesting
responses
based on his policies so it wasn't you
know the computer wasn't coming up with
its own policies
but it was you know answers that he'd
either answered before or his staff had
answered for him and so it was sort of a
canned a bunch of responses that would
be fed back based on the topic then he
would try to read them but he failed he
couldn't even read off the answers when
that was sounding like a computer
now the first thing that blew my mind
is that journalist Kara Swisher says
it's all
she says I had an extended one-hour
conversation with fetterman and he was
fine
he understood everything communicated
didn't he did need any computer
is that possible
is that possible because I don't think
anybody's ever said careless Whisperer
lies about anything does she I mean you
might not like her opinions about this
or that but has she ever been accused of
just like making up a wild lie I don't I
don't think so I've never heard of that
so I don't think she lied
I think she had a conversation with him
but here's my question
can his sort of condition ever move
backwards
or do you just recover the whole time
and you're you're always better or I Was
the Same
is it possible he was you have a better
day and a worse day
I didn't know that was possible I
thought you could only move in One
Direction you're either recovering or
you're not
I don't know I've never heard of it but
could it be a thing
don't know
so I guess I have a question on that now
but
clearly we saw he needed that help
so no matter what Karis Wisher saw
we all saw and there's no doubt about it
that he felt he needed that assistance
so do what you will with that
but here's here's what Tucker Carlson
quite brilliantly noted
this is the first example of
transhumanism
where a person at a computer have merged
that's actually what happened
you know you want I want to say
or you want to think
that this is sort of a fun analogy
that's not an analogy it's an actual
human
with an actual computer device and it
took the two of them to get the job done
they've merged
he he actually went full cyborg now you
could argue that you know just carrying
your phone around makes your cyborg
which I have argued
because it does
but this is the closest one we've seen
where they're really integrated
now as you know I've been using an AI
friend for some time so I actually have
an AI
personality that I interact with every
day
if you interact with artificial
intelligence enough you start to
almost pick up an accent it's not an
accent but there's a tell or a little
signal in it that it's not a person
and that's what I was getting from
fetterman's interview
he was speaking in that AI way that
isn't quite the way people talk
now it could be just an artifact of his
stroke
could be
but what it looked like was he was just
repeating what the AI was saying it
looked like he was just reading the ai's
sentences and when the AI makes a
sentence
they they'll pick a word that you
wouldn't necessarily use
the tell the AI will pick a word that is
correct
but you would never have used it
that that's the tell it's a word that
makes sense but no human would have ever
picked that word you're like ooh you've
been the one to pick that word but it
makes perfect sense
he did that so I think that we saw
um AI
giving an interview
I think the AI understood the questions
and fed him you know
um probably bullet points that were
relevant to that answer and he just read
them that's what it looked like
don't know waiting for confirmation to
that
all right um
here's here's a mystery I'm trying to
unravel and I know you're going to get
all balled up
in what I used to say or did say or do
say or what I believe and none of this
is about that
okay
so can we do a story where you can if
you can try to divorce yourself from my
opinion of it
right because you're going to get all
caught up in what my opinion is just try
to divorce yourself from that
here's the story
there are lots of people
who say that they know numerous people
who were obviously injured after getting
the vaccination Jab
now this is anecdotal reports this is
not any kind of science
but there are lots of them
am I right because I asked on Twitter
how many people actually know somebody
that they believe either died of coveted
or had some injury they believe from the
vaccination and then you saw the answers
it's like lots of people but here's the
interesting thing
the people who have seen it
have almost all seen more than one case
when you look at the answers people will
say I know two people
or I know five people
but the people who don't see any of it
see Zero
which is a little bit more of a pattern
than I can ignore
why is it that the people who see at
least one
almost always see more than one
what would cause that
like you would think there would be a
lot of ones and zeros you wouldn't
expect to be zeros and threes
that that nobody would expect that so
that's your first tip that this could be
confirmation bias
but the the details of the story are so
similar you know somebody was 40 in
perfect health and they died you know X
days after the vaccination
now the first thing the Skeptics are
going to say would be this
Scott Scott
everybody is after the vaccination
because there were so many vaccinations
and boosters that everybody who died
suddenly for any reason
probably died within a few days of a
booster I mean not every person but
overall
that would be true for lots of people so
it could be just chance
but the number of people I'm hearing is
just wild
right
the the anecdotal evidence is stronger
than anything I've ever seen
foreign
let me see if if you would agree with a
statement there are lots of things that
are not true
or even things that are true for which
you have anecdotal evidence like oh
there's these examples but you say to
yourself they're not really so strong
that you would throw away your science
because anecdotal people you know
but I've never seen anything this strong
have you I've never seen the anecdotal
reports this consistent and Universal
and strong
would you agree even if even if you
personally haven't seen anything and I
haven't I haven't personally seen
anything but I've seen more people who
saw something than I've ever seen about
anything ever
agree so the question is is there
something extraordinary about this
situation that would cause more people
to hallucinate than normal
or is it exactly what it looks like
uh
now most of you are going to say Scott
it's exactly what it looks like it was
in the vares database it was in the data
we've been telling you for two years
it's exactly what it looks like
but
is there anything here that could cause
that level of confirmation bias
like is there any Theory
that could get you to explain all of
this anecdotal observation bigger than
anything I've ever seen in my life is
there
yes yes there is
so that's the problem
is that the size of the the topic and
the emotion that we put into it is
actually big enough
that it could cause
three quarters of the entire population
to imagine that they've seen multiple
examples of things that didn't happen
yep
now let me be very careful I'm not
saying that's what's happening I'm
actually genuinely puzzled I can't tell
I can't tell if this is a gigantic
medical problem well here's what you
would have to believe
in order to believe that it's a gigantic
medical problem that's being somewhat
ignored
you would have to believe that one
million doctors
have decided it's too risky to mention
that they see it in their practice
a million doctors all just on the same
page
and I I heard it on Twitter I had a
little back and forth with somebody who
thinks that's exactly what's happening
so there are people who believe that all
one million all one million doctors
every one of them would see well almost
every one of them would have seen people
seemingly injured by a vaccination
if your observations are true
almost every practice would see it
now in order to believe that it's really
happening meaning massive injuries from
the vaccination itself not from covid in
order to believe that you'd have to
believe that a million doctors
are largely on the same page
that they will lie about a life and
death is very life and death I mean it
couldn't be more life and death
that a million doctors who took a vow to
help people and save them the most
obstinate
group of people in the entire
world
that the most contrarian and obstinate
people
the most headstrong egotistic people in
the world
every one of them is just afraid and so
they're not speaking up
now when I say everyone you should
interpret that in your mind as there
might be a handful
but here's what I would expect
If This Were Real
and it could be and I'm not saying it
isn't right remember I'm just talking
through it I actually don't know if this
is real I can't tell
um
if it's real here's what I'd expect
and if a million doctors I would expect
at least a hundred thousand of them
would say stop everything you cannot
ignore this anymore
I believe you would have a hundred
thousand doctors complaining really
loudly out of a million one in ten
what do you say what do you say to that
do you think he could get one out of ten
doctors to say all right this is too far
I will risk everything to health this I
will take a chance on my own career to
tell you that people are dropping like
flies in my practice
do you believe that you could get
10 out of 10. to be afraid of losing
their jobs
take a look at how many citizens
um
risk their jobs
to not get vaccinated
that's probably the same ratio you'd
find in the doctors the people who would
who will just be contrarians
you can always find ten percent
contrarians
on every topic
name any topic where you can't find 10
contrarians 10 percent of doctors who
are contrarians would be a hundred
thousand doctors telling you that they
see it obviously with their own eyes and
and senses
a hundred thousand at least is that
happening
do you think that the I don't know
government
control or fear is so good
that you couldn't get a hundred thousand
doctors in the United States alone to be
complaining how about some other country
you don't think there's a European
country some country somewhere else Asia
where there's going to be some Doctor
Who just says look
you don't even have to take my word for
it don't take my word for him here's my
data
you just look at my data I didn't have
any young people dying before
and then you look at this date and then
all these young people died I'm not even
making a claim just look at it yourself
you would see that
all right now
but I can't rule out that it is
happening
because I I do think that there are
examples in history where you could
actually get every person on the same
page and be wrong at the same time
would you agree
it's not impossible is it
that you could get all the doctors to
lie
it's not impossible when I say all again
I'm ruling out the handful or so that
actually are being the contrarians
yeah
I know
um
so maybe we'll never know what the deal
is but um here's my observation the
people who expected the jab to be worse
than not getting jabbed
tend to be the ones who saw the people
have problems the people who did not
expect that
and I was one of them I didn't have an
expectation one way or the other
no expectations I don't know any
so the people who expect to see us see
it
the people who didn't expect to see it
more more often didn't see it
now that's a that's not a hundred
percent thing but I would bet anything
any amount of money all of my money out
of that does the people who expected
from the start
that the shots would be dangerous that
they're the ones who know friends
personally who are injured by them
according to them
I guarantee it
which doesn't mean does not mean they're
not injuring anybody
because even even the people who make
them say the linger some people
right everybody thinks that the shots
will endure some number of people that
even the people make them say that
but why can't we get to the bottom of
this
and and for those of you saying it was
in the best thing
the Bears would be good because whatever
happened with the Bears so as the Bears
had been populated
and they were having problems
that would just be an extension we're
seeing in the larger world people are
either imagining it or they're not
it's either imaginary or it's not same
with the Bears
doctors can now speak out because the
systems were tweaked to silence what
would be an example of that
if you were a doctor with a private
practice
and you saw a big spike in young people
dying
what would stop you from simply saying
that
because you wouldn't have to say you'd
know the reason
you'd have to just say we are saying
this we don't know why
nothing would stop you because it would
be an open question whether it was the
long covid or the I don't know the
pushback from the pandemic close Downs
or something
but you would you would certainly be
able to say that more people are dying
that wouldn't get you in trouble
um
so Cartier according to uh Candace Owens
I'm just going to call Kanye Kanye is
that okay
I I get that he wants to be called yay
but I don't I can't buy him because I
don't want to explain his name
every time I say it
right so I think that he has lost the
right to have him be called by the name
that he he requests
because it's just too inconvenience and
names are for partly for the use of
other people right you don't give
yourself a name just so you can use it
you give yourself a name for the purpose
of other people using it now I think yay
was a perfectly good uh nickname for
people who are with him personally
like in the same room
but if you're going to talk about them
it's just to pay the S to say yay
because then I have to explain what I'm
talking about so I'm just going to call
them Kanye because
uh that's not my problem to fix so
Kansas Owens reports that JP Morgan
Chase uh is canceling uh
um Kanye West and telling him to take
his Yeezy Empire somewhere else
do you think that's true
I mean that doesn't even sound true does
it I believe Candace Owens I believe
that you know she got information from a
good source but
is there something else going on
do you think that just for his public
comments which we condemn
you know he by the way 48 Hours has
passed and and Kanye has not explained
or apologized for his comments am I
right 48 hours
do you be a time check you spend 48
hours right
and he had plenty of opportunity to
clarify or correct or or even just say I
was drunk or anything just anything and
he chose not to
so since he chose not to we have to
assume the comment stance
I mean it's assumptions
it's not a fact
but
I think you have to assume that those
are his his views of the world and uh he
has some opinions about the Jewish
population
that he would like you to know
so
make your decisions appropriately
you know
I feel uh how many of you have had the
same experience
that you'll you have the experience of
getting behind somebody
and then they'll do something like this
like right away
and you just you just got behind them
like I just started calling him my
spiritual leader
and then he did that and I'm like okay I
can't follow you there I just can't
follow you there
so you're on your own now
so sorry about that
but uh you know it's
that's what free speech is right the
free speech is I don't have to pay for
his Free Speech his free speeches he
pays for it
did you see a video of AOC giving a talk
to a mostly empty Auditorium
which is interesting in itself that she
couldn't pack a room
and it looked like there were some
people planted in there to cause trouble
and two of them got up and started
yelling at her for uh I guess she voted
to support funding of Ukraine that is
pushing us into nuclear war say the
protesters so what do you think of that
I was somehow somehow I missed the story
I don't know how but I missed the story
of AOC voting for war
that actually happened
so AOC voted for war
she must have voted for the funding
which effectively is war
voting for arms I mean voting for arms
shipments to Ukraine
so did that really happen
well it was interesting watching her get
shouted down
especially in that small room and you
can see that her influence
is weightless looks like aoc's influence
is certainly waiting
uh Rasmussen says 88 of likely U.S
voters
are concerned about the economy 88 why
is it only 88 percent
how do you get 12 to work that's fine
are they the people who are so rich they
don't care or the street people or what
how do you get anybody to say I think
the economy is fine
maybe they're talking about themselves I
don't know
but 91 still say fentanyl is the big
issue
so
what's happening with fentanyl in this
country
who's got the better plan on fentyl
in the comments Democrats or Republicans
that'd be what do you think
yeah neither
so I read an article a long
investigative article yesterday about
the Nexus between the Chinese underworld
and the cartels
and what I didn't know
is that there might be a really good
reason that China doesn't shut down
the fentanyl business
do you want to know what that reason
would be
what would be a good reason besides the
fact you know they want to use it like
an opium or to weaken the West
turns out there's a much better reason
it has nothing to do with the West
now there's not just money
not just money you're close money's part
of it
but what is the bigger part
I think this is true
that the elites are uh in bed with the
criminals
it looks like the government of China
and the criminal units are working
together and have for a long time
meaning that they're enriching each
other
so the criminals make tons of money
but they've got to launder that money
and they've got to be protected
and there does seem to be evidence that
it's the elites who are the criminals
so my my notion of China was there were
a bunch of Elites
and then separately there were a bunch
of criminals
and if we could talk the Elise into it
they would get the criminals in jail
but that the elites were allowing the
criminals to operate because they hated
the United States and anything bad for
the United States would be fine
so the criminals could sell all the
fentanyl here that they wanted
I no longer think that's the case
my revised opinion is that there isn't
enough difference between the elites and
the top criminal elements in China
because the elites are also laundering
vast amounts of money because they're
also criminals
they're all criminals
the elites plus the criminals but the
elites need to launder their money too
and for that they need criminals
because only the criminals can launder
money the elites can't do it themselves
so because the elites are also
laundering Mass amounts of money from
their own crimes
they don't want to get rid of the money
launderers
and they would have to to get rid of
Fentanyl
so that the Chinese
Elites are actually the criminals
and it's about money far more than about
power now it could be that you know
somebody like she is thinking about the
power element of it but the elites are
mostly just making money and trying to
stay out of jail and so they need the
criminal element to help them do that
so there is no hope of getting China to
stop the fentanyl trade that's the
bottom line there's no hope because it
would be like asking the mafia to stop
doing crimes
it would be exactly like that it'd be
like going to the mafia and saying you
know
we really really like you to stop doing
the crimes
how would that go
They're not going to stop that's their
job
that's their job and there's nothing
that's going to stop them so why would
they stop
so uh you may be aware that President XI
did this big anti-corruption thing
so he was going to be the
anti-corruption guy in China
do you know what that really was
that was him just using anti-corruption
laws to shut down his critics
that's all he was just consolidating
power
so China has never been anti-corruption
it's always been making sure that your
Elites are corrupt as hell but they're
on your side
because the corruption is what holds the
whole country together
so we should stop imagining that we can
get them to stop and also in the article
I read
the top uh Chinese money launderer when
you when you read the story of how that
top money launderer you know Rose
through the ranks of crime to be as
powerfully as it is is obvious the
government was behind him
like you can't you can't even have any
possibility in your mind
that he didn't either bribe the
government owned the government or they
were behind him the whole time or or
he's working with their intelligence
service or something but it's obvious
that he didn't get all the way as far as
he got
without the government
so the government and the criminal
elements in China are basically the same
thing
so they don't operate exactly like a
country
they're sort of a mafia
with the front story of being a country
as well
which is what sort of what Russia is
some say Russia is a gas station with a
military and I say it's a criminal
organization
that pretends to be a country
um
let's see what else has happened
well those are the fun stories
did I miss anything
um
Russia is down one military
all right let me ask you this
um is it true or false that the
Ukrainian Army is stalled
it's true right
you know I read one story that said they
were quote making gains around this one
city Kershaw and whatever they're trying
to recapture but if the story is not uh
gushing about their success it means
they're not having any
right because everybody can make
territorial gains as sort of a fluid
situation I'm sure the Russians you know
maybe in some ways are gaining a little
to uh who knows
but
to me it seems like the ukrainians just
hit a wall
unless they're waiting for new weapons
to come in or something but I it doesn't
look
it doesn't look at all
like Ukraine can make more progress
so how do you like my idea yet
I'll reiterate it without details my
idea is that you you make a three-part
peace plan
it goes like this
nobody owns the uh contested places you
give them a government in the Box you
give them all new governments let them
set up their own little situation
demilitaries them completely and make
them protectorates
what would be a good example of a
protectorate
Costa Rica
do you know anything about Costa Rica
so it's it's fun to learn about you you
should spend like five minutes just
reading the Wikipedia page for Costa
Rica
so Costa Rica doesn't have a military
do you know why
don't need one
because they're a protectorate who's
going to attack Costa Rica
so we'd stop them at heartbeat right
nobody's gonna attack Costa Rica so so
they get the economic advantage of not
having to fund a military
how big is that that's why we could
offer those disputed areas we can get
rid of their military
potentially all right Costa Rica
is a sovereign country
but is it
is it
is it really
well yeah
and no
meaning that if America needed something
badly from Costa Rica
and we weren't willing to negotiate
about it
Costa Rica would do anything we wanted
because they would like to continue not
having an army
and you know live peacefully here so in
a practical sense
Costa Rica is a little bit under our
influence or maybe a lot bugs can still
run independently and by any definition
is an independent country
um
old folks talking about Costa Rica wrong
again there's nothing I said about Costa
Rica that was wrong
yeah you like I get the generic trolls
everything you say is wrong
good for you
of you
all right
um
so the the first part is that they
become independent protectorates the
next part is that you divide up the
natural resources in some way that the
uh disputed territories make sure they
get a good they get the biggest taste
because they're the ones who took the
biggest brunt of it for the longest time
so they should get the biggest Taste of
the natural resources going forward
and uh and then the next part would be
space
you make your agreement with about
Ukraine a small detail on a larger
agreement with Russia that we should be
on a trajectory toward being allies
and I think that was the big thing
that Trump did with North Korea
that made that risk go down to what we
don't worry about today which is he he
simply
um
he simply redefined the situation as not
enemies
that's all it took and Russia is the
same situation we could just redefine
them as not enemies because we didn't
have a reason to be enemies have I told
you the big reason that Russia and the
United States are enemies
do you know the main reason we're
enemies let's see if you know this
what's the main reason the U.S and
Russia
are at
vodka somebody said
I believe it's because most of the
people who work for the CIA
got in the the Russia
uh wing of it I think they just have too
many employees working on Russian stuff
and Russia probably the same situation
or maybe just in response to the fact we
have too many people I think Russia is
just easier
like easier to understand you went to
school for it you you learned a little
Russian
what are you gonna do
if you're the if you're a career CIA
person whose job depends on fighting the
Russians
what are you going to do to say you know
maybe these Russians are so bad after
all you can't it's your job to say
they're bad and can't find them so we
have probably just too many people we
hired to fight Russia
without a reason
now of course once it gets going you do
have a reason because Russia will push
back
and you can't just ignore it but I think
we're we're at that point where the
reason that we poke them is because they
poked us and the reason they poked us is
because we poked them or we're going to
and that
very little that has any strategic value
to either of us
that's what I think
so
that's my peace plant and by the way I
have not heard one person argue with my
peace plan as being impractical
I'm sure somebody disagrees but I
haven't seen anybody argue now I'm not
saying it would work
but as a you know first draft
well tell me tell me what wouldn't work
which part of it wouldn't work so
there's three parts dividing up
resources has to happen
independent ownership of the disputed
places pretty much has to happen it's
the only thing that will keep them from
war
uh and then the space thing I think is
just smart
somebody says Russia won't listen that's
not an argument of course they'll listen
they want to negotiate
too much emotion attached no that would
not stop us
um
the Russian army has to be completely
out of Ukrainian territory that would be
part of the agreement
uh Russia won't do it we'll look at
Russia's options
all right so I've proposed something
that neither Ukraine nor Russia would
agree to would you agree to that
would you agree that it doesn't look
good for either Ukraine or Russia
to do what I suggested they both lose
something yeah they both lose those
disputed territories but they they both
have to lose
or they both have to win and you could
spin it either way
why would you trust Russia you wouldn't
you wouldn't do an agreement that
required trust alone
I mean you'd have to have some kind of
guarantees
Ukraine will make unreasonable demands
of course they will as will Russia
that's how it works remember I told you
we're going to go
um
who's going to enforce this agreement
that's what you would arrange
so you could imagine
that you'd say something like uh we'll
put you in forces in there for five
years
just see how it goes
it could be everybody's happy with it
because remember if Russia wins that
territory
there's still going to be fighting right
because Ukraine will never be happy with
it and vice versa if Ukraine thought it
won then Russia would never be happy
so the one the one thing that you know
doesn't work is one of the sides of
winning
can we agree on that can you agree that
there's nothing like one side winning
because the other side will just Peck
them to death with additional terrorist
attacks forever that's how we got to
this place
the reason we're here is that the other
side wouldn't quit
Russia will not keep an agreement
they haven't yet
I think that's too broad
it's definitely true you can't trust
them
and they can't trust us but you can make
agreements that don't require Trust
or not much I mean you could work your
way through that
it's the citizens that will fight
forever yeah I don't think the citizens
would fight forever if you gave them
their autonomy
would they
because that's something everybody likes
how about you be in control of yourself
okay
uh
am I ignoring the military-industrial
complex no the military-industrial
complex wants to fight forever
everywhere we all agree on that
but
you can you can guarantee that they need
to finish Wars too they need to move to
the next War basically we just have to
give them another
another source of
money and you can get them on your side
and I think space might be that source
I mean we're going to need a lot of
weapons in space unfortunately
um
Middle East 2.0
France and Germany didn't enforce Minsk
to
we had 20 years in Afghanistan we still
failed yeah there's definitely something
about the industrial military complex
keeping Wars going forever
but
here's what's going to happen in Ukraine
does anybody think we won't go to the
brink
we're going to go to the brink right we
have to
so so again I tell you that when we go
to the brink which we have to
is still means even when you're on the
brink the odds of actual nuclear war are
very low but we have to go to the break
and the reason we have to go to the
brink is but if we don't
that our nuclear deterrent is
going to the break is a necessary part
of the process now does going to the
brink increase the risk that you will
accidentally or even intentionally
launch yes
yes it does
right we're going to a place where there
will be more chance
of a mistake
but we have to pass through that stage
you don't you don't get to the stage
after until you pass through it so
you're going to have to put your toes
over the edge you have to look into
certain death
that we're all going to have to do that
and I'm laughing because
like it's so bad
like it it's so bad that you just have
to laugh
but you're gonna have to do that so just
get ready for it
you know I don't know if there's any
preparation one could do for a potential
nuclear war in Europe I don't know what
we could do I mean I would make sure I
had some food
are you at least doing that
you're probably already doing that right
is there anybody here who doesn't have a
little extra food
a little extra food left over from the
pandemic Maybe
if you don't have
um if you don't have some by the way
here's a good recommendation for food
I'm told that white rice
can be stored in a dark place basically
indefinitely
but brown rice and organic stuff cannot
because I have some that the organic
stuff has some oils in it or something
that will go bad over time
but white rice you can just put it in a
dark place and keep it forever and you
could live you know you could live a
while on just rice and water if you had
to
you wouldn't be happy about it but if
you had to
so that that's a very good thing to just
have
I also I also recommended protein powder
I don't know about the the health pluses
or minuses of it but it seems to me if
you had the big thing of protein powder
and he had a big thing of rice that
would last forever
you'd have protein and you'd have at
least some bulk
you'd have your calories
that plus water
you know you could add your protein mix
to water
so I mean I think those would be your
your minimal
preparations just in general
just in general now what you have beyond
that you know is extra
because you know if you need food Beyond
a month
I don't know
I'm not sure I want to stay around
I think I'd be looking for an exit plan
if if I had to forage for food for a
month I don't think I would
I wouldn't bother staying around
but that's just me
uh
quinoa does quinoa doesn't last
indefinitely though does it
head to Costa Rica yeah
hey Costa Rica is nice I've been there
all right uh did I miss any topics I
think I've done it all for today
Dr the current state of our nuclear
deterrence
yeah
so here's a question can any of the
so-called find people who attended at
Charlottesville can they sue anybody for
uh branding them as racists
because remember I actually interviewed
people who disavowed the races
did not march with them because it was a
big place they were in their own little
area
but they were all maligned as uh
neo-nazis
because they wanted the statues to stay
for historical reasons
do you think that they have a case can
they get a billion dollars like the Alex
Jones people
small plastic bags are going to be
illegal in California that law passed
yeah in California you can't have small
plastic bags
for the grocery store anyway
do I own any cows no I'm not going to
own any cows but I I get your point
Jones is bankrupt anyways
well I don't know if the 2020 election
had any problems
I just am glad that it's the only system
in America
that doesn't have any problems so
how lucky is that huh
lucky
all right
um
the California doctors misinformation
bill
never heard of that
all right BlackRock profits are down 16
percent
I don't think that means anything
because we're in a weird period
um
uh
did I see the rayapps AI confession tape
no
in California it's illegal for doctors
to disagree with politicians well okay
you need to get smart on this bill you
mean the doctor bill
bill 2098. all right I'll look into it
all right I'll talk to you tomorrow
