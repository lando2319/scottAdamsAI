on in yeah it's good to see you
and the early birds are getting the worms but let me check your stock market
it's up not much but it's up a little bit tesla is kind of flat
and up nuclear is up not bad
all right let me get my comments working and then we'll have the show that you
deserve yeah the one you deserve
not the one you usually get but the one you deserve
all right [Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to the highlight of human civilization
it's called Coffee with Scott Adams and you've never had a better time but if you'd like to try to take it up to the
levels that nobody can even understand with their tiny shiny human brains well
all you need for that is a copper mug or a glass of tanker chalice inside a canteen sugar flask vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine of the day the thing that makes everything
better it's called a simultaneous sip and it happens right now go
oh yeah that worked
oh well let's uh check in with uh first Elon Musk news because there's always
some um I wouldn't call it news but he was at some event and he was describing how
difficult it is to be useful at scale
so um I agree with uh Elon Musk's idea of
uh purpose he doesn't say it that way but I feel like that's the point the
point is if you're not being useful to anybody you're you're not reaching your full
potential and you would probably feel it you would feel less meaning in life so
being useful to other people is sort of the best thing you can do especially your family and those close to you your
employer that'd be good but um Musk is talking about being useful at scale in
other words you know building electric cars and uh taking humanity to the moon
or Mars but I have to say that if you wonder
what uh makes me do this every single day when I don't have to and what makes
me enjoy it is that it feels useful and if people did not say to me
literally every single day that they find value in you know listening to the
podcast I wouldn't do it you know e even if it paid really well um I do it
because it's useful and that's what gives me meaning so in case you wondered
well CNN is reporting that the stock market has recovered all of its uh
losses since uh April and it's near an all-time high so remember when everybody
got frightened because of the tariff scare and all the smart people were
saying "Oh Trump has ruined the economy with his tariff scares." And people like
me said "It's a little bit early." Um you don't know how this is going to
work out it looks like a negotiating thing and if you just wait a few months
everything will be fine and what happened the people who said "Hold on
just wait a few months and everything will be fine." They uh were right
so tariffs were a temporary scare to the economy but they seem to be back where
they belong well there's some fake news um that the fake news is that the NATO
secretary general uh called Trump daddy
did you see that news that didn't happen
so all the news and social media is reporting that that NATO secretary general called
Trump affectionately daddy and then when Trump was asked about it he act as if as
if that actually happened it didn't happen
he he used the word daddy but he was talking about the I don't know metaphor
or analogy or whatever it is um because Trump mentioned that that uh Iran and
Israel were acting like children and then the uh secretary general said uh
you know sometimes you know daddy has to be stern something like that but he was
talking about he was talking about the you know the comparison he wasn't
talking about Trump uh although in that in that uh telling Trump would be
representing the daddy but there's a there's a big difference between saying
um you know I often call people the internet dads
but I'm not I'm not talking to them personally and saying "Hey daddy."
It's more of a description of being in charge and taking charge of the children
so that's fake news but it's fun
well as Axios and others are reporting the uh Trump administration is looking
for the leaker whoever leaked the uh uh the battle damage
um assessment they said that uh maybe maybe some of Iranians the Iranian
nuclear program was not destroyed but that was a very preliminary report
there was only one person involved it was way early had no authority and was
even self-labeled as unreliable uh but did that stop CNN's Natasha
Burchin from reporting it no it did not she reported it now how do you how do
you find the leaker my understanding is there's a um secure
system in which private stuff like this can be presented to some members of
Congress but not all of them and the thinking is that in all
likelihood a member of Congress leaked it
now how do you ever find that do you check everybody's you know
messages do you somehow get approval to look
through everybody's uh WhatsApp messages and what if it were just done in person if I were a leaker
and I knew it was illegal as in this case you know I think Pam Bondi says the
leaker should go to jail if I knew it was illegal
I would do it in person in other words I would find somebody to tell even if the
person I tell in person is the person who tells the reporter so maybe there's a little distance there but would the
leaker be so dumb that they would leave a trail that you could find
because you can't really ask the reporter because they can just say "Hey it's a confidential source."
So I have a real question whether the FBI can find the source of the leak but
anyway uh Trump is not too happy with Natasha Burchin um he said in a truth
post that she should be fired from CNN and then and I'm quoting him thrown out
like a dog you know I always tell you that Trump uh
it's impossible for him to be uninteresting he always brings the show so did he
really have to throw out Did he have to include she should be thrown out like a dog
that's what makes us so sticky if he'd only said uh you know she doesn't
deserve her job or she should be fired you know maybe you would pay attention
to it but when he throws in that she should be thrown out like a dog
how in the world do you ignore that it's just too funny coming from a president
but apparently if you don't remember Natasha Bertrren's history um she was
big on saying that the Hunter laptop story was Russian disinformation
which sort of makes her look like a tool of the CIA doesn't it she was I think
with Politico when she did that brit Hume says that she also fell for the steel
dossier you know the the fake uh Russia collusion story as well so imagine being
somebody who had reported incorrectly the laptop story and also the fake
Russia collusion story and then you pop up with this sketchy story
does it seem to you as if some people only exist to do the sketchy stuff
it makes me wonder does CNN say "All right we're going to need um at least
one CIA asset." And I'm just I'm making an assumption here so I don't have any
evidence that she's a CIA asset or any other asset but don't you wonder if uh
since I assume the CIA has some influence on Arnidia
do you wonder if they say "All right you have to hire this one cuz that's our asset." Because it would be easier to
move an asset into a company than it would be to change somebody into an asset once they're there wouldn't it
maybe not anyway um
Molly Abmingway points out she said on X um I'll add that multiple knowledgeable
sources tell me that the intel assessment and that's the one that says that uh the nuclear program was not
completely destroyed uh that the intel assessment being bandied about specifically notes it was done the day
after the strike needs weeks more analysis and was not done in conjunction with
other intel agencies and was given a low confidence rating
so why did it even exist
don't you have a question like why why would anybody put that in writing i
mean all they're putting in writing is we have no idea what happened it's way too early why would you do that
so there's there's a question about the leak
but I would argue that there should be a question about the analyst who put together that analysis
do you think that analyst was proTrump
maybe or does it seem more likely that the analyst who did that so hastily was
maybe anti-Trump maybe possibly
yeah as I've jokingly but not really jokingly said the the uh bomb damage
assessment or if you prefer battle damage assessment is based entirely upon
how much do you like Trump if you like Trump it was obliterated
if you don't like Trump I don't know they may have hid that uh all the good
stuff somewhere else you never really know do you well Trump is uh reiterating that the
nuclear program in Iran was totally obliterated i've never heard of that word so many times in one week
obliterated it's a good word uh but he also says which uh softens his message a
little bit you know just just so he's got a little wiggle room there he also says that Iran would not dare rebuild
its nuclear industry because they they know they would be attacked again
all right so which is it is it totally obliterated and it's going to take years to build it
back or did we send such a strong message that it doesn't really matter if
it's totally obliterated because they know we'd come back
feels it feels like there's a little bit of wiggle room there you know just in case but here when I watch the news and
and how the uh Trump administration is handling their messaging
um I'm kind of impressed that Trump is selling the obliterated
message because a lot of people you know repeating obliterated obliterated and
he's so good at making you remember his little uh sound bites and that that's
one of them he just repeats it and repeats it until if somebody asked you
well what do you know about that attack you would just immediately think well
obliterated so that part is great
but uh I would argue that Trump is also cleverly conflating two things that you
should not conflate one is did they destroy the things they
were aiming at and I would say especially after today's briefing which
I didn't catch all of it but I saw some reporting on it um it does sound like
they have a pretty good idea that they did obliterate everything they aimed at
would you agree uh there's nothing that's 100%
but when when you hear the description of you know the bombs and the military
people who know what they're talking about and was it can yeah uh General Dan
Raisin Kain um when he when he did his uh
explanation I didn't catch all of it because I was preparing for the show so I was a little
busy but here's the one thing I learned for sure if you thought you could do bomb damage
assessment or battle damage assessment if you prefer by looking at those
satellite pictures were all idiots
i think everything I assumed everything just everything I assumed by looking at
the satellite pictures was wrong now I I didn't catch all the details but
if you follow the news today you'll find out that I think I have this right that the three
holes we saw um people like me assumed that oh they
must have been putting two bombs in each hole and and that's the hole that the bombs went into um but apparently those
are not the bomb holes those are the ventilation holes that
show that there was a explosion from the inside from the bomb that doesn't show its own
hole because it goes so deeply i guess it gets you know buried behind itself
u but you can see the you know the blast was so severe that it blew the tops off
of the ventilation holes now and there was something about several of the bombs
going into the same hole or something like that so I don't I didn't get all
the details but the but the one thing I learned for sure is I'm never going to
try to do bomb damage assessment by looking at a satellite picture again
we we had no idea what any of that meant we were we were guessing so hard that by
the time they explained what you're really looking at you just you just feel like an idiot
so I do here here's the thing that's conflated
um I will accept as of today I I accept
that there's a really high chance that everything they aimed at got totally
destroyed and I think the IA whatever they are ei
um I think they said yeah that stuff is so sensitive that if you you know
consider the severity of the blast and the sensitivity of the equipment in
there it's definitely destroyed so but is that the whole story would you
agree that if you knew that everything they aimed at they did destroy completely
if that's what you knew would you also conclude that they had uh set back the
nuclear program by years would you conclude that
well you would only do that if you're conflating two things that should not be conflated number one did they destroy
the things they were aiming at that looks like a yes i'm gonna I'm gonna say
yes on that number two which should not be conflated
with that question is was there anything that they should have destroyed that
they didn't know about was anything moved that could have been used given
that apparently they made their own equipment the centrifuges
uh I don't know if they made all of it but they made parts for it at least is
there any possibility that they made some extras that were not yet installed and they just put them in
a warehouse somebody someplace that would be innocuous maybe so the thing we don't know and
probably can't know you know unless spies tell us later I guess um is
whether there was anything that was moved or anything that was always in a different location we don't really know
that so Trump and Egg Seth and you know
all the admin people are trying to sell you that we got everything that matters and
that might be true um I I'm not ruling it out at all but can you automatically
assume that Iran knowing that Ford would be the main target and knowing that you know
we'd be coming after all their nuclear assets can we assume they didn't do anything about that in advance they
didn't have any time to plan for that you know there wasn't there wasn't some
you know obvious planning to make sure that at least some of that got moved to
another site or maybe they had another thing ready to go don't know
but don't conflate did they hit what they wanted to and destroy it with does
that mean we got everything because the second part is unknowable
yet i mean eventually spies might tell you that we got everything um but I
wouldn't conflate those and then uh Trump and Hegsth are also
trying to conflate the question of whether the uh the pilots destroyed
every part of the nuclear program with the question of are you respecting the
the skill of the pilots and the professionalism of the military
as Caitlyn Collins of CNN said everybody is impressed by the military
i would say that 100% of the public and all of the media is on the same page
that was an impressive uh military action and that if you don't
respect that well I I just don't even know if you can
be an observer of course you respect that of course you do but I think um Trump and Hath are
trying to have it as a little bit of suppressive fire that if you act like
maybe there was something that should have been bombed that wasn't bombed that you're disrespecting the pilots nobody's
disrespecting the pilots so in case in case there's any uh
confusion I really am impressed by the job that the military did like really really
impressed and I'm pretty sure most if not every single American is having that
same feeling about the military they may have all kinds of feelings about
everything else but that's not really in question so it's offensive to me that if
I ask a question about what we know about the damage that someone would say
"Are you disrespecting our military?" No
no those are not the same topic and anyway
so that's that's where that's at um
all right what else uh so according to U Democrat S I assume Senator Timmy
Duckworth so you know the Democrats have to find something bad to say about Trump and uh
here's Duckworth uh quote "If you were Iranian leadership uh what this taught
you was they better get nuclear weapons very quickly because look at how Trump treats countries that have nuclear
weapons like North Korea right he goes and he pals around with dictators."
Well she acts like that's a mistake is it a mistake for Trump to paddle
around with Kim Jong-un so that he takes us off of his target list
she acts like that's some kind of mistake would it be a mistake
and first of all you know North Korea you know I would say is completely
contained they they just don't have a reason to go after the United States and
that's a pretty darn good job by the president if he removed the reason that anybody would have a you know impulse to
attack us nuclear but uh is it true that the Iranians
would now feel more more incentivized to get nuclear fast well yes and no yes and
no if they could do it without being caught of course
i I absolutely agree if they could do it without being caught but do you think
Iran believes they could do it without being caught they just executed
700 of their own citizens allegedly for suspicion of being spies
700 now I have some real question about how many of them were actually spies versus
you know people who got turned in by their neighbors who didn't like them but if you're Iran and you believe that
there were 700 spies that you could find and that's not even counting the ones
that you couldn't identify do you think they would feel comfortable relaunching a nuclear program and think
that nobody would know it doesn't seem possible at this point
so Duckworth I would agree that if they could do it in you know total
confidentiality they would they would definitely do it but there's not really
much of a practical possibility of that i don't think I think Israel's too
deeply in their pockets anyway
um ex uh Congressman Jamal Bowman who's a Democrat was on CNN and he said some
crazy which is always funny when Democrats are crazy he says that the
stress of being called the n-word either directly or indirectly is why blacks
suffer more from obesity and cancer
how how many of you think that's true that the reason that blacks have more obesity and cancer is because there it's
stressful to be directly or indirectly called the n-word now what would what would be an
example of indirectly being called the n-word i guess that would be if you
imagine somebody's thinking it but they didn't say it would that be a case of indirectly being
called anyway so that was on CNN that was nice and crazy uh I saw Endwokeness was
reporting on that clip all right let's talk about the uh
supreme leader in Iran so was it day
before yesterday maybe yesterday i posted this i said uh on X I posted I
have a feeling Iran's regime already changed all the Supreme Leaders underlings needed to do was lock him in
a bunker and take away his phone quote for his own safety now remember that
sentence okay so I said all they had to do was lock him in a bunker take away
his phone and say it was for his own safety and then I said "Then tell anyone
who asks that the Supreme Leader isn't meeting with anyone in person but you know his orders."
And then I I said "Just to tie it all together," I said "It worked for Joe Biden."
And it did so we're still trying to figure out you know who was you know
completely behind the auto patent although we know one person now and
we're trying to figure out who was influencing Biden because he wasn't quite all with it etc so given that the
Supreme Leader is 86 wait 86
86 is the number where you get rid of stuff i wonder if they 86 the 86 year
old it's kind of a weird simulation coincidence but
um there was a new report I saw in Mario Noel's post and uh I by the way I do
know that the Supreme Leader did some posting today and he made a video today
so I'll get to that in a moment but before I saw that
um I saw a report from Iranian state TV in the New York Times uh Mario was
reporting on it on axe and and the report is that uh the Supreme Leader was
reportedly missing for a week and that there's a power struggle going on
now this is unconfirmed of course but these are the reports um and as Mario
said the the Iran Supreme Leader hasn't been seen publicly since before the strikes and there was a nationwide
concern and political infighting apparently a state TV in Iran a host
asked an official from uh the Supreme Leader's office what millions of people
were wondering he said "People are very worried about the Supreme Leader can you tell us how he is?"
So even the uh media in Iran was saying I wonder what's up with him
and then officials said that uh Kam was sheltering in a bunker does that sound
familiar he was sheltering in a bunker but we knew that right and he was
without electronic communication to avoid assassination
so they literally took his phone away and told him it was for his own safety which it was you know legitimately it
was for his own safety but was that the only reason they took his phone away
and his absence during the ceasefire negotiations raised questions about who was running it and I guess the president
who does not have nearly as much power as the supreme leader of course um he
called the current situation a quote golden opportunity for change
really the president of Iran is saying that uh
the war and all the destruction is a golden opportunity for change does that
sound like something that the supreme leader would say it doesn't does it that sounds like
something you would say if the supreme leader was already pushed aside
then in that case yes that might be a golden opportunity for change
so that would be an interesting an interesting framing of the situation
from Iran's president unless the 86year-old supreme leader had
already been you know nudged to the sidelines but let's go on and uh four senior
officials confirmed that their rival factions battling for control in Iran
and uh then I saw separately that uh that the supreme leader was
being guarded and the guarding part is really the the key part of the story
by the valley special forces unit of the revolutionary
guards um and they would be you know the most loyal effective security you could
have unless they got flipped or they were taken down
by some other military unit so do we know for sure that they're the ones
guarding him i don't know but there was a new video message and
some a number of posts on X today which sounded like they were in response to
people saying where the hell is the Supreme Leader so it looks like uh the Supreme Leader
wanted to make sure that people knew he was still alive and in charge or
or was it like Joe Biden where there would occasionally be a recorded message
because they needed to make sure he didn't say anything that wasn't approved by his captors
or does he think he's still in charge and the people who allowed him to do the
video presumably from the bunker did he think he was doing you know
Supreme Leader stuff and the people who allowed him to do it and facilitated
getting the cameras in there and everything is it possible that they're just sort of leading him on and
pretending that he's still in charge both for public consumption and also for
his consumption so he thinks that he's still relevant while they battle it out
behind the scenes for who's who's really going to run the country maybe but uh so
Kam or is it uh I just know you have to clear your
mouth after you say it so he's claiming victory over Israel and
uh he said he quote delivered a hand slap to America's faces
um he said that Iran was victorious in their 12-day war um
and he said the Islamic Republic was victorious and in retaliation delivered
a hand slap to America's face so that would be the the uh the attacks that
they warned the US about and killed or injured no Americans so that would be
the hand slap and he said that US hit nuclear sites
but couldn't achieve much well and he said uh US President Trump
needed to do showmanship uh with all the commotion and all the claims the Zionist regime was
practically knocked out and crushed under the blows of the Islamic Republic
now that all is pretty generic isn't it it does it does show that he made it
recently because it was after the uh the attacks on the American base that were
kind of weak but does it show that he's in charge
well I don't know it could be that there's a lot of uh you know maneuvering
behind the scenes and he might end up in charge again he might stay in charge or
it's entirely possible entirely possible that uh they're
they're Joe Bidening him they are putting him forward as if he's in charge will they really make all the important
decisions because at 86
you know how much capacity does he even have so they probably were already
making a lot of decisions without him and he was just involved in the real high high level stuff like Biden
so I think um there's still the possibility that uh you know leadership has changed
or it might change even though he's doing some public stuff now
and let's see um speaking of that um Jill Biden's quote
work husband um has has decided he will not testify
to the House Oversight Committee even though they asked him to but he hasn't
been subpoenaed yet so I suppose he'll do that next but Anthony Bernell so he
was the the former advisor to the first lady Jill
um was sometimes called her work husband and some people say that he was the most
influential person in the administration because he could influence her and then she could influence him Biden and uh
that he was actually one of the powers behind the the curtain i don't know
about that but uh I'd love to hear him explain it
um and then weirdly here's something I didn't expect uh Trump did a very
lengthy truth social post u calling for Israel to cancel the court proceedings
against Netanyahu so apparently
Netanyahu has some you know major legal issues he has to work on i don't know
the details and I don't know if any of the charges are legitimate but uh Trump
is calling it a ridiculous witch hunt and uh you know just mentioned what a
great job Netanyahu did working with Trump that's Trump's current public
opinion is that Netanyahu was an amazing partner he was just amazing and they did
so well together that may have not been true every minute of their working together because
reporting that Trump had a stern phone call with Netanyahu about a ceasefire uh
but at the moment he would like you to believe that um the charges against
Netanyahu are fake and they're lawfare and political and they should be dropped
because he's such a good leader and did such a good job now do you think that
Trump did that on his own do you think he was just looking at the news and of
Israel and and thought you know what I'm going to weigh in there and you know
really try to support him because is there any chance at all that Israel is
going to pay attention to Trump's preference for what their court should do i I don't think so so why would he
even say it i don't know but it looks like maybe there was a an arrangement
it looks like uh maybe um Israel did something for Trump
or maybe Netanyahu specifically and uh maybe Trump is returning the
favor even even though he knows it won't make a difference but it makes a difference in how we think about
Netanyahu so that's a little bit of a difference
anyway um in other news um Trump is
reportedly according to the Wall Street Journal he's uh considering naming uh the the new Fed chair before the end of
the term of uh Powell and I guess he Powell's term would run out in May and
normally you um apparently normally you nominate the new person
a few months before the old person's term is up so that the new person has
time to you know get acclimated to the job and learn what's what but uh Trump
is considering maybe naming the new person way ahead of time like any moment
now uh because that person would be like a backseat driver
so they would put a little pressure on Powell maybe to quit early because he'd have a backseat driver saying "Well you
know if I were in charge already and I will be in charge in a few months but if
I were in charge already I'd be lowering those interest rates." So that would be
a little extra public pressure on Powell and if it happened to you if you were in
that job wouldn't you at least think about quitting early because it would
just be so annoying and humiliating and just it just wouldn't feel right to have
that backseat driver so it's kind of a clever plan i don't know if it' work but
I could see why they might try well let's talk about this New York City
socialist so there's a lot of comments on um the
uh guy who looks like he's going to win the general election and become uh the
new mayor of New York City Zoran Mandani
now I don't hate the fact that his first name Zoran sounds like Superman's
nemesis doesn't Zoran sound like he came from the same planet as Superman and you know
there's going to be a fight anyway I like his first name
and he was born in where uganda he was born in Africa and he's a Muslim and a
socialist um some are calling him a communist
but uh he's not technically a communist but he's definitely a socialist
um John Federman who's on the same team allegedly you know a Democrat he said
that uh M mom's win which is so far only in the primaries but he'll probably win
the general if the polls are correct he goes quote I describe it as Christmas in
July for the GOP so Fedman who is not a socialist and
sometimes agrees with the uh framing of the Republicans like now
um believes that it's basically suicide for the uh the Democrats cuz you got a
midterm coming up and wouldn't it be convenient if the Republicans who had to
run in the midterms could refer to New York City hiring a socialist
as you know a cautionary tale it's like oh don't be like that so yes Fedman is
correct um the Republicans would probably be pretty happy if he gets
elected at least in terms of how it would affect the midterms
um and uh then let's see what else uh Bill Clinton just congratulated mom Donnie
acted like there was nothing unusual about it so
that was unusual um and uh Mom Dominique has pledged to
quote "root out bigotry across New York City with an 800% increase in funding
for hate crime prevention programs." So
that sounds good on paper we of course uh
yeah we of course would need to know the details on that james Carville as you
know one of the Democrat strategists of of old
um he was talking about mom donnies and uh he said uh
he's not walked back some of the things that he's posted about in the past that were more controversial such as
uh globalize the uh into FOD
because the pro-Israel people say that that's a call for violence and uh
against Israel um whereas uh the anti-Israel people say it's merely a
call for a struggle against oppression but I mean a pretty damaging thing to
have hanging out there and Republicans would certainly make it sound like he's
anti-Israel and they could they could sell that they could sell that
um according to Axios there's a guy that's a president uh and
strategist of Bianco research who wrote on a post on X quote it appears that New
York City is elected to commit suicide by mayor instead of suicide by cop suicide by
mayor and
uh let's see what else and then of course uh there's some fear
that a lot of the businesses will want to escape from the socialist um taxation
and and other problems that will come with New York City if he's elected and that they might escape like Ken Griffin
did he's already relocated to Miami and uh there's there's a warning that
New York could go the direction of you know Detroit and Baltimore and some of these other places
but Bill Aman ambassador Bill Aman who's been a lot more um involved in political
stuff in the last year or two he had a very long post and he he's optimistic
that Madi could be defeated even though it would be too late for somebody to
enter the race in a normal way but he says that if somebody you know is
qualified and a superstar and they want to run as a rightin
now what are the odds that a writin candidate would get elected in New York City well not very high right a rightin
candidate that that when was the last time a rightin candidate won any kind of
major election in the US i've never actually heard of it
but Bill Aman says that if such a superstar candidate wanted to run his
right in that he will quote take care of the fundraising and he could definitely
take care of the fundraising so he would have all the money he needed he or she
and they'd be writing does that sound like
it might work i don't know i I would have to know if it's ever
worked in the history of elections in the United States maybe in a small town
but for something as big as the mayor of New York could that ever work i don't know i'm skeptical
and then Tyler Winglevoss one of the Winglevoss twins who's uh I believe
they're both billionaires at this point in crypto and he said "A lot of people
have asked me if I will get involved in the New York State New York City mayor race by supporting some other
candidate." And he says "I'm torn and undecided." Um he said like every other
city run by Democrats New York City is a broken kleptocracy
taxes are astronomical and services are pathetic to non-existent anarchy and
socialism are the next logical steps in this story arc
he goes on saying is what the people of New York City have been asking for for years it looks like it's what they're
about to get he says "Trying to fight against this tide seems like throwing good money
after bad." And then he he said some more but then he said "It appears things will have to get worse in New York City
before they get better." So one point of view is that the only
way New York City is going to get better is you have to let socialism try and fail and then people will be willing to
try something else um others would deeply disagree with that because if you
let it go too far it might be just too hard to save it uh and so Mike Cernovich
was disagreeing with giving an inch and you know would prefer fighting to you
know maintain as much territory as you can um but I'm going to go with uh Winklvoss
and it's not that I want a failure in New York City it's just that I don't
know that any Democratic city has ever climbed out of it in recent years i
don't know if they can my my best assumption about the real
world is that it can only go in one direction at this point and I think the big Democratun cities are essentially
just criminal enterprises and the odds of a socialist coming in
and fixing it are close to zero it feels like so it doesn't feel like
they have a plan and it looks like it's pretty dire and I would go with if you
can get out of any Democratun city unless it's in a Republican state
because some of the Democrat cities and Republican states uh are doing okay but
if you're a Democrat city in a Democrat state and you're about ready to um elect
a socialist I would say leave that would be that
would be my advice get out of there now I realize that losing New York City
would be just the worst thing for America but it might not be you know it
might be time to uh to know when to hold them and know when to fold them you know
there's a um yeah I'm seeing in the comments a lot
of people say that uh Giuliani did in fact save the city now I will
give you that that Giuliani did in fact you know turned around New York City but
I don't know that that's still possible uh maybe you just need somebody who's
that popular wasn't didn't Giuliani get elected no he got elected before 911
so do you do you believe that a Republican or even just a noninssane
Democrat could get elected in in any upcoming year i don't know i I
feel like the the window in which a Giuliani could get elected probably is
closed so my feeling is that some of these might not be fixable i mean I don't I
don't see Baltimore getting fixed i don't see Detroit getting fixed and New
York City might be joining it i don't want that to happen so unlike uh you know unlike those who
say you got to let it fail before it gets better I only think it might fail
um I don't really foresee the it failed and therefore people got smarter and
elected better leadership and fixed it i don't really see a way that this gets
fixed and I'm pretty optimistic you know if you've watched me for a while I
generally think everything can get fixed but there's there's a systemic problem
with some of these cities and there's nobody suggested any fix for the systemic problems and one is that
they're all criminal enterprises it it would be sort of like well you're I
guess this is bad analogy but I I won't I'm not going to say that
New York City is like the Mexican cartels they're not the same
but I will say that if you were expecting the Mexican cartels
to fix themselves because they got better leadership and then they got out of the drug business and turned to
legitimate businesses and started helping Mexico be a good good country
would you think well that could happen yeah yeah the cartels just need a Giuliani
uh if they get a better leadership then they would stop selling drugs and killing people and they would just turn
to you know legal enterprise and the answer is nobody expects that's possible
no matter how much of an optimist you are nobody says themselves well I think
those Mexican cartels can turn around so at what point does New York City and
the kleptocracy as Tyler Wlvos calls At what point does a system
become something you could plop a Giuliani into it and fix it i feel like
they've passed that point but that's just my feeling i'd love to be wrong so
if I'm wrong that would be just the best thing to be wrong about
um Trump is uh doing a little branding of the Democrats uh he's referring to
Jasmine Crockett as low IQ Jasmine Crockett and he thinks that Jasmine Crockett and
AOC and what he calls communist mayor Zoron Mdani should be the leadership of
the Democrats so basically he's mocking them for having leaders that are
completely impractical bad idea and it should make you know
normal Democrats just give up because if that's who's representing
them you good luck with that well in other news the House Republicans
are trying to get some testimony from Act Blue that's the big uh money
gathering enterprise that funds the Democrat races everywhere
and uh at the same time the Department of Justice is doing a probe because
there are allegations that ACT Blue was involved in widespread donation fraud
so we'll find out if any of that's true i don't know how long it takes the DOJ to do its job but maybe Congress can get
to the bottom of it first well there's a uh story here from
Bloomberg and UNODC that says Australia has the highest
cocaine use on Earth and New Zealand is right behind it so the biggest per
capita uh cocaine users are Australia and New
Zealand now the reason I bring that up is because by complete coincidence I was
watching a real is it called a real on Instagram
in which uh there was some guy going around and asking people if they knew
uh which country had the highest body count now body count refers to how many
people you've had sex with in your life so he kept asking people and they would
say you know Brazil and he'd say 'N no the US no and I thought it was actually
uh uh Iceland but Iceland was third it turns out but number one and two were
Australia and New Zealand and then the very next day after finding
out that Australia and New Zealand has the most number of sexual partners I
find out that they also have the highest cocaine cocaine use per person and I'm
wondering is that a coincidence or
could it be that the highest cocaine use gets you the highest body count i don't
know or could it be that they just really like to party i don't know
don't know well Trump is back from his NATO meeting
he's back in the US and uh but while he was there he said that the Ukraine war
is quote totally out of control um but he did meet with Zilinski at the
NATO summit and he said that Zilinski quote couldn't have been nicer
and he says he believes Zilinski wants to end the war but he's got to meet with Putin to see if they can get it ended um
other things that Trump said suggests that he doesn't really have a you know
he doesn't have any traction on ending this one but he's still trying
i do like the fact that the way he he characterizes Zalinski is how nice
Zalinski was to Trump he could not have been nicer
and it's so Trumpian that he can hate you you know one day and then praise you
the next depending on how nice you were to him which which I have always told you is
good persuasion because you want to have the the greatest penalty for people who
are doing what you don't want which is what Trump does gives him the biggest penalty but also the biggest reward
if you're doing what he does want so here he is saying he couldn't have been nicer so here he is getting the reward
for playing things the way Trump wanted to play it but I don't see really much odds that
Putin wants to end any wars he he seems to be sort of winning a little bit um I
think uh Russia is still gaining territory albeit slowly and uh their
drones are doing a lot of damage so um but in related news
um I guess Sky News is reporting that the UK is going to buy a bunch of F-35s
from the US and those can carry nuclear weapons
and that will make the UK a stronger partner in uh in NATO because they're uh
their nuclear capabilities would be enhanced by that
and u Starmer over in the UK calls it a response to radical uncertainty
so that's kind of a big deal they they've never had that capability before
and in uh other news the Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against
Orange County uh California register of voters for concealing unlawful registration of
noncitizen voters to the gateway pundit
so apparently what this means is that the the justice department had asked for
um records that would show how many voters were non-citizens and Orange County did not want to
provide that so there's going to be a court case there and
um I saw also in the same article the Gateway Pundit that Orange County um had
an unusual outcome because it's sort of the the most conservative part of the
state and it didn't go the way that people expected it to so even though
Trump made California and every place else a little bit redder
um Orange County turn blue at the same time that almost everything else was
turning a little redder so we have questions
why do we get this nonpredictable result in this one place and it might be
because of who they have their voted maybe we'll find out
according to the New York Post the uh Trump White House says that the big beautiful bill would reduce the deficit
by more than $2 trillion over 10 years because of all the economic stimulus and
therefore the added uh you know tax revenue that comes in because the economy is doing well do you believe
that do you believe that anyone and I guess who did this uh
it was members of the White House Council of Economic Advisors so they did
their own analysis do you believe that anybody could do a
10-year analysis of our of our of our tax collections
based on one bill i don't think so but if it helps him
sell it I suppose that's a good idea in uh hard to understand events in the
Shaun Diddy Combmes trial apparently there were a whole bunch of different charges and the prosecution decided to
drop several of the horrible charges against Diddy before it goes to a
verdict so they're dropping attempted kidnapping attempted arson and aiding
and abetting sex trafficking but that still leaves them with some serious
charges that uh will be part of the jury uh deliberations
and the reason given for why they would have all these charges and then drop them is that dropping them would allow
them to simplify the jury instructions and I have questions
has that ever happened before has a prosecution ever dropped charges
for the express purpose of simplifying jury instructions for the other charges
maybe or does it mean that they didn't make their case and they they don't want to
have a bunch of things that the jury says "Well you didn't make your case on this thing and that thing so maybe we
don't trust the other stuff too." I don't know so I guess I'll have to rely
on people who have more experience with the courts to explain that to me but is
that a good idea from the perspective of the prosecution
does that really improve their odds of getting a conviction it might i mean I
could see why you don't want to confuse the jury with the instructions but I've
never heard of this before and then over in Virginia Governor Ynan
is going to sign into law a ban on using phones in schools
which uh according to just the news um is something that uh 31 states are
already doing a bunch of states um but from the beginning of school to the end
you would not be allowed to use your phone uh as other states have already decided now don't you think that's a
good idea that that's probably one of the
unambiguously good ideas that you'll ever see but what happens
when AI becomes wrapped into your lesson plan which is going to happen you know
kids will learn AI to do math AI to write things AI to look at history do
you think that they'll reverse that and say that you have to bring your phone because all the tests will involve you
knowing how to use AI to get the answer maybe it's possible that will get
reversed at some point i don't know anyway that's what uh
that's what I got for today i'm going to talk to the uh locals people my beloved
locals members privately and the rest of you thanks for joining um I hear from a
lot of people that uh they don't care so much what I talk about they just like
listening to my voice and falling asleep to it do you have any idea how many
people have told me you know I love falling asleep to your voice
and I say to myself I don't know if that's good it it's sort
of a compliment yeah but uh I guess I've slept with quite a few of you so we'll keep doing
that if uh listening to my voice makes you sleepy and that works for you I'm
all for it because as I started out by saying I'm all about being useful
and if I can be useful at scale as Musk says is the hardest thing I'm all in so
if if a lot of you are finding it relaxing to listen to me before you fall asleep that's what I'll do so we'll keep
doing that all right um I'll see the rest of you tomorrow same time same place and in the
meantime in 30 seconds we'll go private for the local subscriber
