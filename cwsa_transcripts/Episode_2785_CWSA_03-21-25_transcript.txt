the S&P stocks are down Bitcoin is down
but barely and Tesla is up
2.5% look at that Tesla is Bucking the
trend it's
up well we should do a show what do you
think about that I think you deserve
it you do you deserve
it so I'll I'll give you the best show I
know how to
do again because you deserve it
[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and
you've never had a better time but if
you'd like to take this experience up to
levels that nobody can even understand
with your tiny shiny human brain all you
need is a copper muger a glass a tanker
chalse din a canteen Jugger flat ask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dopamine end of
the day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous Sip
and it happens now
go oh that's some good stuff well I have
it on good authority that
um anxiety is high
today for a lot of people I think the
news is making people anxious but I'm
here to make that all go away so all if
your anxiety you can already feel it
draining out of your body can't you oh
you can do some Uber and breathing while
we're while you're
listening that's a two long inhales
through your nose one after another
followed by exhaling out your mouth and
you'll have to do it uh three times your
whole body will feel different but
speaking of Health did you know that
there's a new
study you won't believe it but turns out
that coffee is good for you uh there's a
study the Journal of nutrition is
writing about in which they found out
that consuming more than two cups of
coffee as long as it's not
Sweden um it was associated with reduced
overall cancer incidents and mortality
that's right
coffee can help you prevent cancer
according to science which is never
wrong and this is kind of interesting
you know how for your entire life you've
complained about how yeah they can't
even predict the weather tomorrow you
know how are they going to do this or
that when they can't even predict
tomorrow's weather well apparently
there's an AI driven
method according to the
guardian that uh will be able to predict
the weather with very little resources
um something like a single researcher
with a desktop computer will be able to
have more accurate forecasts than all
the computers that they're using now to
do forecast at with way less
energy thousands of times less computing
power so you'll be able to sit at your
desk and predict what your weather will
be tomorrow how about that so I guess I
guess the job of news weather
person might be at risk when you could
just go to your computer and it will
have a better idea than all the
experts well as you know Trump signed an
executive order to get rid of the
Department of Education and probably had
one of the best
um I guess presentations
where so he was surrounded by school AG
kids who were all at their own little
desks and they all had their own little
executive
orders so he signs his executive order
while the kids are signing their
executive
orders it was impossibly cute but the
funny thing is you know that the reason
that uh the get of the Department of
Education uh the critics say it's bad
for the children so he surrounds himself
with all these happy
children and then then Trump
says that uh giving it uh giving the
power back to the States uh might be
better for the better for the teachers
than what they were getting before so
it's good news for the
teachers so uh but the executive order
can't actually get rid of it you still
need Congress vote on it I guess he
thinks he has the votes if only the
Republicans agree they can vote it out
but the executive order can kind of gut
it you know it can stop it from
functioning even though it still exists
so so that's happening but yeah Trump
says teachers will be quote better
rewarded with the education in the hands
of the states now let me give you the
how the news has treated
this don't you think the most important
question about the Department of
Education is what will be different if
it doesn't
exist how many of you can answer that
question most of you if you're a
republican your answer to the question
would be well I guess they didn't do
anything because you know scores of
tests never went up so I guess it never
did anything but that's a little
oversimplified don't you think little
over
simplified and then the uh the Democrats
are being told it would be the end
of the end of Education or something uh
they think it will cut funding for the
disabled and uh cut funding for
lowincome people but it hasn't even been
decided if the funding that was once in
the um the department of educ
will be distributed to the states so we
don't even know if it will cut anything
it might just be a you know less
administrative costs because you just
get rid of an entire department but
maybe maybe the disabled will get the
same amount of money it'll just be
distributed to the states instead maybe
so nobody really even knows what this
is this is one of the biggest stories in
the country
and how many of you even
knew what would be cut or what would be
different I would say almost none of us
I had to I had to actually uh you know
do a little research even to get as far
as I got and I don't think I quite
understand it so it's kind of a it's
kind of a funny one I think Trump's
doing a good job of just acting like no
scores went up and so I guess we're in
good shape anyway so if it can't be
defended uh better than it has been
defended I think that's a pretty good
reason to get rid of
it um because the arguments for
it only make sense if the states don't
pick up that
slack and we don't know yet that they
won't because there might be funding
given given to the states we'll
see well meanwhile uh Bernie Sanders and
AOC are doing their anti- oligarch tour
together
uh so they're in Las Vegas I guess
yesterday it it must be just so hard for
them to go to Las Vegas and do an anti
oligarch so the funny thing is according
to journalist baa Angar Saran she was on
Fox Business and she says that there are
twice as many billionaires backing who
backed KLA Harris compared to Trump
twice as many and that 65% of the Rich
vote Democrat so rich people are 2third
voting Democrat and 75% of hedge fund
managers also vote
Democrat
um and so there you have it so once
again the Democrats are the living
embodiment of the thing that they're
accusing Republicans of do you remember
when they accused Republicans of being
uh domestic terrorists
or at least the white supremacist which
they conflate with being a
Republican and then we're watching all
kinds of domestic
terrorism that's 100%
Democrat so it's very consistent pattern
whatever they're accusing you of that's
probably what they're doing it's like a
confession um I was reading the amuse
account on X uh that had that that take
um now to
me the the best filter on Democrats is
the theater
kids because they seem to pick things
that can work well in a theatrical
setting so they send theatrical AOC and
Theatrical Bernie Sanders and then they
make them you know sort of like Lewis
and uh
Martin so they turn him into like a like
an entertainment
Duo what would be better than Lewis and
Martin that's an old reference is is
there any newer couple
anyway so uh it seems to me this anti-
oligarch thing is just like a play they
took on the road it's just completely
unmowed from reality in any way so
Trump's got like a few billionaires with
back him and you know obviously musk is
the biggest one but it seems completely
artificial as do the Tesla things as do
a lot of things I do so the theater kids
put on a play Take It on the
road all right let's check in with the
other theater Kids U we've
got the we've got Gavin Newsome who uh
apparently claimed on his
podcast uh that no one in his office
ever used the word L latinx
latinx remember for a while we were told
that uh the Latin uh or the Hispanic
Community like to be called
latinx with an x on the end and you
never heard anybody ever use it in the
real world and turns out the Hispanic
Community wasn't really crazy about it
at
all well here's the fun part so poor
gavan is trying to trying to become more
of a Common Sense Middle Ground guy so
he has some chance of national office we
assume can't read his mind but it looks
like he's trying to position himself for
running for president and uh but Aon
Bernett of
CNN on her show she runs a compilation
of Nome actually saying latinx without
being without joking about it so
apparently he's the person in his own
office that was using it in public
public a number of times and he wasn't
using it ironically or as a as a
criticism so now he's trying to sell us
that no one in his office ever used the
word while while we have video
compilation of him using the word
typical so I'd like to give uh the
Democrats another Pro
tip uh I'm good at the pro tips if
you're trying to be the next Joe Rogan
the thing you can't leave out is the
authentic
part but the the thing that the
Democrats get wrong every time is they
literally think that authentic means
pretending to be
authentic that's what nome's doing he's
pretending to be
authentic to try to become the next Joe
Rogan without quite understanding that
the public can see through in
authentic so easily it's what we can
pick up just so easily and and then
think about Joe
Rogan so how long has he been in the
public
eye is there anything he's ever done
that ever struck you as
inauthentic nothing right probably
literally nothing yeah yes he likes to
hunt animals and cook them up yes he
likes to do hard workouts yes he likes
the
MMA like what what part of anything he's
ever done strikes you as even a little
bit even a little bit
inauthentic
nothing and that and that's the part
that they don't get and it feels like
they can't get it it it's completely
unavailable because their
world and I mean this literally this is
not this is not hyperbole Democrat world
is completely
artificial so they don't live in a world
where connecting to anything in the real
part of the world has ever made sense
it's a complete artificial theatrical
imaginary we can read minds we see we
see uh you know domestic terrorists
under every chair uh we can read Trump's
mind and we know he's going to steal
your democracy and it's completely
artificial so I think they've actually
lost the ability to even police
themselves with
authenticity they just don't have it and
they I'm not even sure they know what it
feels like or what it looks like or what
it would you know how you would act
authentic I guess that's the problem
they act
authentic anyway the authentic part is
not optional if you want to be the next
Joe
Rogan
um here's another uh pattern I think I'm
detecting see if see if you detect any
pattern so I think former Democrat uh
representative Corey
Bush so I guess she was defeated
recently but she's the remember Corey
Bush she was one of the squad kind of
people her uh husband was charged with
two counts of wire fraud uh something
about accepting payments during Co I
think and alleged lied to get those
payments now does anybody see a
pattern has anybody
noticed that prominent I'm going to just
say prominent has anybody noticed that
prominent Democrats are so often married
to
criminals is that a is that my
imagination how many times have we seen
prominent Democrat
husband in
trouble and I think it could go the
other way you know prominent Democrat
wife is collecting money from us Aid NGO
for doing just about
nothing all their spouses seem like
criminals now I suppose the politicians
themselves have some some questions to
answer too but uh does seem like a
pattern the the Democrats either marry
criminals or are
spies if you see a Democrat That's not
married to a
criminal I I would suspect that spouse
of being a
spy because they only have two kinds of
spouses criminals and
spies anyway gret of and
sust who has worked for a number of
different news
outlets as revealed on a podcast with
Tara paulm
um that uh the MSNBC is the only one who
told her what she could and could not
say are you surprised that MSNBC didn't
let her have her own opinions that she
had to she had to agree with sort of the
the company opinion on stuff and uh
granta said that's why I got fired at
MSNBC when MSNBC tried to tell me what
to do I thought they were
joking I thought they were joking
imagine working for a company that's so
corrupt that when they tell you honestly
what they want from you you think well
that can't be
true you you actually think it must be a
joke because because your brain Can't
Wrap itself around the fact that they
were never a real news organization that
they were you know a propaganda outfit
by
Design and uh that's why I got fired
because they said I needed to play ball
and that didn't work now what else do
you need to know about
MSNBC the the the main takeaway from
that is if you know somebody who's
getting their news primarily from
MSNBC they're not really getting news
are
they you know uh obviously most of our
news sources are biased left or biased
right so bias is no big deal but there's
a really big difference between having
some bias and being told what you can
and cannot say on the air that's a it's
a big difference so
MSNBC
propaganda all right here's a story I've
been waiting
for so
uh so JD Vance vice president Vance um
was talking to a podcast I guess was a
daily color uh podcast with Vince kogan
Co KES I think I'm pronouncing that
wrong but uh he so Vance was asked how
he how he's a different vice president
than K Harris was and Vance said he said
I swear he said this this is real I'm
not making this up Vance said well I
don't have four shots of vodka before
every Mee
meeting and then he laughed um but
here's the thing so the New York Post is
reporting it as he joked that he
joked was he
joking does anybody remember
2019 and there were a number of prot
trump people who joked we
joked about uh Biden and his mental
incapacity do you remember that and
everybody said ah you're
joking and people like me would say no I
mean I might be saying it in a funny way
but I'm not
joking he quite obviously has some
mental Decline and it quite obviously is
going to get worse in the next few years
if he gets selected yeah we think it's
funny on some level it it's funny that
they would even run for office but we
weren't joking joking you know joking in
quotes it was more like that's an actual
observation that everybody could see and
the funny part is that people weren't
admitting they could see
it now that's
funny and to me this feels like 2019 all
over again oh oh yeah K Harris that that
guy that guy joked that guy joked about
her drinking before she goes in
public yeah well it was a joke in
quotes but do you think he didn't mean
it do you think that the people who
really know what's going on the the most
Insider people whether they're
Republicans Or democrats you think they
don't
know that k l has a substance problem do
you think they really don't
know is it just us
Jokers well the well the Jokers keep
joking about it it is a
joke but it's only funny because it's
obviously true if it were not obviously
true do you think I would have brought
it up more than once I mean maybe I
would have floated it more than you know
I might have floated it once to see if
it was funny but I wouldn't be hammering
on it like a million times like I am
unless I literally thought the joke is
that so many people are pretending they
can't see it now that's funny because
it's just 2019 all over again you know
you think to yourself well the news will
learn from their mistakes and if so many
people could clearly see that Biden was
mentally declining you know at a fast
rate in 2019 if so many of us could see
it well obviously we'll we'll make an
adjustment so the next time some
something like that happens we won't be
caught off guard and we'll say oh yeah
we could see it early
too but we're right back in the same
situation pretending that they can't see
it oh it's just a joke JD Vance you just
telling a
joke and then how many how many outlets
on the left carried that
story I didn't see it anywhere I saw it
in the New York
Post which you know leans right did the
entire
News
Enterprise that is mostly left leaning
did all of them ignore that the vice
president of the United States joked
that his predecessor was was drunk
during meetings did they think that
wasn't
newsworthy no it's obvious that they can
see it they just can't say it the they
would rather they would rather back
somebody who couldn't possibly
win as long as it makes other people
unhappy I guess that they they seem to
be more about destruction and making
people unhappy it doesn't seem to have
any kind of like you know overall
strategy to it
anyway uh let's talk about
tariffs you know I keep hearing that the
stock market is in turmoil because all
the smart people can't forecast what's
going to happen with tariffs and it
creates great uncertainty to which I say
really I think it only creates great
uncertainty to people who are really
really bad at risk management let me
explain the risk of
tariffs one thing that might
happen is that we'll have a little bump
in uh you know maybe products coming
through some things will be more
expensive a little bit of bump
inflation but I guarantee you that when
the dust settles America will have
better trade agreements than we had
before now does anybody doubt
that the the Tariff stuff is the closest
thing to a guaranteed outcome that
you'll ever see and I think lutnick does
the best example of of basically making
that case well actually Mr Wonderful
probably does the best case to make it
uh
ly
um there's only one way this can go the
other countries will say okay we can't
take this heat because our economy won't
last as long as America so we're going
to have to you know offer him
something so if you knew for
sure that the worst thing that could
happen is there might be several months
of disruption but when the the dust
settles the us is going to have
substantially better maybe not as good
as we wanted but substantially better
trade
agreements that
should make your stock market go
up what what is wrong with the with the
riskmanagement people who are driving
the stocks down do they really believe
that is chaos do they really believe
that because Trump seems to be
unpredictable and he's he's changing you
know changing things based on the
situation on the ground so there's a lot
of roaling going on do they really think
that the outcome of that has really much
of any chance of being negative in the
long
run these are professional
riskmanagement people and they think
that this won't work out in the long run
this is this is as close to a guarantee
as you can ever get an economic
right there's no guarantees but it's as
close as you can get I I don't think you
know if there were a betting market and
I could say okay make me a bet in the
third year of the Trump um
term will will our tariff situation be
better or worse than it is
now it's close to guaranteed to be
better now whether that takes a you know
a year or a month or it's just
guaranteed I mean I don't know how it
could go any other direction
really so I'm not sure that we have the
smartest people driving the stock
market all right uh then there's a story
Blaze media is covering that apparently
I didn't even know this but America and
Mexico have had some kind of long
running water
deal and part of the deal is Mexico
gives us water and part of the deal is
we give Mexico water now I'm assuming
that they give us water from places they
don't need us so much and we need it
more and we give them water from places
we've got a little extra and we didn't
need it where that water is so otherwise
it wouldn't make sense we would keep our
water they would keep their water so
there must be some situation where it
just makes sense that we use their water
and they use but apparently they have
not been meeting their deal under this
1944 Waters sharing treaty and so Trump
with I think the backing of Ted Cruz
who's been um pushing for this just said
all right so we're going to cut off your
water to
Tiana yeah you you either have to fix it
on your end or goodbye water you know so
so it looks like the the US will deny
Mexico's water to now I don't I don't
know if that means to you want gu no
water I doubt it but uh maybe maybe not
as much as they
wanted this seems exactly right so I
love it that my country is saying wait a
minute you have to do your end to this
and water is not free so if we don't get
your water you don't get our
water looks right on point to me here's
another good news by the way remember um
today's theme is I'm trying to drive
down your anxiety in my opinion this is
my actual opinion things are going
really
well like really well it just maybe
isn't really obvious you know from the
lens of you know everything's on fire
and the headlines and we're all fighting
about everything but things in general
the biggest things are going really well
here's another one
so of course one of our biggest problems
in the United States is access to Rare
Earth minerals well according to
Financial Times uh Trump is invoking
invoking a wartimes power uh to increase
us mineral production so you probably
knew this existed I think we talked
about it during the
pandemic there's a thing called a
defense production act and if the
country is in
trouble and you need to just sort of
quick quickly ramp up production
typically we're thinking of a a war
situation um you can you can invoke this
wartime Powers thing and then you can
cut a lot of Corners so you can get
around a lot of regulations um here are
the things that will be
immediately um Changed by this act so
it's going to speed up the review of
projects so if you had a mining project
that you wanted to do in the US to get
some Rare Minerals here or even
somewhere else I suppose um then you're
going to get a much faster review which
could be could be the number one thing
that makes something uneconomical that
it might take you years to get it
approved so if it goes from years to get
it approved to I think we can get this
done in a couple weeks that
should you know vastly improve our odds
of creating our own uh you rare earth
minerals um also Trump says that there
will be a mineral deal with Ukraine
despite what the news is reporting
because I thought the news was saying
the mineral deal was dead but Trump is
reporting it is very much alive and
might be signed soon so I don't know
which one of those is true
but it does suggest that Trump's looking
everywhere and anywhere for rare
minerals which I like um you might know
that Congo the country of
Congo um is in such
a let's say bad state in terms of war
that they've offered that they will uh
share their rare Earth mineral wealth
with the United States if we could help
them militarily essentially
survive and apparently that's on the
table I don't think a deal has been made
but uh
Congo is one of the places that the US
is looking at as a source so I don't
know what that would look like and then
part of the reason Trump liked Greenland
is because of the mineral Rare Earth
minerals so we're also looking at
Federal lands for mining the rare with
minerals we're looking at loans for
Federal loans for companies to uh get
involved and let me summarize
that we have long said one of our
biggest vulnerability to China and one
of our biggest limiting factors to you
know all kinds of technological progress
is our is our shortage of or let's say
the risk to our supply chain of rare
earth minerals this looks like exactly
the right response doesn't
it so again you know I'm I'm just going
to give you all the good news um if I
were to
design the perfect response to we don't
have enough Rare Earth minerals in our
pipeline that are secure it would look
exactly like this it would be the War
Powers Act it would be Federal lands it
would be we're going to get it anywhere
we're going to increase the rate of
approvals we're going to give loans this
is
everything this is right on point
excellent and other good
news um Trump is backing every form of
efficient energy so he's not big on
windmills cuz they haven't really proven
themselves and uh he's not anti-solar
but you know solar is going to do its
thing but he is uh he is pro nuclear
he's Pro drilling like crazy he's Pro
getting rid of regulations he's Pro I
think there was something about drilling
in the
Antarctic um and he's even pro
coal now if I were going to tell you
that you had a president who was just
super pro energy and he was going to do
everything he could to make energy you
know just bigger in the United States
what would you think is the prospects of
the United States for thriving in the
future and the answer is really really
good because if you could only use one
thing to predict how a country is going
to go it would be their access to energy
it would be the one thing that largely
predicts the future
of the economy and Trump is you know
seemingly Allin on doing exactly the
right stuff in exactly the right area of
the economy energy so he is right on
point on that so that looks
good here's some uh probably fake news
from The New York Times so the New York
Times uh got an anonymous American
officials so it's the New York Times
it's a story that's bad for Trump if it
were true and it comes from Anonymous
American officials uh involved in
the uh involved in the military
industrial
complex so does that sound like it's
going to be true I haven't even told you
what the story is but without even
knowing what the story is do you think
that the New York Times with a negative
story for Trump from Anonymous American
official
um probably in the Pentagon or somewhere
close to it does that sound like a real
story well according to uh musk and
Trump it's not a real story and also
according to the Pentagon it's not a
real story but the story
was the story that I'm not going to give
any I give it no respect whatsoever I
guess anything's possible but this one
doesn't even sound like a good try
so the story was that um Elon Musk was
going to be briefed on the battle plans
with
China the battle plans with
China do you know what the battle plan
with China
is we're all
dead pretty much cuz if we had a real
war with China China's dead we're dead
the world's dead everybody's dead we're
not going to have a war with
China in my opinion in my opinion the
odds of a war with China are really
really low really low because China
doesn't want a war and we don't want a
war with China it would be the most
destructive thing that the world has
ever seen and neither the United States
nor China is
crazy so even if it looks like you're
getting close to war with
China China doesn't need a war China can
just wait their strategy of just being
bigger than other countries and you know
having a big manufacturing base and just
keep building things and getting
technologically more capable and
controlling resources and markets and
building their belt and Road thing that
all works that is a really good plan for
future Chinese dominance now we're not
going to attack China
with you know the risk that that would
be to the I mean that would be an
existential risk of the of the highest
order so in my opinion if you're worried
about war with China it's the last thing
you should be worried about literally
the last
thing but anyway so the the rumor was
from the anonymous American officials
that the Pentagon was going to brief
Elon Musk on the war plans with China
but musk says that's not true uh the
Pentagon says that's not true Trump says
total lie not true make up your own mind
but it but let me tell you what does
make sense it does make sense that if
musk is in charge of figuring out how to
cut the budget and the military is an
enormous part of the budget at some
point musk would need to know the
general d diretion of the Pentagon
meaning is the Pentagon going to turn
into a a drone only kind of a military
is it going to uh double its number of I
don't know nuclear subs is it going to
get rid of its tank um expenses because
who needs a tank you know if the United
States got into war with anybody capable
tanks wouldn't last five minutes
so at what point does musk need to know
not the war plan with China you don't
need to know that detail but you would
certainly need to know the budget
direction of the Pentagon so that you
could say you could ask the right
questions like all right if you have all
these
drones why do you need tanks there might
be a reason I'm not I'm not saying
there's no reason but those are the
questions you got to ask is like well do
you really need this if you got that can
you make a robot army I mean there's a
lot of questions that need to be
answered to handle the budget and the
budget
cuts well as you know there's this big
Tesla
takedown um effort and I guess they're
getting really organized and something's
going to happen at the end of the month
and uh they keep planning all these
events that turn into domestic terrorism
because there's always somebody bad at
these events um and they're going after
Tesla assets and Tesla dealerships and
charging stations and it's all about
Elon Musk and now actor John
cusac is involved with this
and once again we get back to this
theater
kids John cusac I don't believe he's
appeared in any top grade movies lately
this is the only acting job he can get
which is pretending to pretending to be
a leader of this anti-tesla
thing and he's he's complaining that the
United States is fascist and becoming
more fascist every day is that because
there's somebody who's making cars as
somebody wants is that the fascist thing
or is it possibly the people
organizing uh the violence against them
which one sounds a little more fascist
to you H tough
question anyway if it's the only acting
job you can get and you look crazy and
you look like you might be on some kind
of mental health um
drugs uh I guess it's the best you can
do so the daily wire is reporting on
that so poor
guy anyway so here's my opin about the
Tesla
protests um something like 30 to 40% of
all Tesla owners are
Democrats if you own a Tesla do you feel
uncomfortable driving it in
public because all you have to do is
stop at some red light and if there's
some bad radical you know crazy leftist
you might get
keyed so so if 30 to 40% of Tesla owners
who probably are quite happy with their
automobiles because Tesla has a lot of
happy owners how are they going to feel
finding out that their own party made it
too dangerous to just drive down the
street in the car they already
own that is an unrecoverable
error I I don't think the anti-tesla
people have thought this
through it it's not like all those
people can immediately swap swap out
their
cars that's a pretty big
expense so a few will right a few
politicians will make a big show of it
or whatever but most people are going to
keep the car they have no matter what's
happening because changing out your car
is sort of a big deal so if 30 to 40% of
the Tesla car owners are finding that
their own party made it too dangerous to
drive to the grocery store to buy a loaf
of bread how are they going to forgive
their own party I wouldn't I would never
forgive that because it's one thing to
say blah blah some policies happening
that might not affect me you know blah
blah executive order that might not
affect me you know blah blah the
Congress is talking about something that
will never affect me that's really
different from I can't drive my car
without fear because the Democrats did
that to
me that's non-recovery terrible it
really is and the fact that the leading
Democrats are silent on telling people
to you know cool it against an American
company so forget about even the violent
part don't you think that democrats
should be saying you don't take down
American companies especially ones that
they would say are good for climate
change but nobody it just completely
reveals that their views are about power
and about destruction they're not trying
to build anything and when they do they
just take the money and nothing gets
built you know like
the California the classic example of
that so anyway it uh seems that the
Democrats have decided to Define
themselves as um to Define themselves as
domestic
terrorists uh the Democrats have tried
to kill Trump twice because we assume
that those those killers were left
leaning and now they're trying to take
out musk so they've literally become a
party of Anarchy and and I told you
before I think I told you that Mitch
mccon not Mitch McConnell um Schumer
Chuck
Schumer when he was on one of the news
shows he talked about how the goal was
to make Trump less popular
now how could you belong to any kind of
a group whose leader says our goal is to
make the other side less
popular so that we can get power
back no part of that sounds like what's
good for the public how about we plan to
lower your taxes how about we plan to
create more jobs that would be good how
about we plan to find a way to get more
rare earth minerals oh that would be
good how about we found a way we have a
plan for uh getting better trade
deals that would be good every one of
the productive ideas is coming from
Republicans now some of it is because
Republicans have power and Democrats
don't but the complete inability to have
a positive policy idea combined with the
unfortunately the authenticity of saying
that what they want to do is destroy two
of the most successful people in the
country
how do you
not understand what's going
on they are the party of Anarchy chaos
and
destruction they're not trying to build
anything they're trying to just
completely
destroy and I just don't see how that
could ever be a competitive political
party uh at the at the national level of
course you know they'll they'll retain
power in cities and
states but wow I've never seen any group
self-destruct so thoroughly without
understanding that they're
self-destructing thoroughly it's like
they don't even understand
it um meanwhile this is interesting as
you know Trump was doing executive
orders against a few law firms that he
thought had acted
inappropriately um meaning Target Ed
Republicans or targeted him but one of
them has negotiated with him the Paul
Weiss Law Firm that had been one of the
targets of Trump's executive orders that
would take away their clearances and and
prevent them from doing work with the
government apparently they
negotiated and they promised not to deny
representation to clients based on
political views so that means they
agreed to take on Republicans if they if
made
sense they promised not to use any
diversity equity and inclusion
policies wow um and they said they would
dedicate the equivalent of $40 million
in pro bono legal services to support
the Trump administration's
initiatives according to the
hill
now that that sounds pretty
extreme how in the
world I mean did they offer that or did
the Trump Administration ask for it CU
it feels different if they offered it
versus if they were if they asked for it
if they offered it well it just make
sense to say yes but I hope they didn't
ask for it because that would look a
little that would little look a little
extortion you know if they asked for it
but if the law firm said all right we're
just going to have to throw everything
at this deal and we'll just offer for
this and it might not be any more than
they do for um for the other side of the
political aisle it's a pretty big firm
but anyway that's a that's an
interesting situation it also tells me
that the law firm is very good at what
they do because if you had told me they
could negotiate a way out of this I
would have said hahaa there's no way
they're going to negotiate their way out
of this and then they did so I guess I'm
a little impressed
um and probably they they weren't crazy
about the diversity equity and inclusion
thing they probably just did it because
everybody was doing it
so they might have given away nothing on
that it might have been something they
didn't want to deal with in the future
anyway well let's talk about la la
reportedly has a billion doll deficit
just the city of
La now if you heard that how bad would
do you think that
was what if I taught you about numbers
without percentages or percentages
without numbers so there's a number
without a percentage so if I didn't tell
you what is the total budget of La how
would you know if that's a big deal or a
small
deal so I had to do my own research to
find out what the budget of La is to
find out if a billion dollars even
matters it's around 8% it's about 8% of
the budget so if you tell me that they
have to cut the budget by 8% the rest of
the budget by
8% that seems painful but
doable uh if you tell me it's just a
billion dollars they go I don't know is
it a$2 billion budget because it
wouldn't be possible to cut 50% but
8% I feel like I feel like an 8% cut is
is something
that a big budgeted anything should do
once in a while if you're a big company
big state Big Country big
organization shouldn't you every now and
then look to cut 8 to 10% of your
expenses that's the most normal thing in
the world so it's doable but maybe not
with the competence of the people who
work in La by the way State Farm has a
lot to answer for um I'm hearing more
stories
of people who thought they had insurance
for the Pacific Palisades and State Farm
was part of that and are learning that
uh the quality of their insurance was
not what they hoped it would be so I
think the local news is going to be on
that story and I don't know what state
fir does about that I mean it could be
that they just don't have any money so
even if they wanted to treat people
better they
can't um we'll find out we'll find
out another cost cutting uh Pete Heth
said on um said on Thursday yesterday
that they're going to cancel more than
$580 million in Grants and contracts
that they deemed quote wasteful
spending what do you think about the
fact that all these big government
entities seem to be able to look at the
budget and in five minutes they can
identify millions of dollars that don't
seem to be justified and they're just
going to like crazy grants for crazy
 the the fact that this is as easy
as it
is is really weird there was a I think
it was one of the Doge leaders was on
the the news I think he was on uh Laura
Ingram's show on Fox News and uh one of
Sam corus is his name
and he was asked you know what was one
of the big surprising things about the
you know the Doge and the cost cutting
and uh Sam said you can you can cancel a
50 million contract a $50 million
contract and nothing happens no one even
knows why it
existed just think about that just think
about the fact that you can cancel a $50
million contract probably in multiple
places in the government this exists and
there won't be much push back because
there's nobody who can defend why it
existed in the first
place that's the quality of our
government money
management we really have the right to
ask for a lot
more um let's say responsibility and
auditability and uh just fiduciary
responsibility with our money
we we're owed a lot
more anyway but even when I when I read
that uh the heg said the Pentagon found
580 million to
cancel my first thought was wow that's a
lot 580 million and then I realized that
the number we're looking for would be
closer to 580
billion in order to get to a sustainable
debt level the defense is probably where
a lot of the cuts will
happen 580 million doesn't get you
anywhere close I mean it's better than
not getting 580 million obviously
but 580
billion you know might close the uh the
debt I see people still dumping
on on a usack in the
comments well uh here's here's some good
news bad news you want to hear the good
news bad news the good news is uh
Germany is going to increase its
military spending by a trillion
dollars the bad news is Germany's going
to increase its military spending by a
trillion
dollars have any of you seen the Norm
McDonald
um you know the late nor McDonald's act
when he talked about
Germany and I don't remember the exact
wording but if you can think of it in
nor McDonald's voice it's like I don't
know if any of you study
history but in
Germany and and then everybody starts
laughing because yeah Germany does have
a history so when was the last time it
was good for Germany to massively
increase its military
capabilities I'm not worried at
all anyway so that's happening so but
that might be part of what gets the
United States out of Europe's business
because it didn't really make a lot of
sense that we're all up in their
military business in Europe in the first
place but let's talk about some other
countries
um as you know Israel is going hard at
Gaza and the Hamas militants who are
still there because the hostage deals
seemed to fall apart and it looked like
it looked like amas was just going to
stretch it out and they were hoping for
some kind of a
ceasefire maybe involving the hostages
or not and then they thought they could
reconstitute and Take Back Control and
indeed during this latest season far
Hamas tried to reconstitute its
leadership of the area and you know
reconstitute like a government and a and
the military and stuff and I guess
Israel said no we're not going to have
any of that so now they're just going
hard at them and here's my
question it seems to me that anytime one
of the grown-ups from another country
you know be it Saudi Arabia or some
other you know country that's allied
with the us or maybe a European country
anything in the European Union don't
they always say but what we really need
is a two-state
solution and here's my
question how do they not know that's not
an
option if if you just look at at a map
of all the Israeli settlements in the
west bank and then you look at
Gaza where exactly would this set
where exactly would this second country
be that that option has been completely
taken off the table and it makes me
wonder that the people who say it are
generally
smart which makes me think that they
know it's not real but they know that's
the thing you have to say in public
because if you don't say it if you don't
say I want a two-state
solution then you become a target for
any body who thinks that being too pro
Israel is a bad
thing and we live in a world where
there's a lot of people who think that
so do you believe that that's just
acting my current opinion is that's
acting that that 100% of the people who
actually know how the world works and
are paying attention you know not not
casual people I think if you just stop
somebody in the street and say do you do
you prefer the two State solution you
you'd find lots of citizens who are not
you know deeply informed about what's
going on I think the citizens would
quite honestly say yes two State
solution good idea but not the
experts so don't we still have people
who are like allegedly experts who they
they have to know that there's no real
possibility of a two-state
solution don't
they so
and that's a real question do they
actually not know that that option
closed I don't know when but it's
certainly closed
so I would also say that uh the way
Hamas handled the or didn't handle the
hostage
situation kind of gave Israel the free
pass that they needed to do whatever
they need to do so I think that uh
Israel has decided Hamas will be
destroyed completely and I think Hamas
never thought that was
serious I I think there strategic
problem was they thought well if we just
do this and that they're going to do a
ceasefire we'll reconstitute we'll claim
victory uh and we'll do it
again but that's not at all where
Israel's Head is at not at
all Israel is quite clearly decided that
you know they'd like to get the hostages
back but they're not going to let it
control them meaning that they're going
to destroy every part of Hamas no doubt
about it no matter how long it
takes so um for those of you who are new
to
me I don't support Israel it's not my
country I support the United States but
it's hard for me to criticize a country
that's doing something that looks like
it's in their best interest even if it's
horrible to other people because I see
it through the filter of
power and Israel has power and they're
using it to the what looks like uh their
own opinion of what's the betterment of
Israel if the power were
reversed and the Palestinians had all
the
power the Israelis would not be happy in
other words Whoever has the power is
going to be doing things that the people
who don't have power are really really
going to hate and they might even have a
good point but it doesn't matter it just
doesn't matter if they have a good point
because the ones with the power are
going to get what they want and that's
just what that part of the world is
about now I don't think our part of the
world is
better I think that when the US has
power it uses it and when somebody else
has power they use it um so to imagine
that if I had a moral or e ethical quam
that somehow that would matter that
wouldn't matter it wouldn't matter to
anybody so I just shut up about any
moral or ethical qualms because I don't
live in a moral and ethical world I live
in a world where
countries quite understandably pursue
their own best interest as hard as they
can so what are you going to do about
that now you might say but we don't want
to we don't want to be fun it and that's
a good conversation to have because
that's just
economics but um I'm not even entirely
sure if we understand the whole funding
situation because a lot of that
money that looks like it's for Israel is
really just does a U-turn and comes back
to the United States and funds our
military-industrial
complex but we also have some
strategic reasons to be you know strong
partner with Israel um probably economic
reasons as well so it's a more
complicated situation and I don't think
that my ethical or moral opinion about
anything moves any needles so I just
stay out of the whole conversation but I
don't back Israel I don't support Israel
because they don't need it and it's none
of my
business so I have to say that every
time I
think meanwhile let's talk about Ukraine
uh zalinski has said that there's no way
that the us is going to take over any of
their nuclear power stations now there's
some you probably heard the news that uh
Trump said uh when dealing with Putin um
what if the United States takes over
some or all of uh the nuclear power
plants in
Ukraine and that that would be I guess
the the thinking would be would be good
for Ukraine's power structure because of
our expertise but also um it would be a
reason not to attack Ukraine because
that be a bigger American presence there
but uh then some are saying that that
only applied to one nuclear power plant
that's in the uh an area controlled by
Russia at the moment so I'm not even
sure what the details are that but
zalinski is defying defying that um
according to the independent and he says
uh no way that America is going to have
any of our power plants
now does it feel like any progress has
been
made because it seems to me there are
two situations that will never
work one situation according to
zalinsky uh is that if America tries to
negotiate a peace plan without Ukraine
at the table that there's uh no way that
will work do you agree do you agree
there's no way that the United States
can come up with an agreement that uh
Ukraine will
accept I agree with that because even if
we say oh but you know we can twist his
arm and we can threaten him and we can
just make zalinski do what we want he's
going to do every one of these weasel
tricks he's going to have the European
Union on his side he's going to have
each of the countries over there on his
side he's going to have a lot of
Americans on his side so as long as
zinski is a weasel and whoever might
replace him would just be weasel number
two um I don't think that we can come up
with an agreement that he would
keep uh and would end the war so
situation number one that won't work and
I agree with zy on this
is trying to negotiate a peace deal
without Ukraine at table but there's one
other thing that won't work trying to
negotiate a peace agreement with Ukraine
at the table because if you put them at
the table they're going to ask for
things that nobody's going to give them
if you don't put them at the table we're
going to give away things that they're
going to you know work behind the scenes
and in every way to thwart us so you
can't make a deal with them at the table
and you definitely can't make a deal
with them not at table and those are the
only two options they're either at the
table and it doesn't work or they're not
at the table and it doesn't
work in my opinion I don't see anything
that looks like even a little bit of
progress what do you think do you see it
differently and to me it looks like um
Russia is just going to keep chewing up
whatever they can because they have such
a dominant position at this point
theoretically I mean I'm not there so
you know maybe the drones and robot dogs
that the ukrainians have are you know
can turn the tide of the war I mean
maybe but I don't see it happening
so I don't see any progress there at all
nor do I see a
path so unless something big
happens um I'm not expecting anything to
happen except the United States getting
out of the game so let me make a
prediction given that
zalinski doesn't seem to be serious
about U peace because being serious
about it would be giving up more than
he's willing to give
up but we don't have to pay for it so I
think Trump's next move would be to
remove just every bit of support for
Ukraine and say Germany I'm glad you've
increased by a trillion dollars you're
spending hey uh Great Britain and France
good luck with that we'll sell you some
weapons if you like would you like us to
sell you some weapons because we'll be
happy to sell you
stuff um but I here so that's my
prediction my prediction is no peace in
Ukraine and the United States pulls out
entirely and just says every one of
you and I think we're really close to
 every one of you you because we're
being dragged in I mean I guess we
dragged ourselves in You You could argue
that we're responsible for it but at
this point we certainly have a fiduciary
responsibility to deal with our own
budget problems and uh let them have
whatever Faith they decided they wanted
because if zinski wants to
fight why should we stop
him anyway um according to uh Live
Science an octopus has been spotted
riding on top of the world's fastest
shark this is my favorite story there's
even video of
it so somehow an octopus grabbed on the
top of a shark and it happened to be
coincidentally one of the fastest type
of sharks a short finin Macau or macow
shark and that shark can go up to 50
miles per hour underwater
can you imagine how much fun that
octopus is having right now
unless the moment it lets go the shark
is going to eat it so I don't know if
sharks eat
octopuses I think they do right are are
sharks picky about what they eat so it
could be that the octopus is thinking
okay if I ever let
go uh I'm going to be lunch or is the
octopus saying I think I just figured
out the greatest thing ever I've I've
got a pet I've got a pet that's going to
take me places man am I traveling I'm
seeing the
world so anyway they're calling it The
Sharktopus It's a combination of a shark
in an octopus the shopus it was spotted
in the haki Gulf off of New
Zealand so be careful if you go to New
Zealand because it might not be the only
shark neus there might be lots of
them and that ladies and gentlemen is
all I needed to tell you so here's what
I think I think the Ukraine war will not
turn nuclear but I think the US will
just get out and just say screw this
around
um I think that everything
economically looks positive I think that
the Democrats don't realize that they're
Tesla attack will destroy the entire
Democratic party um because I just don't
know too many normal Democrats with
Teslas who are going to put up with this
I just don't think they will I think
they're going to lose the entire
Asian-American vote if they haven't
already and because of that I mean that
that just looks like complete
lawlessness and the Asian-American
Community likes their law they like law
order and they like their Teslas so I
think that's really going to sting in a
big part of their
party I think the tariffs are going to
be nothing but positive but it will be
you know a rocky road until it is I
think inflation will get under control I
think interest rates will come down I
think our energy is almost guaranteed to
be much higher you know in a year or two
than it is now which will again bring
down prices I I think
that almost everything is going in the
right direction with
Doge um I do worry that they can't find
enough but boy does it look like there's
plenty of Fraud and Abuse it looks like
there's plenty to cut so I'm going to
I'm going to tell you that the stock
market is acting political right now
it's not acting economical if the stock
market started
acting as if economics were driving it
I think it would be discounting a lot of
the roing and would be saying you know
things are definitely starting to shape
up so we fixed the Border problem
um I I don't think education is fixed if
I had to pick one weak spot um I don't
think getting rid of the Department of
Education makes much difference but I
don't trust states to do education
because they haven't succeeded yet you
know the the idea that the states would
compete with each other to do education
better it hasn't worked yet what would
make that suddenly work so I think the
the only thing the Republicans have
there is if they can push school
choice so school choice might give you
something you know as long as everybody
has the
choice
and that ladies and gentlemen is all I
have to say today hope it hope it reduce
your anxiety a little bit and if that
doesn't work coffee can cure everything
else so I'm going to say uh a few
private words to the people on locals my
subscribers and the rest of you thanks
for joining I will see you same time
tomorrow on X and Rumble and YouTube
locals I'm coming at you
now
