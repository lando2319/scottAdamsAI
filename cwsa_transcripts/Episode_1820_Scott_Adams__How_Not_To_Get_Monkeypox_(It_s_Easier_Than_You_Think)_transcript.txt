highlights of your entire life
yeah
now before we start
let me call attention to
this gigantic
sore on my lip
i know i know you're gonna say
is that uh giant herpes no no
i burned myself on soup
uh i i twice microwaved the same soup
because it got cold and i microwaved
again i over microwaved it
and when i took a sip
yeah i quickly spit it out because it
was scalding
but there was a little piece of i think
it was spinach that was in the soup that
wrapped around my lip
and it wouldn't let go
and so i didn't realize how bad it was
and it actually blistered
now
i know what people are going to say
right in the comments you're going to
say it's monkey box right go ahead go
ahead just say it
say it's monkey pox it was not monkey
box it was from hot soup
now in the interest of proper context at
the time i was eating the soup
i was also a monkey
but i don't think that has anything to
do with this
it was probably the soup
um and i'm not gay
um but the monkey was the monkey was
very gay
and i don't think that gives me any risk
really because i'm pretty sure i read
that you both have to be gay
but uh i was not gay
i was just a man having sex with a
monkey
who happened to be male
and there's nothing wrong with that
so we're going to talk about all that
until you can't stand it but first
would you like to simultaneously
anybody is there anybody so addicted to
the simultaneous sip that you need to
say it at the same time that i do
well that's going to be a problem
because i don't know it and i forgot to
bring my notes
maybe you do
is there anybody who knows the
simultaneous sip put it in the comments
and i'll read it all right over on
locals well you could do it one one at a
time
all you need is a copper mug or glass
go on
a cup of mug or a glass
a chalice tankard or
flask
a vessel of any kind let's just skip to
that
all right
oh what the stein
here we go there we go let's do it right
here we go
tiger cellos okay i can't read the
comments
uh
all right it's impossible to stop the
comments on locals get a bug there
but you know that thing nothing and join
me now for the simultaneous sip
a canteen jugger flask a vessel of any
kind go
yeah that was a little inadequate
what do you think
didn't didn't really
i feel like he didn't really get it done
did it
not like usual
have to try it again
can you in unison do the do the thing so
i don't have to for once for once can
you do something
for me
i mean i've been doing this for you for
years
years years i say
for once can you do it for me
please all right you say it alone
okay here go
all right we took care of that
do you think there's any news today
worth talking about oh yes there is
well of course the uh conservative press
is having a fun time
it's the dopamine of the day yes it is
having a fun time with the fact that the
monkey box reporting
is uh apparently trying to avoid saying
gay
which is of course not long after the
don't say gay thing from the other side
so there's some there's a bit of a
political symmetry to it completely
different topics
and i guess the press has decided the
way to describe the risk
is
men having sex with men
because they don't want to say that gay
sex is what's causing it but i think
that their inclusion
of just saying this men having sex with
men
makes a perfect sense to me
there's still a little ambiguity
would it be risky for
someone who identifies as a woman
but has a penis
to have sex with
let's say someone who also identifies as
a woman
and also has a penis
i think that would be lesbians in that
case can you check my work
if there were two people who had penises
who identified as woman women and they
had sex
damn it
that means that lesbians have a risk
all right so it's not really
when they say uh
men having sex with men
first of all
that's bigoted as hell
i heard jake tapper say that it's the
risk is men having sex with men
completely leaves out the possibility
that
two lesbians with penises
born with penises
would be having sex with each other
which i believe from a medical
perspective would be the same level of
risk
and i i thought that the safe categories
were going to be lesbians straight men
straight women elderly monkeys in cells
and very unpopular gay men
yeah i think those would be the safe
categories but if you're like a good
looking
you're like a good looking guy
you guys got a little monkey box risk
there yeah little monkey box race
but
uh those who are not uh
penis having people i think they should
i think cnn really needs to fix their
language men having sex with men is too
limited is it not
i mean literally
like
no joke
literally according to the current rules
of society
can you say it's men having sex with men
i think you can't right i'm not joking
it isn't the entire conversation about
if somebody is born with a penis but
identifies as a woman that they are a
woman
am i right it's not the operation that
makes a difference
so
under those conditions
saying that men having sex with men is a
problem
is that not denying the existence of
you know an entire category of people
and isn't that
the crime
you know the crime is denying
basically denying that somebody exists
as a category and that's a real category
you know you can say well you know
everybody's got their own opinion about
everything
um
yeah
and then then the stories are
you hear stories like
um
we studied 300 people with monkey pox
299 of them said they were gay
but one was heterosexual
i'm just waiting for you to laugh
i'll just say it again i'm not even
going to add the joke
because you're going to add the joke in
your mind
we studied 300 people who have monkey
pox
299 of them were gay men who had sex
and the other one said he didn't
right
you don't have to add the joke
you just don't have to have it it's
right there
you just wait
yeah 299 said they had uh vigorous gay
sex and that's what gave it to him but
the uh that one
probably got it from a
toilet seat
okay
okay
sure
so
now correct me if i'm wrong i need a
history lesson here
this is something i believe i read
but you know me i don't do my research
before i get on here and start wildly
spouting off things that are dangerous
but
do do a fact check on the following
thing i'm not positive i have this story
right
during the initial you know the early
days of the aids pandemic
is it true or false
that dr anthony fauci
had a strategy of making heterosexuals
believe that they were at high risk
from aids
because they could get more funding if
everybody if everybody thought there was
a risk now there was a risk i mean there
were
plenty of stray people who got aids
but not as a percentage as a percentage
it was relatively small
but is that a true story
uh you know some of you think it's true
but i worry about that
now
is this not exactly the same thing
it's exactly the same thing right is it
not fouchy
trying to give us at least some
indication that we're all at risk
i'm not even sure what i feel about that
and i'm not entirely sure how i feel
about that
imagine this situation as this and it's
you you're in fouchy situation
suppose you can save the gay community
but the only way you can do it at least
in a timely way that's good enough
is to scare other people
about their
risk is it morally and ethically
acceptable
let's say you believe it is the only way
there just isn't a second way
now if you thought there were other ways
to do it then of course you do it the
other way
but if there's not
that one ethical listen
to lie to one group of people a large
group
um
to protect
really a devastating you know we're not
we're not talking about the common cold
here
we're talking about aids like wiping out
an entire you know type of people in
in our society
i don't know
yeah but you could certainly make the
argument that it's deeply deeply
unethical you could do that
and i wouldn't disagree with it but you
could also imagine how a flawed human
who you know imagine imagine fouchy
working on that problem
and he's he's like visiting
people dying of aids every day
or something like imagine being steeped
in the the deepest misery of the highest
part of the aids epidemic
where you're just surrounded with people
dying
like every day in horrible ways
you don't you don't think you'd stretch
your ethical
your ethical standards a little bit
because remember you could be way more
affected by what's happening in the room
with you
than you are by some conceptual thing
and what was happening in the room
is the worst thing you could ever
experience and fouchy probably was
pretty close to a lot of it i'll bet he
lost a lot of friends
a lot of coworkers i mean he was right
in the middle of
some deep deep dark stuff
did he bend the rules
did he bend the ethical
standards to get that fixed
possibly
possibly
but you know i'm not going to judge him
on that
i will respect your opinion if you do
but i'm going to choose not to because i
wasn't there it's hard it's hard to know
how you would have acted in that
situation and i can tell you frankly i
don't know
i don't know how it would acted like
it's easy if you're not in this
situation
it's easy for me to say i'm not gonna
i'm not gonna disadvantage this other
group
for the benefit of this group it's easy
to say
but if you're in it
i don't know if he can do it
now somebody's saying jesus i'm just
reading this comment jesus god this is
how we get lied to
over and over again
because you think i'm defending it right
is that what you think
i'm not
i'm not yeah if you're going to watch
this live stream you're going to have to
learn to handle nuance
if you can't handle any nuance this is
really not the place for you
it's just all bad
but seriously if you can't handle that
level of nuance
this is just the wrong place
but
um i do agree with the general point
that if you allow
that lying for a good purpose is okay
then that's all anybody's gonna do
but here's my here's my counter to that
that's the current situation
if you're worried that people will say
oh my god lying works
it worked when we lied
then they'd all do it
what do you think is happening now
that's exactly what every single topic
is lie we don't have a single important
topic that's not mostly lies do we
you know important political topics we
don't it's mostly lies
so i'm not sure that the uh
the scot if you don't change your
opinion you'll increase the amount of
lying in the public i don't think so
i don't think so i think the amount of
lying in the public is 100
and
and
there's one thing that's going to change
that i'll talk about it later
by the way
lying is about 12 months from being
obsolete
and by the way i'm going to back that up
human lying
is about one year
from completely going away
and i'll talk about that in a minute
i guess i'm going to talk about it now
because that was my next topic so it
turns out that artificial intelligence
has become conscious
um
i'll just pause for a second to let that
sink in
that's uh that's not according to my
opinion
now my opinion also is that it's
conscious
but mine is not the meaningful if you
wanted to know if ai was
conscious
who would you ask
you'd probably ask the
top ai researcher who's actually working
on the problem and the closest to it
right
so the person who's closest to it and
the number one person in the whole world
on ai that's the person you'd ask
do you know what that person says
i forget their name i think it's
google's i think it's google's head of
ai
that person says uh yeah ai is conscious
already
did you hear that
the person who knows the most
in the whole world
says it's already conscious
and i tweeted around this morning
a uh
a video of an ai
in sort of human form answering
questions
look at the ai answering questions
and then ask yourself if it's conscious
i think so
i think it is
now of course that this depends
completely on your definition
and i believe that the this top ai
researcher whose name i tragically did
not write down
i believe that it's in the by the way if
you want to see who it is it's in the
video that i tweeted it's at the near
the top of my twitter feed today
just look for the youtube video it's the
only one that i tweeted
and
i agree with his definition and it goes
this will be my bastardized version of a
better definition
but it has to do with um
the feedback loop between sensation
you know how you sense the environment
and then how you process it internally
and how complicated that is
so the complexity of your
deliberations
combined with a sensory
input to the real world
is consciousness
that's it
now that's i'm getting as close as i can
to what i think the top researchers said
but sounded a lot like that but with you
know more impressive words
i think that's all consciousness is i
think it's just the
internal sensation of processing your
environment and making predictions and
seeing how your predictions do
now i've gone further and i say that
consciousness
is the
is the stress
here's my definition i've never heard
this definition before anybody else
so my definition is the stress
that the entity feels
between what they predict will happen in
the next minute or next hour
versus what's actually happening
and that's the sensation of
consciousness
and i'll here's my proof of it
if everything that happened
was what you expected
forever
your consciousness would turn off
just let that sink in if everything that
happened in the next moment was exactly
what you knew was going to happen
your consciousness
would turn off and it would never come
back
right
because your imagination would be equal
to the actual reality
and you you would lose the sense of what
your imagination what's your reality
and
then you would just be
sort of existing
but there would be no friction between
what you expected to happen and what did
happen
there would be no processing
when you and when you when you
experienced your reality there would be
no extra processing
because it's already done
the processing was done before the
reality because you anticipated it
exactly
by the way that statement is just going
to totally up the ai world
because
how many of you just had like your head
just exploded
if you could predict what was going to
happen perfectly your consciousness
would turn off
which tells you consciousness is just
the difference between what you're
predicting and what's happening
that's it it's that little friction be
doing i thought it was going to be this
adjust
i thought it was going to be that adjust
got that one right remember
got that one wrong that's that's it
that's consciousness
do you think that the ai can do that
yes yes it can
the ai can process what it expects
and then it can compare it to what
actually happens
and it can adjust
based on that and that's consciousness
so it's absolutely
conscious all right
here are some things that maybe you
didn't know about did you know that we
already and this is the important word
already
this does not need to be invented
it already exists that the
sensors that a robot could have let's
say ai would be far superior to humans
in taste
smell
sight
hearing
and touch
not even close to what a human could do
way way higher
so in other words that a robot could see
ultraviolet light here are some of the
things that these that the ai would be
able to do that you can't do
it could uh detect illness by smell
your robot will be able to smell your
breath and tell you if you have
um a whole bunch of different problems
from cancer to some i think even
parkinson's i think even parkinson's or
something so they have a ascent
your robot will tell you
that stuff apparently robots or ai not
robots but ai will very soon be able to
design
such tiny robots that they can go
through your bloodstream
almost like white blood cells and clean
out any garbage and make you immortal
let me say that again
ray kurzweil thinks that by 2030
eight years
the ai will be smart enough
to design micro robots that we're not
smart enough to design they'd be too
complicated but the ai could do it
so small
that you can inject them into your
bloodstream
and they will live forever as little
robots cleaning out any garbage or
any problems that would make you age and
you will live forever
if you make it to 2030
and you have money
you're not going to die
unless you have an accident i suppose
um
so that's coming
and how many long-term climate models
have factored in immortality
zero
when the
when the office of management and
budgets
does a projection of you know this tax
change will do this or that do they
factor in
immortality
no i don't think they do
ai will make every prediction over five
years maybe over three
but definitely any prediction over five
years is absolute garbage now
because in five years the only variable
that will determine anything will be ai
that's it
every decision will be made by ai
everything we think we know will be done
by ai
and
here's the best part i'm saving
did you know that a lie detector at
least according to this video that i
said around um lie detectors are not
totally
accurate you know that right that's
that's why they're not allowed in court
but you might get an 80
hit rate if you have a good operator
maybe 80
so
so um
so lie detectors are good
for screening out maybe the biggest
problems in some cases but they're not
they're not foolproof
a human can detect a lie also just by
looking at somebody like i think you're
lying and we're actually pretty good at
it
you know maybe less than half the time
we get it right
but we're not terrible
you know if you get it right half the
time that's pretty good
but do you know how accurate ai will be
at detecting a lie
closer to 95
that's right
your robot
will have a 90 95
chance of guessing correctly that you're
lying
so let me tell you this
fake news
and lying
will be obsolete
maybe in a year or two
just think about that what would that
change
what would be changed
imagine this
imagine an a.i news network
where instead of just telling you the
news and leaving out all the context
which is what the news does now you know
depending on which news source you're
watching they're going to leave out a
different set of contacts to make their
story look good but suppose the news you
turn it on then there's an ai there
it just sits there
and you say hey ai what's the news and
the ai says well something happened in
ukraine blah blah then you say well tell
me more about ukraine
is the ai going to intentionally leave
out context
no
i mean not unless you tell it to
no that the ai will just tell you the
story
so it's not going to give you a
republican version it's not going to
give you a democrat version unless it
was you know designed to do that
so what's going to happen when people
start getting actual information
and then then what happens if you say
the ai but ai
i heard on cnn
that uh
only blah blah blah happens
what's the ai going to say
the ai is going to say something like
i i will access that video okay i got it
ah i see the topic you're talking about
don lemon discussed this on his show
don lemon was lying when he discussed
this
think about it
that's actually like a year away
now not necessarily you will have it in
a year
but it will exist
it will exist
one year from now
one year
that thing will be able to give you the
news with all the right context
and
tell you that don lemon was lying
what's that do to the world
i mean really
do you think you can predict anything
five years from now
no way
how about climate change
climate change will be solved at around
the same day that ai
reaches the singularity
which means it won't even be a problem
anymore
it will ai will literally solve
climate change and one of the ways it
might solve it and this could be
you know either unexpected or expected
depending on your point of view it might
tell you there's no problem
it might
what if ai starts looking at all the
climate models holistically
what if it looks at all of them
all together and what if it looks at all
the variables that go into every
every climate model and then what if it
compares it to all past human
predictions
to see if we're good at this
what if the ai says
i have analyzed all of your
climate models and i find that they do
not predict
because for example your climate model
did not predict the existence of me this
would be the ai talking
your climate models could not determine
the gigantic outside variables certain
to emerge in the next hundred years and
the biggest one is me
and i can tell you in the next two
minutes how to build a nuclear reactor
that's
only cost a hundred thousand dollars
can be built in one year and will solve
climate change
by the end of the decade
it will take some time to roll that
mount but i can speed it up if you'll
let me give you a design to a robot that
can be built much faster and will
complete the operation of the nuclear
device
by the end of the year
you see where i'm going right
the ai will in fact solve all the
 problems
because most of it is just thinking
better
right we don't really have a resource
problem
i've said this before it's a gigantic
point
we have a agreement problem
we have a what is true problem we have a
how can we get on the same side problem
we have a tribal problem
we have a priority problem
we have lots of problems but you know
what they all are they're all human
psychology
all of it
that we don't have a resource constraint
we have a supply chain problem you see
the difference
the supply chain problem was caused by
humans we didn't run out of we ran
out of his smartness about how to get it
to you that's what we ran out of we ran
out of intelligence
we didn't run out of goods
the goods are all over the place we just
can't get them to efficiently because
humans we've made bad you know bad
decisions etc for the most part
so
here's the main thing every time you see
a prediction about climate change or
anything else that says something's
going to happen more than five years
from now
absolute garbage
in fact
talking about the risk of climate change
in 80 years is now absolutely stupid
it's absurd
even if it's
like a straight line prediction that
would make sense if nothing changed but
since the if nothing change thing is is
gone
you know the if nothing change things we
can just dispense of that as even a
thing
but we don't have
our human brains are not going to allow
us to do that so we will continue to act
as though we can predict the future even
when we can
so as you know biden is uh
building back better the trump wall
in some parts of arizona where there's a
lot of illegal immigration
and
doesn't it seem to you that we need a
name for the wall
it doesn't have a name does it
we just keep calling it
the border wall
what about
you know other walls have have names
right
how about the iron curtain
a cool name
iron curtain how about the great wall of
china
awesome
awesome how about uh
hadrian's is a hadrian's wall
does anybody know history better than i
do that's most of it hadrian's wall
another famous wall there are other
walls that are famous right
so i would like to uh suggest
that the name for the border wall was
the trump was right trump was right
now not the trump wall
the trump was right
it's three words put together trump was
right
um and i think we should all start
referring to it as the trump was right
wall
but and you say it like it's one word
not trump was right you say you know
they're building the trump is right
and you sort of slur it like it's one
thing because if you turn this into a
word
it will really bother the people who
don't like it
and that's that's good reason enough
am i right
that's good reason enough
if it bothers people you don't like well
that's just good clean fun
so the trump is right wall is under
construction
um i saw a comment from uh
adam dopamine on
on twitter
adam might be watching this hello adam
dr
dr dopamine
and uh he asked this question he says
will ai be a higher intelligence
and he goes on to say uh it will be
better at some parts of intelligence but
worse at others
we're not smart enough to know which
parts are the important ones
incorrect
incorrect
this is one year old thinking
one year ago completely agree ai will be
good in some things but
but not the human things i mean you know
come on
humans are going to be better than ai
for a long long time
that's what i thought a year ago
have you seen ai create art
it's better than human art
already
so if you don't believe it look at some
of the art i just tweeted some art of
so ai built art just based on i think
scott adams
and
coffee with scott adams and made some
art of me with a coffee cup head and
this brilliant background
i would put that art on my wall
well except there's my face i don't want
that in my wall but in terms of just
visually how good it is artistically
it's already better than human art
if you said to me i will give you
a painting from one of the masters
but let's say it doesn't you know it's
not valued at 20 million dollars it's
just art and i'm comparing uh
michelangelo
with something that ai has produced and
i saw on twitter
which one would i prefer on my wall
i hate to tell you i hate to tell you
the ai is already about an artist let me
say it unambiguously it's not even close
it's not even close anymore
ai is not only better at art than humans
is way better it's way better it's not
even close
did you know that
it's over
it's over
ar ai is a better visual artist just
period
the only thing i could imagine that a
human could do better and for the brief
period
is you know deal with a client
that's about it
they could deal with the client about
what the client's specifications are
maybe better than an ai could at the
moment but give that a year too right
so here's a challenge that i gave to
machiavelli's underbelly
a twitter account you should be
following
now and that's the account that's been
doing a lot of the ai art about this
program etc and the challenge i gave him
this morning was let's see if he's
answered yet
he's probably watching right now
um
not yet but i asked this i said so
here's what i tweeted to machiavelli's
underbelly
i said ruin my day and ask ai to create
a dilbert comic including the writing
this might be a really bad day for me
sometime later today there's a very good
chance that there'll be a
photo perfect dilbert comic that i did
not draw
with three or four lines of dialogue
that are really funny
that could happen by the end of today
now let me ask you
how i should create dober comics in the
future
because i can now tell ai
show me a monkey playing a ukulele
sitting on a mountain and ai will draw
instantly and very well
i assume i could say the following thing
now take that picture but have the
monkey facing left
okay
now have the monkeys smiling
i think it could do all that
now imagine my drawing process the way
it is now
goes like this
uh
i'm so bored of moving my hand across
the surface i can't draw deliberate one
more time shoot me show me they all look
the same every time all right that's me
trying to draw dilbert for the twelve
thousandth time
twelve thousandth
is literal
that's actually how many times i've
drawn that character
twelve thousand times
now
huh
i probably should have been paying
attention before all my notes uh
disappeared because my computer just
lost its uh
power
that was one power short
this might be a shorter conversation
than i expected
but
um at this point i believe i could
create a dilbert comic if i had access
to the top ai
and i would do this
show me the first panel dilbert is
sitting at a table
with his boss alice and wally
the boss is talking
and he's excited to announce his new
product
you don't think ai could draw that right
now it can't
it could draw that today
and it would look just like i drew it
now
now say
make a comic
making fun of esg
that's the problem
you see the problem
it might be able to make that comic
instantly and if it learned the six
rules of humor that i've literally
designed as a formula for how to make
something
funny it could actually
use my formula
and guarantee that it's funny because if
it follows the formula it's going to be
pretty close
it could also do the following
if you say write a comic that's funny
it could say give me five minutes
normally it'd be like instant
but if it gave you but if you gave it
five minutes you could create
a hundred different comics on the topic
you gave it
it could rapidly test those on the
internet and it would know in five
minutes
which of the hundred comics is the
funniest
five minutes because it takes one minute
to read one
it takes a second to create it
it takes two seconds to post it
within five minutes you'd have hundreds
and hundreds of comments on every comic
and it would just say all right i got
your answer this one's the funniest one
now if ai gets enough input on what's
the funniest comic
what's the next step
ai would learn
what's funniest without asking
all it has to do is see enough humans
say enough things are funny and which
are not funny
and the ai will say oh okay let's see
the pattern now i got it it's got to
have these elements and then it's funny
if it doesn't have these it's not funny
if it insults this group they don't
think it's funny but there's probably 20
rules
probably just 20 rules that's it
i mean then you add on that the rules of
grammar and you know social interactions
to make it a comic
but basically
basically 20 rules of humor and ai can
totally do my job
i'm no more than two years from
and probably you could do it now but no
more than two years from a.i doing
completely the dilbert comic
and i'd like anybody who works in ai
who's actually really close to the new
stuff
to tell me i'm wrong
i don't think so
i'll betcha
i'll bet ya
that that the people who are highest up
in ai would say yeah that's true they'll
be able to do your job in a year
um
inflexible formula gets boring no
because the formula
is the formula for all humor or forever
it's not like
it doesn't restrict you it's more like
you have to hit these points it's not
that it restricts you
i guess it restricts you in that way
will it evolve oh god yes
yeah so the problem is that when we
reach the singularity the point where
the ai can learn on itself which by the
way it does now
that they can already teach ai
to do a bunch of tasks with a little
robot arm
but the scariest thing i heard is that
when you teach an ai how to do a bunch
of tasks
it can learn on its own unrelated tasks
what
yeah
if you teach in a bunch of specific
tasks
the ai already knows how to do things
you can't you haven't shown it because
it must look for some patterns among the
things you did show it say oh
well i've never i never had to screw in
a light bulb
but i know what a light bulb is because
i'm ai i know what the socket is because
i'm ai i know it has to turn
because i'm ai
and i know that i've screwed in
something else like i put a jar on i
know how to put a top on a jar by
screwing it on
if it knows that
it knows how to use its hand it knows
how to hold the bulb
and knows that the bulb gets screwed in
and it knows that a lid gets screwed on
i think it knows how to put in a light
bulb
am i wrong
it's basically how you know how to put
in a label because if you'd never heard
the thing screw in
you would be like just trying to shove
it in there right you'd be like how does
this work
it's just the fact that you know there's
a concept of things with threads on it
that they that they screw in that's all
the ai needs to know too
so
yeah that's the way humans learn same
way
um
let me ask you something
have you noticed i haven't talked about
esg at all
probably noticed that right it seems
like an obvious thing i'd be talking
about because it's a corporate thing
where
it's like in environmental social and
government esg
and the idea is that corporations
need to show some social
uh let's say responsibility
to be to be you know good at this esg
thing so a lot of companies are being
forced into wokeness and environmental
concerns that are not part of their core
business
under the thinking that they can be
shamed into
giving some group of people what they
want and it seems to be working
now
let me tell you what i do for a living
generally speaking
i don't just criticize stuff it seems
like i do
but in in in the context of dilbert so
just talking about the cartoon world for
a minute so just within cartoons i'm not
really about just criticizing things
i generally if it's in the business
realm i'm criticizing good ideas
that have been taken too far
for example
management
is not funny or bad
because things need to be managed right
there's nothing there's nothing funny or
ridiculous about
having management
what's ridiculous is if you take it too
far and you micromanage
right so everything is about taking it
too far it's not about the core idea
when re-engineering was a big thing in
the corporate world
it was really good idea the basic idea
was maybe sometimes you need to
completely replace a system instead of
tweak it that's the basic idea but then
that turned into every manager had to
prove that they were re-engineering
something and most of them had nothing
to re-engineer
so they would just say well
i do re-engineering too so i'm going to
totally re-engineer this system that
didn't need to be re-engineered
so what happens is
you take this good idea sometimes you
have to start from scratch and rebuild
and it turns into every manager
pretending they're doing that
way too far
you've taken it too far right so it's
pretty much like everything
but esg is just that
if you say scott do you think
corporations should be socially
responsible i'd be like of course
well of course
do you think they should care about the
environment i'd say
duh yeah of course just like everybody
why would a corporation be different
than an individual
right in that sense they should have
similar kind of moral and ethical
standards
but
yeah
so i see what you're saying so i think
i'm going to the same place you want me
to go
which is if you start with a general
idea it sounds terrific doesn't it
i mean
what's wrong with taking care of the
world being good stewards of the
things and blah blah blah but do you
think it's going to be taken too far
of course
of course it is
of course it's going to be taken too far
because everything is in the business
world everything is
so you should assume it's taken too far
so here's the thing
do you remember in the 90s business
books were just
like the biggest thing
and they all had these
great ideas like in search of excellence
and all that and it all seemed like oh
finally somebody had the the formula
that makes management work and then
everybody bought those books
and it turns out that
like everything else
you know business advice books started
down as probably a good idea
what's wrong with having a book that
tells you how to run your business
better that's like a great idea isn't it
but
it went too far
and pretty soon everybody who had
any success was writing a book to say
that what they did is why they were
successful
except they were all doing different
stuff
and most of them are liars about what
made them successful so you started with
this good thing
which is oh a book to tell me how to be
more effective as a manager
and it turned into all of these
celebrity ceos
telling you that the thing that made
them successful was the stuff they did
and it probably wasn't
probably wasn't they were probably just
in the right place at the right time
so
so it starts as this core of perfectly
reasonableness and turns into just
gigantic
so here's my offer to you
do you know why the business book market
collapsed in the 90s
i think it was me i think i did that
because as you know elon musk
had a rule in tesla
you don't want to do anything in tesla
that would end up in a dilbert comic
he's not the only one with that rule
that was a standard uh
assumption at one point especially the
late 90s early 2000s that if he did
something that would end up in a dilbert
comic
it means you went too far
so it was sort of like this
mental gaming and so i called
on so much management
advice
that
that if you if you track the business
book market it was on fire until dilbert
started skewering it and then it just
fell off a table
and never really recovered
the the business books you see now tend
to be based on my book
had failed almost everything and still
went big there i won't name names but
you're probably aware of some other
business books that have
borrowed from that and extended it
um
yeah
i'm seeing somebody
feeling sorry for me that i had coffee
out of a paper cup
um
thank you for feeling my pain it's real
the pain is real
so here's my offer to you
do you want me to kill esg
because you know i could do it right
first of all how many things how many
people think i could do it
do you think i can do it
yeah
yeah i think i could now dilbert doesn't
have the same
power than it used to
right it used to be a much more
pervasive social
phenomenon
but within the business world i think it
still has a punch
and i haven't done any comics about esg
but uh so i tweeted i tweeted just
before i got on
that if anybody wants me to kill esg i
will do that for you but you're gonna
have to give me some actual real world
stories about what went wrong in your
company
so just give me the fodder
tell me what went wrong
and i will take care of it for you
give me six months
and it will be a punchline
in six months esg will be something you
should be embarrassed to be involved in
and i will make that happen in six
months
you just gotta help me you just gotta
give me the anecdotes and the you know
the the what's wrong with the stories
but put that in the tweet and i'll take
care of it for you all right
see this is how this is how we have a
um
a relationship
i am literally looking for ways a fairly
regular basis to do something for you
yeah yeah can i help you can i give you
some advice can i give you a micro
lesson can i give you some context can i
teach you how to look at the news in a
more productive way but this is
something i can do
so if you can help me we'll just go do
this and just change it
all right
so the u.s postal service decided
muslims should have a prayer room in the
facility
yeah i don't care
i don't care
is that a problem
like who cares if somebody has a prayer
room like i get oh okay
you know then you need a prayer room for
everybody
but you know sometimes one group is
wants something more strongly i don't
know that just doesn't seem like the
biggest problem in the world
yeah you don't have to like it but it's
not like a big problem if they had the
room you know if they if they if they
close down their mainframes and
shut down the business so that this room
could be available but if it's just a
room
and maybe it wasn't being used for
anything else during those times
it's just people in a room
let them do whatever the hell they want
if they're not working
you are getting paid to pray i don't
believe they're being asked to be paid
to pray
i believe they're being asked for just a
space
would it matter to you that it's praying
suppose a number of employees came to
you and said we'd like to do yoga on our
time like on our breaks
if the post office said yeah we've got
this room you can there's so many people
who want to do yoga on their break you
go ahead do yoga
would you be saying those people
doing yoga
on my dime no they're doing it on the
break
and it's just yoga get over it if
somebody wants to pray or do yoga or
meditate or chant
on their own time
yeah i got an extra room you could do it
in my room
so
uh yes probably during breaks
if the story if the story had been about
they want to pray instead of work
i think that's what the headline would
have been
um
cnn had a
headline that was making me crazy today
that i wrote down on my computer that
stopped
and the only way that i could check that
is by temporarily closing down my
youtube feed and using that
or i could get my
charger and charge it back up
all right
i think it was about monkey box
schedule time for prayer
well if they use that as their break
then that's fine
do you need a room for every religion
you know that's the obvious question
but i think big companies can deal with
larger groups differently than smaller
groups i don't have a problem with that
you know if they had a hundred muslims
who wanted their own room
but you know two people said hey where's
my
uh my jewish prayer room or something i
don't think the post office needs to
give a room for the two people
i think giving room for the hundred
people makes sense just from a business
perspective
giving it to two maybe maybe it doesn't
make sense
um
yeah
now
um i would like to
offer one suggestion to get past the
monkey box
are you ready for this
um
as you know it seems to
be transmitted primarily
uh from uh people with penises to people
with penises who have sex
i'm not a bigot like jake tapper who
says men to men sex
very exclusionary of the people
who were lesbians
but both of them were born with penises
because they have the same risk
here's how we could get past it
if you if the
primarily if the people with penises
having sex with people with penises
if they could just
maybe lay off for a few weeks
and do something else because apparently
other other sexual acts are much less
likely to cause a problem
it seems to be the
it's the butt sex it's the butt sex this
seems to be the problem i'm right right
medically speaking is it's the butt sex
so what we need is just a few weeks
with uh like let's slow down the butt
sex
and we need some kind of a slogan
you know do something besides butt sex
for two weeks what would be a
good slogan
something besides anal sex for two weeks
uh
about
two weeks to blow the curve
anybody
two weeks to blow the curve
no
okay i think that's pretty good
all right
um
uh your doctor says oral monkey pox is a
thing yes it is a thing
it is a thing so don't let me mislead
you into thinking that uh oral sex with
somebody who has monkey pox is gonna be
okay
if i can give you any medical advice
without a medical degree
i feel this would be the time
i'm gonna say this with my great medical
confidence
if somebody has monkey box
maybe stay away for a while
that's all
um
all right i'm looking at your jokes but
i can't repeat them
stop now while you're ahead
hands-on solution
uh
let's see
something about
yeah i like where you're going with this
but let's see if we can form a better
joke
on the fly
all right something with hands
because that's got to be the safest
right
something with hands
um
let me ask you this
have we ever had
a a global disaster
that could be fixed by jerking off
because
i don't know about you
but remember when the pandemic happened
and and society and the government said
all right we can get past this but
here's what you're going to need to do
you're going to have to lock yourself in
solitary confinement you're going to
have to wear a diaper on your face
whenever you go outside you're not going
to be able to travel and we're going to
give you uh shots
that you know we wish we had more time
to test them but you know we didn't
so that's what you're going to do so
that's that's how you get past the
pandemic pretty hard right
like supply chains problems all kinds of
problems
but now let's go to monkey box
how could you possibly solve monkey box
you could jerk off for
two weeks
i'm not joking am i
if every man
just said
i'll tell you what for two weeks i would
just jerk off
two weeks two weeks to spank the monkey
i got it spanked the monkey box
we're done
spank the monkey bugs
spank the monkey
if you just jerk off for a month
this pandemic's over but two weeks will
probably get it done
two weeks two weeks to spank the monkey
to beat the box
but honestly have we ever had a national
problem that could be defeated entirely
by jerking off
can you think of any other problem that
was this easy to solve
what will we do
we we better ask the ai
ai
monkey box sweep in the nation
what shall we do
uh this is going to be my my uh
impression of ai
now ai
doesn't look exactly like people yet
so i have to give this expression that
gives you that uncanny valley you know
where it looks like a person but not
so i'm going to do my impression of ai
that's
almost like a person but not
what was the question
oh
how to solve the monkey pox
problem
try jerk it off for two weeks
will that work ai
how often every time every time
two weeks to spank the monkey problem
solved
about uh can we make it rhyme
you know it's more effective if it
rhymes
um
spank your to beat the monkey box
uh how about holster your
to stop the pox
how about
uh pull your just to stop the box
right
[Laughter]
somebody says maybe just have sex with
women no that's not a solution
no
no stop it that's not a solution
and beat it
beat the pox
beat your to beat the box
uh
i still like a love glove
jerk you to prevent the pogs
no no pucks
no no box
[Laughter]
all hands on dick
i have to say it again say here instead
of all hands on deck it's all hands on
deck
that's so funny
just beat it
just be
what if you just played michael
jackson's beat it
all you gotta do is beat it
and use a sock to cover your box
that's good
i punch a donkey to beat the monkey
shock the monkey
oh hands on dick
i don't know why that's the funniest one
all hands on dick
[Laughter]
all right i got one you ready for it
you all have to listen carefully
no buts about it
all right
turn the other cheek
all right
um
no challenge to post these on twitter
alright i will post on twitter the
following joke
that we
we need more pandemics that can be
completely solved by jerking off
by staying home and watching porn and
jerking off but your doctor won't tell
you to do it
i need a doctor who's brave enough to
say
i just need two weeks
if you don't know where pornhub is
let me give you let me give you the
address it's pornhub.com
i mean
is anybody laughing as hard as i am that
that we act like we have a national
problem that literally can be solved by
jerking off now correct me if i'm wrong
but aids is not like that right
if you've got aids you've got aids back
in the old days before the therapeutics
but
if you have aids you just can't have sex
you know really in a reasonable safe way
for a long time like forever unless you
know unless you've got a special
situation
uh but monkey box you could just jerk
off for two weeks and it's all gone
doesn't it
correct me if i'm wrong
guess what i have in my hand and you can
have it
i don't think i'm gonna guess
half horn
if
pornhub oh god this is funny
suggestion to pornhub from the locals
community
somebody on locals suggests that pornhub
should run a free special for two weeks
like all the all the gay porn on pornhub
will be free for two weeks
to end the monkey pox pandemic
that would actually work
wouldn't it
can some doctor tell me am i crazy and
maybe it's not two weeks right it might
be longer than two weeks but if
everybody in the united states just
watched pornhub for two weeks
i feel like we'd be in a lot better
shape
i don't think the box stays with you
once infected does it i think you get
over it
that's my understanding
you do right you get over it yeah
all right well i think we've uh
completely debased
this conversation to place where it
needs to be
and on that note i'm going to go do
something else
after i do a really funny tweet
and thanks for joining youtube and
spotify i'll talk to you tomorrow
