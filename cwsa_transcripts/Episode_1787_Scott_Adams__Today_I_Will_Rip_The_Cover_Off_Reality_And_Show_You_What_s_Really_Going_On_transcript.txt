thing that civilization has ever
offered up it's called coffee with scott
adams and you're lucky enough to be here
for it either live wow
or recorded still amazing
still amazing and has some advantages
too such as you can put me on fast
forward and listen to be at 1.25
to 1.75 speed
which i've been told
optimizes for my sleepy presentation
but
if you'd like to consume it in a
different way
you'd like to be part of something
you'd like me to keep you company while
you exercise or maybe keep you company
while you're getting ready for your day
or avoiding your boss or doing a boring
thing on a spreadsheet on your computer
oh you know who you are
if you're using me that way
then it doesn't matter what i say so
much it just matters that i'm chattering
in your ear and keeping you company and
i'm your invisible friend so whether i'm
your invisible friend or the person
who's telling you
the most
unusual takes
on reality either way
you're going to take it up a notch with
a simultaneous sip and all you need is a
cup or a mug or glass up tanker chelsea
stein a canteen jogger flask a vessel of
any car and fill it with your favorite
liquid
i like coffee
now join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dope being here of the day
the thing that makes everything in this
reality
and every other one
excellent it's called the simultaneous
step it happens now go
if your coffee was too hot
just blow on it
that's the kind of tips you come here
for
well i'd like to tell you my best worst
idea
would you like to hear it
my best worst idea this is something
that i was pretty sure was one of my
best ideas
i mean i felt pretty strongly about it
i found out yesterday it's my worst idea
and it goes like this i saw a map
of abandoned uh railroad tracks in the
united states
places that no longer have a railroad
but you know they still have the
right-of-way exists
and
i said and by the way this isn't my you
know i'm not the first person to think
of this there's an actual effort an
organization raising money to do this
called rails to trails
and i said hey with all these e-bikes
and other e-conveyances like scooters
and carts and whatnot
why don't we build a network
of interconnected
paths that have no regular vehicles on
no cars
and you could come to america and for
the price of practically nothing
as long as you had time
travel around and you'd build out
tourist industries along the ways and
you'd be able to basically connect
everything in america or you'd get
pretty close to it
um in a way that would be way more fun
than taking a bus or riding a plane or
whatever
and i thought imagine all the people who
would come to america
just to see the natural beauty
and uh and and traverse it from one
place to another and and let's say you
make sure that the
most important monuments and
and tourist sites are all part of the
network now
tell me
isn't that the best idea you've heard in
a long time it would be clean
um clean industry
it would attract the right kind of money
and people it would make it look like it
was a great place to live
come on that's one of the best ideas
you've ever heard that's actually one of
the worst ideas you've ever heard i'm
going to tell you in a minute
so
here's why
it's the worst idea in the world
that i didn't know this
turns out i'm not such a a lawyer
and
i thought
i thought
you could acquire the rights for these
your rail lines you know somebody must
own them that would be happy to sell
them and
that's almost true
so it turns out you can go to the people
who own the right-of-ways
and you could say can we buy this
right-of-way there used to be a train
track and and they can sell it to you if
they want to
so that part works
they're they're not doing anything with
it at the moment has no value
so they just sell you the right away you
use it for the bikes boom so far
so far
it's still the best idea you've ever
heard
it's actually the worst idea i'm gonna
get to that
here's the part i didn't know
the trade tracks all go across or mostly
private property
at some point the government said to the
people who owned that private property
you know that private property of yours
is right in the place that we'd like to
put a train track
so we're taking it
we're stealing your private property but
is for the greater good
so i'm not complaining about that
it's eminent domain it's
part of the system
if it happens to you you hate it
but you know you could argue this for
the greater good
now
it turns out that all those private
owners who were forced to give away
their property for the or sell it i
guess for the greater good
the way the contracts are written is if
the trains no longer need it
it would revert back to them because
it's
their property
and now the bicycle people are trying to
say hey instead of reverting back to the
land owner
why don't you just give it to us and
we'll use it for
why don't you sell it to us so the
landowner
doesn't get the money when somebody buys
the
the right-of-way
because they're only buying the right to
it they're not buying the land
so basically it's this huge
huge land grab effectively of private
land
in effect
so i mean it's the right of ways you
could argue
but uh so i thought it was a great idea
but when you get down to what it does to
private land ownership feels a little
bit
wrong to do it that way if it's
voluntary
you know if somebody could find a way to
make enough money from it
then that would be different
well the dilbert comic was banned for
some day was banned in the la times
in a number of other papers
would you like to uh hear the comic that
was banned in the la times
of course you would
um
so it was a sunday comic in which
wally
was
trying to take time off for his cramps
and you'll see how that went as soon as
i can find my own comic
and here comes
all right so
you'll you won't be able to see it but
i'll read it to you it's just uh wally
with a jacket on talking to the boss and
while he says
this is a sunday comic so it's a longer
form while he says i need to go home
sick today i have cramps
the boss says in your legs
while he says
no
boss says
um
then the boss says is this a woke thing
then wally explains he says i identify
as a birthing human
to be honest i'm only doing it for the
benefits but i believe my scheme is
allowed under our current guidelines is
it not
and in the last panel wally's walking
away and the boss is grimacing and the
boss says jerk
and wally says see you tomorrow bigot
he's got a smile on his face
now
so i got banned from newspapers for that
joke
now my editor to his credit
anticipated this
and this would have run um it would have
run earlier but it would have been too
close to some other things that got
banned in newspapers recently
i think was it the dave comic
oh i think the other ones have got a
band
where i introduced a new character named
dave
who appears to be black
but the joke is that he identifies as
white because it ruins their their uh
their diversity targets
so he's just sort of playing with the
system
so again
is this an insult in any way to black
people
or or anything
no
it's literally the opposite the dave
character is kind of a cool character
introduced you know should have been
introduced long ago you know if anything
it took you know decades too long
so
in both cases
i
i don't even
come close
to showing disrespect for anybody
would you agree
do you see any disrespect for the let's
say the trans community in my wally joke
there's none it's literally a joke about
wally
i have a character who has nothing to do
with trans
who uses every every mechanism to you
know find a way to not work that's what
the character does
so when there's a new a new uh
trend or something that comes in across
the workplace
then i bash it against wally and i have
wally figure out how to use that new
trend
to get out of work
now wally did the same thing with um
covet
and working at home right so whenever
there's a new thing he finds a way to
use it to work less
so i get an impassioned uh
you know
a very long
message on instagram from
someone in the trans community i think
it was and
saying you know he'd been a fan of mine
forever but
um had gone too far and was insulting
him and i think have we gotten to the
part
where even mentioning somebody
has gone too far
here's the way this should have been
interpreted
the way the the way the
topic was identified in my comic
is as the canvas
so so the topic was just the canvas and
then i did something that was just about
my characters
so
what's wrong with uh
what's wrong with saying that the canvas
now includes the
trans topics
because what you're seeing actually is
the opposite of something disrespectful
you're seeing me incorporate it as
normal
that's what you want
you want people like me who write about
stuff
and decide what is appropriate to write
about what isn't you want people like me
to treat it as a matter of fact
the moment i treat it as
that's the special part well then you've
got you've got a bone to pick with me
but if i treat it like it's just the
canvas
and then the joke is actually about
wally
that's exactly what you want you just
want to
disappear into the background and then
everybody's happy
so be careful what you wish for
um
here's the
weirdest little story
i i i wondered if i was going to say
this and i've said some version of this
before but
i saw a interview with lex friedman
and
donald hoffman
if you haven't seen it look for it's a
podcast
lex friedman does a great job by the way
his podcast highly recommended he has
great guests and asks some of the best
questions
probably some of the best questions
you'll ever see a podcaster ask
tim ferriss is great too there are a lot
of great
jim eltashir
there are some people who jump out as
being the best question
askers
so you want to look for them
anyway when i saw that interview
it sort of freshened in my mind
something that i just
i can't not tell you about
so here's a little story from you need
some background
23 years ago
i published or i wrote a book and it got
published
that
largely destroyed my career
it was called the deliberate future
now
have any of you read it
now let me tell you why i destroyed my
career if you weren't there you probably
didn't know
now it's a it's a it's a book that you
know has some gilbert comics in it but
it's you know mostly text and i make a
bunch of
humorous but sometimes
serious humorous predictions
some right some wrong and you know a lot
of it would be subjective whether it was
right or wrong
but the weirdest part and in many ways
the reason i wrote the book was to fit
this in here
i talked about affirmations and stuff
but there was a chapter toward the end
called the new view of the future
and i made some predictions in there
that ruined my career the following way
my
my die hard
dilbert reader fans were almost
well probably at least 80 percent of
them were in the technical fields
some kind of stem field
and
one of my predictions offended that
group so much
that it just destroyed you know
licensing and book sales almost
immediately
and let me tell you what the prediction
was
and so i wrote it down so i could give
it to you exactly i wouldn't up from
memory it was prediction number
and i said the theory of evolution will
be scientifically debunked in your
lifetime now the key word here is
scientifically
so the prediction was that science
itself
not me not religion
not god not christians
you know not intelligent design people
but rather science itself
in my lifetime
i actually say your lifetime but it's
already here
that in your lifetime
the theory of evolution will be
scientifically debunked do you know what
happened to me when i predicted that
it it almost ended my career but it did
probably cut my earnings potential by
75
something like that
now i didn't see that coming
honestly i thought it would just be
interesting some people would argue i
didn't think it would actually just
destroy my career
but in terms of you know what dilbert
was doing you if you were to track it
you can see that that's the point where
every time i was mentioned online
for at least a decade
the comments were filled with people
saying he doesn't believe in evolution
he's an intelligent design creationist
and then
because they hated me for that
they said i was also an
uh a holocaust denier
and that i was in favor of rape
those those are the things said about me
and and there was a story about me being
a
um
a sock puppet
which is also out of context there was
something there's something that looked
exactly like that if you didn't know the
context
so basically
i got destroyed
because i made this prediction
23 years ago
i was listening to lex
friedman interview don hoffman and don
hoffman says
that the
the evolution is probably closer to a
user interface
for something that we don't understand
that's happening beneath it
now i made even weirder predictions in
this same chapter
i said that um there were some theor
some assumptions that we make about
reality
that we're going to be challenged in the
next hundred years and i said
specifically prediction 64. i said the
next hundred years will be a search for
better perception
instead of better vision
and that's what hoffman has said
that's where we are
so here's here's what i meant by that
and you i'll use hoffman's um analogy
or is it metaphor i don't know what it
is
about us seeing user interfaces
over the last say
20 some years 30 years
most of us have been looking at screens
and if you're looking at a screen you're
looking at a user interface that's
hiding a bunch of complexity like the
zeros and ones
but
for 30 years the quality of the screen
keeps improving right so now we have 4k
tvs and you know the ipads i'm looking
at are really good
but that just improved our vision
it didn't allow me to know anything
about the zeros and ones that were
underneath it i could just see the user
interface better
and so my prediction was
that we were trapped in improving the
user interface
but we weren't learning anything about
the nature of reality and that we would
figure that out
donald hoffman's book
called
did i write it down
it's called uh
oh damn it did i really not write that
down
i actually looked it up to write it down
then didn't do it so somebody in the
comments you know which you know what
i'm talking about though with the case
against reality there it is the case
against reality
so
um
he also says
there's space-time as a way of
understanding things is dead
do you know space-time
um you know the sort of the father of
space-time that was einstein right
so hoffman is saying
he said in the lex friedman interview
and i guess he probably says this in
this book
that
um just as einstein um supplanted
um
what's his name
why am i newton yeah just as newton's
ideas were replaced by einsteins
because newton's ideas only work in a
certain range of situations
but einstein's worked in a greater range
of situations so it it sort of replaced
it
and
what uh hoffman claims
is that this would i and i think he's
presenting it as not just his opinion
but that the physicists themselves would
agree with it sort of a that the
mainstream is coming around to the idea
that space-time doesn't exist
that space-time is just another
interface
now all we did was get down to another
user interface
we're not anywhere close to reality
and that everything we knew about
particles and
uh
just basically everything we know about
science is probably just a user
interface and we're not even close to
understanding what's under it now here's
here's the thing is hoffman says the
scientists now believe that and that
they've done enough math and science to
demonstrate
that they know it's not real
they haven't yet figured out what is
now here's what i said in the same book
that the assumptions that were going to
come under challenge
were the following
time goes forward
objects move
gravity exists
and that cause and effect requires some
kind of physical contact
that's basically
a an idiot's description of space-time
so i actually predict i predicted that
einstein's
theory that involves space-time would be
overturned in your lifetime
and it was
so
i'm going to make a claim
that you should reject on its surface
except that i'm pretty sure it's true
but you should object you should object
because it's so distasteful all right
here's here's my
claim
that 23 years ago i publicly predicted
that both darwin
and einstein would be shown to be wrong
specifically because they would be shown
to be working at a user interface level
and not telling you what reality was and
that once we understood that we could go
deeper below the user interface and
maybe if we haven't done it yet figure
out what's going on into there
and both of those things happened
so one of these predictions literally
ruined my career yeah i mean i did fine
but it could have been ten times bigger
i suppose
um
you got quiet didn't
you all right let's talk about something
ways
um
there are three ways to adjust your user
interface let's say that everything you
see is really just a an icon or a
representation of reality and you really
don't know what's going on down there
how can you
know what's going on there are three
ways
if you don't follow the news
you don't know what's going on when you
agree if you don't follow the news or
some
in any way
whether it's through twitter or anything
else but if you don't follow it
then you don't know what's going on i
think you'd agree with that
if you do follow the news
you have been grotesquely misled about
what is going on
now you might think that's only other
people
but it's not
there's very it's very
very small chance that only the people
who disagree with you have been misled
about what the reality is
is very small maybe i mean maybe
maybe you're the one who got all the
right answers
you can't rule down right
can't rule it out
but think about it
is it more likely
that
only the other people get brainwashed
and you don't
wow everybody else looks brainwashed
it's lucky that hasn't affected me
oh okay maybe maybe your eo you know
you're neo
maybe you have escaped the matrix it's
possible but probably not
probably watching the news just makes
you
more grotesquely misled
so not watching the news doesn't work
washing the new and but if you watch the
news it makes it worse
well how about doing your own research
a lot of you are big fans of that and if
you do that you will experience
confirmation bias and an illusion of
understanding so i picked
uh
i did a survey on scientific survey on
the internet and i said which way do you
understand reality
25 said they ignore the news and that's
that's the way they deal with reality so
at 25 that's that's exactly a quarter
it's just 25
interesting
um nine percent follow the news to get
their understanding of reality i mean
only follow the news whereas the largest
group they do their own research
66 percent
uh so the the largest group um
uses uh their own research to create a
bubble of uh confirmation bias which
they call reality
so those are three ways to understand
reality
pick one
um
joel pollock
wrote in breitbart i think it was today
or yesterday
did you see the story there's this
attorney ken uh klukowski
who did hours of testimony to the
january 6 committee
it was you know videoed and recorded so
there's no question about what he said
because i i think he was probably i
don't know under oath but it was at
least on video
so there's no way to
misunderstand
what he said hours of direct testimony
right to the camera
and the january 6 committee
literally just made up a bunch of stuff
and said that his opinions were the
opposite of what he said
and that he was
basically they painted him as one of the
people who thought
that the election could be delayed or
you know you could have a alternate
slate of
uh electors he said clearly and many
times including
on video nope nope never thought that
now my reading of the constitution is
you can't do anything like that the vice
president doesn't have those rights nope
was never on board
for a second
not a second was he on board
with any of it he did his job when he
was asked to raise some memo from his
boss
right
but that's different when asked his
opinion
he said nope
nope this isn't right and then they they
presented in public
in public they painted this guy
as being basically
a primary insurrectionist planner
when all the evidence that they had
collected said the opposite
that their own evidence said the
opposite
now
of course he's complaining
but
what do you even say about a story like
that
i mean it's hard to add any kind of like
punditry to it right
it's just like watching a car wreck
where you just look at it you go
glob
wow
is this really happening
like do you actually live in a country
where your elected leaders
your most
respected leaders on one side of the
party in power
most respected leaders on one side
literally
just made up a bunch of facts
the opposite of the facts they knew and
painted this guy as a monster
you know it's almost like they're
hunting republicans i don't know
somebody who's really good at making
predictions
might have predicted that
um
new york times
is reporting about china's surveillance
and ai stuff
and apparently they've got to the point
where they think they can sort of
detect in advance a crime
you know they can find somebody who
maybe looks like they're probably doing
a crime by the by where they're going
back and forth
or what phone numbers they call or you
know they get i guess they've got a
variety of ways if you know enough about
people
you can determine
patterns that would make them look like
they're either getting ready for a crime
or maybe they're involved in a crime
that nobody's reported yet you know
because if it's drug dealing nobody's
reported it but maybe you could detect
it just by the traffic patterns
so as for example a drug user
if he makes too many calls to the same
number
that was one of the examples i mean
that's a weak example but
anyway
[Music]
and if a person with a history of mental
illness gets near a school
so if you have security at the school
they would get an alert oh there's
somebody with a probably a specific kind
of mental illness who's you know within
a half a mile to school so you know be
alert
now if we had that system to
uh
detect
mass shooters
would you be happy with it suppose it
only did that
first of all do you think it could do it
do you think that an ai could detect a
school shooter in advance
i say yes
yes
probably i don't even think it would be
necessarily a high level of difficulty
now you might get too many
but there's no chance you wouldn't get
them
you'd get too many that's the problem
like you get the people who are
sort of larping and you know
pretending they were thinking about it
you'd get all them so that's a problem
but i think you'd definitely get the
ones who were really going to do it
because they they always seem to leave
such an obvious trail of
i'm going to do this thing before they
do it
so yeah i think it could be done which
is completely different from should you
do it
and
here's uh
yeah i'm not gonna say that there's some
things i told the
people on locals that i i just can't
tell you here
in the main public why because the
locals people pay a subscription to
to get extra stuff
but that's not why
it's the fact that they pay for it
that it makes me trust they don't want
to ruin the model
so i tell them things and say don't tell
anybody else they actually they actually
don't
because they're paying
for a model that they don't want to
break i mean if you're paying for it why
would you break it it wouldn't make
sense so it's this weird little
situation where they actually
sort of
sort of keep a secret
it's it's weird
you wouldn't think it's possible
um
so i retweeted uh aoc
um i'm not so sure
you should not interpret when i when i
retweet aoc it's not so that
you assume that i agreed with why she
said
all right it has more to do with
is interesting
and she tweets that uh
i love the way she puts it of course
that's the reason i like her most of all
is that she communicates in such a
provocative way and i always like
anybody who does that
so
she tweeted just a few months ago i
literally had to explain to republican
members of congress how periods work
their complete and utter incompetence is
now killing women and pregnant people
are throwing the pregnant people across
the u.s there remains no legitimate
grounding or basis to force
to force birth in the united states
now
the example was
i think she had to explain to them that
six weeks wasn't enough
because
if you've missed your period by only two
weeks there could be so many other
reasons for it that you wouldn't you
know necessarily say oh i better get an
abortion while it's still legal what do
you think of that
now again
if anybody's new to me
i'm not giving you my opinions on
abortion because
i have a penis
i don't think that i add any credibility
into the conversation and i'm not going
to have a baby
so therefore my opinion
i would hope would have no value to any
of you that that should be your opinion
of my opinion should have no value
just as i would not want your opinion
if it were about a male only perspective
if you were not a male
right
if it were a male only question i would
only want to hear from men
if it's a female only or birthing people
if you'd like to you want to throw that
in there
yeah that's
i say let them figure it out
now i get
that for many of you is murder and
that's not for other people to work out
right you're like wait
if i think his murder
in my opinion my honest opinion
shouldn't i get involved with that
and the answer is
not if it's already handled
not if it's already handled
do you think women can't figure it out
i feel like they i feel like they have
this right no matter what your opinion
is you know whatever sexist opinion you
have of women and decision making
because i'm sure some of you are
operating on that level
still don't you want the people who are
closest to the thing
making the decisions and why would you
think women would make the wrong
decision
and there's no reason to believe that
so
um that's why i stay out of it anyway
but i like aoc's point
is is it wrong
let me ask just from a scientific
biological question because i'm not
going to claim any expertise in this
area so
definitely she knows more than i do on
this
so would it be true
that you wouldn't necessarily know you
were pregnant by the time the deadline
passed is that true
do you think six weeks is too short
to be sure
and would that be a good point
now i know many of you are absolutists
you know it's point of conception but if
you are not an absolutist
isn't that a good counterpoint
again this is not my opinion i'm asking
you of your opinion i'm not i'm not
giving you mine i'm asking you
i don't know
so i'm seeing a lot of yes
so why is it we can't even agree on
something like that
because if the state of texas intends
to make some kind of legal period
and maybe now that's old news so they
don't have to do that but if somebody
intended to have a legal but short you
know window
shouldn't it at least be one that makes
sense
it's a good question
if you're an absolute
[Applause]
here's a question i asked if uh if you
were uh raped and impregnated you
personally
um and you had the options without legal
consequence so i'm gonna give you three
options and you have to imagine that you
could never be legally prosecuted in the
real world you could but imagine you
could
imagine you could be free of all risk
you had been raped and you had been
impregnated who would you kill
and i gave the following options the
rapist only uh the the baby slash fetus
whatever you would like to label it only
both of them the rapist and the fetus
slash baby or neither
and here were the results for my
followers who chose to answer so not
scientific
uh 44 would want to kill the rapist only
again if there were no legal risks of
doing so
um
three only three percent would want to
kill the fetus or the baby only
but 29 would kill both the rapist and
whatever the rapist had issued into
their bodies
and uh 23 percent was say neither
23
23
anyway um
and how about you my my live stream
audience
uh who would you kill a rapist only
the fetus baby only
both of them
or neither
i see some neithers
neithers
neither's
the rapist
rapist only so the pro-life people are
being
um
okay some of you are both
all right so we've got some
a lot of bowls oh you know there's quite
a difference here actually yeah and now
i'm seeing a lot of both
both in neither interesting
does it
this is the sort of reason that i don't
weigh in on abortion
because i know that my
what i would decide personally
shouldn't be relevant because i would
have to do it in the hypothetical
so the only kind of decision i could
make is hypothetical ones let's see if
hypothetically
in the imaginary world i were a woman
and then this happened to me
what would i do
so
having
opinions about my hypothetical
non-existent future isn't useful to you
but
would you like to know what i would do
anybody care
you shouldn't care because it shouldn't
affect you in any way
all right i'll just tell you what i
would do i would kill them
both and i don't think has anything to
do with my opinion of abortion
let me be clear about that
independent of any opinion i would ever
hold about abortion in that narrow case
if i were a woman who would be who had
been raped and impregnated i would kill
both of them if i could without legal
consequence but that's just me
now
isn't that a good reason i should not be
involved in the in this decision
shameful exactly andy
thank you
shameful
by the way i'm not defending it
if it sounded like i was defending it or
recommending it no
my god
killing people
is the worst thing you can do
do we all agree on that
i'm saying that i would i would do like
the most horrible thing
but i'm not defending it i'm not saying
you should and i'm not saying i would be
a good person if i did it god no
no i would be a monster
i would be a monster just like the
person who
had raped and impregnated me
but
i'm just telling you that i would turn
into a monster
i would
under those situations i know myself
well enough i would just snap
i would frickin snap
and i would i'd be willing to kill
anything probably
so i'm just talking about myself and
you know should my opinion have any
influence on you i hope not my god
i don't want you to turn into monsters
like me
well the
morning joe
joe says that uh the opinion written on
the uh roe versus wade that the court
wrote it in an aggressive tone
and he said quote there's a violence to
the reasoning
there's a violence to the reasoning
so the words have a violence to them
now
i don't want to be an alarmist but
doesn't that sound like
somebody softening up the room
to rationalize physical violence as a
response
i feel as if
that's that's setting the tone
to make physical violence
a reasonable response to this all this
word violence
you know violence to violence
fire fight fire
now i don't know i'm not going to say
that that was his intention right that
would be mind reading that would be
crazy
but
i feel it's maybe the outcome
so it's uh i would say it's careless
at the very least is careless it's a
careless way to
frame it i think you should correct that
actually and if you did by the way i'd
say
a plus
because that's exactly the sort of thing
you'd love to see somebody say you know
i used i was just talking off the top of
my head
i said there's a violence to the
reasoning i didn't mean to imply
you know any
any correlation with actual violence so
you know don't take it to violence now
if you were to say that i say oh
clarification accepted
that's exactly what i hope he would say
you know a plus
but i don't know we'll see what happens
do you see the weird story about rudy
giuliani he was in the grocery store
and he got slapped on the back
aggressively
and
it's being you know considered an attack
an assault
now it was assault i saw the video but
the the video is
it asks an interesting question
because the fellow who quote hit him
slapped him on the back
and if you watch the video you don't
hear the sound so maybe it's a little
missing in terms of the you know the how
much kinetic energy there was but it
didn't look like he was you know cast
forward it didn't look like he you know
had to wince or anything it looked like
it barely affected him
but it must have been a hard enough hit
because his assistant immediately
reached up to the point where his head
and like he or she and you know sort of
making sure he was okay or something
but
so i would say unambiguously it was an
assault do you know why
because i'm a public figure
if somebody came up and slapped me hard
on the back and
and then he followed up with some words
that made it clear that the hard back
slap was exactly what you thought it was
that would be an assault
i mean i would
i would consider a response i mean i'd
probably avoid it but i'd consider it i
would consider a violent response
i just probably wouldn't do it in that
case because it wouldn't be worth it
um
democrats have some time saving tips and
maggie haberman is uh is a good source
for those
and sometimes we get caught up in all
the you know
you're you're wrong i'm right and yeah
we get we get into this team kind of
conflict and we can miss some of the
good
that comes out of it because often
there'll be nuggets of real value
they come from the other side and if
you're if you're blind to it because
you're you're in your
team mode you're going to miss some good
stuff
so maggie haberman
um
she tweeted this she said that officials
with security clearances we're sending
talking about the
the trump administration and the closing
days
officials with security clearances were
sending internet conspiracy theories to
senior officials across the government
asking them to investigate
so i guess during the
january january 6 workup
there were a lot of people sending these
conspiracy theories
to people saying that the election was
rigged and you know those satellites
were involved and all kinds of stuff
asking them to investigate
and
you know this is
exactly the kind of thing that's helpful
because now this gives us two time
saving tips from democrats
and if you think about it
think about how much time this saves
really
number one you can know an election was
fair without auditing it
i didn't know that
until all the democrats told me now if
one democrat said it i'd say well it's
like an idiot
i mean if you don't audit it how could
you possibly know
and then they might say something like
well we wanted a part of it and i'd say
you can't really know if you ordered a
part of it
auditing part of it doesn't get you all
the way i mean to certainty
but democrats have taught us and they
all agree there's there
correct me if i'm wrong i've never found
any democrat to disagree with the
following statement
that you can know an election was fair
without fully auditing it
to my understanding every democrat
believes that
and it's a big time saver because do you
know how much time and energy it would
take to audit an election
do you have any idea how hard that is
that's like a lot of work
a lot of money but democrats tell us
that you don't need to
because you can know an election is fair
without actually doing a full audit
great time saver but now
even better and maggie heberman is
giving this great tip
the essence of it is that these internet
conspiracy theories
could be known to be conspiracy theories
without investigating them
so that's the second time saver you can
you can know which theories are true
without investigating them for example
the steele dossier
i mean it sounded crazy right
but you don't have to investigate it
do you i mean why would you investigate
a thing that's that's wasting time
so these wild internet conspiracies that
the trump um senior officials were
looking into in some cases or at least
were interested in we don't know how
much work they put into it
but
um apparently they should not have
because you can know what theories are
true without investigating them
so you don't have to do an audit to do
an elections fair and you don't have to
investigate something
to know that a theory is either true or
false because you can know that
just because it's a it's a conspiracy
theory
let me
and furthermore to maggie's point which
i think is a strong one
if somebody says to you hey i've got
this conspiracy theory
that the election was influenced by
aliens using our satellites
do you know how you can tell that's not
real
and why watch you're going to be
diverted and you're going to say it's
because of the alien part right
nope
nope that's not how you know it's
failing because you know maybe maybe
they're aliens is it is it because it's
technically unlikely the aliens could
control the satellite and there's no
mechanism from that to control the
elections
nope that's not how you know
that's not how you know it's a
conspiracy theory do you know how
i just told you it was a conspiracy
theory i said if somebody comes to you
with a conspiracy theory
that says aliens did this to satellites
how do you know if it's a conspiracy
theory well it's right in the name it's
right in the name
and i think
that's what maggie is teaching us
in her tweet she says
officials with security clearances were
sending internet conspiracy theories to
senior officials
well if they're conspiracy theories
why would you look into them
because they were sending them
conspiracy theories
now i know you think
maybe they were sending him just
theories
is that what you're thinking
or maybe it was just
reports
no
no
if they were just reports you would look
into them
wouldn't you
if there was a theory and it was
important you'd probably look into it
but if somebody sends you
a conspiracy theory
you don't have to look into that that'd
be crazy that'd be crazy
so that's something you can learn from
democrats
all right um
rasmussen says uh
voters trust the u.s supreme court less
than they did two years ago
and they did and they did that survey
before the roe vs wade decision so even
before roe versus wade the u.s supreme
court was at this lowest credibility i
guess
or less not the lowest but less than
they did two years ago
so 52 of likely u.s voters have less
trust in the supreme court than they had
two years ago
and only 17 have 17 have more trust
uh while 29 say their trust in the
supreme court has not changed much in
the past two
years interesting
all right so
i'm watching cnn doing his tortured
turn toward the middle
now in theory
we've all heard that the new head of cnn
wants them to be less sensational and
more
straight down the middle news
and that would be awkward because
wouldn't you notice
when you notice that they're saying
reasonable things when they used to not
be reasonable
so how how do you go from crazy stuff
to reasonable stuff without it being
obvious to the
the audience
well maybe we're seeing small little
signals
for example this was the headline on cnn
today
on their website
analysis colon
tide turns in the ukraine war as russia
makes progress in the
east the tide turns
doesn't that suggest that the tide had
one time been in favor of ukraine
was the tide ever in favor of ukraine
was it because i think cnn was sort of
suggesting that you know ukraine was
was uh you know maybe getting the best
of things
but
the tide turns
suggested it was going one way and now
it's going the other way when was the
point that the ukrainians were
in charge of the tide
all i remember is a slow flooding
from russia
has there ever been a week where russia
didn't own more at the end of the week
since the beginning of the war
is there now there were certainly
attacks that they abandoned like kiev
but we don't even know if that was a
real attack i mean that could have been
just to keep part of the military you
know nailed down in that part of the
country so they could
you know
uh control things in the the east
maybe who knows
but
uh i think when you see headlines like
the tide has turned they're trying to
find a way to make sure that the old
story that didn't really track with
reality is somehow connected to the new
way they're reporting it so you might
you might see some interesting
word torture happening here as that
happens
but still i'd rather that they get to
closer to reality whatever that is
all right
uh so jake tapper asked the secretary of
state
uh blinken is it um
about who is winning you know you're
saying is ukraine losing the war or what
and
basically secretary of state says that
russia did lose
because russia wanted to wipe ukraine
off the map as a suffering country and
that it's clear that's not going to
happen according to him
and so therefore russia lost
what do you think did russia lose
now it is isn't this great that
everybody gets to win this war
do you remember the old days when you'd
have a winner and a loser and you called
it a war or two losers
i feel like that's in the old days you
either
both sides lost because they destroyed
each other to the point where they
couldn't survive
or maybe you had one winner and one
loser
or maybe you had a pyrrhic victory which
is where it seems like you won but you
you know you hurt yourself in the
process so much you wish you hadn't
but now
but now we have a whole new category
both sides winning all the time
am i right
the ukraine war is the first one i've
ever seen where both sides were winning
all the time
at the same time
so
according to the united states
ukraine's totally winning by being a
free and sovereign country
and according to russia they're totally
winning because they're taking control
of ukraine one bite at a time and
they've already got the good stuff
so everybody's happy no reason to stop
that war
and the question that this brings up is
and i tweeted this earlier
maybe you could give me some advice
i don't give financial advice to you but
i will take financial advice if you have
any should i
and is it too soon it's really a timing
question
is it too soon to ask my publishers to
pay me in rubles
too soon
because i feel like i want to get in on
the bottom
and it's already made a run i mean
ruble's made a good run and i missed the
bitcoin run when bitcoin made its big
advance and i've always regretted that
but i'm thinking
i'm not going to miss this one i feel
like the ruble
is the place to be
am i right
i just need some advice from you
put it in rubles or no
all right
again if you are new to this live stream
don't listen to any financial advice
that you hear
none
you should listen to no financial advice
except diversify
you should listen to that
well the cnn has a story about russia
defaulting on
some major loans
of course they didn't
but that's what the headline says
what they did was they paid it into some
entity that isn't allowed to give that
money
to the lender
because
the lender says you can't give us the
money
because they're sanctions
so
the way we're looking at it is russia
defaulted
because they didn't pay
the way russia explains it is
we did pay we paid exactly who we're
supposed to pay
they chose not to give it to you
because you said don't give us the money
because they're under sanctions
that's really different than defaulting
that's really really different
now i'm not sure if it's an escrow
entity exactly they might do more than
that wasn't clear on what that entity is
so anyway they're either defaulting or
totally not defaulting is one of those
things
now let me ask you a question
in my book
the religion war
written many years ago
it was a fictional book but it imagined
that one day ai
would be able to figure out who was the
what i called the prime influencer
the one person who would just be an
ordinary person not a not a famous
person not a pundit but there would be
one person in the world
who had the capability
just by a weird connection to the right
people
to make any trend happen
and so the character is you know trying
to find the prime influencer
and
here's my question
well i doubt that there's anything like
one prime influencer there's probably a
variety of them
could you not
use ai and all the data that we have now
to figure out who are the most powerful
influencers of other people in their
peer group
and could you not
then make anything popular
because you'd really only have to
convince one person
and the one person would convince enough
people who would convince enough people
who would convince enough people
that you'd be a hit
and then once it's a hit
all the other people who are outside the
influence say hey that's a hit we'd
better you know it's a new trend let's
get going on this
so i think
you could find like literally like one
person
who's just
has charisma and you know a good local
following
and that person could say you know
i like wearing my shoe on my hand
and it's the kind of person where
the first time you see them wearing
their shoe on their head you're like oh
god
what is going on is that crazy and then
the next time you see him you go
i gotta admit
he's pulling it off
or she
i gotta admit she's pulling it off i
never would have worn a shoe on my head
like a hat
but i can't lie
i can't lie she's pulling it off
it's sort of like sagging
if somebody had described to you wearing
your pants below your ass
you always said no
that's not going to be a thing but you
would have been wrong you would would've
been wrong apparently there was probably
one person
i'll bet about sagging started with one
person all right here there's my
um no what's it called not is it sagging
yeah it's where you wear your pants
below your ass
and
it probably started in prison somebody
says but i'll bet it was one person
i'll about literally one person and i'll
bet it wasn't a famous person now it
might have been a famous person who then
spread it but about about one person did
it in one prison
once and they just caught
it says i'm available is that what it
says
all right
oh it's because they don't have belts
i don't know
all right no belts in prison that's why
so it's it's a
you're saying it's a prison
uh
fashion
thing belts equal suicide all right that
makes sense
but i think uh correct me if i'm wrong
but
prison knows what elastic is right
they know what elastic is i feel like
they can figure that out
so
do you think
the ai is close to figuring out who
influences everything and if they could
find that people since you could bribe
one person quite easily
i mean if you found it you could say
look
i'll give you a million dollars to wear
a shoe in your head for a week and and
tweet about it
you don't think you could get like an
average person because it could be just
some popular person who just has a
normal job but they're very
charismatic could be
so i think that's what you should worry
about in terms of ai influencing us
because ai can figure out who the
influences are and then influence the
influencers and then
through that the rest of humanity so
that's what i'd worry about
and
and that brings us to the conclusion
of the best show
that's ever been done
uh on locals was there anything that i
said i was going to talk about that i
didn't talk about ufos
somebody said there's something new
about ufos but i couldn't find that
story i just did a search for it i
didn't say anything new
copper prices
the descent don't care
50 yard line prayer a coach loss i
usually don't do the individual person
got fired
stuff
i i'm not too much into the individual
person who had a situation things
uh ammo they're going to restrict
let me ask you this
does the second amendment give you a
right to ammo has that that's probably
been
decided all right right
so somebody say yes because that would
be part of the device
because you couldn't use the device
without it
makes sense
okay
um
uh
right
yeah you know there's also the question
this is a good philosophical question
if
if a company is offering to pay for
their employees to go wherever they need
to to get an abortion
aren't they doing it for their own
benefit
is that for the benefit of the
employee
or the employer
because the employer would much rather
get them back to work
right
so
do we not have a situation where
employers are in this weird
ethical dilemma where if they pay for
you to get an abortion
it feels like they're paying you to kill
your baby so they can get more
productivity out of you
that's how some will interpret it right
you know i'm not saying that's my
interpretation because again
i'm trying to stay out of the opinion
part
but
that's a bad look if you're a
corporation that's a bad look
for at least you know a third of the
people looking at you
so we'll see how that all plays out
all right that's all for now
i believe i've delivered the best show
you've ever seen
in history of the universe
and
it's time to
say goodbye to youtube but i'll see you
in the morning
