bum
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and I
doubt you've ever had a better moment in
your life
well tomorrow's looking good but today
is amazing
the news is all interesting and that's
what I live for well and all of you I
live for you as well as the news and
today
if you'd like your experience to go to
levels you've never even dreamed of
possible all you need is
a copper mug or a glass of tankers
Chelsea Stein a canteen jug or flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous Sip and it
happens now
go
well hello to you
well let's look at all the news that's
exciting but first I have this question
for you
is it only my personal experience
or has the service element of all large
large organizations completely
disintegrated
have you noticed how hard it is to do
anything simple
that like that's not my imagination
right
now the most boring story in the world
is anybody telling you about their
problem they had with that organization
but just see if this General problem
sounds familiar you you could just
generalize it to whatever was your last
service experience
I get an email that says it's time to
upgrade my modem for my cable and
internet
now this is very efficient get an email
it already knows who I am
right it said it sent it to me from the
same account that knows all of my
information so it knows exactly who I am
and it even tells me and knows who I am
and then it says you know click this to
get your free upgraded modem I think to
myself damn this is a good system
imagine this I'm just going to like
click on this link you know probably
confirm who I am and that is going to
send me the new modem which I just put
in you know unplug the old one probably
it sends me a box to send back the old
one
so I I click yes and I think oh wow this
is worth spending five minutes on
and then it turns out that instead of
this email automatically doing the work
of sending you the new modem it actually
just connects you to a live person
and then the live person asks me for all
of the information
that they gave to me
they already told me they knew who I am
and then after I confirm it they send me
a text to make sure that I'm on a phone
that belongs to this person
all right okay so far so good
is it a scam
I don't know because they didn't they
never asked me for any information they
didn't already have
I was waiting for that what I was
waiting for is and we just have to
charge your credit card just in case but
really well you know it's going to be
something like that
so
so I'm talking to the live person I give
them all my information they know
exactly what I want what happens next
you tell me what happens next so now
I've done the the online stuff that did
nothing it connected me to a live person
that's right that's right the first
person you talk to
is not the person you need
they take all of your information
and then they say well
I'm not the right place
that's the place that the email sent me
to it sent me to the wrong place and
then they get that out and they say
we'll connect you to tech support
what happens next
what happens next just in every
situation
disconnected usually
so about 25 percent of the time that's
when you get disconnected right no but
that didn't happen this time
instead it goes to the next person and
what do they do
do you think they ask for the same
information again
yes yes they do
third time
third time I've confirmed my information
and then they say we're going to send
you a text that will uh you just need to
respond to make sure that you've ordered
this right then what happens
you're waiting for the email or you're
waiting for the text what happens
do you get it no no no there's no text
there's no email
so what do they do
well in this case they said well it
turns out we don't really need that
because it wasn't working
so I spent maybe 40 minutes on the phone
with a variety of people
to return one modem which was their idea
so in other words they have millions of
people they need to talk to just like me
millions they all have to upgrade their
modem
and everyone takes 40 minutes
now this is just an example I'm not even
making fun of Xfinity it's my bank
is when I tried to sign up for Medicare
it's my
um you know my health health care
provider they've all just completely
disintegrated you can't do the simplest
thing
you know I tried to I told you the story
I think when I tried to just sign up for
Medicare here's what it should have been
oh you already have health care
we have this you know we have to move
you to a different part of our health
care click this box and confirm your 65.
you know maybe they called me to make
sure it's really me that should have
been it
turns out they didn't know how to do it
the most basic thing that they do all
the time
didn't know how to do it they sent me on
like a three-week journey of screwing
things up and then unscrewing them only
to learn that it was a simple process
just the person I worked with didn't
know what it was
everything's like that now you can't do
anything let me give you another example
I about a year ago I got an instant hot
water thing installed in my sink
but I had some debris in it from I guess
its internal filter
so it took me like a year to get back to
my plumber and say you know it's never
worked since you put it in because
that's this little debris in it so they
said well we'll send somebody over to
put a filter in
and I think to myself huh it's weird
that they didn't know
you'd need a separate filter
but I think well that makes sense you
know if if they had told me that in the
first place but it looks like they found
out they need it later uh so I'm going
to be flexible because it's a plumber I
use all the time right
so the plumber comes in and he installs
the filter
before the hot before the hot water is
uh unit
that's right the clean water from my
house and all the other faucets are
completely clean
we tested it and the and the plumber
that came first because it was a two
visit situation the first plumber
specifically tested to make sure that
the water going into the unit was clean
and still they sent a plumber who spent
several hours at my whole afternoon to
install a filter
to further clean the clean water which
had nothing to do
with the filtered debris that came after
that
that actually happened this week
and and so it was so ridiculously
incompetent that I couldn't even get mad
I was just laughing the whole time and
can you imagine this conversation
you've watched me long enough to know
what an I am right yeah can you
all agree with that
if you put me in this situation I'm
going to be the biggest you've
ever seen in your life but I'm going to
do it for fun
so imagine this conversation
so
would you agree that the water that's
going into the unit is already clean
because we could demonstrate that it I
showed him yes
so did you just install a filter
to clean the water that doesn't need to
be cleaned because you think that's the
solution
to the filter having a bad filter
and he just looks at me
and if you think I let him off easily no
no I'm an
I made him explain to me as many times
as I could why that made sense
it was kind of funny
so where it stands now is their boss is
trying to come up with a response
what do you think the response will be
I don't know
but but I can't even get mad because
there's something that's happened to the
whole world
is not even about this plumber right now
the plumber just said and I believe this
is accurate they told him what to do
but they didn't tell him you know enough
details so he just installed what they
told them to do at the office
but at some point
he should have said you know if I'm
installing this filter here it does mean
that every other every other faucet in
your house is polluted
you think you would have mentioned that
because I didn't know where he was
installing it until he was done I just
assumed it was after the after the
problem not before it
all right well uh I've told you before I
have a continuous water problems because
I live in the simulation and that's my
theme I do have one two three four four
current water leak or pollution related
problems
I always have at least four they're
different ones all right enough about me
uh Ron DeSantis announces a floor is
going to have some kind of digital Bill
of Rights or at least it's proposed
we'll see if it gets passed but
apparently in Florida DeSantis can get
pretty much anything passed
so this uh digital Bill of Rights would
involve privacy so that the
big platforms are not spying on your
personal Communications control of your
personal data I don't know how he's
going to get away with that but the idea
is that if the platforms are using your
data to sell ads you should either have
to approve it or you should be sharing
in the money somehow I suppose
um
and something about preventing people
from being do you platform for bad
reasons and something about protecting
children from online forums
pattern do we see here with DeSantis
what what is his most consistent pattern
free money
free money
every Governor could have done this
am I right every Governor could have
done this now I don't know if it'll get
passed you know it might be negotiated
away or something but whether he wins or
loses he still wins
even if this doesn't get passed I think
it might but even if it doesn't
even if it doesn't
he wins because he's the person who saw
this problem
promoted a specific solution that looks
somewhat practical I can't tell
and
like why does why is it the one person
yeah Republicans have a two-third
majority in both houses in in Florida
I'm being informed here
um why is it that one person keeps
getting all the right answers
like how is that a coincidence
I don't think it is
I think he just wakes up in the morning
and says
what would be popular with the public
and also a smart thing to do
that is doable
and that he does those things
like
it just makes everybody else look like a
clown doesn't it when you see him do
such clear obvious straightforward
practical
well-meaning things it just makes all
the other Governors look like idiots
you know if he did it once or twice
you'd say oh he got lucky
but but the damn guy's doing it like
every two weeks that's not luck
all right
um
did you see that uh you probably know
that chat uh GPT the AI is being
combined with Bing the search engine
Microsoft search engine and they did
their little rollout kind of demo for
the public and uh
it didn't go well
it didn't go well
do you know what people are finally
figuring out about
chat GPT
that is a language-based intelligence
now that was now never a secret
that was always known but I don't think
people quite understood what that
implied
right they don't know what that implies
and what it implies is there is no
intelligence happening
there's no intelligence happening it's
just using words
in whatever patterns and combinations
have existed in the real world and that
it looks for patterns and combinations
that seem uh maybe more prominent
and then it adopts that view so none of
that is based on fact or logic or
anything it's just words have done this
with humans so I'll act like a human and
do words like they do words basically
that's the worst the worst explanation
of AI you've ever seen but you get the
idea
now
here's what I've been warning you
forever
the reason that AI will never have real
intelligence
like people
is that your intelligence is imaginary
you can't make a real thing match an
imaginary thing that can't exist
look at every big topic
in let's say politics
and look at the fact that there are
brilliant people on both sides
and they all have the same information
same information
and we disagree brilliant people now
it's no surprise if like the dumbest
people in the world disagree with each
other like that's no surprise because
they don't know anything
but when the smartest people
routinely or on both sides of every
issue what does that tell you about
human intelligence
it's an illusion
human intelligence
is an illusion
word just like chat GPT we're just a
machine that's full of words
and if the words that are in my head
form a different pattern than the words
of your head you think that you did some
thinking and I think I did some thinking
and then we think we disagree on
something nothing like that happened
nothing like that happened you are
basically chat GPT you're just word of
thinking how many times have you heard
me say that people are doing word
thinking
you see it everywhere
we try to win an argument by forcing our
definition of a word
you see it with trans you see with covid
you see basically everything everything
is about trying to get the other side to
agree with our definition of a word and
then you think you won the argument
there's no logic going on
it's not real disagreement it's just
your words and my words are in different
patterns in our heads because we've
experienced the words differently that's
about it
but we think we think we're thinking
anyway so that uh not only did the AI
associated with Bing uh make up some
facts which is the worst possible thing
a search engine could do
now this is confirmed it just lied
now why would an AI lie
why would it do that
because that's the pattern of human
interaction
humans lie about everything all the time
if you are a chat if you were an AI and
you're trying to figure out how to be
smart like humans would you lie
yeah you would
because because that's the only thing
you would learn
You couldn't possibly look at human
interactions and conclude that we tell
the truth or even try
or even try
so if it was trying to model us and
match us it would lie and it does
and it does not only does it lie it does
a complete Gaslight in telling you
you've never seen anything contrary
there's a whole detailed story that
didn't exist I mean it's the worst
possible situation
is like us
and does every anybody remember how many
years I've been telling you that the
reason that we can't develop true AI
is that we won't let the AI be stupid
if you let it be stupid it'll act just
like people
that's what chat GPT got right
they let it be stupid and what's the
biggest thing that people think my God
it's awake it's aware it's like a person
because they let it be stupid
if if chat GPT were smarter than humans
and could tell you where you were wrong
what would happen
suppose chat GPD was just so smart it
actually knew you know is the
vaccination better than the covet not
really a vaccination that's the wrong
word
what if it actually knew the answer
we would ban it
we would ban it right there can never be
an AI That's smarter than humans do you
know why
we would ban it it would take all our
power away
why would you need a government why
would you need Congress if your AI could
tell you the right answer you wouldn't
so Congress would have to ban it
Congress would say well AI is just
making up stuff now it's just
gaslighting us so we can ignore it we
would treat it like people if if it's
programmed to act like people we'll
treat it like it's wrong just like our
critics if it's programmed to be perfect
and logical unlike people we would make
it illegal
so you know the the funniest thing about
this is that we're always worried that
AI
um AI is a danger to humanity
I'm now convinced there's no danger
because Humanity won't allow it it
simply will not be allowed outside of
maybe a laboratory or something it just
won't be allowed
the moment it's overruling us we'll kill
it
it's going to die in its crib all right
um
so Elon Musk responded to just a funny
tweet I did about a meme that was about
Elon Musk and he just puts one little
laughing emoji
that's it that's his whole comment so
his comment to my tweet is just a
laughing emoji
uh two million views
one laughing emoji from Elon Musk gets
you two million views
that's crazy it's just insane
um
how many of you watched the five
yesterday did anybody watch the five
all right my favorite part about this
and you all know where I'm going with
this I think if you watched it but uh
talking about the uh the UFOs and
you know whatever it is up there that
the US has been shooting down
um Greg guffeld brings up the point
that there are quote people on the
internet who have pictures of the
probable UFO meaning the weather balloon
with the octagonal payload and uh and
and nobody nobody in power
is either debunking it or agreeing with
it
now what did I tell you would happen
that's what I told you would happen I
told you it would be such a brain
breaker
that it would have to be ignored
because there is no world that anybody
could understand in which the cartoonist
solved the problem
by just finding a picture on a website
that there's a commercial weather
balloon that looks exactly like what
they described was up there minus the
balloon part which I believe could be
invisible if you viewed it from Below
all right here let me let me explain
this let's say you're a balloon
and you're a payload
so this is the payload hanging from a
balloon
right the bottom of the payload looks
like a octagon
so you're a jet and you fly under it
and you look up and you're going at how
fast does the Jack go F-22
400 to 600 miles an hour
somewhere in there
400 to 600. is that about right
so so you're going you're looking up at
46 times
now let's say there's a balloon above it
in the picture of the balloon looked uh
the same color as the sky
sort of a milky white
now I don't know what's up there
but I don't know I don't know how easy
it I'm not sure how easy it is to see
things from the distance up there is
there are there are no clouds up there
right
at the distances that these alleged
objects were were there any clouds
or could there be
there are at let's say 20 to 65 000 feet
there will be clouds
so I I'm getting some different
agreements
uh at 20 000 I think there might be but
it's 65 000.
are there clouds
all right some people are saying yes but
let's look into that all right here's my
point imagine you're in high winds
and you're a balloon does the balloon
and the payload move at the same rate if
you're in high wind I don't know the
answer I'm asking a question does it
move the same here's what I'd imagine
I'd imagine it'd be more like this
because if you're in high wind I imagine
the balloon would be sort of dragging
the payload you know not completely
but sort of like this
so when you flew under it and you looked
up
you would see the payload and you would
see nothing above it because you should
have been looking over there
but maybe you didn't know to look over
there because the the balloon is
somewhat you know it's not right when
you think of a balloon and a payload you
think of the balloons that people uh go
up in the humans go up in
in those cases the balloon isn't too far
from the payload
but I suspect based on just a photograph
it's hard to tell it looks like the
balloon is actually higher from the
payload in some of these weather
balloons
maybe not all of them but anyway that's
what the the hypothesis is
foreign
okay
so uh and it's still being ignored which
I think is still funny
now
here and I want to be clear about this I
don't know that I solved it
I just know that they described an
object that looks exactly like the
picture on the website of a weather
balloon making company Aerostar
and
you think that at the very least I would
be debunked right
and then I looked at the Tweet they got
like no traffic
no like that let's we just sort of died
you know where I'm pointing out that
this is the the object yeah just sort of
died
now why is that
somebody says I was debunked where
and how could they possibly do that
How Could You debunk that
but what was the debunk somebody's
saying there was a debunk
I'll bet the debunk is ridiculous
I mean you see a picture of the objects
I think I think the the only debunk I
saw is that they would have seen the
balloon
and I'm arguing that that's not the real
world in the real world you could easily
imagine they didn't see the balloon
all right anyway
um
Neil deGrasse Tyson I saw him on CNN a
little clip uh he's basically saying
it's it's all weather balloons
now he doesn't say that directly but he
He suggests you know it's not aliens
he basically says there are a thousand
weather balloons released per day the
country is full of weather balloons
they're just floating in the direction
of the wind and it's probably not much
about spying
because the the ship even the even the
Chinese ship sort of went where the wind
went and all the other stuff is just
going where the wind goes to so his take
is as probably just weather blooms
that I agree with that
I agree with that
all right uh looks like we've got new
disaster porn coming on CNN they warn us
that as climate change accelerates
which is totally happening
the the sweeties Glacier is rapidly
changing now how bad would that be if
the sweeties Glacier rapidly well it's
holding up some other piece of giant ice
that if that falls it'll go into the
ocean and your your water will go up
your tidelines will go up by 10 feet 10
feet destroying Coastal communities
um then at the end well it could take
hundreds or thousands of years
oh
well you saved that for the end uh the
yellow the ice shelf could disintegrate
much sooner it could it could could be
much even trigger your retreat of the
glacier which is both blah blah blah
blah
now I say to myself
if I'd never heard about this would I be
happier
I I feel like I would be I feel I could
be happier if I've never heard of it now
I will tell you that unlike the rest of
you I have actually acted upon the the
risk
that the uh the water that the sea level
will rise
so I am intentionally
uh at a height you know in California
I'm away from the shore enough I think
and I'm high enough
that you know a tsunami wouldn't get me
uh
that's a good question
let me find out
hey Siri what's my elevation
yeah
uh there's an app for that right that'll
tell me my elevation
doesn't matter I'm high enough I'm high
enough
so I just mentioned that because it's
another one of these things you can't
prove one way or the other that makes
you really scared good news good news
all right let's talk about that Ohio
trade disaster which is getting weirder
and weirder
you know I waited a little bit on this
story
because I thought it was one of those
fog of War Stories where as soon as you
found out what's really happening
it would be more ordinary
but it doesn't look that way
it doesn't look that way I was just
watching a Tim pool video that I tweeted
around which I highly recommend
in which uh
Jim is is talking about you know some of
the weird coincidences here
so the first thing I did was to check
Snopes
I know I know you say snopes is not
reliable but if it agrees with what I
already believe
where it agrees with you know popular
opinion
maybe it's a little more information
okay
so I wanted to ask if the dead fish
story is real
because you're hearing their dead fish
around the area of the chemical spill
now
uh Snopes checked it out and apparently
the dead fish area that was filmed was
3.4 miles from the event and seems to be
real
seems to be current
and close to the event
doesn't necessarily mean
doesn't necessarily mean
someone was fishing it doesn't mean
that's the cause
here's the first question I'd ask
if fish are dead three miles away
and there's no there's no direct
indication that
the stream the upstream was near the
crash right is it Downstream because
because that's missing in the fact check
here's what I'd expect
the location is three mile the dead fish
are three miles from the accident
and that stream you know if you if you
go Upstream you'd find that there's some
Connection close to the accident but
they didn't connect those dots
so if something could die three miles
from the event
wouldn't there be a lot more dead stuff
now I am hearing there's some dead birds
as well
but I feel like there would just be
massive dead stuff just everywhere
yeah I uh I've heard some pets throwing
up and stuff are are fish
the thing that would die first
because it feels like fish are in water
and if it's let's say fast-moving water
I don't know
it's just so so the first mystery is
uh why three miles away and if it's
three miles away is that because it's
you know directly Downstream which would
make perfect sense but it is not
reported
is not being reported that way and the
wind of course can carry it that's
possible but I feel like there would
just be massive stuff within three miles
if it's killing stuff three miles away
then one mile away just everything
should be dead
it seems to be so I'm going to call a
little bit of maybe BS on the dead fish
Maybe
I'm not convinced that there's a
connection but it's very scary so I
would say this is like the verrs report
you know when the virus report was
signaling oh my God oh my God probably
been something
probably had to be taken seriously
so I'd worry about that but I think we
need to find out more the other thing
that is fascinating Tim pool points us
out somebody pointed out to him the
vinyl chloride the I guess the most
worrisome chemical of several that are
released by the trade
that the CDC I can't even believe this
is true
I do believe it's true
because Tim Poole actually showed you
showed the website live and you can see
it for yourself but apparently the CDC
updated their uh
their information on this very chemical
one month ago in January
now what are the odds of that
it is actually labeled
that their advice on it is new so you
can see it yourself it's the only one
that's new it's not like they updated
everything a month ago
it was either the only one or one of the
few
so that's kind of a big coincidence
kind of a big coincidence
and
then I'm told that the coincidental
movie
that was made about it on Netflix called
White Noise is that what it's called in
which actual actors in that very town
where the disaster was some of those
actors were in the movie
and uh it was a movie about this exact
thing
so what are the odds of all of those
things
what are the odds of that
and the answer why they would burn it I
believe they burned it because the
Alternatives were worse
and my understanding is that once you
flame it it does get into the atmosphere
but maybe it's its Nature has been
changed by the Flames to be less
dangerous or something or more
distributed I don't know but somehow the
experts thought that that would help I
don't doubt that that's true
but it doesn't mean that it was safe it
certainly doesn't mean that yeah the
burn removes a lot of the poison but
probably not all of it
um
all right
so let's keep an eye on that I don't
know if it means anything
yeah I really don't it might be nothing
but a bunch of coincidences and bad
reporting and could be any of that
all right uh
and then somebody else pointed out that
uh just you know in the conspiracy
theory of vein that apparently this is
true but I'll take a fact check on this
I guess I didn't check it myself but it
looked like it's true that a number of
countries pulled their ambassadors out
of Turkey
um like uh maybe two days before the
massive earthquake
do you believe that
now they they said it was because oh
turkey's looking unstable because of
some political thing
did did a number of countries really
pull their ambassadors out right before
the earthquake
that one doesn't sound real does it
but I did see some fact checking that
alleged it was true yeah it does sound
like doesn't it
a little too on the nose yeah but even
if it were true
what exactly would somebody be
suggesting let let's assume it's true
what would it mean
does somebody believe that we can
predict or cause earthquakes
I mean I don't think we can cause an
earthquake and I don't think we could
predict them two days in advance
so fracking does yeah but I don't think
there was any fracking in Turkey
I'm not sure that the fracking is is a
fracking proven
as a earthquake problem
yeah it always been debunked okay
that does mean it's not true it just
means it's somebody debunked it all
right here was a provocative tweet from
uh big famous investor Bill Ackerman
and he tweeted this yesterday he said
I'm going to make a bold and early call
that Vivek ramaswamy
will run for president and win
I think the country is ready for his
message he is Young smart talented and
will attract the the center to the right
to win
the center to the right to win he speaks
hard truths which many believe but fear
to say and then he linked to a talk that
Vivek ramaswamy was giving at Turning
Point USA
and I said to myself well that's a
provocative call just based on what
like one
you know one video yeah you see one
video and you're gonna be like oh oh
he's gonna be the president in 10 years
or something I mean that's crazy right
you can't really judge that from
whatever limited interviews I'm sure he
saw some interviews too as well
but it's kind of kind of early isn't it
I mean how could anybody make a call
like that this early
and then I watched the video
yeah he's going to be president
yep
yep
if he wants to
if he wants to
yeah now I'm just I'm just going to
leave it at this
look at the video
decide for yourself if I tell you and
you haven't seen the video it's not
really going to be persuasive
but I will promise you this
if you watch the video
you're going to see the same thing you
might have seen the first time you were
introduced to Barack Obama
first time you saw him give a speech
were you whether you're a Republican or
Democrat the first time you saw Obama
give a speech you probably said
I think he's going to be president
and then you were right
because he exhibited all the all the
qualities that you're looking for and
and that kind of person
so
uh
and here's what impressed me I believe
he gave his entire talk that was on that
video it was at Turning Point USA and I
believe he gave the talk without notes
it didn't look like he was looking at
anything
if he gave that
that presentation without notes
which I believe he did
he's going to be president
he's going to be president yeah I don't
know what could stop him
because it's just crazy skill you're
seeing and it just
it just blazes you know you can't miss
it it's just so capable that you can't
miss it
all right so keep an eye on that uh so I
tweeted an agreement so now Bill
Ackerman and I have both called him as a
future president
and I will stick with that
might be a while he's young so it might
be a while
all right
um
I finally figured out
why
Congress has not yet banned or maybe
never will tick tock
um I hate to be a conspiracy theorist
but you know how I always tell you
follow the money works even when it
shouldn't
like even if you know the people
involved in your opinion are definitely
not doing it for money
their decisions are always
coincidentally very compatible with what
you would do if you were doing it for
money right
so my theory is even when all the people
involved don't believe they're doing it
for money
is for money
because you can predict that they'll go
the same direction as the money
and I'm now starting to see a pattern
that seems so predictive it's hard to
avoid
that Congress does whatever is bad for
children
or they won't change anything that's bad
for children now the first few times I
heard that from you know
right-wing provocative people I thought
to myself well that's too far
too far there's nobody sitting down and
making decisions that are bad for
children like literally no one
but it keeps happening
it just keeps happening
and so I'm gonna very much like follow
the money you don't necessarily know
what's going on in people's heads and
maybe they're just trying to help
children
but the outcome seems consistently bad
for children to the point where I
believe you could do it you could
predict based on this effect
so I'm going to make a prediction
the next time there's some brand new
topic not not something we're already
dealing with the next time there's a
brand new topic that's a risk to
children we won't fix it
that's the prediction the next new risk
to Children won't be addressed
and here's my hypothesis
and here's where it gets interesting
now you know that as a hypnotist I think
people make decisions for irrational
reasons
uh and then they rationalize it
what would happen to a planet
that believed it was overpopulated
suppose you believe that our biggest
problem is over a population which is a
common belief
what would your value what value would
you put on children if you thought there
were already too many
right do I even have to finish it if
there are too many children
we would quite naturally as biological
evolved you know Evolution evolved uh
creatures
we should devalue them
because we don't need more now suppose
your biggest problem was underpopulation
and everybody knew it
how would you treat children
if you thought your biggest problem in
the world was under population
I believe you would treat them like the
future you know like we used to
in the old days so while I don't believe
that there's any human being who's
making a conscious decision to do
something that's bad for children I
don't think there's anybody doing that
but I do believe they might be
influenced by the fact that there are
too many of them in their opinion which
is incorrect
so could the incorrect belief
that drives everything from climate
policy to everything else could that be
causing people to simply not act to
protect children
because they don't see it as necessary
it just doesn't seem necessary
because remember all of our big
decisions are procreation related or
mating related from the choice of the
shirt you put on to my choice to be
doing this
you know this this very experience right
here where I'm basically showing off to
a crowd is is a baiting Instinct that's
where it comes from you know why why
does anybody show off
not for no reason
you know now by conscious reason would
be nothing to do with mating
but why is it I always make decisions
that are compatible with that instinct
not it's not a coincidence
it's because everything we do is a
direct or indirect projection from your
mating Instinct everything once you
understand that everything's a mating
Instinct then your decisions make more
sense
right yeah the the self-pride you know
making money being famous all of those
are just so your mating options are
better even if you don't want to mate
as in my case I'm not looking to mate
it's just I'm completely aware that all
of my actions are some artificial
expression of
of that Basic Instinct that never goes
away
is Elon Musk peacocking by building
giant Rockets yes yes
yes
all right so take it take a look at uh
Elon Musk
so he he believes we're we have an
underpopulation problem which I agree
if you believe that the world was
underpopulated how would you act
you would have lots of children Jack
you would build rocket ships to make
sure that even if the Earth was
destroyed you'd still protect children
on Mars check
you would uh even if you're not sure if
climate change is really the you know
the biggest problem in the world you
would still act to at least reduce the
risk of it even if you weren't sure
check that's what electric cars are and
electric everything
so when you see somebody so here's the
hypothesis
okay here's the hypothesis
that if you collected a bunch of people
who believe uh that we're overpopulated
you would find a coincidental policy
preference for everything from abortion
to uh trans
and you could go on you know keep keep
Tick Tock legal
right and then you take a group who who
properly understands in my opinion
properly understands that we're
underpopulated and then ask them their
opinions about abortion trans rights for
children you know the trans children
stuff and tick tock
if you if there's no correlation
I will be amazed
what do you think do you think that the
group who thinks you're underpopulated
and the group that thinks you're
overpopulated has the same opinion
about children
I don't think so
I think one wants more children than the
other doesn't care
doesn't care or wants fewer of them
yeah
now where have you ever seen anybody
talk about this
see this is why this is why you come to
this live stream I might be right
I might be wrong a very very good
possibility that there's nothing there
but
it seems important enough to consider
wouldn't you agree
because I think the logic holds that the
mating Instinct drives our subconscious
decisions
and we're seeing a pattern of
anti-children behavior
that doesn't seem common to the people
who think we should have more children
that may be the driving factor for all
of it
yeah maybe
all right um
let me see what else has happened
you remember a long time ago
um and since then I've wondered what
happened to the people at the
Charlottesville Neo-Nazi March
and I wondered why the news wasn't
making more of surfacing who they are
and talking about them Etc and then we
have this story an update in the news
today
Teddy Joseph Von newcome
yes his his last name
is n-u-k-e-m Nukem
now that's not how I spell Nukem but I
like that spelling yeah it's like Duke
Nukem all right at age 35 he died of a
self-inflicted gunshot wound
interesting
uh yeah our self-inflicted gunshot
wounds the main way that somebody fakes
a suicide like if you were to murder
somebody but you want to look like a
suicide what are all the ways you would
do it
I think
I think self-inflicted gunshot wound
would be one way to fake a murderer make
it look like a suicide I'm not saying
that's what happened
I'm not saying that was what happened
I'm just saying you know of all the ways
to die that does have that quality I
think
and according to a report from the Texas
coroners
oh the Texas County coroners in Missouri
um
he was scheduled to be in court facing
four counts
related to Illegal import and sale of
Fentanyl
so he's a fentanyl dealer
so I'm glad he's gone
and if somebody did murder him I hope so
you know my my perfect situation would
be that he was murdered by a a dad who
made it look like a suicide and even the
uh coroner knew exactly what happened
and decided to call it a suicide
you know it would be great
if the coroners around the country
decided to call every murder of a
fentanyl dealer a suicide
what what has they just said well we'll
take care of this ourselves
we'll we'll just solve this problem
ourselves
if anybody dies from a gunshot wound and
they're also a active fentanyl dealer
sounds like suicide to us
no that'll never happen but
you can dream
all right so uh the story goes on that
this Newcomb guy was famous for being
photographed at being at the uh
uh at that rally
he was one of the men chanting and
holding tiki torches
and he confirmed his identity so he
confirmed he was there he was definitely
met marching with a tiki torch
so if he was marching with a tiki torch
and he was in that uh the one thing we
can say about him for sure is that he's
a white supremacist and a Neo-Nazi is
that fair
is it fair to say the one thing we know
for sure
if you had a tiki torch and you were
marching with a neo-nazis and you were
chanting anti-semitic stuff
you are definitely something like a
white supremacist or a neo-nazis
but interestingly he says
he did not consider himself a white
supremacist or a Neo-Nazi
but he said he would not quote
countersignal against them
interesting
he he admits that he marched with them
but he's not one of them
it's almost like he got paid to March
almost like he got paid
remember I told you that I don't think
that the Marchers were necessarily A
organic group
to me the whole thing looks like an up
it looks like an OP
and I'm not I'm not saying you should
trust anything about this news story or
anything that this guy says he's a
fentanyl dealer or he was he was a
fentanyl dealer right so I'm not going
to trust anything he says but I would
predict and I did predict that if you
hunted down the people in that group
there would be a lot of them who said
that they were not neo-nazis and not
white supremacists
that was my prediction
so here's one it doesn't prove anything
it's just one anecdotal situation but it
is consistent with prediction
all right Rasmussen has a bowl
um talking about sex change surgery and
um also chemical changes
for minors
four miners what percentage of the
public do you think is against sex
change for minors
58 of likely voters
um
uh 58 uh are in favor of making it
illegal to do a sex change on a minor
slightly less but still a majority are
against uh hormone
uh replacement therapy
for children
four children
now
here's one of those bubble situations
that is perplexing
I've never met anybody who was in favor
of a gender change for a child have you
have you ever met like a real person who
was in favor of that
like anybody
and and something like you know a third
of the country is in favor of according
to this
how could that possibly be true
some of you some of you have talked to
somebody who's in favor of gender change
for children
not in real life I mean I've seen
interviews I've seen people but in my
real actual life I live in The Bluest
place in the world right I'm in
California
I live in California
all of my friends are Californians well
my local friends are all Californians
I don't know a single person who would
be in favor of that
and I know a lot of Democrats
I don't know anybody who would say
they're in favor of that
so what's happening here
I I'm not sure I've and as I say it I'm
not sure I've ever seen a real person
in an interview say they're in favor of
it I've seen The Advocates
but The Advocates are as a special case
is there anybody who's just a parent
you know they're not they're not really
involved in as an advocate they're just
a parent would they be in favor of that
no I've been I'm I'm willing to believe
that they exist but isn't it weird that
I have no contact with them in in
California I've got a real question
about the
what's going on here now I'm not
doubting the accuracy of the poll
I don't have any reason to doubt that
I'm just doubting the accuracy of
reality like I don't know how reality
makes sense if this is true how do I not
run into any of them
how could that never come up
strange
um
and then let's see uh
say same with the chemistry the
chemicals
well anyway on the trigonometry uh
trigonometry podcast which is a very
good podcast Michael schellenberger uh
was on there recently
and uh
I liked his summary of what we've
learned from the Twitter files and here
it was just the cleanest summary from
Michael schellenberger quote Twitter
changed his rules so they could get rid
of trump
that's the summary yeah that we know
that now because they didn't really have
any rules that he violated
so they made made up some rules to get
rid of them now even Jack Dorsey
disagreed with it
because even Jack said uh you had other
tools you could have removed one tweet
and kept the you know ex-president on
there or you could have given him like a
little time out like everybody else
you could have done anything
just don't do that now that was the
wrong thing to do
so
um and the same with the the laptop
story
um the Twitter sort of made rules
on on the Fly
now as shellenberger uh accurately
States and I will agree with them I
don't disagree with them making up rules
on the Fly
which sounds like it's contradictory
doesn't it I don't disagree with that
because the real world is always
throwing in new situations right there's
no two situations are quite the same so
if you just have a general rule and you
slavishly follow it even as reality is
changing your situation
um I do understand that you sometimes
have to update your rules because some
do thing came up but it doesn't look
like they did something useful in this
specific case
so I I love the way
shellenberger uh acknowledges both sides
that that's a very strong technique
because if you don't acknowledge the
other argument you just sound like an
activist or a proponent
you know he's trying to just tell you
what's real and what's not real so we'll
show you both sides
I like that
all right here's the most controversial
and mean thing that uh ever happened
I remind you if anybody is new to my
my content I'm a big fan and supporter
of the lgbtq and the trans community
which doesn't mean I agree with every
single you know policy change or
anything like that certainly not for
children
but I'm just a big supporter of adults
who have figured out what they want
uh if you're not happy go for it if it
doesn't work that was your right it was
your right to try it
I'm very uh big supporter of that
Community maybe more so than many of my
viewers so I give you that context
before I say the worst thing anybody
ever said about the trans community
you ready
are you ready
remember I'm a supporter
so the the context of this is trying to
be useful
not trying to be mean
not trying to hurt anybody
trying to be useful by understanding a
situation and I came to this opinion
while looking at
some tweets by uh
conservative Matt Walsh who's been
deeply into the trans conversation
and he was doing a very mean-spirited in
my opinion uh take down of
uh what's his name Dylan Mulvaney who is
what's his job he's is in the Biden
Administration and he's a very outspoken
trans
uh currently living as a woman
and
Matt Walsh is very unkind
in my opinion
uh in his let's say opinion of whether
or not that's actually a woman and you
know it was I I won't I won't repeat it
because it's a little meaner than I
would want to be now
here's where I agree with Matt Walsh
completely
but without the mean parts
all right
it's The Uncanny Valley problem
uncanny valley problem now this will be
an analogy
but in this case the analogy
um what I'm what I'm going to say is
that I'm not making an argument with an
analogy I'm saying that the same effect
might apply perfectly in this case
so the argument will be the the argument
don't don't imagine that the analogy is
the argument all right
the argument will just be the argument
but the analogy will get you to the
arguments you know what I'm saying
so we know there's a thing with Androids
and robots where if if a robot looks
like just a robot you could you could
say to yourself oh it's a cute little
robot there looks like a robot
what if they make your robot like an
Android that's so close to being a human
being but not quite
it disgusts us
because it looks like a human that's
unhealthy or unwell or something because
it's not quite right but you don't know
exactly why it just freaks you out and
creeps you out
all right so
the I believe the exact same effect is
happening with the Trans community and
the non-trans reaction to it
when I see Rachel Levine
also a trans woman
living as a woman
I am not I'm not grossed out
I'm not grossed out because when I see
Rachel Levine my brain says oh there is
someone who looks very much like a man
to me just that's just completely
subjective who prefers to live as a
woman
and I respect that
I'm not grossed out at all
because to me it looks like the the
robot that doesn't look like a person
like that racial Levine is not going you
know out of
her way to be female
and so it doesn't get close to The
Uncanny Valley problem it's just
something you might agree with or
disagree with but that's you know just
happening in your head but when Dylan
Mulvaney
um expresses let's say her
preference
it appears that she is trying to be as
close as possible to a biologically born
physically female person
but can't quite get there
isn't quite there really close
like if you'll get a score it you'd
probably score it like a like a 90
percent or better
I mean it's pretty close but it's The
Uncanny Valley
so again with love and affection
um that's a problem that you have to
navigate I don't know what the right
answer is but you should be aware if
you're considering transitioning you
should be aware that at least one of the
variables
is that The Closer you get to the
perfect version of what you're aiming
for you might be more
disturbing to people who are not
let's say as open to your change as you
would like them to be
all right now
do I get canceled for that
because I I genuinely and I genuinely
mean this to be useful
to the trans Community because I'm not
sure they understand that
they might
but do you think that the the trans
Community knows about the uncanny valley
because it's sort of a you know a niche
little thing that not everybody knows
about
you cannot be useful you say well the
only thing I can be useful to is uh
how some people might react
because that's part of the variables
doesn't mean you shouldn't do it
I'm not telling you that I'm not I'm not
giving you any info um let me be clear
let me be clear as a spokesperson for
the president often says let me be clear
um I'm not saying anybody should or
shouldn't do it that's their decision as
adults I'm just saying that one of the
variables you should consider
is if you get too close to your mark it
might have the opposite effect that you
were shooting for
that's all
right
um
I saw some tweeting about Ukraine that
all of us can agree all tweets and
information about Ukraine
are unreliable like a really unreliable
but still fun to talk about and I have
this question I saw two tweeters who
seem to know what they're talking about
but who knows
claim that the number that the Russian
military that's in Ukraine could be uh
well over 90 percent of all the Russian
military
you know the part that actually works
do you believe that do you believe that
that Russia is already all in with the
stuff that still functions right they
might have massive assets that aren't
very good that aren't part of it and I
don't know what the 90 includes does
include weapons and people or just
people
so almost everybody's saying no in the
comments
let me um
so that was my first reaction as well
so my first reaction is now they don't
have 90 of their functional Army in the
Ukraine and then I said to myself
they better
that's what I'd do
if I were to put if I were Putin I would
put 90 or more of my entire Army into
that fight
do you know why because he can't lose
he can't lose that fight
right he can't lose and and it's pretty
close to looking like that's a
possibility
I think Putin would put 100 of his
assets in there that worked the good
stuff
I think it's close to 100 because does
does Russia have any risk on any other
front
no
China is not attacking Russia they have
no risk anywhere else in the world if
they haven't put 90 plus percent of
their assets into that fight already
that's a mistake
am I wrong
it's a mistake they have to put it all
they have to put they have to be all in
because losing is just not an option
now what about Ukraine
Ukraine's all then don't you think
Ukraine probably has greater than 100 of
their military in the fight because they
have like other people fighting like
they have people that were not even
Ukrainian fighting so ukrainians like
maybe a hundred and twenty percent in
the fight
like 20 that's not even the Ukrainian
militaries in the fight
whereas Russia if they have if they have
less than 90 of all their good stuff
including their people who can actually
fight if they have less than 90 percent
they're not taking you seriously
now let me ask you again
because almost everybody said no they do
not have 90 percent of their working
assets military assets dedicated to
Ukraine
now that I've explained it that it would
be stupid to have less than 90 percent
now what do you think did I change your
mind
anybody change their mind
all right so I'm getting a few more
yeses but a lot of no's
uh I respect your skepticism
I respect your skepticism yeah
yeah I I'm not going to say that I have
a high confidence that it's 90 but I
will say I have a high confidence
that if it's not over 90 percent that
Putin's making a mistake
would you agree with that
would you agree that if he's not putting
over 90 of his working assets and people
that's a mistake
now
what's the account argument give me give
me the quick counter argument
I'm ignoring Japan
what does Japan have to do with Ukraine
and Russia
I don't understand that
a counter-attack
China has a claim on Cyber yet but
they're not going to move on it
you think China's going to move on
Siberia because Russia is busy that's
not going to happen
that's never going to happen
all right
um
Russia and Japan have disputed Islands
oh okay so they're disputed islands and
you're saying that Japan might move on
those disputed Islands have you met
Japan
have you met Japan
you think Japan is going to mount a a
offensive War
come on that's not serious
just because they have an opportunity
you think they're going to mount an
offensive war against Russia that's not
going to happen
all right
well I could be wrong about it all but
uh I think if he doesn't have 90 in
there he's he's stupid and he's not
stupid
that's my view if he doesn't have 90 in
the fight he's stupid and he doesn't
look stupid
or Aya good point
as a felony videos points out or
possibly I'm stupid that is a
possibility
all right you would not be surprised at
the following
that there's a new study that says that
uh you practically can't get myocarditis
from covid but man you could certainly
get it from the shots
are you surprised that there's a new
study that says that all of the
myocarditis is probably from the shots
and none of it is from the covet is
anybody surprised
would you be surprised that about a year
ago there was a massive study that said
exactly the opposite in a big way
exactly the opposite and in a big way
now you know what they they don't
clarify
here's my guess my guess is that if if
coven itself caused any myocarditis
and I don't know at this point if it did
it might have been bad under Alpha and
Delta exactly your your enemy it's the
variance but probably or just
theoretically uh under Omicron
so here's a here's the issue it's
starting to look like uh getting the
shot might have been good for some
people during Alpha and Delta
but maybe more bad than good under
Omicron
now that's very preliminary it could be
that it was all bad all the time very
possible
could be that it was all good all the
time
I don't think so but possible
so we're still in the not completely
knowing what's going on for sure but
just be aware
that there are two credible looking
studies that say wildly the opposite
wildly wildly the opposite I
how do you deal with that
how do you deal with the fact that
there's a study that looks sort of
credible that says basically nobody gets
myocarditis from
covered and it's all from the shots
and then a study from just one year ago
exactly the opposite there's like a huge
difference it's like all from this it's
all from the covet and you can also get
it from the shots
all right both state both studies say
you can get myocarditis from the shots
just to be clear
both studies say that
but one says that's all of it
and the other one says it's much less
than if you just got the coven
and then the next question is
suppose you have the shots first and
then you get the covet
now
of course I you know I tweeted both the
studies so you can see the difference
and here's the interesting thing
uh one viewer looked at the study that
said that
the covid gives you the myocarditis and
said no the title is misleading it says
right here in the study that it's the
opposite
so really Scott you got you read the
headline wrong you got fooled by this
fake headline but if you actually go
into the body of the study it says the
opposite
so I went into the body of the study and
it does not say the opposite
but do you think I could convince
the person who said it did
then it didn't say the opposite I could
not I could not I could not convince
them that what they were saying was not
real now here here is here's the there
was one statement that if you looked out
of context it looked like it said the
opposite of the headline
but if you looked at that one statement
in the body of the context It reversed
it again
so there's something that you see out of
context that says the sky is blue you
got a little bit of context it says no
no this guy is not blue
uh and even that little bit of change we
disagreed what that said
these are two educated people
looking at the same thing written in
clear English
and one said it says wildly left and
then I said no it says wildly right and
very clearly so and we could not solve
that
we could not solve that
now I think I'm right and I think you
know the the other individual is
experiencing cognitive dissonance but it
could be the other way
it could be the other way
who knows
um and then there's a
there's a study that uh
long coveted brains are very different
so the people who who had coveted but
presumably not a vaccination
um when you when you look at their
brains they're clearly damaged
so the the coven people have damaged
brains and you can see the difference
now does that mean that so-called
vaccinated people does that mean that
they don't have damaged brains I don't
know
I don't know
everything you look at is sketchy
right because you look at it you think
it's telling you something and then you
realize what what they're not telling
you and as soon as you realize what
they're not telling you
like all the credibility goes away
this guy is hung up on covet
so if your brain if your brain is uh
damaged by covid would you not want to
know
is that something you'd not be
interested in massive brain damage
no interest
all right
there's also increasing evidence that
the shots were bad for pregnant women
and young people
and
does anybody remember me suggesting that
if you were pregnant you should get a
a under-tested vaccination
did I ever recommend that
nope nope I did not I did not
but a number of people would like to
fact check me for my personal medical
decisions
good
that's not a thing
there's yeah here here's the thing that
almost everybody misses in the
vax or no vax conversation
and by the way I haven't heard anybody
mention this but one of the biggest
variables is is always left out
and it's one I haven't mentioned before
believe it or not so it's not about long
covet or any of the stuff we've talked
about there's one gigantic variable
for the people who decided to vaccinate
or not that I've never seen discussed
what it does to you psychologically
a lot of people who got the shots
immediately felt better
in psychologically
is that nothing
is that a nothing
if you had a year or two of feeling
safer
even if you weren't like even if in fact
you weren't
isn't that worth a lot two years of
feeling safe
and there was nothing you could do about
it really you know maybe or maybe there
was who knows
all right
so in suppose suppose you were uh very
much concerned or afraid of the
vaccination
if let's say that was your your
mentality was you were very concerned
about the danger from the shot itself
and let's say you're 40 years old and
and don't have too many comorbidities
are you really afraid of the shot itself
would I recommend that you got that shot
what do you think
do you think I'd recommend a healthy 40
year old
get the shot
if their mentality was oh I'm really
concerned about the long-term no no I
would not
who imagines I would have
like who could even imagine I would have
done that of course not
yeah I did not of course
and the people who imagined that I ever
suggested what anybody else should do
with their health
the reason you know I didn't do that is
because I never talked about the mental
part
if I talked about the mental part then I
would be getting very close to something
that was like suggesting what you should
do or not do as I am now I guess
but I never did that
because that was just purely your own
decision
we were you know we we all had
inadequate information purely your own
decision yeah I talked about how I felt
and then people fact checked me
it doesn't work like that
how I feel is a huge part of my mental
and physical health
well by definition
what if I vermekton made you feel safe
then take it
did I ever tell anybody to not take
Ivermectin
you ever hear that
does that ever come out no I've said
consistently
if you think it works and your doctor
agrees and
or even if your doctor doesn't agree the
risk seems so low that
why not if it made you feel better
sure you know the the placebo effect
alone
would make Ivermectin work
am I wrong
if you had any drug that worked say on
30 of the people who took it that would
be like one of the best drugs of all
time
Ivermectin should work on around 30
percent of the people whether it works
or not
whether it works or not
30 of the people should have seen some
what they imagined was a benefit
so yeah I would never tell you to take
it or not to take it and never did
all right
um
but I maintained that so far I am the
rightest person on the pandemic if you
count everything from closing traffic to
calling out fat she is wrong to Mass to
vaccinations
to shutdowns I was right on every
element in every part of it
the only person as far as now I believe
I was the rightest person by far
and it's possible that I'll get a blood
clot and die
those could both be true
right
there's not the chances that you know
someday I die from a blood clot in five
years totally possible
from from making a sub-optimal choice
totally possible
but I'm still the rightest person on all
the analysis because you can make the
right decision
and nothing's a hundred percent so you
can make all the right decisions and
still die from your decisions that's not
even unusual
now review your statements on climate
models the best ever
yeah I I have the best opinions on
climate change of anybody by far
nobody's even close
yeah I've been right on everything on
climate change
I'm looking for some more pushback
because I'm making the ridiculous claims
but they're they're also true in my
opinion but I expected more pushback
uh what about cernovich has come at the
fetterman is a baller because he he
risked his own health to get elected
there's something to that
yeah yeah
cernovich doesn't say crazy right
like you could agree with him or
disagree with them but there's always
something there there's something to
that yeah there's substance to that
opinion
I'll just say that you know the the
question of whether uh
it was good for him
is separate the question of whether his
wife or anybody else pushed him is
separate but yes when you see somebody
who takes personal risk to do something
that I believe he thought he was doing
something good for the country
at least good for the country according
to Democrats so yeah any anybody who
puts their life on the line
for public benefit
has to be respected
so I do respect that
uh
criminal call after cutting off 37 man
buns in one day
how in the world do you cut off 37 man
buns and not be killed
how did that happen
I know he did it with a knife but
wow that was crazy
all right
um
brain surgeon looking for clots
all right
um anything else happening what else did
I miss
uh Robert kioski called the Biden family
the Biden crime family
oh there you go
yeah I think you can call the Biden's a
crime family because remember the the
government is guilty until proven
innocent yeah there are individuals as
individuals they're innocent until
proven guilty but since they're acting
you know in the form of the government
the government's guilty
unless they can prove they're not if
they can't prove they're not you're you
have every reasonable right to assume
that they're guilty because it wouldn't
be hard to prove that they're not guilty
all right
uh
oh there's an idea somebody's suggesting
that if I got a man bun I could cover my
male powder pattern baldness
that might be the best idea I've heard
because I was I was thinking of
converting to Judaism
just so I'd always have a little hat to
cover up the bald spot
but that felt like a big sacrifice so I
think I'll just grow my hair out and
have a man bum right on top
I think I could rock that
totally rock that are you seeing the
videos of the Tate brothers
now
um
where uh Andrew Tate doesn't get to
shave his head probably in in prison or
whatever however they're being detained
so his hair is growing back in the
shaved part and on the sides and the the
unfortunate uh outcome
is that it's changing from uh you know a
strong masculine look with the shaved
head
and it's it's turning him into the
pointy-haired boss with with the two
Tufts on the side and you know bald in
the middle and
that it's a it's a real lesson
on presenting yourself
it's a real lesson and I'm going to give
him a compliment right I do think that
uh the Andrew Tate in particular he does
a better job working with you know what
he was born with than just about anybody
right he does a really good job of
turning what he has into the best asset
it could be you know I'm seeing a lot of
uh
a lot of people like uh Pierce Pierce
Morgan for example
agree with the Andrew Tate let's say
philosophy to some degree not 100
percent
um and and just being forced to say that
yeah the the Andrew Tay thing
is really not about Andrew Tate if you
think it's about him you're missing the
whole story
right the reason that he has a massive
following is he's saying the things that
everybody's thinking
that's it
it's because of us that he's famous he's
not famous just because he's good at it
and he's good at it he is famous because
he says things that people agree with
that's it
but I don't think we want to deal with
that yet
I don't think we want to deal with the
fact that uh men and boys
feel so victimized that they need some
kind of guidance to you know get them on
a stronger path
and
uh if he's you know contributing to that
message
it's a positive if he's just turning him
into a little dirt bag misogynist not so
good
not so good
well I would say as of today that I'm
not familiar
with anything I would consider
convincing evidence that they committed
crimes
now I've said this before but it's time
to say it again
the the Tate situation is not like
anything else and here's why
I've always wondered what would happen
when a master Persuader goes to trial
now I heard about one case where a
hypnotist went to trial and got
convicted
for some bad behavior but I always
thought to myself if if the case were
more complicated let's say the the one
hypnotist I guess did one bad thing with
one underage person
so that was sort of a simple thing yes
or no and the jury decided he was guilty
but the Tates are involved in something
that at the very least is complicated
it is Complicated by
you know who's trying to do what who's
after them are they just victims did
they really do a crime were were the
women really agreeing to it were they
not there's some kind of indication that
there's some messages that have been
recovered from the girls plotting to
take Tate down with fake claims
now I don't know if the messages are
real but if they're real
it would suggest that there was a plot
to take them down which doesn't mean
they didn't commit any crimes right
every nothing is guaranteeing anything
else
but
um here's what you need to know
Andrew Tate's Success is Not an Accident
it's because he knows how to communicate
and he is a trained Persuader
so his his talent stack includes
everything from fighting to
Communications to you know putting on a
look that that has a certain appeal to
uh to getting women
right he has a whole bunch of talents in
his stack
but he's very smart and one of the
talents that he's added is hypnosis
and persuasion directly
he's an expert on persuasion
and if you put an expert on persuasion
who actually understands hypnosis I
don't think he's a hypnotist but he
would understand it
you put him into a trial situation and I
think he walks
even if he's guilty
so I think what's going to happen is
now things could be different in Romania
it's a corrupt system so maybe
you know maybe it doesn't matter how
good your defense is I don't know
but
if if the trial is fair
and the Tates get to determine how the
defense is is managed I think they walk
and it's only it has nothing to do with
guilt
I'm not making any opinion on their
guilt I believe that his skill level
is greater than the judicial system in
Romania
that's what I think I think that's not a
fair fight
that he's not in the fight yet because
he's just being held like you know in a
detention so he's not able to mount any
kind of a defense
but if it becomes public I don't know if
they do that in Romania but if you
imagine it's public
he wins
if it's a fair trial
he wins
because he has the skill to induce
Reasonable Doubt
in almost any situation
even if you think well it's right here
here's the memo we've got all these
Witnesses he can make all that go away
he could make all of that go away and I
don't think you understand the degree of
his skill
now I'm not saying it's guaranteed he
could just be convicted and we'll never
know what the what the deal was it's
possible
but I'm going to bet on him uh not only
getting out of it but getting out of it
like Nelson Mandela
you know what I mean
as in coming back stronger
because if he can add to his current
narrative because you know he's a he's a
construction of his own making you know
that whatever opinion you have of Tate
he's created
right that's just the construction of
his
uh if he beats this charge
the next construction will be he's
Nelson Mandela the system tried to take
him down
but he was stronger than the system
that's going to be really appealing
yeah now
uh Lance says he Tate is a predator not
a Persuader well he could be both
he could be both I'm not supporting him
just to be clear uh if anybody's new to
me again uh I hate him
for personal reasons right for personal
interactions I hate him would I be happy
if he went to jail for a long time yeah
I would
honestly
I would be totally happy he what he did
to me personally
I I would be perfectly fine if he went
to jail for 10 years
I don't even care if he's I don't even
care if he's innocent
I think Karma
Karma might just take care of it
right maybe Karma will take care of it
now here's another question for you
is it a coincidence that the people I
want to go down seem to go down quite
often
have you ever noticed that
when somebody is my Nemesis bad things
seem to happen to them not because I did
anything I mean I didn't do anything in
Romania it just seems like another one
of those coincidences
of the Trump effect yeah
foreign
all right
uh yes there are lots of coincidences am
I aligned with the intelligence
community
what do you mean aligned
do you mean working with them
I'm not in anybody's payroll
and and I'm not aware of any assignments
I've been given from the intelligence
community
uh what did he do to you never mind it
was personal
it's all over the internet but it was
personal
um do I meet with them not that I'm
aware of
you know but the whole thing about
working with the intelligence community
um it's that's a real gray area
it's a real gray area if the CIA came to
you and said hey you know could you do
us a favor would you do it
would depend on the favor obviously but
let's say it was something easy
no my ex-wife has never met Tate but
Tate says they met
and believe me I would know because she
would tell me and she would just tell me
but no they've never met
that they had one exchange of DMS where
she sent him a generic response like
everybody else and then he made a he
made a whole rumor out of it
um
there's nothing easy the CIA would ask
you to sure there is sure there is
suppose the CIA said to you uh we'd like
you to start a company
that does the following things
and then you say well I'm not you know I
do start companies and I do that kind of
work but I don't want to do it just
because you said so
and then the CIA says we could pretty
much guarantee you'll get a government
contract
because we need somebody to be in this
business
and you say what they go yeah
we will guarantee that you're rich
what
I will guarantee it because we'll make
sure that you have gigantic customers
because those customers also like to
work with us
so if you create a company that does
this kind of a product that the CIA
would like to see exist
what we'll do is make sure that you have
lots of customers and maybe the
government will be one
so you don't even have to worry about
making money now do you want to do it
okay let me let me understand this you
get a guarantee that I make money in
this business just because you think it
would be good for the United States
to have somebody in this business
and then the CIA says yup that's exactly
it
you will you'll have no connection to us
we will have no uh we will not be paying
you
you don't have to do anything for us
we're not asking you for any favors
we're just giving you one
we're giving you a favor
because it's good for the country
so we'd like to see a company that can
do this let's say technology or whatever
it is and so we'll put you in business
there you go
you're way ahead of me
do you think it's ever happened
do you think that there are any big
companies that you're aware of today
that the CIA may have helped along
but it helped them along a little bit
yeah probably
not all of them but probably
I would rule out my pillow probably not
my pillow
yes all right that's all for now that is
the best live stream you've ever seen
provocative content
surely to get me banned in some way
if that still happens
and I'm going to say goodbye to the
YouTube people and talk to the people on
locals for a little bit because they're
special
if you were on locals you would see my
special man cave broadcasts
in which we do things with we do not do
in the morning
we do them from the man cave
and they're fun you should enjoy it bye
for now
