oh
hey i didn't see you there you snuck in
here without me even noticing
good morning good morning it's time
for coffee with scott adams the best
time of the day
every single time and all you need is a
copper mug or glass a tanker gels design
a canteen jaguar flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes
everything better you know it does it's
called the simultaneous hip and it
happens now
go
ah
i feel as if
even remdezavir works now
it's because of the coffee if you add
coffee to
any therapeutic or vaccine
it's more effective a lot of people
don't know that but that's why i'm here
to educate you speaking of educating you
i'm experimenting with a new form of
education
have you ever noticed that if you take a
class
in anything it's really boring
have you noticed that have you noticed
that education
just in general boring as
hell does it need to be
probably not probably not sometimes it's
just because
we say that a class has to be 45 minutes
and then you just make it 45 minutes why
does
every class have to be 45 minutes or an
hour or whatever
don't you think that there are some
types of content
that you should hit in 10 minutes and
then let it rest for a day
we have this structure set up that's
completely wrong
for learning so i'm doing a little
experiment over on the
locals platform where i have content for
subscribers only and what i'm doing is
i'm putting what i call
micro lessons there and a micro lesson
would be maybe a two to three minute
lesson
on some really focused and
immediately useful life skill
and the idea here is if you've watched
other uh
youtube videos on any topic
let me give you uh let me give you my
impression
of looking up a youtube video
that will explain how to do something
that i want to do and let's say the
thing is
i want to learn how to let's say
repaint my house and i'll go to the
video on
how to paint your house and i'll click
it and i'll say great
this is exactly what i need i want to
paint my house i don't know how
this video is going to tell me and then
the guy will come in and he'll say
so i've been doing videos for
six months and some people said some
things i should change and i'd be like
how about painting the house
can we get to the part where you tell me
how to paint the freaking house
and it'll be five ten minutes later
before he starts talking
and then he talks way too slowly like
i'm doing right now
because your patience and your your
attention span has been shrinking every
year
especially lately because your your
smartphones and social media are just
shrinking your attention span like crazy
so if you can't get education down to
tiny little nuggets it's probably
more than you want to handle because
your life's pretty complicated and
fast moving so if i can't put it into a
little nugget for you it's probably not
going to work so here's
here's some of the classes micro classes
so these are like two three minute
classes
on locals so you got locals.com if you
wanted to be there
i taught uh had to talk like a hypnotist
success strategies i went through some
basic life success strategies
using imagination to fuel your success
programming yourself for bad habit for
good habits not bad habits
how to ask for what you want those these
are basic
life skills do you know how many people
don't know how to simply ask for what
they want
just really basic life skills um
knowing when to trust experts and when
not to
pretty useful and uh i'm working on what
i haven't done yet and i had to know you
have
a good product or service so anyway
that's there
the rasmussen report says that 61
of people are actually likely voters
61 of likely voters think trump
should concede 61
at the same time 47 percent
nearly half say it's likely that
democrats
stole the votes or destroyed pro-trump
ballots in several states
to ensure his victory so so think about
the
enormity of these two numbers
61 percent of voters likely voters
think trump should uh concede
but half of voters think the the
election was stolen
that means that there's a whole bunch of
people in this country
who who have the following thoughts the
election was stolen
let's just go with it let's just go with
it
and now if you said to yourself
would this work if the situation had
been reversed
would you find that the the democrats
if they believed let's say 50 percent of
the country believed
that trump had won but it was a rigged
election
do you think the democrats would say ah
darn it
darn it i sure wish we hadn't had a
rigged election
but all right we'll just we'll just
figure down on the next election
do you think they would have just said
that because the the republicans
kind of are that that's kind of what
they're saying
they're kind of saying uh we think it
was stolen
we're gonna live with it anyway
what would be behind that i have
an opinion i would say as a preliminary
opinion i'll just put it out there and
you can
decide if you like it i think
conservatives slash republicans
have this general philosophical sense
that if there was something that went
wrong that they could have fixed
it's a little bit on them a little bit
of a let's say a bias for accepting
responsibility
even if it wasn't your job if you could
have done something about it
do you think there's something that you
personally
could have done more or better
collectively let's say
you know you personally but also
collectively to have
gotten to a better place in this
election where it was either more
certain or your candidate won
and probably there are a lot of
republicans and conservatives who are
saying
some version of this you know
maybe if i'd made more
noise about having a fair election or
i'd fought harder to get rid of mail-in
votes or i'd
complain differently or i'd volunteered
to be a watcher
maybe there's something i could have
done so we wouldn't be in this situation
i see i see one person agreeing with me
i don't know if i'll get more
but i do believe that republicans
are are biased and again anything i say
about republicans or democrats
never means every one of them right
so you're all smart enough to know when
i make generalities it doesn't mean
every person
it just means there's a tendency or you
know a bias
i think republicans say well we had our
shot
it's our own damn fault we'll try to
figure it out next time
i don't know if that's widespread but i
feel that at least
some people feel that way because i i
feel that way a little bit myself
i feel that if i let the
the process run
meaning that the legal process does what
the legal process does
and then we get to the end of it and the
challenges are somewhat extinguished
even if i'm certain
that the election was stolen i'm
actually going to be completely okay
with it
completely okay like a hundred percent
okay
that doesn't mean i don't still think
maybe the election was stolen
but if the elect if the process goes
forward
and the the consensus of the country is
it's just time to move on
you know you you can't fix the past
can't fix history can't have everything
the way you want it
but you can maybe improve you can maybe
fix it for the next time
if you still have that option i hope we
do
so i've got a feeling that there's a lot
of uh
what's what's the word uh capitulation
as they say in the financial markets
there's a lot of
capitulation going people who believe
that the
election was rigged and are still
still willing to say well
all right we'll get them next time
that's what it feels like it's
that's the way it feels like it's uh
shaping up
um interestingly when i look at the cnn
homepage i see no stories about
alleged election fraud
except stories saying it didn't happen
and
trump is crazy and any any of his
followers who
think any of that stuff happened they're
crazy too
and i thought to myself can you think of
other situations
where the accusation itself wasn't
enough to make news
and and i'm curious if you can think of
any other example of that because it
seems to me that the accusation is
pretty much 80 percent of the news isn't
it
isn't 80 of all news somebody's accusing
somebody of something that
typically ends up not being true
more often than not it's not true so
why is this the one time that an
accusation it's not news
well the answer is this that news is
also persuasion
and the left does not want you to think
that the you know the irregularities
alleged and real um made a difference
and if they even reported the
allegations there would be so many of
them
i guess there were 220 sworn affidavits
or something like that
even if you'd say half of them were
complete bs
if they just talked about all the
allegations you would come away thinking
that the election was rigged so
your brain not you personally but brains
in general
they work on uh how often you see
something
whether your attention is brought to it
far more than
your logic and your reason those things
are largely illusions anyway you don't
have a lot of logic and reason
but you think you do what you really
have is
things you spend time thinking about
and if cnn made you think about
allegations of fraud
even if their reporting said none of
these are true
your brain would still record sure was a
lot of fraud
so they have this weird situation where
even if they reported
all the allegations and said every one
of them is false
you'd still come away thinking there was
a lot of fraud so they can't even cover
the story
without influencing you to think there
was the opposite of how they covered the
story
so it's kind of a kind of a kind of a
tough spot they're in
have you noticed that the social media
platforms have gotten a total pass
on election interference before the
election we were
talking about them a lot what we were
talking less about
was outright fraud but once the election
happens
and you've got something real to talk
about not hypothetical
and there are lots of reports of fraud
we'll find out how many of them are real
but it seems that fraud is the shiny
object
and that if you were to perhaps if you
were to
somehow and i imagine it's impossible to
do this
but if you could measure how many votes
were
determined by fraud and let's say you
think that there were a bunch
and maybe even be millions let's say
worst case scenario i'll just pick a
number
worst case scenario you're very
skeptical of the election
and you think god i think that election
may have moved
fraudulently i don't know five
six million votes something like that
that'd be a lot that'd be that'd be a
lot of fraud
how many votes do you think social media
moved
if if you were to imagine i'll even up
that a little bit i'll take it to 10
million
let's take it to 10 million the worst
case scenario
of the worst accusation of how many
fraudulent votes there were
i doubt there were 10 million but let's
just use this as our
thought experiment here how many votes
do you think
social media moved by being
biased toward a side well i would think
a lot more than 10 million
i don't know how you would measure such
a thing it's
it's largely impossible to measure
because there's so many variables
i don't think you could tease out how
much was the social media
impact maybe you could i can't imagine
it's doable
but i feel as if social media
is hiding behind the alleged
you know direct fraud accusations
because they're just more interesting at
the moment and social media is like
don't look over here nothing happened
here
no direct evidence right so
i think that was an interesting outcome
uh i've noticed that
as more and more let's say trump
supporters
start to move toward conceding
or suggesting that the president should
concede
that the number of his remaining
supporters
shrinks and then instead of being
lots of targets there are fewer and
fewer
targets now my message
is not like i believe can can you
fact-check me on this
i believe that the things i'm saying
about the the
allegations of fraud are different
than what other people are saying would
you say that's true
would you say that my take on the fraud
allegations is different
than most trump supporters
for example i don't think that the
venezuelan
whistleblower is real but probably i
would bet
the majority of trump supporters are
willing to buy into that story
so i don't think that my version
or my opinion really maps too much to
anybody else's at the moment
but one of the ways i'm noticing my
critics are going after me
is by lumping me with other people who
have different arguments
because it's hard to go after my
arguments because they're
so darn reasonable it would be one thing
to say
adams believes everything that
that is being alleged now if i believed
everything that was being alleged
i would be a laughable figure and you
could lump in with
anybody else and that would be fair but
you can't really do that
i have a fairly nuanced opinion that
doesn't attract anybody else's
and it's a little bit harder to assail
in part because i don't pick absolutes
which are impossible to
to support so i think that the only way
that you can go after me
is to say that i'm really just rudy
giuliani or i'm really just
some other troll on the internet and
that i'm just like that
i saw this approach this morning where
somebody pointed to some article that
had nothing to do with me
a complete stranger wrote an article
with an opinion
and then somebody tweets that uh this
guy is just like me
and i look at it's like well just like
me except
we don't share any opinions
and i get i get thrown in with a
stranger because they can't attack me
directly which is a good place to be i
guess
i asked this question on twitter and i
think it's a sort of
a question that people will interpret
differently so i don't know if you can
make anything from the answers
but i did a little unscientific twitter
poll
and i asked this question if you
personally
and personally is important to this if
you personally have no proof
of any election fraud and wouldn't you
say that would apply to most of us right
there there are allegations and there's
evidence
but meaning there's people making
allegations that's the evidence
but that's not proof that's that's well
short of proof so here's the question if
you personally have no proof
of election fraud which which opinion
would be the most reasonable one to hold
in 2020
so you have no proof of fraud do you
believe
would you believe with no proof zero
proof
do you believe that the election was
probably fair
or probably rigged with no proof
what do you think the the uh responses
were
well last i checked 88 said it was
probably rigged
and say that even if there was
no proof is it reasonable
to have a belief that something was
rigged
with no proof now if there was a little
bit of proof
i think we'd all agree it's reasonable
to have an opinion you got a little bit
of proof might not hold up but you got a
little bit of it
but hypothetically if you had none
would you still believe it was rigged
with no proof
i would and i would argue that it was
completely reasonable
why because you don't need proof of the
obvious
let me give you some more questions and
see if you can answer the following
questions
with no proof is there
oxygen in china
can you prove it show me a study
show me a study that says that there's
oxygen
in china today oh yeah you have studies
that there used to be oxygen in china
yeah i'll agree with you on that but
show me your study
that says there's oxygen in china today
you don't have any so you're going to
claim there's oxygen in china
with no proof zero proof
and yet and yet you're willing to go out
there and say
i think there's oxygen in china with no
proof
no proof there are some things
which by their nature do not require
proof
it's just obvious and when you have a
big complicated system that has
software all over it and you have the
greatest incentive in the world
for intelligence agencies as well as
partisans on both sides
at least the evil elements of them
to attempt to mischief you are going to
get it every time
it's like oxygen in china there's no
scenario in which it
can't happen it's impossible for it
not to be true based on everything else
you know about the world and
physics and the fact that air doesn't
stay in one place
it has to be true so if you ask me is
there massive fraud in american
elections i would say
how could there not be i mean really
how could there not be but if you're not
going to be
stupid you have to take it to the next
to the next level which is probably both
sides
probably both sides if you're not
willing to say
probably both sides and you know in
varying degrees it doesn't mean both
sides do the same amount
the same way every election or anything
like that but if you can't admit
that there are probably cheaters on both
sides
you're not really a legitimate
you know person in this conversation
you're really not legitimate
of course it would be both sides
might be different amounts but it would
certainly be both sides
now what we don't know is if the
cheating would be sufficient to
change a result that i would say that
nobody knows that
but you can't say that there's no that
the election was not at least attempted
to be rigged
so the legal challenges are falling like
flies
um but let me make an observation about
the legal challenges which have been
thrown out of court for being
apparently laughably weak in some cases
would you say that in let's say the
financial market
would you say in the financial market
that past performance
can predict future performance
well if you believe that you're going to
be poor
because it doesn't work everybody who's
ever tried to
invest in the stock market and said well
i'll just look at what happened in the
past
and assume that keeps happening with an
individual stock
the one assumption you can make is that
the the
general market will go up over time but
for an individual stock
its history doesn't tell you anything
it really doesn't and as soon as you
think that the history of that one stock
tells you something
you're on your way to losing all your
money because it just doesn't predict
and likewise no matter how many lawsuits
get thrown out
for being laughably weak it does not
predict
how strong the next one is you get that
right
i'd like to think that everybody
watching this periscope
understands that the last
lawsuit does not predict what the next
one looks like
it doesn't work that way so all the
people saying
there will be no good law lawsuit coming
because other ones have been rejected
there's no
logical thread to that now of course you
could say it's the same people involved
but even that's not true because the
lawsuits are coming from
individuals or coming from different
probably different members of the legal
team
etc and i also think that the early
lawsuits
were about keeping the argument alive i
think the early lawsuits were just to
you know make sure that the public knew
there were big questions
you know let the public know that the
questions were not just
one thing but might involve a variety of
things
and that lots of people are involved
questioning it
so if the only thing the legal team did
was send the public the message hey
there's not only questions here but
there are so many questions
that you could have lots of different
lawsuits because there are so many
questions
even if they lose them all was a good
strategy to flood the zone with weak
lawsuits well i'm no legal expert
but it might be because remember you're
you're fighting on two fronts
trump is fighting on the public opinion
front which could affect
let's say the legislatures and you know
the
whether there's a credibility for the
outcome in general
and then there's the legal cases so i
would say that trump was
winning the public the public opinion
contest by flooding the zone
with weak weak
lawsuits because remember i talked about
cnn not even talking about the fraud
accusations
because even if you just talk about them
people will think they're real
even if the thing you're talking about
is that they're not real
likewise trump using the same strategy
basic
the same same concept by flooding the
zone with lots of lawsuits
if 100 of them get thrown out eventually
but while you're thinking about it
there's more in the pipeline
as long as there's more in the pipeline
you're going to say to yourself
well there must be something to it
because there are so many lawsuits how
could there be
so many lawsuits if there's nothing to
it
so the legal team is a hundred percent
winning the public opinion battle
with weak lawsuits because it just makes
you think something's happening
so everybody who says your your lawsuit
record
on the initial ones is terrible
is correct but that wasn't really the
play was it
i think the play was more about the
public opinion and
and they're winning because as you saw
half of the country thinks thinks the
election was thrown
that's winning you know in terms of
public opinion
um i've got a prediction about the
venezuelan whistleblower
are you ready for this i think you're
going to laugh at this
because this will be one of those cases
that i teach
that there are six dimensions of humor
and if you get at least two of them into
your joke it's funny
one of the dimensions is recognition
meaning you recognize it in your own
life
so i'm going for that element of humor
uh
and then some some cleverness and it
goes like this
if this venezuelan whistleblower is real
what would be the things you would
already be seeing
would you be seeing a photograph
of the whistleblower because i think the
whole point of it
is he's willing to be public right i
haven't seen a picture of him
and i'm wondering why not what about
would you see him appearing on hannity
would you see the whistleblower
appearing on tucker carlson's show
if he were real
yeah yeah by now
now maybe he wouldn't have appeared by
now but you would at least say
you would at least be hearing hannity or
tucker or somebody saying
we've booked him he's going to be on
next week have you heard that yet
nope haven't heard that here's what i
believe
is happening as i've said before
if you're in a if you're an attorney
working for a client
you have a responsibility to the client
to make the best case even if in your
own mind you're thinking
some of it may not hold up you still
have a responsibility to your client
so as long as this whistleblower is
making the claim
i think sydney powell is it was is
within her
ethical and uh appropriate
zone to put it forward
even if she doesn't personally have
confidence in it
if she doesn't have reason to debunk it
well
it's out there it's evidence and she
might also think that the software has
some issues
which are not necessarily being
whistleblown by this this
whistleblower but maybe it gets you
closer to
some kind of a deeper audit into the
code maybe
maybe it just moves you forward even if
this isn't
exactly accurate so here's what i think
is happening here's what i think is the
funny part
all betty's not returning calls
i'm i'm just gonna guess but i'll bet at
this point
sydney powell and her team are putting
in phone calls to the whistleblower and
saying hey
maybe could we talk to you again get a
got some follow-up questions
we've got some interview requests like
to see if you'd do them
and they put in the message i bet he's
not calling back
or they email them and say hey would you
do this and you get sort of a
non-committal answer back or
or uh i i've got to go get some work
done i'm going to do some traveling
maybe when i'm done traveling we could
talk about these interviews
i'll bet you i'll bet a large amount of
money on this
the sidney powell is getting the stall
and the run around if that's true then
obviously he's
not a real whistleblower now of course
the whistleblower could
you know you can't rule this out maybe
afraid for his safety
or something like that but i doubt he
would have come forward in the first
place
if he were not willing to eventually be
public
why would he do that i mean you wouldn't
you wouldn't come forward if you weren't
willing to be public
because they're going to find you right
so
i'm looking at angry all caps yelling
guy
on the comments
yeah and maybe it panics the
conspirators
somebody says so that's my guess is that
the venezuelan whistleblower is going to
be
quote hard to get a hold of i think he's
going to be a little hard to get a hold
of
just saying and by the way
if you turn on tv they'll say tomorrow
night and that whistleblower is a guest
on hannity
everything i think is wrong
about the whistleblower i don't think
you're going to see the whistleblower
on tv what do you think do you think
you'll ever see him
because i think he's a disinformation
play
all right um here are some things that
we've learned
recently about the coronavirus that we
didn't know before
uh there's a thought now that
asymptomatic
carriers are not carriers if you're
asymptomatic you're probably not
spreading the disease
and if you are it's so rare that you
could almost
forget about it so we don't worry too
much about asymptomatic
we know that outdoors is safer than
indoors
we know from studies that opening
schools doesn't seem to spread it even
though
some places are closing schools anyway
we know that
wearing gloves didn't seem to make a
difference
for example when i get gas
the first you know first month of the
pandemic when i would go to get gas i
would wear gloves
but now i don't and i don't see anybody
wearing gloves so i don't think
anybody's worried about surfaces
especially if they're outdoors so we're
not too worried about surfaces
but here's the question what's the data
on restaurant related virus transmission
so we're putting basically every
restaurant out of business in the united
states
and i don't think we have data
to back that up do we because all the
other things that we thought were kind
of
obvious to do turned out that the
obvious thing
didn't really act the way you thought it
would
because wouldn't you think it was sort
of obvious
that an asymptomatic carrier could maybe
spread it
because you could have it and the
symptoms could be low but if you're
coughing you're coughing i suppose
no i guess that would be a symptom
so i've got a feeling that restaurant
related transmission
you know so long as they're spreading
the tables out doing their basic stuff
i'll bet there's not much transmission
from that and we're going to put the
whole business
the whole industry out a business
um i i think that's
there's probably some lawsuits that have
to be filed over that
i don't know i don't know if you can
pursue the government for anything
but i i don't feel the government is
doing right by the restaurant business
do you feel the same yeah it feels
feels like uh the restaurant should get
a break
um i wanted to share with you one of the
best persuasive tweets i've seen in a
long time
from mike schellenberger and the topic
is
nuclear waste and i'm going to show you
the technique
in this tweet now um if
once you notice that the technique is
very good i will tell you that
uh mike schelenberger does continue to
build his
talent stack as it were so it includes
you know environmental stuff
and nuclear energy and and i know that
he has
intentionally learned persuasion
i'm pretty sure he's read one or more of
my books
so let's see how well he has
incorporated
persuasion into this tweet i'll read you
the full tweet
and i'll go back and tell you the the
persuasion parts
okay so here's the tweet nuclear waste
is the best kind of waste
all uh all of it ever produced
can fit on a single football field it
never hurts and
it never hurts anyone and never will it
will be recycled in future reactors
and then he says nice to see stridently
anti-nuclear
senator reid acknowledge that it is safe
where it is
and then he includes he pays a quote
from senator reid
and a question was asked of senator reid
based on your experience of
is it yucca or yucca mountain in nevada
what do you see as the future of nuclear
waste
disposal in this country and senator
reid said
i think that what we've learned over the
years is that the best thing to do with
nuclear
waste is to place it where it is don't
transport it
put it in dry cask storage containers
you can bury it in the ground
or leave it above the ground because the
dry cask
storage containers that we've developed
are extremely
safe so um
there's there's a senator acknowledging
he's
a democrat right democratic senator
acknowledging that nuclear waste
basically isn't a problem because
it used to be but now we've learned just
as we've learned with the coronavirus by
experience
we've learned that transporting it kind
of doesn't make sense
because if the nuclear facility itself
already has you know a stay away written
all over it
right because you would stay away from
you're not going to build a house
or you don't want to build a house right
next to a nuclear reactor
so just keep the waste there it's the
same problem
you you don't want to be near it so just
put it in all the places that you didn't
want to be near anyway
and on top of that they've developed
these dry storage
techniques which are seen to be quite
safe but let me tell you what is
good about this tweet number one tweets
that have
uh a an attachment or a photo
get much more engagement so this is
trick number one
an attachment or a photo gets more
engagement so what he did here was he
attached as
the text from senator reed as a photo
basically an attachment now because the
attachment looks different from the
regular text
even though it's all text it breaks it
up
and i think that counts toward the same
kind of attention getting as a
photograph would
because it's broken up it's not just
straight text
so that's the first thing second thing
is that the topic is
sort of a hot current one we're talking
about the
green new deal because biden's the
president nuclear waste is always hot
so he's got the right topic that's
naturally viral
you know anything about this topic is
going to get people's attention
he's uh got the right you know
visual look because it's not just text
and then the size of the tweet
hits the sweet spot as well a brilliant
tweet that's only one sentence
still won't be that viral because people
will look at it and say well it's
brilliant
that's just one sentence so people are
less likely to
retweet one good sentence but they will
retweet a good argument
especially if it's got like a picture or
something with it
so he's got all of that working for him
before he's even
started his tweet the first sentence
he says nuclear waste is the best kind
of waste
now i've taught you that the first
sentence is the important one
because it's the one that makes you
curious or not
does this make you curious to read the
rest of the tweet
nuclear waste is the best kind of waste
yeah yeah you have to read the next
sentence
because who is telling you that nuclear
waste is the best kind of waste
it's like opposite of what you thought
can he make that case
do you think anybody can make a case
that nuclear waste is the best kind of
waste
and then he does then he makes the case
so it's a surprising provocative
shocking
invokes curiosity in the first sentence
in the first sentence he got all that in
there
and then he goes uh all of it ever
produced can fit
in a single football field what if i
told you about
visual persuasion it would be one thing
to say
uh all of that waste is safely stored
just a concept but if i say to you
all of the waste ever produced could be
put on a football field
now you've imagined the entire size of
the planet earth
and then you've imagined what one
football field would look like on the
entire planet earth
and now it doesn't seem so scary does it
so it's visual in the second sentence
which is a plus
persuasion keep it visual then he says
it never hurt it never hurts anyone and
never will
now that's a provocative claim how do
you know it never
will well he can't know that of course
but by making it so extreme
you can't look away and that's good
persuasion
he went a little too far by making it an
absolute
in this context the absolute works
because
it's wrong and a little bit of wrongness
will tie you to a point in the way that
being all right
won't here's what it should have said
if he wanted to be accurate as opposed
to persuasive accurate instead of saying
it never hurts anyone and never will
a more accurate statement that i think
you would find more fair would be
it has never hurt anyone and it is
extraordinarily unlikely
that it ever will now that would be
fair to say you could disagree or agree
but it sounds like a fair statement
but to say never will
well you can't really say something
never will right
somebody could fall out of a helicopter
and land on a i don't know
but there must be some way to hurt at
least
one person in the future of the entire
civilization
but turning it into an absolute which
your brain recognizes
as wrong still binds you to it and you
say to yourself but how wrong is it
now you've got to deal with it right
it's wrong
i'm sure it's wrong that you could say
with certainty
nobody could ever get hurt but how wrong
is it is it 100 wrong is it completely
wrong is it
is it left field is it in the wrong zip
code no
it's not it's pretty close to reality
and that's the point
if he can make you argue that it can't
you can't know that it could never hurt
anybody
he's probably already getting you to the
point where you're willing to accept
it's very low risk it's very clever
persuasion
uh and then he says it will be recycled
in future reactors
and that is sort of like the drop the
mic
moment of this tweet because you and i
probably knew that nuclear waste can be
used in the newer types of reactors
for their fuel that's a newer emerging
industry but it seems
quite obvious that that will be the the
future
for people who didn't know that that's
like a big
big piece of information that they just
learned
imagine if you didn't know that it's the
first time you've read this sentence
it will be recycled in future reactors
what if you didn't know that was a thing
that would be pretty impactful i think
and you might even look
you might even have to research it to
find out if that's real
and it is it is real um
so anyway that is a whole lot of things
to get right
and then he shows the senator reid
thing so that you can get um you can
feel that people on both sides of the
politics
agree with him it's a social proof
so i mean look at all the things he's
got curiosity he's got a little bit
intentionally wrong he's got visual
persuasion
it's the right size it's provocative
social social proof he got all of that
into a tweet when i saw this thing my
jaw just dropped i was like
god this is some good work here
all right i wonder if the pandemic
ruining all of our leisure activities
is going to give us some uh insight
about how valuable those things were in
the first place
for example prior to the pandemic one of
my favorite things in the entire world
was going to a restaurant
and having somebody bring me food and
you know have a good time
but now after six months of really not
enjoying that i have gone to restaurants
but you know it's
a masky situation it's a different
situation
i asked myself if i never could go to a
restaurant again
and let's say restaurants just stopped
existing
would i be less happy i don't know
i don't know if i would so there are a
lot of there are a lot of
assumptions you made about your life
that the pandemic
destroyed where you have to go back
and reassess your own assumptions like
do i really need this to be happy
let me tell you another assumption i've
never had
less human contact at any time in my
life
i'm at my maximum smallest amount of
human contact
and it's fine it's not that bad
so there are a whole bunch of things
that i wouldn't have imagined could be
true that i'm learning
all right um one of the benefits of the
pandemic is that movies will stream
sooner so you don't have to wait for
them to get out of the
theater and get to your uh your tv and i
guess
there's some deals now about movie
streaming where it'll only be three
weeks
of exclusivity in the theater so the
movies are only going to be the theater
for three weeks before you get them on
on streaming
um here's a uh
somebody challenged one of my assertions
and the challenge is good enough that i
would like to bring it to you see what
you say
i've said that the election is obviously
illegitimate because i couldn't believe
that biden would get so many more votes
than obama got in 2008
but the counter to that argument is
there are 25 million
extra voters since then
if there are 25 million extra voters
would you now accept that biden got
as many votes as he did 25 million
well let's say young people probably
skew democrat
so let's say another 25 million maybe 50
million
would be at least leaning democrat
how many of young people vote they're
potential voters but
are they voters i don't know i'm a
little unclear if those are
people who did vote or if they're just
potential voters
of which only half of them would kind of
vote
and but here's the problem
are there enough people in the country
who are voters
to give joe biden that number of votes
the answer is yes
there are enough people there are
definitely enough people
and there are enough of those people who
could potentially vote democrat
to give him the number that is reported
right now here's the part that doesn't
square
i cannot square the
complete lack of enthusiasm
with the vote count if you could get
that much of a vote count
just by hating trump
maybe i'm not going to say that's
impossible
but it doesn't it doesn't pass my sniff
test
so i'm going to stick with is it
mathematically possible
that a great candidate could get as many
votes as joe biden
no i mean yes it's possible it's
completely possible that a great
candidate
could get as many votes as joe biden has
but is it possible
that he did like a terrible candidate
with no enthusiasm that is observable
whatsoever for the entire campaign
no no enthusiasm and yet it showed up
on election day it is possible
it's just when you say is there anything
that would suggest there's fraud
well that's at least where i'd be
sniffing
but again it's not proof all right
so it looks like regeneron works and is
getting approved for emergency use
whereas rem deserver doesn't work so
that's our current information
rem desevere doesn't work and what about
hydroxychloroquine
it's like masks you know every every
week
there's a new study that says
hydroxychloroquine doesn't work
followed by one that says it totally
works then it doesn't work
it totally works just like masks believe
the experts
who are telling you conflicting things
and i'll say this again i don't remember
if i said this yesterday
but is china still reporting that the
coronavirus is basically
solved in china that's true right give
me a fact check on that
china still says they've eradicated it
for all practical purposes right
is that possible i mean really
really is that possible now
there are two possibilities that i can
see number one
maybe three possibilities number one
china is just lying and they haven't
controlled it at all
now if that were the case wouldn't we
know that by now
if you know millions of people were
dying in china
and and there was a wild rampant
virus there we would know that right
even if they claimed it wasn't happening
we have enough observable
people around we would know that so i
think the thing we can rule out
is that they have a massive pandemic
over there
that they're hiding i don't think
they're hiding it
now the other possibility is that they
found some way to treat it
that they're not sharing with us or they
have shared and we're not doing it right
do you believe that their better
adherence to masks
is the difference no nobody believes
that even people who are pro-mask
don't believe that the difference
between china and the united states
is masks nor does anybody believe that
it's social distancing
i believe right because while those
things a lot of experts say
work and are important and obviously
social distancing has to work
i don't think that's enough because you
can see in our own experience that even
when we do it well
it doesn't really stop the pandemic
so how about medicines
don't you think by now that there's
enough sharing of information
that if the people in china were getting
some kind of secret medicine
what do we know about that you know
hypothetically if they were all getting
hydroxychloroquine
and it turns out that it really did work
and that's the big difference
i'm not actually high there's always
somebody who asked me if i'm
high at eight in the morning not so much
no this is actually my actual
personality
shocking i know so the other possibility
is that they have a
some medicine or therapeutic or cure
that we don't have but how would we not
know that by now
because it would have to be somewhat
massively
produced and massively distributed and
we'd know that right i mean there's some
things we can't know about china
but you'd know if there was a massive
pandemic and you would know if they were
using some massive kind of
different vaccine or therapeutic so can
we
eliminate those things as possibilities
probably there is another possibility
which is the worst case scenario which
is that
they always knew there was a genetic
uh let's say advantage that maybe they
just
don't get it as badly or maybe the five
percent who
were susceptible already got it could
there be
that much of a genetic difference and
could that be part of the reason
now that of course would suggest that
maybe it was weaponized
virus which is a separate question
but we have a mystery here
would you the only thing i want you to
agree on is
would you agree that we don't know why
they're having a good result
can you fact check me on this is there
anybody here
is there anybody here who believes that
we understand in the united states
why china's experience is what it is
is there anybody who thinks we
understand it
because if we don't understand it we
should break
relations with china just send every one
of their diplomats home
and say look we will continue having
relationships with you
you know meaning diplomatic relations
after you tell us what you did
because whatever you're doing
seems to be working and you're not
telling us what it is
and given that the virus came from you
and you seem to have gotten over it and
we haven't and you're not telling us how
i feel like we're at war
and at the very least we're going to
send your diplomats home
until you tell us something that sounds
even a little bit
like it could be true just a little bit
like it could be true
send the diplomats home china
has some explaining now could it be that
they have a
perfectly good explanation and once we
heard it we would say oh okay
i guess you're doing a good job over
there we should we should be more like
that
yeah could be you can't rule out the
possibility there's just something we
don't know
and once you found out
you you'd be satisfied um
so i think we need to get a little
tougher on china about that
now in a related in a related story
there's a startup which i'll talk about
later
but not ready to do it yet there's a
startup that will test your dna
to see if you have a hyper propensity to
have a bad experience
with covet i actually tested my dna
which i can download from 23 in me
because i'd use
23andme once and once you've used it you
can download your dna
because it's your dna so you can you can
own it
and then i send it off to the startup
and i'll tell you about the startup
in a separate periscope and they tested
it
and they said that i'm you know
somewhere in the average
range so in other words i'm not in the
in the population
which by my dna i would have an
unusually bad situation
but neither am i in some category where
i'm
unusually exempt from it so i'm sort of
in the
you know the average range there i think
so if it's true that the startup
can tell by your dna if you are likely
to have a bad experience with it
is it possible that china
made a virus that they were not
expecting to release
perhaps to see if they could make a
virus that would affect
non-chinese people you know
i'd love to think that that's not a
thing
and no country would ever work on
something like that
but in terms of military
stuff i've got a feeling that the
military works on all kinds of stuff
both ours and other countries that if
you heard about it you would be
horrified
but maybe it's just because they need to
know how this stuff works in case the
other
the other you know the enemy uses it all
right so that's
that's all i got for now i'm not
accusing china of anything
except not being forthcoming and that's
enough to send their diplomats home
in my opinion that's all for now and
i'll talk to you
later all right you youtubers
periscope is offline
um
people are still blaming fouchi for
sending the virus to wuhan
i don't buy any of the fouchy is in on
it
the stories
the longer it goes on the longer you
believe china had something to do with
it somebody says
china needs to pay um
what about the canadian researcher
getting arrested i don't know about that
should the vaccine be compulsory no no
it should not be compulsory
i don't think it'll need to be uh can we
make merchandise for you i'd rather you
did not
but thank you uh
reparations oh reparations for the virus
yeah i don't see china paying us any
reparations
that doesn't seem like that is ever
going to happen
um aren't you using analogies to
describe the chances of fraud yes
and that is the correct way to use an
analogy
i will explain this for the billionth
time
analogies are not persuasive as
arguments
they are very useful for describing a
concept
for the first time but it is not true
that if something reminds you of
something else
that the something else is going to act
the same in the future
as the thing that reminded you of it so
it's not a persuasion
it's just describing something for the
first time it's useful for that
all right uh
all right you redefined the slaughter
meter yes
so i know there's going to be an entire
cottage industry
of people who want to tell me scott
you're wrong
and you can't admit it and you you move
the goal posts
but here's the situation
i've already congratulated biden for
winning
i'm done if biden is put in office
i'm the guy who congratulated him the
day the network's called it from
that's it but it is also true that trump
has these legal challenges and he's
allowed to do them and we could talk
about them
but i can still congratulate him for
winning
in a surface way and i would expect the
same would be true if it'd go on the
other way
so um and because i've already accepted
that biden is likely to take the office
um then i've also modified what it means
to talk about the slot
the slaughter meter but i'm doing it in
front of you
i'm not trying to be tricky i already
said i predicted trump would win on
votes
didn't happen there may be an
explanation we may never know
but you know it is what it is
all right all right so here here's so he
says back metal time
all right so i'm gonna i'm gonna block
you sammy
because the whole point is that i've
said what i'm doing
and when i adjust my prediction
i acknowledge that i'm adjusting it
because it doesn't work anymore
so i'm accepting
that my you know that it didn't happen
right
so i am allowed to re to re-predict
re-predicting and saying that your old
prediction didn't work
is not moving the goal line because
you're doing it
explicitly right you can change your
prediction
so i'm gonna i'm gonna delete you
um hide user on this channel
okay you're hidden
no you can't scott
all right that's all for now and i will
talk to you
silence leads to violence dave says and
thank you
i appreciate that bye for now
