hey everybody
it's time for coffee with scott adams
it's the best time of the day
every single darn day you know you keep
waiting for an exception
it never comes it's always the best time
of the day
and if you would like to enjoy this to
its maximum potential all you need is a
copper mugger glass attacker chelsea
steiner candy jugger flask
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
i like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure
the dope mean hit of the day the thing
that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous zip it happens now go
ah oh yeah
oh yeah that's good
does everybody feel better now a little
bit better than you did
boy i'll tell you what made me feel
better i just saw a
a paparazzi picture of goldie hawn
and um what's her husband's
or husband's name man they did not age
well
so it made me feel good because i'm
aging better than some other people
kurt russell thank you kurt russell has
not aged well
but made me feel good because maybe i'm
doing better
yes thank you for that so apparently up
in sun valley
right now there's a little thing
happening called the uh
the billionaire summer camp have you
heard of it
the billionaire summer camp it's uh
invitationally
i'm checking for my invitation but i
don't see it
and you have to be a billionaire ish i
guess
and you get to go there and hang out
with other billionaires
now are you worried that there's an
illuminati
now it's not the bohemian grove that's a
that's a different
billionaire club this one's in sun
valley
do you worry that something like a
trillion dollars worth
of value is all in one place
if that place ever blew up the uh
the entrepreneurial life of the united
states would be decreased quite a bit
but uh are you worried about it are you
worried about all the billionaires
talking apparently this is the place
where
jeff bezos completed the deal to buy the
washington post
so deals get done uh
it's just interesting that all the
billionaires know each other
at what point could the billionaires
decide
to just run the world they're kind of
already there aren't they
hypothetically just let's just do a
mental
thing here suppose all the most
important billionaires in the united
states got together at sun valley let's
say
and decided privately hey this country
is just not going the right direction
why don't we billionaires decide what to
do with the country
and then we'll just tell the politicians
to do it now we'll tell it
via our platforms and we'll tell them
through our tv shows and our newspapers
and stuff
but basically we'll just we'll just tell
them what to do
do they have the power to do that
what do you think if the billionaires at
sun valley
if they decided that they were the real
power
but they would use it through influence
and money and connections and
you know brainwashing all the usual ways
could they literally and directly
just take control of the country
i think yes now i think it's
unlikely that they would all agree
because they're not all going to be on
the same side on everything
they might not want to be in charge some
of them might be
more trouble than it's worth you end up
getting assassinated like the
president of haiti if you're in charge
so
maybe maybe they need to know
maybe they would prefer just ruling from
the background i don't know
but my sense is that they could do it
they could do it all right uh over on
uh i see some people talking on youtube
about
the the locals live stream and i'm
seeing somebody saying
it never works well we're doing beta
testing this week
so most of the time it hasn't worked
it's been a user error
such as forgetting to turn on my
microphone that sort of thing
but at the moment is working better than
youtube
so if you have an option of seeing it on
locals or youtube
um i've i just temporarily i've opened
up
the locals channel so you don't have to
be a subscriber
for this live stream just in case people
want to sample it
um so you would see what it would look
like without commercials if you wanted
to
be a member of locals later the they
won't all be open
but this one's open because we're doing
some testing all right um
remember i told you i thought there was
going to be some genetic
element to the covet outcomes
in other words that some people who
some people who have a certain genetic
outcome or a certain genetic makeup
probably have better
and worse outcomes and we keep seeing
more confirmation
of that so now there's uh
there's a new manuscript published in
nature
saying that they found a whole bunch of
genetic
clues to why some people have worse
outcomes
now apparently the genetic element could
be
as important to your outcome as
uh could be as important to the outcome
as
your comorbidities so if you're looking
at the size of the genetic
component it could be as important as
having uh being overweight
uh obese could be as important as being
old it could be as important as having
diabetes
for example but the importance is that
we could identify you as the greatest
risk and that might make a big
difference
so if you're keeping score of
if you're keeping score of who did good
predicting
during the pandemic i would say that add
this one to my list
because early on i was saying there's
almost certainly a genetic
component to this and there appears to
be
so good guest scott
so let me i promised in one of the
titles i think on youtube
i promised that i would teach you how to
predict the future
now this is going to be really
complicated stuff
things you've never heard before no it's
stuff you've heard before
but watch how powerful it is
you've heard the statement follow the
money
it is really creepy how
often that works you know it's sort of
it's so obvious that you should see
who's getting paid for anything to know
what everybody's motivation is and
what's likely to happen
so it's completely obvious statement
what's not obvious
is how often it works because in your
mind you're thinking well
that might work half the time you know
that 40
of the time that might tell you what's
going to happen
no no it's not forty percent it's a lot
closer to a hundred percent
it's not a hundred percent but it's
really close let me give you some
examples
um you know ibrahim kendi he's the
director of anti-racist research and
policy center
department of anti-racism or i'm sorry
he's a director of the anti-racist
research and policy center
and he makes his money by telling the
country that it's
super racist and that people like uh
ibrahim kendi
are the partial solution there are
people who can explain it to you and
tell you how to fix it and
and you would give them money for that
now
if somebody who gets paid for something
has a good idea about how to fix the
world
and coincidentally that person is likely
to get a big promotion out of this idea
do you trust the idea well ibrahim
kennedy is apparently proposing
that there be some new i think is a
cabinet level position
he wants to he once created called the
department of anti-racism
and they would they would have powers to
punish
other entities for being too racist
who do you think would be the obvious
person
to make the director of the department
of anti-racism
if the department of anti-racism were to
be created
because it's probably a pretty good
paying job
and i don't know how much ibrahim
kennedy makes in his current job
but i'll bet it would be a promotion and
should you trust anybody who suggests
creating a job for themselves
i think you could have predicted that
sooner or later
anybody who's in charge of an
anti-racism thing
will come up with a plan that
coincidentally
is good for them monetarily
if you look at black lives matter and
you say to yourself hey
let me make a prediction about black
lives matter
we know that black lives matter
representing
largely the black population of america
should agree with the black population
of america that we should fix
let's say the the school system
it's a very simple thing right there's
probably i doubt you could find even one
black person in america
who doesn't think the school system
should be fixed
specifically for black american children
but also for everybody
right a universally true statement
so if you were black lives matter
it would be obvious that you would be in
uh in favor of
let's say working with republicans who
have the same opinion
that the school system needs to be fixed
the teachers unions are too powerful
they're preventing school competition
and if you could fix that competition
part
then schools could rise to a much higher
level for everybody
but what would happen to the leaders
of black lives matter if they fixed that
problem
or fixed any problems well you lose your
job
because you don't want a job where if
you succeed you lose your job
and that's what leaders of sort of
protest movements if you will that's the
problem
it's the same problem with a dictator
you say to yourself i'd sure like that
dictator to retire but how
dictators can't retire they would
immediately be killed by the new
dictator
just to get them get them off the field
so if you were to follow the money you
should assume to
assume that black lives matter would
oppose
the legitimate interests of all of their
members
not not some other members literally all
of them
a hundred percent of black americans
would like school to be better
am i wrong is it 99 is there if you did
a poll
would you find anybody who said you know
i'd like schools to be a little bit
worse or maybe stay the same
none literally none so here you have an
organization that
tries to represent a population black
americans
while clearly being on the other side
how could you predict that
well you could predict it easily just
follow the money
the leaders only only prosper if the
conflict remains the conflict and they
don't prosper if republicans say you
know that's a pretty good idea
fixing schools let us help you we've got
money and power
you've got a legitimate uh issue
let's work together same page boom all
done
follow the money all right let's go to
uh
uh the important story of britney spears
and her conservatorship
i have to say that while i generally
do not like much of anything about
celebrity news
well it's fun i mean i like the fun part
but you know it's not important
but this conservatorship thing with
britney spears i gotta admit it bothers
me
like it legitimately bothers me you know
it doesn't even feel like it's somebody
else's
problem like it actually feels personal
in a weird way
does anybody else get that does anybody
else feel that this
this brittany conservatorship like it
feels personal
doesn't it i don't know why exactly
some of it i think is because brittany
herself
is so transparent meaning that
you know we see her all the time we see
her her lows
her highs you feel like you know her a
little bit right
and she is a character who
i would say she invites our empathy
because i don't think that have you ever
heard of britney spears doing anything
bad to anybody
right she's a sort of a good soul
who's got some problems which she admits
but now we hear that madonna has thrown
in
saying with the free brittany movement
and uh
she went in hard and
how many how many celebrities does it
take to change this situation because
now that here are the people who have
spoken out justin timberlake
mariah carey halsey rose mcgowan jesse
tyler ferguson
um i guess elon musk has spoken out on
it
and i'm looking for my name on the list
and what
how did they leave my name off the list
i have speak i have spoken out
about this situation so
um i will throw my weight behind these
other people and
my tiny weight behind these other people
and say
yeah this needs to get fixed this really
needs to get fixed
and i feel like i could help so
uh brittany if you need any help let me
know all right
um i'm following the story of the
haitian president who got assassinated
and what we know so far although it's
still fog of war so this could change
there was some team of highly trained
commandos who
stormed the palace and killed the
president and wounded his wife badly
and at least two of them look like
they're american citizens
and they were apparently from a variety
of countries etc
and here's the thing that is sort of
buried in the news
why'd they do it what was the point
of assassinating the president because
generally when you do an assassination
it's part of a coup right so you have
the the new president who's trying to be
president
and you want that one wants to come in
but where where was the
replacement what was the point of
assassinating the president
how did we get this far into the story
and not even know the motive
seriously how do you not know the motive
of killing the president
of haiti well then i saw one sentence
and i think it was a cnn report
that said that the president who got
killed had been ruling by decree for
more than a year
ruling by decree in other words it was a
dictator
so a team of mercenaries killed a
dictator
and did not suggest a replacement
what's going on here because
i see people speculating that biden did
it
oh somebody's saying it's like biden
okay that's a different point
so how can we get this far into the
story without knowing
oh there we go i'm seeing somebody
suggest
child trafficking because doesn't this
look like
an anger crime it doesn't look like a
political crime does it
it looks like somebody was really pissed
off and had the money to do this
doesn't it it looks like somebody just
wanted him dead
like they would want anybody else dead
and they just had the money to do it
and they hired a bunch of people and
killed them oh somebody says it's a
mcafee uh
dead man switch oh my god that would be
interesting i doubt that's true but
my goodness that would be interesting
now other people are suggesting that
there's some kind of clinton connection
blah blah i don't i doubt it but we'll
see
all right so until we know who paid
these mercenaries
this story could get a lot more
interesting
a letter to the wokheart by alexander
okay i'm just reading a comment there
apparently the spotify staff is still
mad about
joe rogan having his big deal over there
on spotify
and i was trying to figure out what
exactly is there a problem with
joe rogan and the only thing i've seen
is quote
reference to his quote transphobic
comments transphobic
what does transphobic mean
now i assume it means somebody who has a
phobia
or a fear i suppose of trans
uh people but would you say that joe
rogan has a
fear or some kind of like
just some kind of emotional reaction to
trans people well i haven't seen any
evidence of that
i have heard him talk about how in
sports
it could create unfairness and it
doesn't make sense
is that transphobic it's
sort of what everybody's talking about i
i don't really see it
so and he may have made some comments
about the
the the mental state of people who go
through the transit transition but i
think
i think it's fair to ask those questions
because no matter what you think about
uh the transgender situation is there
anybody who would disagree with the
following statement
let's see let's uh take the temperature
of the room
i'm not going to talk about a bunch of
transgender stuff i know you hate that
topic
but because we've done it too much not
because it isn't interesting
but let me ask you here who
how many of you would agree with the
following statement
that there are undoubtedly people who
are better off
making the the change and there are
almost certainly people who are not
is that a fair statement without giving
any percentages
would you say that it's just a a flat
statement of truth yeah i'm i'm seeing
you say that
so as long as it's a universal agreement
i don't think i've ever seen anybody
agree so hard at anything i've ever said
in my life
right i'm saying only yeah oh so one one
no okay a couple of no's
a couple of no's are sneaking in now but
almost entirely yeses
it looks like 95 yes yeah
i i think the the overriding
um truth of the whole transgender thing
is that people are different
how about just that how about people are
different and
you either think that people can make
their own decisions
even if you don't think that they're
good decisions
so can brittany make her own decisions
even if you think that they're not going
to be as good a decisions as
somebody might make for her well
freedom kind of requires that brittany
does make her own decisions even if
they're not good ones
according to you you know they might be
good ones for her
but the transgender is the same thing
it's you you have a bunch of people
who want to make the choice for
themselves now when children are
involved that's a whole different
situation
but for adults
i would say the evidence clearly shows
that some people
regret the change and some people are
really happy they did it
and what can what can you and i do about
that well nothing
unfortunately we live in a world where
people get to make these choices
themselves and some of them are bad
so that to me that's all the whole story
um the sports stuff is interesting but
otherwise it's just a personal choice
story
um there's a actress christina hack
h-a-a-c-k and she just
revealed that she smoked toad venom
and got rid of 15 years of anxiety
she said that smoking the toad venom
reset my brain all right let me ask you
this question this will be a good test
of your
situational awareness if you see if you
hear a story about a an actress
who smoked toad venom and cured her of a
15-year
mental problem do you say that's true
we don't know for sure but do you say
it's probably true or probably not
okay fake news check fake news check
in the comments probably true or
probably fake
i'll read your comments fake fake fake
fake fake fake probably not
fake fake fake fake fake fake not
not not not not not well you
you're all pretty sure that this is fake
news
guess what you're all wrong
uh this toad venom
is a hallucinogen and i believe this is
the basis of dmt
uh i'm not the expert on lucid gins but
i think that's true
and do you believe it is likely
or even possible that somebody could
have a few minutes of smoking
towed venom and cure a mental disease
this is really going to you up the
answer is yes
the answer is unambiguously yes now i
don't know if it worked in a specific
case
right so i'm not making a claim that it
always works and all people
and you get only good results or
anything like that it's a
it's an illegal drug so of course i
don't recommend it
i'm not a doctor but if you
think that this is unlikely to be true
you're missing one of the biggest
stories in the world
because the people who have studied this
field and i've had
you know enough conversations with
people who know this field
to know this is real
there are people who fix a lifetime of
mental problems
depends on the mental problem right not
every problem
but one like this 15 years of anxiety
yup yeah there there is plenty of
evidence
that people are fixing lifetimes of
mental problems
in 15 minutes that's real
now this isn't the only elusive agenda
that can have that kind of benefit
yeah ptsd would be another thing that
people have fixed fairly quickly with
this
so when i asked you th this was a fun
test
because when i sort of disguised the
story by saying it was toad venom
i got you off the off the idea that it
was a hallucinogen if i had said a
hallucinogen from the start
most of you would have said well maybe
maybe but i
i fooled you by calling it toad venom
which i think is
basically what it is all right um
stephen miller the controversial uh
former aide of president trump i was on
tv saying that
uh about biden that no president in
history has been dealt a better hand on
day one
than president biden how could you argue
with that
i mean you can dislike stephen miller
all you like
but really could you argue with that
point
yeah and then the people arguing with
and say are you kidding me he
biden inherited a debt economy with a
pandemic
well yeah but he also inherited the
known
solution so whoever was president
was going to be president over the near
solution
of the pandemic the huge improvement of
the economy all that was going to happen
the only thing that biden added was me
he made some things worse
like immigration made it worse
um i also wonder if trump had been
president and it looks like most of the
vaccination resistors are republican
do you think that having biden as
president
is creating more resistance to the
vaccination because he's a democrat
and because the republicans just have a
sort of a natural resistance to anything
that comes from a
democrat what do you think
um
i'm actually interested in that that one
anyway
so tell me in your comments so
my take is that uh um maybe
maybe trump could have influenced people
to take more vaccinations
now i'm not saying you know if you want
to argue that wouldn't be a good idea
that's a separate conversation but just
would he have been able to successfully
do that because remember he took the
vaccination himself
right so
when you see that trump has convinced
half the country that the
election was a lie and
uh and he's still controlling the party
it seems like
from the outside does anybody still
think
trump is not persuasive
do you remember when people were
laughing at me early on when they say
he's persuasive
how can he be so persuasive when he's
only
got 25 percent of the support in the
primary the republican primary
that's not very persuasive it's only 25
percent
and here he is so
yeah he's persuasive i imagine that
trump if he had tried
if he if trump had put his level best
effort into more vaccinations and again
we don't know if he would have
maybe he would have just been yeah wear
a mask you know
i think it's a good idea he might have
been lukewarm on it who knows
but there's no way to know how he would
have handled it
but at least there's a chance he could
have gotten more republicans to take it
compared to biden i think that's fair to
say
all right rasmussen
asks people if they agree with the
following statement
that media are truly the enemy of the
people
truly the enemy of the people what
percentage of americans
likely voters this is agreed with the
statement
that the media is the enemy of the
people
58 either strongly or somewhat agreed
that the media are the enemy of the
people
do you remember when i said that trump
was persuasive
this is trump trump is the reason
that 58 of the public think the media
is the enemy of the people now
it would have been at least 40 percent
without him probably
but this specific phrasing
don't you think that it was always true
that people would have said oh i think
the media
is biased in one direction people would
have always said that
but would they have gone the extra level
and say no no it's not just bias
you're the enemy of the people
i don't think that happened before trump
i think this
poll shows you how persuasive he is
that he just turned this into a thing
that the media is the enemy of the
people and
now 58 of the public agrees now they may
disagree which side of the media is the
enemy but
it's a lot of agreement on something and
here's another one
do you trust the political news you're
getting also from rasmussen
43 said no
what 43
of the public the voting public
the people who need the media to tell
them what's true
so that their vote will be non-absurd
43 percent say no we don't trust the
political news we're getting
wow but you want to know the shocking
part
37 said they do 37 percent
of the public thinks that the political
news they see
is accurate really
do you even know anybody who thinks that
i don't even know anybody who thinks
political news is accurate
like literally nobody but it's a big
country
so maybe i just talked to the wrong
people uh but here's even the funnier
part of the same poll
you know there's always a category for
not sure or uncertain or no opinion
well twenty percent of people said they
were not
sure that they can trust the political
news
huh what would be very similar
to not sure you could trust something
what would be another way to phrase that
i'm not sure i could trust something
that's very similar to don't trust it
or exactly the same it's one thing to
say that the news is working against you
but if you're
not sure you can trust it you don't
trust it
right am i over
interpreting this if you're not sure you
can trust it
then you don't trust it you're not there
you're not sure
so let's add the 20 that are not sure
to the ones who said no we definitely
can't trust it
you've got 63 percent
of the voting public saying they don't
trust political news
nearly two-thirds
oh my god but what about the good news
uh adam dopamine dopamine adam dopamine
on
twitter i was tweeting some good news
some scientific good news
so there's a professor in the department
of
department of some tech department in
the university of st
louis they figured out how to turn waste
water into clean water and electricity
so they can take waste water and
run it through some filters and chips
and whatever the hell they do
and oh we've got a cat siding and they
can turn it into electricity and clean
water
now this is the sort of thing where you
know who knows if this specific
technology will take off or not
but it's the sort of thing where i look
at it and i say to myself
these are all the little things you know
they're not in the news
that could be big things so they're not
in the news but could be
completely transforming society
uh but on the bad news although it's
weird news
there's news that china is developing
exotic nuclear weapons
such as underwater drones
how dangerous will the world be when the
ocean is filled with
underwater nuclear drones
think i want to go to mars you know i've
been thinking that mars would be the
the least safe place to be because what
happens if your
you know your enclosure unit gets a
crack or something
but i'm starting to feel that if the
ocean gets filled with nuclear drones
pointed at each other that's not a good
thing
and i also asked this question how good
do nuclear weapons have to be
before they're good enough is there not
something that's
uh completely good enough well before
you have
underwater drones because it's not as if
any of our any country could wipe out
the nuclear arsenal of another on day
one
right and anybody who starts a nuclear
war is going to get attacked with
nuclear weapons
if it's a superpower so i
i just wonder if it makes any sense
whatsoever to
keep improving our nuclear weapons
because we're not going to use them
right i mean and if you did use them it
would be the end of the world
effectively so that's a big question
but remember i said you could predict
the future
by following the money let me ask you
this
is there anybody in china who's in
charge of a big
let's say drone building
operation who would not make money
no there are people in china who run
their
you know military industrial complex who
would make
amazing amounts of money if the
government
improves their nuclear arsenal so who do
you think
runs china it's the people with a lot of
money
coincidentally you know the head party
members who are connected to the
billionaire class etc
so is china building all these nukes
because they're
preparing for a war i suppose it's
possible
but you could predict that this was
going to happen even though it probably
doesn't make any sense for china
i just don't see how china is better off
doing this but you could predict it
because if you follow the money likely
the billionaires
who run china like every country is run
by the billionaires effectively
they would make a lot more money if they
build more
more devices so you can predict it'll
happen
same same with the united states
well let's give joe biden some props
if we could or whoever is the puppet
master behind him
because joe biden has announced that
august 31st will be the end of the
20-year mission in afghanistan
and i don't have anything to say about
this
except positive i have only positive
things to say about this
this is one of those cases where if you
can't
full throatedly say joe biden you
democrat
good job then you have to really check
your bias a little bit don't you because
this is something that
trump started you know yeah right in the
comments you beat me to it trump started
it
so you know you can certainly make the
argument it's a it's a trump
accomplishment that you know biden is
just finishing off
but he didn't need to you know biden
didn't need to finish it off he could
have found a way to stay
so i think the current president always
has to get credit
for doing something even if even if it
was easy even if
somebody else started it you know you
have to discount that a little bit
so let me say it again joe biden doing
exactly the right thing
um congratulations good job
and and i have nothing you know you feel
like i want to put like a
disclaimer on that but no no i just want
to say this is a good job and that's it
moving on all right remember i told you
that money could predict things let's
say you had a situation in which there
was somebody looking to sell
something that they would make a lot of
money selling and there was somebody who
might be a buyer for that thing
but it would cost them a lot of money
and then there's a decision to be made
about whether
more of it should be uh created and
purchased
who would be in favor of creating and
purchasing more of this product
well the people who sell it who would be
not in favor of it
well the people who had to pay money for
it they would take some more convincing
well here we are pfizer maker of
one of the major vaccines says that you
might need a third dose
in fact they say you do you're going to
need that third dose for that extra
booster
if you have the pfizer shot no word yet
on the
moderna which is the one i have i think
the most recent information is that the
modernist shot
lasts longer maybe we'll see
but do you trust pfizer when they say oh
yeah you're going to need another shot
you're going to have to pay for it it's
going to be expensive
oh yeah oh yeah you need another shot
who says they don't well it turns out
that the uh
the fda and the european medicine
agencies and other regulators
i think the cdc said nope
nope you don't need it yet the data does
not yet indicate it
was this predictable what about the
moderna people
i'm sure the modernity people would love
to tell you that there's you know works
better than pfizer
because that could be cool but don't you
think the modernity people are looking
at the pfizer people and saying
wait a minute if we can make the case
that you would get 10 percent extra
coverage
for a booster shot of the moderna should
we recommend it
because if we recommend it it will make
20 billion dollars for us that we
weren't going to get otherwise
and it would make people 10 safer
which might not make any difference in
terms of deaths
should we recommend it
you should assume they will right if you
want to predict
what moderna is going to do they'll
probably try to tell you their shot is
better in the first place
but just to be safe you better look at
that booster shot
i mean we're not saying you definitely
need it
but ten percent pandemic
watch out for those variants so
follow the money tells you the modern no
matter how well they're shot works
are going to be influenced by this
pfizer thing and probably try to get
away with the same thing
here's a dumb story so you're watching
hunter biden's
art career so if hunter biden's going to
sell this expensive art and
he that he made himself for 75 000
to half a million per uh painting
and the worry was that people would buy
these paintings as a way of bribing him
which would be an indirect way of
bribing
the senior biden and
the solution apparently is that the
white house worked on a deal with the
art house that's going to be selling
this stuff that the buyers names will be
secret that's right
the buyers names will be secret so even
even the bidens the public
nobody will know who bought it
so that's a pretty good idea right how
would anybody ever know
who bought this painting well
maybe everybody who visits the house or
the person who bought it
because do you buy a painting and then
not put it on the wall
seems to me that whoever spends a half a
half a million dollars for a painting
is going to want to display that
painting they're going to want their
friends to see it
how do you hide who buys this freaking
painting
now let me ask you this if you wanted to
bribe hunter biden by buying his
painting
do you think it would be hard
do you think that would be hard you just
get the message to somebody who knows
uh hunter biden personally you say hey
tell hunter that when tomorrow comes i'm
gonna buy his half million dollar
painting
and i you know i'm a you ukrainian
oil company or whatever i am you know
somebody who wants a favor from them
and just let them know just let them
know i'm the i'm the secret buyer
how hard would that be how hard would it
be
for the bidens to be the only ones to
know who bought the painting
so here's what happened the bidens had a
situation
where somebody was going to buy this art
and everybody would know
that the bidens were beholden to whoever
bought the ark
the bidens actually figured out a way
that the only people who don't know who
bought the art
is us right
because you don't think the bidens are
going to find out one way or the other
either before the purchase or after you
don't think the bidens are going to find
out who bought it
seriously you and i might not ever find
out
but do you think there's any chance the
bidens won't find out
of course they will of course they will
so they took a bad situation and they
found a way to make it look better
by making it way worse it's way worse in
the sense
that at least if we knew who bought them
right tell me if i'm wrong here at least
if the public
knew who bought the painting we could
keep an eye on them
and see if joe biden makes any decisions
that seem coincidentally favorable to
the buyer of the art
but now that only the bidens will know
they can do any favor they want
and you might even have somebody buy the
art and put it in the
you know just destroy it so nobody knows
they even bought it
if you were going to bribe the bidens
you would buy the art and you would
immediately destroy it
or hide it but you wouldn't you wouldn't
put it on your wall
right somebody says trump bought it now
that would be funny
all right so there again money predicts
um
there's a uh julian zelizer a
cnn political analyst who's also a
professor of history and public affairs
at princeton
is talking about it might be time to
impose vaccine mandates and passports
um i don't think it's time for that do
you
because the public has to be willing
right i mean there's a line
you can push the public pretty far
but do you think you could push the
public this far
all the way to mandatory vaccines and
passports
i don't think so you know i think you
have to read the room on this one
right you could make you know
let's say uh charitably let's say you
could make the argument for it
and let's say it was a a reasonable
argument and
you looked at it and it made sense i
don't think it matters
because the the mood of the public is
just not there
i think that would just be an overreach
so and i think the public has very
clearly stated
that it will accept the predicted level
of death
in return for freedom right
don't you think that the public has
spoken go outside
see how many people are outside walking
around living their life
the public has spoken we have decided
that the risk is now small enough that
it's like driving to the
store to get a loaf of bread meaning
that you don't even consider the risk
when you plan your life
once you get to the point where you
don't even consider the risk
when you plan your life you know i'm
going to go to the grocery store today
am i worried that if i don't have it
delivered i'll get covered
nope nope it's not even part of the
decision i just
do i have time do i have money do i need
groceries that's it
once you reach that point where you're
not even factoring it into your daily
decisions
and you know i'm vaccinated so i have a
little advantage there
i think the government has to just get
the out of it
right they just got to get out of it
all right
now the other thing that's interesting
is the number of people getting
the covant while they're also vaccinated
and i'm still uncertain whether i want
that or don't want it
because correct me if i'm wrong but if
the
shots can wear off in effectiveness but
i don't think that actually
being infected wears off as quickly or
ever
really um so don't i want to get it
i wouldn't go out of my way to be
infected but given that i'm vaccinated
if i also got it
i would have sniffles for three days
right or whatever
minor symptoms and then i would have
natural immunity on top of
my artificial immunity i'd be like a god
you know i'd be
um you may have had it already and not
known
no i've been tested so often because i
did some traveling
so i've been tested every few weeks and
then i did some surgery
last year i've been tested quite a few
times
maybe how many of you have been tested
how many times
i'd be interested in this in the
comments tell me how many times you've
done a covet test
i'm going to try to remember how many
times i have one two
three four
five i think i've done
five six i've done at least six
and i'm looking at your numbers oh the
biggest number i see yet is four i'm up
to six
because of travel uh three ten
somebody had ten and six yeah we're
pretty well tested
two times zero ten another ten
yeah people having ten of them probably
you have some kind of a
job where they have to test a lot um
somebody says it's so dangerous that you
have to be tested to know you have it
well be reasonable you know we know that
you don't have symptoms right away
all right um
all right let's see if i got anything
else so michael avenetti
so michael avenetti got his two and a
half years of prison
for trying to extort nike just do it
bad advice in his case he was probably
thinking
i wonder if i should try to extort this
major company
and then he thought to himself ah just
do it
worst advice ever just do it
anyway he was crying in court
a lot of people making fun of him for
all that here's you know i
believe i know it's hard to believe but
i do have empathy for him
because he did throw his life away and
the life of his family and stuff
and i actually feel bad for him
but i would like to add this comment
have you ever noticed and this is just a
pretty well established fact that males
tend to occupy the extremes of every
category
right so there are more men who are
literally geniuses
than there are women which is not to say
men are smarter than women just
you know i'm not one of them so i'm not
einstein
so i don't get any credit for him
because i also you know have a penis
so i'm not saying that hey men are
awesome because
there are a lot of male geniuses because
i'm not one of them
most of you are not one of them either
it just happens to be
that the category i'm from also creates
different kinds of people who are
were geniuses but also we
men are mostly the mentally
disturbed you know idiots they're way
more
criminals and idiots who are men as well
so men
occupy the extremes and we're we have a
different relationship with risk
so even the men who are not on the
extremes we are
prone to risk we're just designed for it
for some reason we evolved for it
whatever
and here's my take the reason that
somebody like michael
avenatti can even exist is because men
take big dumb risks it's just built into
us
and it doesn't seem to be related to how
smart you are
you could be really smart i think
avenatti is probably plenty smart
but somehow you still take these risks
it's just built into us
and if you didn't have people like
michael avenatti
then you wouldn't have a trump because
it's the same thing that drives a trump
that drives somebody who ends up you
know
tanking their whole life because you
could easily imagine that trump's future
could go
either direction right now i mean that
if you take this point in time
trump will either be a trump triumphant
returning president
very possible or you know a forever
mocked one-term president
either thing could happen right
so it's the risk takers who tend to move
things forward
jeff bezos is i think he's 10 days away
or something from being on his own
rocket
blue origin going into space
pretty risky stuff but bezos is like
yeah
sign me up now whatever it is that makes
bezos willing to get on a rocket ship
that you couldn't pay me all of his
money to get on
if you said to me hey we'll take all of
jeff bezos money and give it to you but
we'd like you to be the first passenger
on this
this untested jet i would say
thank you but i'll stay right where i am
but aren't you glad that there is a jeff
bezos
you can hate his politics you can hate
what the washington post does
you can hate what he's done to you know
small business
but if our country didn't have the jeff
bezos
you know elon musk kind of personalities
the people who take gigantic risks
that sometimes work yeah branson et
cetera risk takers
if we didn't have these crazy risk
takers society wouldn't go forward
but the price for the crazy risk takers
who do things that work
is you get your michael avenatti's the
crazy risk taker who
he ran for president right like if he
hadn't
been brought down by his legal problems
i don't know could he have been running
the country
it's just so close between jail and
running the whole world jail running the
world
as the president of haiti recently
realized the difference between being
the president of haiti
and being dead really close
because again the president of haiti had
become a dictator
took a very high risk path
didn't work out right so
as much as i cannot approve of anything
that
michael avenatti did
yeah epstein was another risk taker in
the worst possible way right
so you really can't have a world where
you have the good risk takers that are
absolutely essential
but you don't have any bad risk takers
you know it'd be great if you could
but it doesn't seem to be a possibility
um all right
some saying that avenatti is evil but
trump is not
yeah i mean the crimes that avenatti is
accused of i can't see trump doing
really
i can't see trump doing that particular
crime
all right um four african leaders are
all dead
in the last 12 months and all
and five have refused vaccination
hmm are you saying that people are being
killed because they're
refusing to get their people vaccinated
that would be an interesting
conspiracy theory but i don't think we
can
so mark says tony heller seems credible
to you here's the problem
so tony heller's a a well-known critic
of climate change
and a lot of people follow his work
here's the problem
a lot of what he says looks true or
true-ish
meaning that when he finds problems with
the the theory or the data or the way
it's looked at
they might be good points
but when you see his presentation
without the counter points
it looks persuasive but the problem is
everybody's per
everybody's argument without a counter
argument looks persuasive
imagine a court case where only the
prosecution got to talk
everybody would get prosecuted the you
know almost
you would have almost nobody who didn't
get prosecuted if you didn't also have a
defense attorney that's why you do it
right it's just completely obvious
that you could convince a jury of
anything if you're a good enough lawyer
as long as the other side doesn't get to
talk so when you say
tony heller is convincing what you're
really telling me is you don't know
what credible things look like because a
credible thing would look like
two people with a point in the
counterpoint arguing right in front of
you at the same time
being able to address each other's
points and then when it's done you say
oh
i think that one did a better job than
the other one or maybe they're both
credible
but you like one argument better that
would be a case of having an ability to
know what looks credible
but if you simply say to me i read tony
heller's stuff
and he looks credible to me you're not
really judging
tony heller you're judging your own
inability to know what a credible thing
even looks like
because there's no such thing as a
credible one person by themselves just
talking
that's not a thing just if i could teach
you just
one useful thing in life
don't ever take credibility from one
person talking
ever no one will debate heller
the plenty of people have debated his
specific points
in writing extensively so
just look to uh debunking tony heller
and read what the critics say and
you'll you'll come away with a different
opinion
uh rudy giuliani's law license suspended
without due process
or presenting his side uh i don't know
enough about that story
but is that how it works is there no
appeal
to losing your law license it seems to
me
that it would just automatically be
something
you could have some legal recourse to so
i'm not going to say
right away that he has no recourse
why don't we discuss the possibility
that global warming could be in that
positive well um
because i don't think that's likely
and here's why change is bad
when it comes to the the base of stuff
so in economics
it's better to be inefficient and
predictable
than to try to fix that and create an
unpredictable
situation because people don't like to
invest
when things are unpredictable so
predictability is pretty high um
so if you talk about climate change the
mere fact that it would change
over 80 years which would be say a short
period of time in human history
all of that change is expensive so
we know it's going to be expensive so
when you say it's going to be a net
benefit
you could almost guarantee that
somebody's going to get rich
some countries will be better off some
places will grow more food
some places will have longer you know
longer
times to grow things especially if the
winters get milder et cetera
but you also know there might be rising
sea water
and people dying of the heat etc but
at the same time we'll be developing new
air conditioning systems
but how are you going to power all those
air conditioning systems because you
need energy
and we don't have enough clean energy so
is the warming going to cause the
warming to get more
because you need the air conditioning
which means needs the power which has to
be cold because we don't have enough of
the other stuff yet
can't build nuclear as quickly as we
need to even though that would be the
the big solution
so as a general rule anything that is a
large
change to a system that's largely
working is going to be very bad news
because you have to adjust to all that
change however
your comment that it could be a net
positive
totally appropriate but
would you make that choice if you could
let me put it in different terms let's
say i said to you you're you have a
magic power
and it's your magic power to make
climate change either
stop so it's no problem at all or to
continue on the way it's going
and you you're the magic person in the
world and you get to decide
and the only thing you're going to
decide is whether you think that
climate warming or climate change is
going to be
net good or net bad what do you do
you're magic
all right i'll tell you what i'd do i
wouldn't introduce
a big change into the world without a
certainty
that it was going to be good you get
that
don't introduce a big change without a
pretty big
certainty that that big change is going
to be good and do we have something like
a pretty good certainty
that changing the climate of earth in
any direction
would be a net positive i don't think so
you could certainly make an argument
that says well we'll grow more stuff
winters will be more mild but you also
have the other stuff you know rising sea
water
too hot to live in places places can't
can't grow
droughts forest fires et cetera
how do you indented left now i'm an
optimist and i believe that whether the
climate changes or not
humans are getting really really good at
compensating so i don't think you can
predict how quickly we'll develop
more efficient air conditioning i don't
think you can predict how
efficiently we can move populations away
from
rising water i think we'll just be good
at that stuff
so we could have every problem that the
climate change people say
all of them like every one of those
things could happen and we could lose
no people you know we could get to the
point where
zero extra people died because of
climate change
at the same time that the climate is
just wreaking havoc all over the
the natural world but we just become
really good at predicting it and getting
out of the way
which is a trend that has been you know
as michael schellenberg says
often it's a trend that has continued
for i don't know
decades if not hundreds of years for
example
we believe that climate change or the
scientists do believe that climate
change is making the forest fires worse
in california but every year
fewer people die from forest virus
right so how do you net that out
yes we have more forest fires but fewer
people die every year from a forest fire
because we're just better at
handling stuff so no i don't think you
would make
if you were magic you would not make the
choice to increase the
temperature of the planet because it
would be too much risk
but it's possible so your your question
of you know might it be a positive
is a perfectly good question but because
you don't know
you don't want to change things that
much if things are going
fine the time you would change things a
lot
even if you didn't know would work is if
you were in an emergency
right so if you had no choice it's
desperate you're going to die
if you do this but you might not die if
you do the other thing well do the other
thing even if it's
risky because it's your best choice
all right
climate always changes arrogant humans
think they can change that
well nimrod that's his actual name i'm
not calling him a nimrod
um what's wrong with that
what's wrong with humans saying that
they can change the climate
you do realize that there's a hundred
percent chance
that humans can change climate right
like whether whether it's happening
already is your question
but there's no doubt that we'll be able
to do it
we we know how to do it now we can see
clouds now
we could uh yeah we could probably spark
a volcano if we wanted to
i don't know if we could do that but i
suppose if you nuked a volcano that was
active maybe maybe something would come
out of it
but i'm pretty sure that humans will be
able to control weather
and climate those things are completely
doable within maybe not within my
lifetime
but certainly within the lifetime of a
lot of people who are watching this
humans absolutely will be able to
control the weather
do you know what air conditioning is
have you heard of it
air conditioning that's how you control
the weather
at least where you are so yeah we'll be
able to control the weather that's not
arrogant
that's just science all right
i believe i've said more than i need to
say today
and the weather the news continues to be
gigantically boring but we'll try to
make it interesting with the
simultaneous sip
each and every day um by the way the
technology on locals for the live
streaming which i'm doing simultaneously
with with youtube
is working really well for for a beta
product
i haven't had a problem with it at all
um
the last number of times i've used it so
i think
the people who decide to watch it there
are going to be pretty happy
and the sound is a little bit better
over on locals i've got different
hardware there
the simulation isn't working because
there's no news
well you know maybe that's a benefit
that biden is giving us i'm definitely
not worked up over the news
maybe i should be all right
um that's all i got for now and i'll
talk to you youtubers
tomorrow
