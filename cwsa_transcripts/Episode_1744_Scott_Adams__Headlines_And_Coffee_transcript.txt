appreciate it
is everybody here for the simultaneous
sip which is one hour delay then
damn it that's the best i could do today
i know you're the crying babies outside
which are not crying babies they're some
kind of weird bird
there they are screaming birds you got
it you got it
so should we talk about the news after
we have our simultaneous sip
um
sorry to say that this is the vacation
version of the simultaneous sip and that
means
paper cup
paper cup
can you believe it
i know
so
how would you like to join me now for
the simultaneous sip you can put it in
any kind of vessel that's that's the
vacation version quick version
and uh you ready it's the dopamine head
of the day it's the thing that makes
everything better
go
um point of order point of order
i'm asked in the comments on youtube if
it would be okay
to have a cold cup of coffee
well
if that's all you have
yes
but i would consider it respectful to
the rest of us
if you would be prepared next time sure
i'm an hour late yeah that's a thing
but
next week i'll be right on time expect
the same of you
well i'm looking at all the important uh
news today and
by far
the most important story have you seen
it
yeah there's a ruling in the the uk
a judge ruled that calling a man
at work is sexual discrimination
sexual discrimination
and i have to agree with this judge
when people refer to me as bald
the first thing i think is
you sexist bastard
why must you
mock me for my high testosterone which
causes this baldness
or testosterone sensitivity which is
almost the same thing but technically
different
huh why
well
i believe it's because people are
terrible
and uh that when they mock me for my
follicle
uh
let's say my follicle shortage
is that fair no it's sexist it's sexist
i feel like
less of a man and the argument
apparently
actually i don't but the argument
apparently
is that since men are the primary gender
that gets bald
primarily but not exclusively
that this must be some kind of
a
a sex gender related insult and so i
accept this new standard
on behalf of all the bald men out there
who as you know
are more virile
more efficient more aerodynamic
and in many ways superior to all those
who have good hair
wait a minute that makes me a sexist
i take it back
i take it back
we're all equal no matter our hair
that's better isn't it
can i be a little more woke
i could not be more woke than this
all people of all kind of follicle
situations
we are all equal
i have a dream
i have a dream
that one day
you go to the barber and the barber will
treat you
exactly the same as people who have hair
someday
i don't know how they do that
someday they'll do that
well speaking of woke people apparently
there's a trend in yale law school
of uh angry people who want to get in
the face and have unrelenting quote
unrelenting daily confrontations
with their fellow students who
identify as conservative do you know why
do you know why
the woke yale law school people want to
get in the face
of those conservative fellow students
because
of the supreme court decision about or
upcoming decision we expect
about roe versus wave
and the the thinking is that these
students although they have done nothing
will someday grow up to be just like
these supreme court people
and you got to get them early
does that seem uh seem like a pretty
good idea to you
to uh get them early
see here's the problem
if you were going to predict which side
of the
roe vs wade question
were most likely to become violent
which side would it be like if you
didn't know anything about anything and
you just heard
that there was one political side that
was trying to prevent what they believed
was murder of babies that would be their
their interpretation
versus another side who's who's saying
no this these are not human lives so
you know it's a it's a medical decision
now i'm not taking a side
if you've been watching me long enough
you know i don't i don't have an opinion
on
abortion that i want to share
meaning
let women work it out and i'm going to
accept whatever they come up with
which i think is just a better system
the the the less my opinion is part of
this the better everybody is right i i
don't i don't have a
womb and therefore i would rather
allow my vote to be taken by somebody
else
so
on this issue just this issue
so wouldn't you imagine that the
pro-life people would be the ones
uh
who were the most worked up about this
situation
it's kind of weird that it's reversed
but to be fair
if if i were a woman uh
and i could have a baby and somebody
told me that let me let me just give you
one example
somebody told me that if i had been
raped
i would have to raise the rapist baby
nope
sorry
i'm sorry you know this is not my
opinion on abortion in general i'm going
to give you a very narrow little opinion
the narrow little opinion is if i got
raped and i were a woman and i got
pregnant i would want to kill that
little thing so badly
that i don't know if i would care if it
were illegal or illegal
i'd want that thing dead so fast
now that's a special case
that's a special case that's not my
opinion on abortion
right like i i'm telling you how i'd
feel
it's just how i'd feel
like i can tell you that if if i were
the victim of that specific crime there
wasn't anything i wouldn't kill
i would kill the abortion i would kill
the person who did it i probably want to
kill his family i certainly want to kill
any fetus that came out of it i mean i'd
want to kill everything
but that's just me
right i'm not saying you should build
any kind of laws around that
[Music]
so
don't change the constitution to be
compatible with my way of thinking on
this i'm just saying
that if the situation were reversed
and somebody was telling me what i had
to do in that situation
not cool
not cool at all
but
if you were to guess which side was
going to be the one to get violent about
this it's kind of it's it's not exactly
the way you'd expect it
all right let's talk about uh
here's a smallish story that's bigger
than you think
it's
potentially world changing it's just a
little tiny little story that you can
imagine it
like becoming gigantic and here's how
this happens
so the story is that
david sacks
has just endorsed on twitter endorsed
michael schellenberger
who's running as an independent against
gavin newsom for governor of new york
i'm sorry governor of california
and
here's why this is a big difference big
deal
there there are certain people in the
let's say the tech ecosystem
who
just have a little more credibility than
other people
and david sacks is one of them
so he sort of represents let's say and i
you know this is me talking this is not
him so don't blame him for anything i
say
but
he's he's positioned let's say
uh
he's the kind of person who
if he says a full-throated endorsement
of an independent candidate
there's a lot of people listening
and the people listening are
let's say
opinion makers
so he this is not like a regular
endorsement
i don't know if he's endorsed anybody
before it might be the first time but
the uh the argument for sheldon burger
is the same one i'm making because i
endorsed him as well
uh is that he's got solutions they're
very specific
very well researched
based on stuff that's worked in other
places i mean it's just the the most
commonsensical
solution based
very detailed here's how we're going to
do it
situation
we have to try this somewhere once
please
right
in the interest of
you know saving america and i think
we're at that point
where saving it isn't too strong
do you would you agree with that
do you think we're at the point where
you have to save the country
it's not like we're just tweaking it
better i feel like i feel like we're in
some serious right now a little
more than usual right
and
but imagine this
imagine a world in which somebody ran as
an independent in our you know one of
our biggest states or the biggest i
don't know
what's bigger is california bigger than
texas by population it is right
um
what would happen if he got elected
because he doesn't say things that are
let's say
poisoned to democrats
and he does anything that's poisoned to
republicans
do you know how weird that is
imagine somebody running for a major
office getting this much attention and
he's not saying anything this poison to
either side
he's just got solutions that he's
detailing and you know books
best-selling books he's showing you
exactly what he's going to do exactly
and it's right on point with just
science and
things that we know work
so how do the democrats say no to that
i mean unless they're just team team
people right
now
i know i know all the money suggests
that uh nusa will win
all the politics suggests he would win
right so he's got the machine he's got
the money
he's got the
history the
inertia everything basically but why he
doesn't have is a good
a good proposition
what he's offering you is more of what
you had
and who in california wants more of that
i don't know anybody
i literally don't know anybody not one
person not of any
persuasion not one resident of
california
wants more
of whatever the we had for the last
five years or whatever
nobody wants more than that nobody
[Laughter]
so how does how does a independent
who is defending either democrats or
republicans and by the way has that ever
happened
is it has anybody ever thread that
needle before no
and i don't think people are
understanding how smart you have to be
to do it
if you watch shellenberger navigate this
space
he's literally stepping on all the rocks
in the river
than nobody has seen before it's like he
can see the rock to get across the river
without getting his feet wet and there
are a lot of rocks and he hasn't missed
a rock yet
it's pretty freaking amazing
so
yeah and the one thing that i'm puzzled
by
is why the national press hasn't been
more aggressive about this story and
obviously it's because the democrats
you know would like to keep power
but
and they're you know they're backing
museum of course but it does seem like
the nature of the story is just made for
the news
because it's a whole different approach
and it would be
nationally transforming so here's here's
why it's a small thing that's a big
thing the david stacks endorsement
makes it safe for other people to do the
same
makes us safe
because he's he's considered so rational
and so respected
in you know the silicon valley tech
world anyway people people were aware of
who's done things in that world
uh that i think he's just made us safe
to back the independent
and so if you see more people of his
let's say
stature
following on
this could be a big deal and it could
have influence for national elections in
the future
because it's a little bit desantis-like
in some ways
but desantis goes for
republican-only solutions
right desantis is a real practical guy
but he's nowhere near a shelling burger
shellenberger is really about the
solutions period he really is
you know you can't even determine his
politics from his solutions you wouldn't
be able to find it and that's the weird
part
so nobody else has ever pulled this off
and sheldon brewer's
he's got the best
he's best got the best chance i've ever
seen
based on his campaign
all right
have any of you seen the rumor i think
the washington or not so the new york
post getting all my states wrong today
the new york post had an article
but it's based on your rumors and blah
blah blah and the rumors are that
putin might have some
terminal blood cancer
have any of you read that in any other
media
in the last say day
has anybody seen that story
i wouldn't have seen the story except it
was you know tweeted at me
nope yeah
so i'm guessing that this story has not
met the test sounds like cia
disinformation doesn't
yeah
but i'm gonna stick with my earlier um
my earlier observation that in my
opinion he looks like he's dying
right
so i'm gonna stick with it just because
i like to follow it through that way you
can see was my prediction good or bad
it's kind of unfair to change it in the
middle
so i'm gonna i'm gonna stick with
i think he's sick
maybe terminal the terminal part you
know how would i know
but he looks like he's got a problem
like a pretty big one
yeah
so we'll see
it does look like disinformation
um
but
uh am i reading things right
does it look like
uh we must have somebody on the inside
in the kremlin
now we've said so right the the news has
reported that there's some kind of
insider that's giving the united states
and ukraine
some kind of intel
but that too could be cia disinformation
because one of the best things you could
do to an enemy
is tell the enemy that one of their top
lieutenants is giving you secret
information
even if they're not
because then you know then they'll
distrust each other and everything goes
to hell so you can't trust anything
about a rumor of somebody having a spy
on the inside there's nothing about that
that's believable
even if it's true it shouldn't be
considered credible
but
i gotta say
independent of what the news is telling
us it sure looks like we have somebody
on the inside
are you feeling that too
and the reason is because i don't think
we would do the things that we've done
so far unless we knew more than the
public knows
we meaning the government it seems to me
that the biden administration has some
information about russia
that we don't have
what do you think
now it might be wrong
might be right
but doesn't it seem like their decisions
are hard to explain without a better
understanding well without them having
extra information
because otherwise it looks like
mistakes but why would it be that their
mistakes have so far produced
something that looks like a
stalemate in ukraine which very few
people predicted except me i predicted
it
and
and if you look at the news coverage the
news coverage has clearly changed
to ukraine is winning
you've seen that right
now look can you confirm that if you're
watching the news
in my opinion the coverage has changed
to ukraine is just winning
now that doesn't mean it's true i'm only
talking about the news coverage
am i right
are you seeing the same thing
that the news is covering it like
ukraine
is winning
and will win
that's different all right because it
went from wow they're they're putting up
a
surprisingly stiff resistance
and then it went to
you know this is
i guess we should mention that in a few
towns they took back a couple of towns
but you know there is still just a stiff
resistance and then
you hear about some russian stuff
blowing up today
today the uk intel
uh people
estimated that russia had lost one-third
of its troops that are committed to
ukraine
so one-third of the troops that have put
in ukraine are already dead
or wounded i guess
now do you believe that
do you believe that the uk
and their intelligence agencies
with all of their believability and
credibility and of course they'd have no
reason to lie in the context of an act
of war
why would anybody lie
what
thank you baron von blair
um
yeah
so uh how many people think we should
believe an estimate out of the uk
intelligence agency
during war
yeah that sounds very believable doesn't
it
no
you know the the thing that we
sometimes forget
is that and then an intel agency's job
is to lie to you it's literally their
job to lie to you
they're professionals and they do it
really well
now their job is to protect you
right that would be the larger job and
one hopes that they're doing it
in every way that they can and that
they're really on your side
but we don't know i mean we hope
so in the context of protecting you
they have every
moral ethical right to lie to you
because we kind of hired them to do that
right to manage how we think about
things oh by the way
did you see the uh i tweeted it i think
there's a video ad the tv ad i think
probably on the internet too uh
recruiting people for the um
psychological operations of the united
states the psyop people have you seen
that commercial
oh my god
oh my god
[Music]
go watch that thing um
what happens when the people who are
the most qualified brainwashers because
that's what that's what their job is
they would work in psyops so they'd be
brainwashing and influencing the enemy
that's that would be their very
expertise
what happens when those guys make a
recruiting ad a video
well i'll tell you
you can't stop watching it that's for
sure it's really long and it's an
advertisement to recruit people so you
think it'd be short
but it's unusually long
and i couldn't turn it off
i couldn't turn it off
you could feel
you could feel the uh skill level
from the first second
like as soon as it gets you it grabs you
by the throat
and then you're like i think i think i'm
going to i can't turn it off
uh yeah i've seen enough i think i get
to just
just one more
i want to join the psyops
i mean it's really good
so
anyway i had to put that up there
um
and the uk intel says that uh under the
current conditions russia is unlikely to
dramatically accelerate its rate of
advance over the next 30 days
so in other words
the thinking is that over the next month
remember this was supposed to be over in
a you know two months or something but
they're saying in the next month
russia's just gonna sit there and bleed
what's that gonna look like
another month of russia just losing
people making no gains and just bleeding
and
every day that they sit there ukraine is
getting more drones right
don't you think this you know the
russian forces are
going to have to look up a lot because
there's going to be a drone over them
pretty much all the time
dropping something on some part of them
imagine the mental state of the russian
soldiers
imagine their mental
state because they don't want to be
there
a third of them have been killed or
wounded i guess
and
and the united states just put a
gazillion billion dollars in there
that's not a good place to be
you know so again
i
i've been predicting that this is a war
about tipping points
that one of the sides is going to run
out of something
that is necessary
probably not fighters
probably food or ammo or something like
that fuel
so
um it looks like ukraine supply lines
might be better which makes sense
because they have control of most of the
country so
yeah
well maybe it doesn't make sense i'm not
i'm not sure that it makes sense their
supply line is better
but
we'll keep watching that
all right
um
elon musk continues to tweet funny
he tweeted yesterday whoever whoever
thought that owning the libs would be
cheap never tried to acquire a social
media company
that's pretty funny
all right um how many of you saw elon
musk's tweet i think it was maybe a week
ago in which he taught you how to change
the
twitter interface
from the algorithm to just
the order that things come in
how many of you saw the tweet in which
he taught you to do that
i'm going to read the tweet
this is
civilization-changing tweet
that's not hyperbole
i'm going to tell you a tweet
that if if enough people saw it
would change civilization
that is not hyperbole here's the tweet
from elon musk
[Applause]
[Music]
he's teaching you how to change change
uh twitter's a feed so that you see
things in order of tweets instead of
twitter deciding what you see he says
number one
tap the home button so on your app on
your phone you tap the whole button
then number two tap the stars on the
upper right of screen
i never knew what they were because i
never was interested to tap it
i didn't even know that was up there so
there's little stars in the upper right
hand side if you tap on those little
stars
you can select latest tweets
and then elon says you are being
manipulated by the algorithm in ways you
don't realize
easy to switch back and forth to see the
difference
so i took his advice and i switched it
to order of tweets
and let me tell you something
i feel different
i
feel different
i was not expecting that
i was not expecting that i was expecting
that the
tweets maybe that i've been missing i
would see
and that's true
that's true
um
but i wasn't expecting how different i
felt
in other words there's something about
the seeing things just in order
that is not triggering me
is that is that real
or is that just
a completely subjective confirmation
bias
situation
did anybody else have that experience
it was like the dopamine button got
turned off
now it's just interesting stories
it used to make me
my head catch on fire every time i
i looked at twitter and now it's just
interesting
and
informative it really feels different
now i'm seeing other people agreeing but
be careful because this might be just
confirmation bias we might have expected
to see it and you know so therefore
we're seeing it i don't know if it's
real
but
it's been days now and i feel different
when i watch twitter
so when elon says you are being
manipulated by the algorithm in ways you
don't realize
oh my god
it sure feels true
and i saw people saying today that they
were seeing the tweets from
the rasmussen poll
for their first time they hadn't seen
them in a long time
so rasmussen is the one that
had one of the most accurate polling
histories for the political stuff
and although it has one of the most
accurate um
by the way and after the fact you can
look at the predictions you can look
what happened who got elected and you
can actually calculate who is the most
accurate
and they do well no matter who
calculates it they're always in that top
uh echelon
and
apparently that they had been you know
sort of shadow banned out of existence
even for the people who wanted to follow
them
and now people are saying hey i keep
seeing these rasmussen
tweets now so yeah yeah things are
different
if the only thing that elon musk did is
threatened by twitter but in the process
teach us how to turn the algorithm off
it would be one of the greatest things
that anybody ever did in the history of
humankind
too much
too far
no i'm going to say it again i'm so
proud of it
if the only thing elon musk did is he
never bought twitter but in the process
he taught you how to use that menu
choice to turn off their algorithm so it
stops brainwashing you
it would be one of the greatest
accomplishments in humankind
because he would have freed your
brain
from jail
that's what just happened he freed your
brain from jail
[Music]
yeah think about it
think about it what name something that
was bigger than that
what what did you care about more
inflation or freeing your brain from
jail
well inflation's pretty darn bad
but
my brain freed from jail honestly
so
uh yeah that is one of the biggest
accomplishments
now
not enough of us know to push the button
so it's not nothing yet
but hypothetically
if he could free your brain
it would be the most important thing
that's happened in a long time
um
how many of you are watching this story
about the buffalo mass shooter whose
name
let me check his name uh
uh jerky mcfuck i think that's
his actual name
because when they do these things they
like to be
become famous
so that's why i like to use his name
it's a it's a bob jerky mcfuckface i
think was his name
so remember that uh he needs to be
famous
uh so jerky mitch uh uh
apparently he's a white guy and he
watched tucker carlson show and he shot
a bunch of mostly black people in a
grocery store
and he seems to be a bad person
as in
clearly racist yet apparently his social
media shows a lot of racism
now
i'm watching the left go crazy
and here are the things they're saying
number one
uh he he must have been influenced by
tucker carlson to do this
now
i don't watch tucker carlson every day
but i've seen this show a lot
i've seen the show a lot
and there's one thing i've never seen on
tucker carlson's show
i don't believe i can think of one time
when tucker carlson said you know
those
american citizens
damn them
we sure we sure need fewer
law abiding american citizens
is that what is that what tucker has
been telling people on the shows that i
don't watch because all the ones i watch
he says he's in favor of
law abiding americans of all types every
type
law abiding
every type
totally in favor of all law abiding
americans
black white
male female
all of them every one of them
i'm pretty sure he's in favor of
anybody doing anything that's legal
you know he might not do it himself
maybe he would advise you not to
maybe he would advise you to ignore
their advice
but
i don't believe there's ever been a time
when tucker carlson said you know
those law-abiding americans of a
different type
you know there's something wrong with
them
got to be killed
nope nope
now you could argue with tucker
carlson's opinion about illegal
illegal people
right
if you don't like his opinion about
illegal immigration well that would make
sense
but
uh
tucker carlson is not in favor of
shooting americans
am i right
and yet the the left has somehow
imagined
that the guy who would well let me put
it in starker terms if tucker carlson
had been in the grocery store
and armed
one assumes that he's at least in favor
of the second amendment i don't know if
he carries a firearm but if you were
armed and if he were in that grocery
store you don't think he would have
taken out the shooter
because he was white
do you think he would have said oh
normally i would normally i would jump
into action with my legal firearm
to stop this mass murder but oh i
noticed the shoot is white so guess
we'll let this one ride
do you think he would do that
yeah seriously
i mean how how stupid do you have to be
to think that someone who's 100
consistently in favor of legal law
abiding americans
would somehow inspire someone to go kill
legal law-abiding americans
that's pretty far away from what he what
his message is
but the left needs some way to make this
all political
now there's definitely something going
wrong
with how he was activated by
right let's call it right leading
extreme right leading politics i guess
uh which is very different than
right-leaning politics
in the same way the you know progressive
extremists are different than normal
democrats right
so
uh
then the other big issue is that he
like many of the uh white
mass shooters he was captured alive
and there appears to be some kind of
trend of black mass shooters
being murdered even when they're
given when they're uh surrendering
how much of that is real
now i am in favor
of when you observe what you believe to
be a pattern to to call it out
especially if it looks like a pattern of
discrimination
but you have to be careful whether your
data is accurate
jenny brown says
let me let me talk to that jenny
jenny brown here on youtube says
she's sick of scott defending tucker
carlson at white supremacy jenny
you you ignit
uh did you see me defend white supremacy
no
did you see me defend tucker carlson no
 i didn't defend him i just told
you what i saw
i watched tv i saw things images came
into my brain can you understand that
can you understand i'm just talking
about things that exist
there's a show he says things here's
what he says here's what he doesn't say
can you understand that you
stupid piece of racist
because you're the kind of person that
the world needs a lot less of right
i'm telling you that he's in favor of
all legal americans
if you can't buy into that
concept
get off this broadcast you don't belong
here you're not
capable of being with regular people you
should go crawl into some hole
all right that's enough of that
um
probably just a troll
[Music]
all right uh
so did anybody answer my question
do you feel that this trend is or the
pattern is a real one
or is it just another racist attack
what do you think
is it a real trend
that the black shooters get killed by
police and the white ones are like oh
okay
surrender
yeah well but here's the question
nobody's
nobody's answered that i'm aware of
have they all acted the same
do they all surrender the same way
because if they surrender the same way
and the black ones are getting shot
yeah i've got a problem with that
don't you
is there anybody who wouldn't have a
problem with that
let me ask you since jenny apparently
thinks my that all of you are racist
[Music]
she must be too if she's watching
if she thinks
all right i made my point
um
i think i'm swearing more than usual
today
uh are you on prisoners island or
i'm not on prisoners island
now
i'm very much off of prisoners island
i am now on a tropical island
and uh it's not bad
cloudy but it's not bad
all right
um
let's see what else is happening
there anything else happen i'm gonna
check cnn and see if i missed any
stories because all the important
stories are in this oh
come on
see if i can get my wi-fi to come back
on and then we're going to make gucci
all right wi-fi
i tell ya it's hard to live with hotel
wi-fi sometimes
if you get once you get used to the good
stuff
all right looks like everybody woke up
and started using their wi-fi now it's
not working
um
all right news and
yeah you know i'm not going to talk
about this shooter anymore are you okay
with that
is every everybody okay that we're
um
everybody's okay that we're not talking
about him right
all right
here are your headlines on cnn which
really tells you a lot
california's in a water crisis officials
are focused on the wrong problem
so even cnn is criticizing california's
water shortage
the water shortage in california appears
to be purely a mismanagement problem
purely a mismanagement problem we're
going to run out of freaking water
and electricity
because we're mismanaged that's the
worst management i've ever seen has
anybody ever managed anything worse than
that
um
so what do you think of finland and
sweden joining nato
that's also a headline here
um
if you had asked me 30 days ago and i
probably talked about 30 days ago if you
said should uh sweden and finland join
nato under these conditions i would have
said you're just asking for more trouble
are you
you know are didn't uh nato flirting
with
ukraine and ukraine flirting with nato
isn't that why we're in this situation
or at least
parliament
and uh so i would have said you know why
don't you hold off on that nato
expansion idea
but what about today
if if you made the decision today would
you put
finland and sweden into nato
because it's starting to look like
russia is losing
i know a lot of you aren't on that page
yet but the way the news is treating it
the news is treating it as if russia is
just losing
and if russia is losing
[Music]
what is the best strategy
do you do you just keep the pressure on
until they lose bigger
because that looks like
not a bad strategy
so i i'm changing my mind in case you're
in case you're looking for my
inconsistencies
the situation has changed
and this or it looks like it at least
the news is reporting has changed
um good question here sparky says scott
how do you know that you're not being
used by intel as a part of the term
useful idiot
um
the only way that i pretend
to uh to deal with that
and pretending this is the best you can
do
is that i'll give you both sides
so i'm not telling you that ukraine is
winning i'm telling you that the news is
reporting they're winning
because i don't believe anything that
comes out of the
way of anything that comes out of russia
and i don't believe anything that comes
out of uk intel
that comes out of american intelligence
i don't believe anything that comes out
of biden administration on the war
everybody on the same page
if you start with the assumption that
everybody's lying all the time about
everything about the war and really
that's the only logical thing to do
if you were any of those entities you
could buy
it's a war you have to you have to do
whatever it takes right so lying is just
part of the you know one of the tools of
war so they're all lying of course
they're all lying or they're leaving out
or they're omitting you know whatever
they're lying in some way
so if i were a useful idiot i would be
telling you that one of those stories
was true
and one of them was not
but i'm not i'm telling you the opposite
of that so yes it's the right question
but there you go
um
yeah
keeping a race killer in the news is
just a democrat
um technique yeah because they want your
attention to be all about that
um
oh somebody's asking did i see the
trailer for matt walsh's movie what is a
woman
all right
so as you know
uh unlike many of my viewers
i'm the most uh pro
public figure you might ever meet
totally pro anybody doing whatever they
need to do right so it's not even about
trans
it's just about freedom
right it doesn't matter that i think
somebody might make a different decision
or should have it's irrelevant
don't do what you want just doesn't
don't affect me
um i wish the best for them and and i
don't think that they all make the right
decisions
but do you right
the fact that you think that other
people are making wrong decisions about
this very basic identity stuff
that doesn't mean they don't get to make
the decision
they still get to make that decision and
that's to me that's
you know that's uh an unassailable
position it's just not my decision
so
i'm as pro as you can get to the trans
community i think sports should be
adjusted so that there's just a whole
better situation for everybody not just
not just the trans community
so that's what i'm starting for having
said that
having said that
watching matt walsh go around and ask
people to define what a woman is
is really good entertainment
okay
right so i don't i don't uh
i don't align with his
provocative views on this 100
so it's not about agreeing with them i
don't have to
but as a form of entertainment which is
asking a perfectly legitimate question
under the current circumstances and then
watching people
not be able to deal with a fairly simple
question
on a topic they seem to care a lot about
but don't understand maybe even the
topic
really funny so i don't see it about
trans
if you see it as a film about trans
people then maybe it's you know it's
going to affect you one way or the other
negatively probably
but if you see it as a film about how
people form opinions
and how well they can think through
simple questions
it's actually really funny
uh and that's just based on the trailer
and things i've seen him say in tweet so
i
i will definitely watch that thing i'm
definitely gonna watch that
yeah it's matt walsh from the daily wire
and so i'm not sure that i agree with
matt walsh on more than i don't know
half of what he says maybe something
like that
but he's always good
like even the part i don't i don't agree
with sometimes i'll be like oh he said
that pretty well he's really good at
what he does
all right
um and one of one of the most
public
figures i think
um
so us claims uh reversal is new yeah
okay
there's nothing negative about ukraine
uh ukraine is sending images of dead
russian soldiers to their families even
the spin on this
seems wrong
right cnn's spin on ukraine is that
they're
sending images of dead russian soldiers
to their families but the way they're
spinning it is that is so that the
families can pick them up or so they'll
be better informed of what happened
is that really why ukraine is doing that
i feel like it's a terrorist act
i i feel like
if you send a picture of somebody's dead
child to the parents
that's a terrorist act
isn't it
how would you define terrorism if it's
not that
that just looks like terrorism
now
i'm in favor of it
that it just happens to be terrorism now
is anybody in favor of terrorism yes yes
that's why there's so much of it
everybody's in favor
of if if the person doing this on your
side
if the united states got conquered by
uh let's say china
and there was some some american who got
into beijing and
started terrorizing beijing while we
were being oppressed i wouldn't i
wouldn't be opposed to that
yeah it's a war crime
[Music]
but if they're doing it on your side it
doesn't feel like terrorism anymore does
it
yeah look at the uh well i'm not gonna
go there let's just say the formation of
a popular country
uh there was some terrorism
so we we judge terrorism differently
depending on whose side it's on
all right
um
and everything about that shooter we
don't care about that
melania trump teases the second term as
first lady interesting
if melania is down for a second term
[Music]
that means trump is definitely down for
a second term doesn't it
because i don't see melania teasing
about that unless she was sort of down
to do it
hmm
very interesting
um
gop governor says that rape victims
should have to carry a baby to term
such a losing argument i'll tell you
you know
um separate from what is right or wrong
it's just a bad argument
um
[Music]
let's see
which governor is that gop governor
which one is it
let's see who would say such a silly
thing
now how many of you agree with that by
the way because a lot of you are on the
same page
uh that he will call sweden so uh
republican of uh nebraska
republican governor pete ricketts
total ban
um now i of course i can understand it
of course i understand why a pro-life
person would just be pro-life
permanently so in terms of
morality
i would say that would be the most
highest moral
opinion
so if you were going to say this
republican governor who says there
should be a ban on abortions including
rape
i would say he is taking the highest
moral
stand by his assumptions that the you
know the child is alive and it's a human
life
so you can't argue with that part
but
morality has a little bit of wiggle room
if you define it as not being a life
which many people do
yeah the moral standard goes both ways
because if you define it as not yet a
life then it would be highly immoral to
to
force someone who is alive the mother
to do something this radical
for something that isn't alive if that's
what your assumption is
so since the only question is whether
it's alive or not
don't you get down to the
um
by the way there was i saw
a lawyer
it was a woman who was arguing that
the first amendment is how you protect
the first amendment would be how you
protect in other words freedom of
religion is how you protect abortion
rights
let me try this argument on you this is
not my argument
right everything i say about abortion
is not trying to influence which way the
law goes i keep myself out of that let
the women work it out i'll back them
i'll back your majority whatever you
whatever you come up with
so
here's the argument for a
religious
right to abortion you ready for this
if the reason that people want abortion
to be illegal is based on their
religious
faith
that this that the life starts at
conception
is that not one religion trying to force
another people who are not of that
religion
to conform to their religion
is that not what's happening
now i'm going to argue the other side so
don't don't worry that i have a point of
view that you've seen yet right but just
as an argument
if you said to me well my religion says
i can do this
your religion says i can't
is your religion not guiding me now
here's the problem we've never had
religious freedom in the united states
that this is just telling us what was
always true you've never had religious
freedom in the united states
did anybody teach you you had religious
freedom
because you never did
and you never will
what you have is the freedom to have a
religion
that is largely compatible with
christianity that's it
that's your only that's your right
your right is to accept
christianity as your religion you can
use different words for it
you could call it uh
moderate uh
moderate islamic belief
because you're you're accepting a god
you're also saying that murder is wrong
stealing is wrong
basically
totally compatible on the big stuff
now let's say um you want to have a
religion that was
satanic in nature
and that your religion said that you can
kill human people for sacrifice
would that be legal
no
no that would not be legal
because it's not legal for a christian
to kill somebody
so you wouldn't get to do it
the only things you can do are the
things that christians say you can do
that's it
there's nothing else
so as soon as you say hey you're
violating my religious beliefs my first
statement is you never had a rule not
religious beliefs you never had any
religious freedom
you have the freedom to be exactly like
a christian but use different words for
it and you know wear different clothes
you know have a different book
you can do all that
but if your religion says you can kill
people whoa oh hold on no that then
we're going to go back to the christian
religion as your your guard railway
so the trouble with the argument is that
it acts as though we have we've ever had
religious freedom we never have
and never will
yes honor killings would be an example
there there have been
times when that was appropriate under
not appropriate but allow it under some
religion right
were honor killings ever allowed
at any time
by any subset
of people as within their religious
rights and that right
so
how about uh beating your wife
if there were a religion that said yes
you can be your wife but you know don't
use a stick that's any bigger than your
thumb
but otherwise you can beat your life
perfectly fine
would that be legal in the united states
under the religious
freedom
first amendment
would that be legal
no it wouldn't do you know why
because christians don't like it
that's why
that's it you don't have any freedom
except to be a christian or a
christian-ish or like them or similar to
them that's it
full freedom
now
usually we don't even notice
because we
pretty much all the the major religions
believe in one god
uh or at least they believe that murder
is wrong so mostly we're on by
coincidence
but then this question of whether a
fetus
is a human life
this gets like right to the religious
belief thing
and so if you're gonna argue that
religious freedom lets you take this
let's say take this entity
whether you want to call it a life or
not
then you get a problem
because that is a genuine difference in
religious belief and the christians
are mixed
so in other words even christians don't
agree on whether this is a life or not
so then it gets really messy
but let's not let's not imagine we ever
had freedom of religion that was never
real that was always just a smokescreen
for a christian country
and by the way i'm not a believer
if anybody's new to me i'm not defending
christianity beyond the fact that as a
model it seems to work
you know a lot a lot of people are
christian and they have good outcomes
just as many people are muslim and they
have good outcomes as well
yeah i'm in favor of religion
when it works
and it usually seems to work so it's a
pretty good system in general
i just don't buy into it because i don't
have the i for whatever reason i was
born without the ability to be a
believer
all right let's see what fox news is
see if anything looks different on that
side of the world well wouldn't it be
great if my wife i work
that'd be great
but it's not all right
where is it
all right did i miss any big stories
uh everyone knows it's a life i don't
i i think that's always a mistake to say
everyone thinks or everyone knows
anything i don't i
i don't believe it's a life
at least at inception
i believe it's an organic thing that has
a potential for life
so in my view
there is potential for life
and there is this this long
you know consciousness
growth thing that starts at almost at
nothing basically and then goes to
almost nothing and it gets bigger so i
don't have an opinion of when life
starts
but it's not the first second
so that's that's the only part that i
feel now
if you say that your religious belief
tells you that the first second is life
i'm okay with that
i'm okay with that like i said i'm not a
believer
but i'm a big proponent of belief
and so if your belief
put you in that camp i think that's a
perfectly moral ethical
reasonable place to be
it just doesn't match with my
my less my let's say my instinct
just my instinct
tells me that that's
you know less than a conscious
life
but i i wouldn't try to sell it to you
okay
how about that can we make an agreement
that if i stay under the question
you know i won't give you my opinion on
abortion
that you won't argue with me about where
i think life begins because i'm not
gonna you know i'm not gonna make that
any kind of a point that you should act
on uh
yeah
all right
what if you're stuck on prisoners island
how many of you are on prisoner's island
right now
if you don't know what that means it
means that you're you're in a bad
situation but you're gonna win
all right um
the worldwide child hepatitis
i've not heard of that
it is not on the front page of my news
sources
now you're talking bs i don't know which
part
um
you are not forced to be a religion here
that's what it's about
well you're not forced to
[Music]
let the local voters decide when life
begins
well
that would certainly be a political way
to take care of it
but it certainly doesn't change the way
people feel
um scott gay marriage is recognized even
though it is anti-christian no it isn't
no it isn't because christians say it's
not anti-christian
see if if all the christians were on the
same side then i'd say oh yeah there you
go
there there's a case of doing something
that's not christian
but christians believe that
same-sex marriage is okay not all of
them
so that would be not a case of being
against christianity because
christianity doesn't have a decision on
that it's a mixed bag
um
all right
and that is all for now
uh
the white house is lying about baby
formula
you know the whole baby formula story
i've been uninterested in because it all
looked like to me
do you remember those big palettes of uh
baby formula
i saw somebody trying to debunk that as
fake news i don't know what part was
fake
but i feel like the whole baby formula
thing is
the factual part is so murky i don't
know what's going on there
but here's a question
can baby only thrive if they have this
special kind of baby formula
let's say they don't have an option of
nursing in the natural way
is there only one way to feed a baby
like you can't
you can't take ordinary
food related things and grind them up
into something that's liquidish
and has
age matters age matters not for the
first few months
so you're saying that if the first few
months that if a newborn
didn't get
human milk or formula
that there's nothing you could feed them
to keep them alive and thrive you know
let's say healthy and alive
can't do that i mean it must be true
that you can't do that or it's hard to
do it not a newborn interesting
they'll suffer later in life
okay well learning something here
all right i guess i'd have to be more
educated on this topic but there's not
much to say uh the
there seems to be some combination of
bad management
that got us to this point
but i think we'll fix it
um there were a lot of infant deaths pre
formulas okay
interesting
all right well that's all for now
and i think you're gonna turn off the
youtube feed we'll talk to the locals
subscribers here a little bit more and
i'll see you tomorrow i think i'm gonna
try the same time tomorrow so just while
i'm traveling
until uh until thursday next week we'll
be an hour later
