good morning everybody
and welcome
to undoubtably the peak experience of
your entire life it's going to happen
now it's called coffee with scott adams
i don't know if anything has ever been
better
let me check my notes
nope
nothing has ever been better and if
you'd like to take it to another
really unheard of level
unheard of
all you need is a copper margaret glass
a tanker jealous steiner canteen drug
flash vessel for the kai fill up his
favorite lake red
i like coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day the
thing that makes even scott
wake up it's called coffee
and the simultaneous it happens now go
it might just be me
possibly a placebo effect
but i feel the blood clots in my blood
starting to dissipate
does anybody feel like their blood clots
just decreased a little bit i mean not a
lot
i'm not talking about completely
eliminating i'm talking about a little
bit
i mean don't get greedy it was just one
sip okay you can't can't cure covent
with one sip
that would take at least three to five
all right
i give you now my plan to destroy the
united states
um how would you do it
what would be the cheapest way to
destroy the united states let's say you
were on a budget
you could be i don't know i'll just pick
a random country china
you could be china let's say you're on a
budget and i'm just picking them
randomly
and you wanted to destroy the united
states what's the
what's the one person you could get to
to do that well the president right
getting to the president would help you
do it
but there might be a cheaper way because
the president's pretty expensive
you know you're buying hunter biden with
that deal hunter biden doesn't come
cheap some say 31 million dollars is
minimum price
but
if you wanted to get even cheaper than
that who is the one person you could
influence in the united states
that would destroy the country
just one person
okay me
okay not counting me
because i'm not going to destroy the
country so they don't have that option
well i would suggest and by the way i'm
not suggesting that this is happening
i'm just telling you you should be
alerted
to this risk
if i were going to destroy the united
states i would bribe the head of the
teachers unions
and we're done
how much would it cost
to bribe the head of the biggest
teachers unions
now i'm not saying they've taken their
bribes i'm not suggesting there's any
evidence of anything like that
i'm just saying hypothetically
what would it cost to totally own the
head of
the teachers unions
i think you could get it for about a
million
maybe less don't you think
so for maybe a million dollars and you
know indirect benefits that can't be
traced to anybody particular you know
maybe a business does well that
is related to them somehow
if you could get that one person what
would you encourage them to do well you
might encourage them to
select a fact-checking news filter
and suggest that it run in all the
schools and perhaps that news checking
filter
would be
biased toward a certain kind of news
and biased away from
a certain other kind of news
what would happen
if you did that well if that news filter
happened to be legitimate
and they happen to be making you smarter
and educating our kids better
that's all good for the kids good for
the country too
but what if
said person bribing the head of the
teachers unions which is not happening
as far as i know
just talking about the risk of it
couldn't they come up with ideas like
educate your kids at home
even though
the science might not support that
wouldn't they come up with ideas like
filtering the news so that only pro
china news gets through
just for example
critical race theory they might suggest
critical race theory
all i'm saying is that there is one
individual
in charge of the current country and
that's joe biden
but there might be only one individual
in charge of the future of the country
and that's whoever has the most control
over our education system
because that's those are the minds that
will be run in the country in the next
generation
so i am very uncomfortable having one
person having this much control over the
future of the country especially when
any one person can be
bought
you know
i'd love to say there's nobody who can
be bought
but
you know anybody who's not already
pretty rich can be bought
everybody's got a price they could
either be blackmailed bought coerced
persuaded
this is a real real problem that we have
such a
vulnerability in our national defense i
would go so far as to say that homeland
security should be in charge of the
teachers union
yeah yeah you didn't see that coming did
you
homeland security should be in charge of
education because if we don't get
education right and protect the kids
from being brainwashed by external
sources
we will be giving away the future
didn't see that coming now i'm not i'm
not terribly serious about homeland
security because you don't want to add
you don't want to add any extra layers
of government anything if you can avoid
it but my point is we have a real
vulnerability
that is a a genuine security problem
like a real security problem like a real
real really big security problem like as
big as security problems could ever be
it's just that it's about the future
like it's not we're not on fire at the
moment it's just something brewing that
that will kill us all eventually
the hard way anyway we need to do
something about that
um i thought that i saw a joke on cnn
and it turned out it wasn't a joke
how often have we joked about
the anti-trumpers saying that the walls
are closing in on trump right isn't that
like a punch line the walls are closing
in on trump now
they're going to get him any minute
those walls are closing in
right
the walls are closing in is just a punch
line i thought i didn't know that
anybody actually said it anymore
you know originally they were saying it
and repeating each other but at this
point
at this point are really asking are are
people actually saying that
well it turns out chris eliza released
the headline actually he said that
and it wasn't a joke
and here's the liz's argument
that the walls are closing in on trump's
legal problems
now here are all the examples
i've done this before but
it's just head shaking
to see how the media creates this
narrative all right
so look at all the examples that they've
they've fit into the narrative it's the
same thing they did with russia
collusion
you start with the framework oh there's
russia collusion
you know roughly
ambiguously stated and if you've got
this ambiguous framework of russia
collusion then anything that involves a
russian
is probably going to map to it right
confirmation bias is going to do the
rest uh something with a russian phone
call oh that probably fits there all
right uh
trump uh once said niet
well that that's probably there
right so once the framework is set your
mind just fills in the framework it's
automatic
so cnn has caused this this framework
of trump legal problems all right so now
you got this ambiguous framework yeah
there's some kind of legal financial
tax problem
something
but so everything you see is going to
like stick to it right so here are the
things they threw against that framework
the new york attorney general um
is has told us that uh the trump
uh
the trump company
has a number of misleading statements
and omissions used to secure loans
so
do you think it's true first of all
that there are quote misleading
statements and omissions
that were used to secure loans
well let me put this in context
how many of you have ever been a banker
and it was your job to evaluate loans
me
me that was my job for several years for
several years i worked for a bank and
one of my jobs i had a number of them
was to be the one who approved loans
business loans
so somebody would propose one and not
have to look at it and sign it off
and
how often have i ever seen
a misleading statement or an omission
used in a loan
application
do you think i've ever encountered
a misleading statement or omission
how often like what would you guess is
the percentage of time
you encounter a misleading statement or
omission
100 of the time
[Laughter]
100
so what is what is the new york attorney
general telling us
that trump's statement is exactly like
every other big statement in other words
if there's a certain level of
complication
you always have omissions
you always have misleading statements
now is that illegal
which which one of those things is
illegal
it depends
there's nothing illegal in concept
right because misleading is a subjective
standard isn't it
it's hard to say what is misleading
wait
if it's untrue
that's a standard right if you just put
something that was just you know you say
you made this much money and it's just
not the right number well that's just
untrue
so that's the standard that you could
you could manage to
but how do you manage to misleading
i don't think misleading is a is a legal
standard is it
and if it is there's going to be a whole
lot of judgments in there
and the reason that you hire
accountants why do you hire accountants
and cpas to do your taxes if you're a
business instead of doing them yourself
well one reason is they're complicated
it's hard to do yourself do you know
what the other reason is
here's the other reason
if your cpa or accountant
makes a misleading statement that they
can back up
as in well there were two ways to handle
this
both of them were legal
we chose this one
how much trouble does the client get in
the client you know the person who hired
the cpa how much does the person who
hired the cpa how much trouble do they
get in if the person they hired who's a
professional
does this every day
says you know there were two ways to do
this we chose this way they're both
legal and then the irs comes back and
said you know
i think you should have chosen the other
way
zero legal risk there might be there
might be a financial risk
meaning there might be a penalty or
something if the irs says oh you know i
see why you did it but you should have
done it this other way we'll give you a
penalty you don't go to jail for a
penalty
you just pay the penalty
fairly ordinary i'm pretty sure that
i've had that happen i'm sure at least i
think yeah i think at least maybe twice
the irs has said oh something wrong here
you're a penalty
and you know i look at it go oh okay
yeah i owe a penalty just pay the
penalty
all right here's another one um
there there's been a document release
about all the january 6 stuff
that might show that trump did something
bad
what
we're looking for things to find out if
there might be something bad
what
couldn't you say that about literally
everything
you know
i don't have any direct information
about
joe biden
doing horrible things but
if we can get access to all those
documents i'll bet we'd find something
yeah
fishing expedition is not a legal risk
per se
except they might find something
so you got a whole bunch of nothing in
the in the uh about his
misleading statements and omissions at
least the way it's described to us i'm
not saying there's no substance i'm
saying that if there were substances
weird that they wouldn't tell us
because i feel like that would have been
important to the story
then they're just looking for stuff on
january 6
and we found out today that apparently
the
the uh the protesters were already
overthrowing things even before uh trump
spoke
so that so the trouble has started long
before trump was even talking so
that's a factor then there's also a
special grand jury being convened in
georgia
talking about his phone call in which he
said
he hoped they could find the votes
there isn't any chance he's in any legal
trouble
for a phone call that everybody was on
in which he used ambiguous language
about
finding votes
when the context of the call was he
thought they were fraudulent
if the context of the call is i think
there was fraud
and you say i think there's fraud you
should look into it because we'd only
need to find x number of votes
clearly the context is not illegal
the context is perfectly clear
that he means to find votes that are
real that just weren't counted or vice
versa
right
so there's no way that's going to get
him in trouble that's the third thing
that's completely empty
and then my favorite ones
are eg and carol
she's the one who accused him of rape
and nothing happened to that
but
now trump said that she's not his type
it didn't happen because in part because
she's not his type and now she's suing
him for some kind of
defamation for saying she's not his type
or something
could anything be less than that
can you think of anything
that would be less of a legal risk than
that
even even if everything went wrong you
just pay some money
right this one has no risk other than
all right here's some money make it go
away and and even then this is clearly
not any kind of defamation
uh i'm no i'm no lawyer
i'm no lawyer but i feel confident in
saying this is not going to be a problem
and then there's his sister mary trump
who is suing him for alleged fraud on
their estate
however many decades ago when when they
all inherited
do you think that's going to turn into
anything
i doubt it a lot of time has gone by and
i would imagine the entire family
is on the other side and i imagine there
were lawyers involved so they probably
did everything as legal as anything
could be done
somebody says this is niece
oh he's a niece i'm sorry
mary's a niece
well that's
sad for mary because i put her in the
same age range as trump so sorry mary
sued for defamation
anyway so do you see any part of this
that sounds like the walls are closing
in on trump
i mean really
seriously does any of this look like he
has any legal risk to speak of
not really
you know i mean i suppose a fishing
expedition could come up with something
but i'm not expecting it
all right here's the funniest marital
problem story of the day
so you know the rfk junior he's a
anti-vaxx kind of guy
and
he's married to cheryl hines actress
cheryl hines you know her from
curb your enthusiasm and other stuff
and so rfk junior made this uh
uh let's say ill-advised
comparison of accident of uh
uh vaccinations to uh not nazi germany
uh at least the mandates the mandates
anyway
and cheryl hines who works in hollywood
and if you work in hollywood one thing
you don't want to do is
disrespect the holocaust
i'm just saying that's not a good career
move if you're a hollywood actor or
actress
and uh so cheryl hines did something
never i've never seen any spouse do
before but it's hilarious
i've never seen anybody come out harder
against their own spouse so uh the the
offending comment was something about
anne frank right so details don't matter
so rfk made a anne frank reference about
uh vaccine mandates
and so heinz uh
heinz said my husband's reference to
anne frank at a mandate rally in dc was
reprehensible and insensitive
what
are you really married
are you two are you two actually married
what
now i always appreciate people
speaking their mind
and it certainly doesn't surprise me
when you know spouses have
disagreements on political stuff and
stuff but
how do you stay married
after that
would you stay married to somebody who
called you reprehensible in public in a
public statement
if your spouse makes a public statement
that says you did something
reprehensible
that was just words
right it'd be one thing if you know if
you were violent or something then sure
but just words a political opinion a bad
analogy
if you use if you use an illu ill
let's say an ill-advised analogy
while you're trying to make the world a
better place
now
i'm not on rfk's side on
everything he's
persuading
i'm just saying it's pretty clear that
his intention
is to make the world a better place
would everybody agree with that
i mean no matter what you want to say
about rfk jr i don't think he's in it
for the money
right
can we at least give him that
i don't think he's in it for the money
i don't think he's in it for like
personal gain i mean you get your ego
involved so that's always a factor but
it doesn't look like
there's any intention here other than to
help people survive
now
if she had said uh i don't agree with my
husband's characterization
but uh he has a right to you know make
his points
would you be okay with that
i don't agree with his characterization
i thought that was ill-advised but of
course it's a free country and
and i i support his right to
his opinion
now that's how you stay married
but if you go in public and say that
your husband said something
reprehensible and insensitive
i think you've just signaled to the
world you're not planning to stick
around
right
i think she just told us she's not
sticking around
like i don't know how because imagine
what her life is like
having to explain her husband every time
she walks out the door
hey cheryl can you explain your husband
because where she is
you know vaccines are
like gold
anyway that's a funny story uh tragic
but funny
here's a big story west virginia the
state senate voted to lift their ban on
nuclear power plants in west virginia
how big a deal is that well west
virginia's big coal state so
you know if if they're going nuclear
we're in good shape as as you know our
one of our favorite nuclear
advocates mark schneider
tweeted this he says i have to wonder if
my meeting with the speaker of the
assembly
helps set the wheels in motion for this
well mark
i don't think it's a coincidence
that with your level of persuasive
ability that after meeting with the
speaker of the assembly
um
the things went your way
i don't think that's a coincidence now i
do think all the argument was was on the
side of
you know the decision they just made
and i think that things have changed in
terms of
in terms of climate change
right you know nuclear power went from
something that
you know was just an economic decision
then it turned into well it's necessary
for climate change
and then it turned into it's is more
than necessary for space travel
because if you need to dominate space
you have to be a nuclear nation because
everything in space is going to be
nuclear powered we expect so if you
don't have a really good domestic
nuclear program you can't have a good
space program
and if you don't have a good space
program you basically are giving up
because you're going to lose everything
if you can't control space
so you know
when you when you see that things are
going in that direction it's partly
because the environment served up the
opportunity but even more than that is
because people learn to essentialize the
argument
so if you want to see somebody take the
nuclear argument and simplify it so
every politician can understand it you
want to listen to mark schneider
um describe it
so so he's probably the best in the
business
of simplifying
you know what the argument is then for
those people who just need more science
and more detail
i would say that
the michael schellenberger
approach really just closes the deal
because sheldon berger comes in with
all the data in the world and
and just
he'll just basically
sweep your arguments away like leaves i
like use that analogy twice in two days
so between the two of them my god
they're so effective right now
um
here's my insight on ukraine
which i have not heard anybody say
apparently the u.s has
sent over or is sending over soon a
written response to
putin's request
for
you know he has demanded a few things so
he's demanded that
we say that nato won't come to ukraine
and also that offensive weapons won't be
put in ukraine
now why is it that putin is asking for a
written response
because it seems like they're making a
bigger deal about the written part
than i'm used to
why is putin asking for a written
response
why would anybody ask for a written
response
half of uk man well trust for the record
priming
not quite
no those are all reasons but not the
reasons i'm looking for
accountability to show the public you're
getting close
all about the price of oil
um
social media contract a document
okay let me tell you why
uh i think none of you got it right but
it's hard to read all the comments so
some of you might might have gotten it
right here's the reason you asked for
something in writing
you ready
because your argument is better
than the other side
and
you know that everybody will see it
it just has to be written down
because right now we're just talking and
when you're talking it's hard to really
uh hold all the
the argument in your head at the same
time
and then decide what's going on
the person who asked you to put your
response in writing
is already the winner
he's already the winner
because he asked for it in writing and
then what is the united states going to
do they're going to send a secret memo
to putin
that you the public can't see
why will the united states not show the
united states public
its own response
why is that going to happen
because it will be embarrassing
that's why
our response
will be embarrassing
putin's requests are not embarrassing
are they
putin's saying
don't put a aggressive military
entity
in my backyard
is that reasonable
everybody thinks that's reasonable
it doesn't matter how anti-russian you
are
literally everyone understands you don't
want an offensive force in your backyard
everybody right so putin is making putin
is making the world's most reasonable
request now
now hold on hold on
i'm not pro putin
i'm not saying that he doesn't have
tricks in his bag i'm not saying that
he's a good force you know just assume
everything bad about putin that you want
to but here's what you should not assume
about putin
and see if i can get agreement on this
he's not dumb
am i right
i mean he might be evil he might be you
know blah blah blah
that's all fine
but
nobody
nobody says he's down
nobody in russia says he's dumb nobody
in the united states says he's dumb
nobody in the world
in fact have you ever ever heard anybody
say putin was dumb no
he probably won't
so why would putin make this written
request it's got to be right and by the
way the news says that he that
russia is likely to release the u.s
response
yes they are likely to do that now
they'll have to read it first because
might be some surprises in there
but i think what putin is going to do
is going to show the world what he asked
for
and that he's going to show the world
the ridiculous response
he wins
he wins
because we don't have an
argument what do you think is really
behind all this
i think
this is just speculation but strong
speculation
i think that putin knows
that his argument can be made publicly
because there's nothing hidden you know
don't put offensive weapons in my
backyard
simple right
but
don't you think that the american
argument has some hidden variables
it does
the american argument
has to have hidden variables because it
would be too easy to reach a deal
otherwise
here's what the deal would look like if
we wanted to make one
we will agree not to put nato or not to
accept ukraine into nato we will agree
not to put offensive weapons there
all you have to agree in return is that
it's conditional
on uh ceasing cyber attacks
pulling your military back so you don't
have an aggressive force that looks like
an invasion force
and don't do other destabilizing things
how hard would it be for the united
states to make that counteroffer oh yeah
we can do both of these things
as long as you do some equally
confidence building things like you know
get get your troops away from the border
and stop doing the cyber attacks
seriously
if those were the only variables that
mattered
how hard would it be to reach a deal
one day
there's literally nothing to disagree
about
i mean some details about what it looks
like to not be aggressive i suppose but
we we can go back on the deal anytime we
wanted we would be giving up nothing
we could wait a week and say well there
was another cyber attack so i guess the
the deal's off
right
we could call the deal off anytime we
wanted just by claiming there was a
cyber attack even if there wasn't
i hate to say that
but even if there wasn't a cyber attack
our government could say there was
and just say the deal is off
so if we can't make a deal that's that
easy to make a deal that we can cancel
like that
keep our keep whatever we want which is
the ability to defend ukraine if we feel
like it
yeah
does congress have to approve this i
don't know the details of that
but
um i think what you're going to expect
is that our writing will look pathetic
putin will show it and while he will
show
here's the key to all this
what putin will show is that our
governments are lying to us
and the way he will show that
is that we can't make a deal that's
simple to make
and we were pretending that we would
prefer
a war with a nuclear power
over making the simplest deal that
anybody could ever make
the simplest deal
the easiest deal a deal that both sides
want their end of the deal
there's literally nothing to discuss
unless
unless
the united states has a hidden variable
could be finance it could be economics
it could have something to do with china
or germany or some other country that we
don't know about right
but
the the thing that i can guarantee you
is that putin's about to embarrass the
united states
you want to take that bat i wouldn't
take that bat
he's getting ready to totally face the
united states like just totally
embarrass us and it's gonna probably
happen in the next couple days
just watch what happens
all right
um
so that's all fishy as hell
here's my problem with well one of my
many problems with the
coven mandates
correct me if i'm wrong give me a fact
check on this true or false
all of the mandates in place for masks
and vaccines
were created during the last war
meaning the war against
delta were there any mandates that were
put in place maybe a few
after
after we knew that omicron was 99.5
percent of infections new infections
so here's all i would ask
it is not irrational for the government
to say
um we're just continuing you know
continuing things because they work
because they do have that argument they
can they can make that argument we'll
talk about alex berns in a minute but
here's what i would ask for a good
government
as a citizen so this is just a citizen
request
so as a citizen of the united states
i assert the following
preference
that because we're in the new war
our government needs to make a new
argument
the government needs to start from
scratch and say imagine there were no
mandates
would we put them in
place because that's the problem with
the thinking right now right now we've
drifted into where we are
and we've gone from one kind of war to a
completely different war omicron's just
a whole different war
our government
doesn't necessarily need to change what
it's doing this is an important point
i'm not saying that i'm so smart that i
you that you need to change what you're
doing i'm telling you that you need to
renew your argument as if you had never
made one
because it's a new war
you don't get to slide us from war to
war under some continuation theory
am i right
if you start a war with albonia
and the united states public is in favor
of it that did not give you authority to
start war with another country
if we approve if we approve let's say by
our actions not necessarily by vote but
if but if the public approves by public
opinion a war against albonia
that is all we've approved we did not
approve
war
right nobody approved war
we approved war against albonia you need
to ask us
in essence i mean not in an emergency
situation but over time you need to ask
the public are you okay with the second
war and if not we need to get the hell
out of there
this omicron war is a different war it's
a different country it's different
weapons it's different problem it's
different everything right it's enough
of a different problem
all i ask
is that the the government give us this
mental experiment
if there were no mandates today and the
only problem we had was our current
problem with omicron would they tell us
to have mandates
if they say yes
then at least they made the argument and
i think that's the responsibility you
could agree or disagree
but without the argument
there's no argument being made so i
think this is a gigantic failing of
leadership
you need to remake this argument it's
just convenient that they don't have to
we shouldn't let them off the hook
remake the argument from scratch
all right um
germany is uh noodling with the idea
of having compulsory vaccinations
well do you think that's going to happen
do you think that the german public or
actually the politicians will approve a
law
to have compulsory vaccinations in
germany
here's why i predict that that will not
happen
because if germany of all countries
decides to go full uh
you know if germany decides to go full
well you know
you know what i mean i don't have to
finish the census right
you never want to go full
you know each word
and in my view
germany just can't do it
i don't think they can do it no matter
what you think about the compliance of
the german public you know if you're
thinking historically how do they ever
agree to that and how do they ever agree
to that
well first of all we're probably totally
misinformed about what they did and did
not agree about in the public but
secondly
the
the weight of the holocaust is just
hangs over germany
to
to an extent
that i don't think they can
their brand can't handle this do you
know what i mean
their brand can't handle it
uh
you you're saying that austria already
did now germany is a different i think
germany is a different deal
so that's my prediction i can be wrong
i could definitely be wrong about that
but i'm going to put that prediction
meanwhile the netherlands has reopened
all sectors of society and they said
quote living even longer with many
restrictive measures would damage our
health and society health minister says
uh and yet another domino has lined up
now what is it that's happening in the
netherlands that's so different than
what's happening in
other western countries
it can't be that different right is the
netherlands basically just gonna be
florida now
it can't be that risky
so that dominoes might be lining up for
february 1st we'll see
the
i asked yesterday why don't we have a
vitamin d
test
that would give you an exclusion or or a
passport because we know that people
have high vitamin d
almost rarely have you know critical
problems with covid
um
and so
i was asking you know why don't we have
a vitamin test vitamin d test exclusion
if you wanted to not take the
vaccination for example
and
uh then i wondered if there are vitamin
d tests you can take it home
so i google it and turns out there are a
whole bunch of home tests for vitamin d
did you know that
but don't buy one unless you look at the
reviews
the reviews are pretty sketchy
uh i won't name names but at least one
of them
people were um there were a number of
cases where people got they tested it
with the home kit i won't mention the
brand but then they had a reason to get
it tested professionally an unrelated
reason and when they put when they
compared the professional
test to that home test they weren't in
close
like one was you're way below and one
was you're fine i mean they're not even
close so i don't know if people maybe
took the test wrong or maybe there's
some errors in the test or how accurate
they are
but i don't think you could trust
that they necessarily are accurate
yeah
so and yeah it's both expensive it's
like 100 bucks
and i i don't i don't think i would
necessarily believe it all right here's
something interesting from fox
bear is reporting if you're not familiar
with bret bear
don't lump him in with anybody else on
fox okay
so in order to listen to this story and
and judge it effectively
just know that bret bear is not an
opinion person he's a news person highly
respected
so if he gives you the news you can be
sure that he's not spinning it
you know everybody could have a mistake
but
um
he's a straight shooter so you need to
know that even
for this context so here's some of the
things he's reporting
fauci was told on january 22 27 in 2020
that his niaid
i guess that's some group he had control
over or was involved with
had been indirectly funding the wuhan
lab through the eco health a us-based
scientific nonprofit so on january 27th
fauci already knew
that money he had some say about had
indirectly gone to the lab
now how would you feel about fouchy
if he told you that directly
oh yes we funded something called eco
health and it does look like they in
turn funded some work at the wuhan lab
but we didn't you know we didn't know
that that was going to happen
wouldn't you feel really different about
him
i feel like his denial was so weasel-ish
as in no no we didn't fund the lab we
only funded the entity the funded lab
doesn't feel like
he just acted like a criminal
because i if i heard this story
you know let's say it happened to me
let's say i was fouchy i don't know why
i wouldn't just tell you
if i just said you know this is one of
the risks of funding
you can give the funding to one entity
but once they have the money you don't
have full control of what happens to it
after that point this was definitely
something we wish hadn't happened
i mean i feel like he could have been
pretty much in the clear
all he had to do was say you know this
is a widespread problem in funding
you know you you make your best you make
your best judgment but then you don't
always know where it's going to end up
that's true and in this case that might
have been a problem
if he had just said that i would have
been fine with it
would you
would you have been fine with that i
mean you we all would have said you
should have checked
you should have checked harder but you
would have kind of understood
that that's not an easily checkable
thing
right yeah you could still be mad at him
but it wouldn't feel the same it would
feel completely different
um
so you know i could i could forgive a
mistake especially one like that where
there's an indirect thing that maybe you
didn't see coming
but the lying or the weaseling i guess
wouldn't be lying so much as weasling is
tough to take all right then also within
the
bret bear reporting
on january 31st a few days later dr
christian uh
anderson a noted virologist at the
scripps lab
privately told fauci
that after talking to his other experts
he said that the virus looked possibly
engineered
and the quote genome is inconsistent
with expectations from evolutionary
theory
and needed to be looked into blah blah
so as early as
january 31st fauci had expert opinion
expert opinion
that it was
possibly engineered
and i think more than possibly as in
looks engineered
right which is not confirmed i think
rather than saying possibly engineered
maybe it would have been closer to say
it looks engineered because it has
things which are inconsistent with
evolutionary theory which is different
from saying it is it just it looks like
it
um hours later
according to the same reporting fauci
hastily organized the call with dozens
of worldwide virologists
and he suppressed suspicions of the lag
lab leak
and possible chinese government
involvement
and then in the meeting that was hastily
called later
the then national institute of health
director francis collins
was concerned that quote science and
international harmony could be harmed
and accusations of china's involvement
could distract top researchers
and there it is
so that's the whole story
this is one of those times where you
rarely get like the whole story
you know usually you're just
confused but i think this brett bear
reporting
i feel as if that's the whole story
like it's all explained there
now you could criticize their decisions
and and i have
but
is it is it crazy
is it crazy for francis collins to have
thought remember this is the beginning
of the pandemic
and what mattered most
in the beginning of the pandemic is that
we save lives
and that was number one right
number number one wasn't
um
you know
get back in china or something
so i'm not sure he made the wrong
decision i hate it
i hate it don't you
when you hear this don't you hate
that francis collins said let's leave
that out of this for now because we
don't want to get china angry
i hate that
i mean i hate it i hate it i hate it i
hate it
but
was it irresponsible
not necessarily
i hate it
but it wasn't necessarily irresponsible
i might have played it differently
you might have played it differently and
i might have liked that better
but
he did have a reason
he did have a reason
you know what i mean
so i have a different opinion about
people who can offer a reason
like like we're not offering a reason
with ukraine right
that's the problem the problem isn't
that i disagree with the reason it's
like you haven't given us a reason how
about offering a reason
so
i hate it but
he did every reason
all right
so i feel like we know the whole story
there uh fouchy's money did get to the
lab they did have a suspicion about it
early on
um
that's the whole timeline i i feel like
this is one of the i feel like this is a
mystery solved
do you
i feel like we're done with that
question that feels like the whole thing
just was laid out that they they did
suppress some information because it
wasn't confirmed which is actually a
pretty good reason
pretty good reason if it's not confirmed
all right
rasmussen has a poll that says if russia
attacked ukraine
should u.s combat troops
be sent to help defend ukraine
31
said yes
what
what
hold on it gets worse
36 percent said no
33 percent
said not sure
if you add the not sure to the yeses
64 percent of respondents
could not give a firm
no to putting troops on the ground in
ukraine
what
now this 33 percent are the people not
sure how hard would it be to make them
sure
as soon as we as soon as the president
any president says we're going to war
what happens to the undecideds
they become decided
pretty quickly
this 33 when you compare it to the 31
who are already apparently out of yes
you could easily get a majority
you can imagine that in one week
let's say something happened you know
and it could be a false slag attack
something
the public is literally primed for war
the american public is primed for war
they're ready to be convinced
oh my god they're ready to be convinced
it's just like ah talk me into it i'm
open to it
oh my god
oh my god
and you know my best interpretation of
this is that americans are just war-like
i think we're just a war-like people i
mean that's not a big surprise
but when you see it in numbers this is
just shocking
that we would be
so open to the possibility
of sending our young people to die for
nothing
for nothing
wow
wow
that one blew my mind
wow
so uh rasmussen also asked people to
rate biden's handling of russia
30 and said it was either excellent or
good and 50 said it's poor
so at the same time the 50 say biden is
handling the russia situation poorly
a third of the public is willing to go
to war
behind the president that 50 percent
don't think he's even handling it right
this is
you have to be so primed for war
that i mean it's just amazing that this
isn't zero
um
here's a statistic
uh i saw from kyle becker on
twitter
now if you don't file follow kyle becker
you should
he's a real strong tweeter
and he often has scoops
which is the best reason to follow him
actually
and but i haven't seen the fact i did a
fact check on this can somebody check
this he tweeted today that state level
data
shows that 80 to 90 percent of americans
already had a coveted infection and
survived 80 to 90 percent as state level
data
now i i tried to google that and
couldn't find it is that true
that doesn't sound true
does anybody have a link that would
support that claim that 80 to 90 of
americans already had a covet infection
that doesn't sound true
the the only reason i would even
uh retweet it
which i did is just because it came from
kyle becker
who who i you know i've been following
for long enough to know
that his his stuff is pretty solid
how would they know the way you would
know is you would test a random sample
of people
uh who had not been necessarily admitted
to the hospital just a random sample
and just find out what a random sample
if 90 of a random sample had
immunity
then you could you know extend it to the
population
weinstein uh interviewed uh who kyle
becker
or the guy who's the guy
anyway uh i don't oh here we go is there
a link
all right somebody just gave me a link
let me just open this and see what it
says
okay that link is
bad link
here's an element uh one and three
in august it was one in three
all right well if you see if you see a
link to that send it to me because if
that were true
then
i mean that would tell us something all
right alex berenson making some news as
you know alex berenson's sort of a
anti-coveted vaccination guy
anti-mandate guy
and he got kicked off at twitter for
allegedly saying things that weren't
medically true he would argue that case
i'm sure
but he was on tucker
and he was
he also has a subset article i'll talk
about in a minute
but here's his statement that got a lot
of press he said the mrna
coven vaccines
need to be withdrawn from the market wow
that's a pretty strong statement he says
this l experiments and says no one
should get them no one should get
boosted no one should get double boosted
they are a dangerous and ineffective
product at this point
my only problem with that statement is
that all the data says the opposite
now when i say all the data says the
opposite what i mean is all the data
i've seen
i haven't seen any data that says
that the vaccinations don't work against
omicron have you
yeah somebody says
all the data says it's effective
100 of it
anything that you think says is
ineffective against omicron
you're looking at just fake data or
reading wrong or misinterpreting it or
something so we'll get into the actual
details of that but uh just know that uh
there's nobody who's good at data who
thinks that's true
now it is true
that omicron
the infection rate seems to be unrelated
to the vaccination so would you agree
that the infection rate
doesn't seem to be affected by the
vaccination
it doesn't seem to be but in terms of
death
in terms of death
all of the data says that omicron people
survive better with a vaccination
if you've seen different data
you probably have not seen real data
i'm not planning to get the booster
all right
yeah
so we don't trust any data pro or con
i'm just saying that that the only
people i know who know how to look at
data
send me data that says that it works for
a while to keep you alive
now i don't think that that's
necessarily reason enough
to have a mandate
so i'm anti-mandate
right
so um i would argue that everyone who
believes eric berenson when he says that
we know that the vaccinations do not
work against omicron that is 100
false
according to 100 of the data
that's my statement
that there is no data that supports it
and in fact when he makes a claim he
doesn't show any data
which should be a tell right there
so look at look at my tweet if you want
to see uh the counter arguments look at
my tweet
um
today about his statements you'll see in
the comments the fact checks just rip
them apart and you can make your own
judgment now here's the problem with the
alex berenson
trap
alex berenson is now so identified
with saying that the vaccines are going
to make it worse not better that he
wouldn't be able to see anything that
said the opposite
because that's how our minds are wired
it has nothing to do with alex himself
if you put any person in the situation
he's in
they would become cognitively blind
to any data that didn't agree with them
because there's too much
they've got too much invested in this
in this point of view
so however credible he was toward the
beginning
your assumption of his credibility
should now be dialed down to zero
even if he's right
even if he's right
does that make sense to you that even if
he's right
your assumption of his credibility
should be dialed back to zero
because he's now putting himself in a
position where he can't tell you the
truth
he can't
well i'm sorry
that's a
that is incorrect he could tell you the
truth if it coincidentally was what he
believed to be true
if it's the other way if if the data
started showing that everything he said
it was wrong he couldn't tell you that
nobody could nobody
nobody in his situation could possibly
change their mind it's just too hard you
know we're we're
we're humans we're not robots you put a
human in that situation and he's going
to turn into alex berenson every time
right
so
whether or not alice berenson is correct
or incorrect your opinion of his
credibility at this point
which is different from the beginning
at the beginning i think you should
listen to everybody
but at this point
he cannot be considered credible
do you know who else i'd put in that
same category
dr malone and dr mcauliffe
same problem now they they have at least
expert credentials so that's better but
at this point
they would all be cognitively blind to
any data that disproves their
their point of view
so you should listen to all their
arguments and definitely look at any
links that they show but also look at
the counter argument
so who is credible that's exactly the
right question
who is credible is anybody who can
change their mind
and anybody who's smart enough to
look at the data
so
um
somebody said dr drew as as an example i
would say dr drew would be a perfect
example
of someone who has a track record
of being able to look at the data and
say oh the data changed so i changed my
mind
right now i can do it but you shouldn't
take me as credible
because i probably have too much stake
in it
all right
so i'm not sure you should take me as
credible but i am a person who can
change my mind based on the data
bill maher is a person who could change
his mind based on the data but i
wouldn't take him as credible because
he's an entertainer he's not a doctor
same as me
so you do have a real problem
but i would say at the minimum the
minimum is you've got to find somebody
who's capable of changing their mind
somebody who isn't so invested in their
point of view that they can't say whoops
i guess i killed a bunch of people with
my bad advice
all right
so here are some things that alex
bernsen says and you can decide if
they're true he says number one now keep
in mind
i'm not saying any of this is true
this is alex berenson so we're just
judging his credibility right number one
both the within country and between
country data show that people who are
vaccinated
but not boosted are at higher risk of
omicron infection than the unvaccinated
he says anyone who says otherwise is
lying i say otherwise
i say otherwise
so according to
to him i would be lying
i believe there is zero data to back up
that point and he doesn't offer any
if you're going to make a point that
it's clear
you kind of need to show your work there
don't you don't you need a link don't
you need to show a study
something
all right so some of you thinking that
that's accurate right
so some of you think it's accurate that
uh the data shows that the vaccinated
are a higher risk of omicron than the
unvaccinated
i don't have to do a bit of research to
know that's not
true i don't have to do any
i i'm going to say with no research
whatsoever that's not true
that's not true and you know i'm sure it
wouldn't take you more than a minute to
find the debunk of that
so i would cause that ridiculous on face
value
let me ask you what are the odds
that the vaccination makes omicron worse
but the boosters make it better
so he's saying that if you get the
vaccination that makes it worse but if
you get the vaccination plus the booster
it makes it better
really
does that make sense to you
i mean maybe as far as anything's
possible
yeah i know the ade and blah blah blah
but
there there's no evidence for that
at least available to the public
number two
uh he says thus based on his first point
thus vaccines will actually make
hospitalization or death from omicron
more likely
now let's take israel as an example
as you know israel is super vaccinated
and boosted they're vaccinated and
boosted and their hospitalization is
going through the roof
correct
and there are number of infections going
through the roof
correct
well that's what omicron does
so everybody's infection rates are going
through the roof so israel would be
similar
um what is their death rate
well
fortunately their death rate is still
under control
because they're so vaccinated
and apparently that works
um scott is confused and jab biased all
right you idiot andrew we're
gonna get rid of you for being uh a
completely unwoke idiot
who just wants to imagine you can read
my mind incorrectly
goodbye you are banned for eternity
um
and
we have no way of knowing
how things above number three is unclear
whether the vaccines interfere with the
development of long-term post-infection
immunity and people who are infected
anyone who says otherwise is lying well
almost everything is unclear
it's it's easy to make a case that
things are unclear i guess that's always
true but it's not true that the opposite
is true
he says it is clear that a third vaccine
dose temporarily reduces the risk of
serious illness so he admits that
boosting temporarily reduces omicron
deaths
but is unclear how long that protection
will last
that's not a point
if it lasts long enough to get through
the hospitalization surge that's all we
need um
and he's saying it's unclear whether
boosters will make you more or less
vulnerable
well it might be unclear in the sense
that it hasn't been tested like most
things have not been tested
but
um i would say that uh his take on this
is so obviously
um based on
[Music]
let's say where he's at in life at this
point
that uh
scott is fake news on this lol
let me let me uh let me make a challenge
for you okay
some of you believe that there's
evidence proving that alex berenson is
correct in these assertions
send me a link
i'll tweet the link it asks for some
fact check and then you can look you can
look at the data that you believe is
convincing
and then just look at the the fact check
and then decide
if you can look at the data and also
look at the fact check and still believe
the data
that tells you you know clearly that
these risks are what alex bernsen says
let me know
so so let me let me tell you that i'm
completely open to the argument
i'm completely open to the argument
because remember the argument is about
omicron
i don't have a vested uh
so i don't have a stake in the ground on
omicron and vaccinations can somebody
give me a confirmation on that
those of you who've watched me long
enough
would you say it's true or not true
that scott well let me ask in a better
better way
just confirm that what i'm saying is
true that i don't have any opinion out
about vaccinations and omicron i've
simply told you what data i've seen
right
so i have not told you to get vaccinated
i've not told you to get a mandate
i've not told you what to do
or any recommendation whatsoever
so if it turned out that alex was right
on the omicron part of it and that
against my common sense and everything i
think i know
if i were surprised
and if and i think this is deeply
unlikely
that the boosters or the that the
vaccinations made it worse
for omicron if that turned out to be
right i think i could easily say that
would you think so
do you think if the data
let's say the data started to really
show that that were the case do you
think i'd have a problem saying that in
public
i'm actually curious because i don't
know if you think i could
i think that that would not be
in my opinion that would not conflict
with anything i had already said
and therefore i should not have any
obstacle to do it because remember what
i like to do here more than more than
anything really what i like to do in
these live streams is to show how we've
all been fooled
so if i could show you a perfect example
of how i had been fooled
especially since you've seen all my
thinking on it if i could be that fooled
i i'd really like to know that
and i would love to tell you
i would i would absolutely love
to tell you how wrong i was i would find
enjoyment in that and it would be useful
because then maybe you'd learn how to
avoid it next time
so
my stake in the ground is that being
wrong actually works for me
right because it makes us smarter
we can do better things we can live
longer all that stuff
so
my reputation does not require that
vaccines work or not work
my reputation doesn't require that
uh scott explain your vaccine plus
booster worked for you in all caps i'm
just going to block you
for asking that in all caps
big bird see ya
the question didn't make sense but you
shouted it at me so
oops
so i'm going to remove you
um
you're still shouting all right
good you're gone
um i should go on tim cast
oh um i forgot to say that the the
israel infection rate
is also coinciding with a mass increase
in testing so anybody who's doing a lot
more testing is going to have a lot more
vaccination a lot more infections
oops
i might have to run like really soon
hold on a second i'm gonna see if i'm
gonna be driving
oh i am gonna run
bye for now
