foreign
good morning everybody
and welcome to what will be no doubt one
of the highlights of your life is called
coffee with Scott Adams or cwsa
I encourage you all of you to say cwsa
from now on because it saves you some
words
and I would encourage you to hit that if
you're on YouTube hit that little
subscribe button I never tell you to do
that because it's so annoying
so I'll just ask you once hit that
subscribe button
because apparently that makes a big
difference now would you like to take
your experience up to
I don't know ludicrous levels
for example yeah yeah you do and all you
need to do that is a cover mug or a
glass of tank which also sign okay
canteen took a flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine the hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
is called the simultaneous hip and it's
coming at you right now go
oh
yep so good
that'll make you slide off your chair
well
here's a question that you can think of
while I'm looking for this thing that
I'm going to show you
so this is a question from Machiavelli's
underbelly I quote I quote his account a
lot
and he asked this today why do you
believe that you're made out of
something different than your
imagination
in your imagination let's say dreaming
as a good example of imagination you
have complete worlds
and then in your dreams you can touch
things can you
doesn't everything have weight
when you're dreaming if you touch
something in your dream it feels solid
right
so why do you think you made of
something different than your dream
there's no reason to think so
there's no reason
but that's not what I wanted to show you
I promise you that I would take care of
the
scourge of ESG
and I am a cartoonist on my word and so
today we begin a series
on ESG
and the first in the series will be dog
burp who has been hired actually the the
ESG thing I'm going to hit in a
different a few different ways so
there'll be some gaps it won't be
continuous
but in today's comic
you can see Dave the new new character
now if you don't know the new Dave
character in The Dilbert comic Dave is a
black employee
give you a little close up there
he's a black employee who's the joke the
running joke is that he's a prankster
and although he is obviously black he
identifies as white because he's just
pranking his his boss anyway so that's
the the context but dogberg says to him
uh says to Dave he says Dave your boss
hired me to solve all of his problems by
renaming stuff does that sound familiar
solve all your problems by just renaming
them
and that dogberg goes on he says I
realize you identify as white just to
prank him but he asked me to rename you
as black so he can reach his ESG goals
and then Dave says you are a worthy
opponent but I can change my identity as
often as I want then Dogma says I get
paid by the hour
now this takes some explaining
takes some explaining the first thing
you have to know is
is it weird to you that I didn't Define
ESG
does that stick out to you did you say
to yourself how many people are even
going to read this comic and know what
ESG means
well first of all they don't need to
it's written
it is written so that um you can still
get the joke without knowing what yes
she reads but
I intentionally don't Define it
because once it appears in a Dilbert
comic and there are court cases that
have actually confirmed this it's
generally considered a common knowledge
so I'm sort of gaming the system is
literally true that court cases have
looked at Dilbert comic strips to
determine what is common knowledge
because if it's in a comic strip in a
newspaper and it's not defined
then the argument is well if he didn't
have to Define it in a mass media it
means it's a common knowledge
there was actually a year 2000 case that
was based on that somebody somebody
claimed they didn't know
the year 2000 would have some technical
bugs involved with it
and the prosecution said it's impossible
that you didn't know that because it's
common knowledge it's even in the
Dilbert comic which it was
um so here's the first cartoonist trick
I like to give you a little uh
persuasion and marketing tips as I go
by not defining it what Behavior did I
cause
by not defining ESG what Behavior did I
cause
curiosity
right if you can Inspire somebody's
curiosity well you have them
and basically if I could make you
curious
I own you
[Laughter]
because you're going to stick around
you're going to find out
like what's the answer to the mystery so
the first thing is a little uh
a little curiosity about what that is
secondly some people will look it up
yeah they'll look it up for the first
time
now if you make somebody do something
physically with their body
such as go search for something else
what does that do
for your art
it binds them to you
it's a bonding exercise so if somebody
does something because of my cartoon and
then gets back to the cartoon and you
know creates more of a structure of
activity around it
than they have they have bonded with me
so as part of the strategy that
sometimes I don't explain things that
are entering the common use but aren't
quite there yet
um
so here the the idea was that if Dave
can change his identity as often as he
wants and dogbert is also getting paid
by the hour to rename stuff that they
have a standoff
and Dave will keep every
redefining himself and dogbert will keep
redefining his redefinition anyway as
long as Dogma gets paid by the hour he's
fine
all right um
a lot of people ask me
um why don't I move out of California
because we got all these problems we got
the heat wave going on we'll talk about
that in a moment we got all the crime in
the taxes and the immigration and stuff
like that
um do you know why I don't move does
anybody know why I don't move
let me tell you yesterday in my town it
was 112 degrees
and I call that a nicer day than Florida
have you ever gone outside in Florida in
the summer
on any day
[Laughter]
it's like it's like you're being punched
to death just walking outside
do you know how often how many days a
year it's unpleasant to walk outside
where I live
hardly any
hardly any at 112 degrees it didn't stop
me from doing anything
at 112 degrees I just did my outdoor
stuff early in the morning yeah it was
around 75.
and then I go swimming at night
I do all my errands I mean it's just the
same no difference at all so at 112
degrees because I don't have humidity
it's not that bad I mean it's noteworthy
you don't want to hang around in it but
it's no big deal
now
you also hear a lot about San Francisco
and la and the the homeless people and
all that stuff right so you say to
yourself how can you live with all that
crime and homelessness and and needles
on the street to which I say there's
nothing like that around where I live
that that is less than you know one
percent of one percent of the total land
mass of California has anything bad
happening on it
99.99 of all of California this enormous
state
it's kind of Awesome
it's kind of awesome
the view is good you know traffic is a
little hard traffic is hard in the
metropolitan areas but you can stay away
from them yeah just tell Amazon to bring
you your stuff if you need it
so if you're wondering what's the
mystery of why people stay in California
they're definitely moving out of the
Cities because the cities are mismanaged
but where I live the population is
growing
where I live there are way more people
moving in the value of my the real
estate here zoomed during the pandemic
because people were moving out of the
city and into my neighborhood so I have
the place that you move to not the place
you move out of
if you lived in San Francisco
that's the place you move out of if you
lived in LA
depending on the area that's the place
you'd move out of but you moved to my
neighborhood it's a big place you'd like
it you really would
so so yesterday
um I got a text I forget what it was it
was in the early evening and it was a
text from the state saying that we're
going to run out of electricity any
moment unless you turn down your use of
electricity like right now and for the
next several hours
what did I do
the moment I got a text it says you
might lose your power completely if you
don't you raise your temperature on your
thermostat and stop your usage what did
I do immediately
do you think I did nothing out of
protest
or did I immediately turn down my
appliances
I walked directly to my appliances and I
altered them all
turned off lights closed doors at you
know AC zones kept my office and my
in my bedroom at a reasonable
temperature
because I use them and other things I
just you know turned off the AC and let
it drift up because my house is well
insulated so it doesn't get above 80
usually
now how did I feel about it
here's the interesting question let me
ask you how did I feel about that
what was my internal feeling when I had
to stop what I was doing and and turn
down turn up
the temperature
how do I feel
because remember I'm I tend to be a
cantankerous personality
I don't know sometimes I could be
cantankerous I tend to be you know
reflexively
against being told what to do
I do not like my government telling me
what to do
right let me tell you what I did I
immediately changed everything and I
felt really good about it
and then I woke up today and I read the
results
do you know what happened in California
last night
that text went out because we were
apparently they could measure when
you're getting right up to the limit of
your electrical usage
we we got right up to the Limit I think
we were using 45 whatever and 50 was our
limit we got there and as soon as the
text went out
boom Drop Like a Rock
Drop Like a Rock
Californians just said what do we have
to do okay well that's better than
losing power
it was easy not only did I do it I felt
okay about it now today I woke up to
lots of criticism
a lot of criticism
I guess some people thought I shouldn't
have done that
now the problem is how we got to this
point the problem is not what I did
yesterday
what I did yesterday is not terribly
relevant to you know Energy Management
in California
I'm just saying that
um here's here's what I was missing
here's what I was missing yeah the the
critics are going to say oh you sheep
you sheep you did what you were told
well let me tell you how it felt
it felt like a shared crisis
and I felt like I was pitching in
and I felt connected to the rest of
California no matter what their
political leading was
more connected
more connected to the people in
California than any time in the past
well maybe since I've lived here no
actually one other time there was one
other time Californians were more
um
more coordinated and on board with each
other
it was the big earthquake what was the
year
do you remember the big earthquake that
whacked everything
when the big earthquake hit I was out
here in California
80.
89 when was it late 80s
that's when the freeways collapsed you
know I was I was like I was one exit
away from the freeway that collapsed
now as it turns out I wouldn't have been
on it but I was that close to a pretty
big disaster like as it happened like I
was right there I was just not under it
luckily
um
have you noticed if you follow the news
and you're following the imaginary Civil
War that we're supposed to be in
the imaginary Civil War makes you
imagine that you're at each other's
throats because on Twitter it looks that
way if you follow the news it looks that
way
but the moment
the moment
I got a text from my state
that said if you don't all band together
you're all
abandoned together
abandoned together because you know what
I don't want to be all and I
don't want the other people to I
probably would have been fine because my
house my house was designed to withstand
the power outage it was it was designed
for that purpose so my house was
designed to be Fireproof
uh water shortage proof because I have
burned well
and energy loss proof it's not as loss
proof as it could be but it's designed
so that the temperature will never be
too high or too low just because my
insulation is so powerful
so it wouldn't have been a big deal to
me if the power had gone out I just
would have literally I would have gone
out and
going swimming
if my power went out I would have said
oh okay I would have walked outside and
just got my pool
that's it that would have been my entire
suffering for the night so I didn't need
to do it I didn't need to turn off my
power I didn't need to change it at all
but the fact that I woke up in the
morning and found out that apparently
the whole state
in some kind of lockstep fashion said I
could do that that that is completely
reasonable
now it's not reasonable that we got to
this point don't take me wrong don't get
me wrong it is not reasonable that we
had to do this
but once we're here
I'm not going to let I'm not going to
let my fellow Californians you know die
am I going to let a Californian die
because I didn't change my temperature a
little bit and go swimming
really so it was the smallest the
smallest little effort on my part but
here's the here's the thing it really
reminded me
that we don't have a common enemy
and we kind of need one don't we the so
you know the United States hasn't had a
common enemy for a while not a real one
so we divided into these two teams so
we'd have the way to still fight well at
least we'll fight with each other until
we get a common enemy but the moment I
got that text
that was a common enemy
right the temperature
was a common enemy of everybody in
California at the same time and as soon
as we saw that common enemy how much did
we care about politics
zero zero it was the most pure moment
of the last five years it was the purest
moment of being a human
in the world
oh I have to do this to save my fellow
humans
um I'm in no problem
so it was actually kind of a magical
moment yeah I know that I'm going to get
criticism for being a sheep and blah
blah blah why do you live in California
blah blah I live here because your state
sucks compared to where I live let me be
honest
where I live is great
even in California
even in California it's great
is way better than where you live most
of the year
now I get that where you live is awesome
for you know when the leaves change
I get that where you live is amazing for
like a month or two in the spring
but if you want to have pretty good
weather all year you're going to come
where I live right where I live you
don't die because you went Outdoors
except for three days this year I guess
you would die if you went Outdoors too
long
all right so um
uh oh here's here's the other thing
do you know what I haven't heard at all
for the last uh I don't know two days
I haven't heard anybody complain about
uh climate change not being real
now again I'm not talking about the fact
of it we're not talking about the
science of it I'm not even arguing
climate change
I'm just saying that we're so anecdote
driven
that it is it would have been impossible
to be in California yesterday walk
outdoors and doubt climate change
now do I understand that a few days of
hot weather don't mean anything yes I do
yes I do I completely understand that a
few days of hot temperature in
California don't mean anything it
doesn't mean the models are correct it
doesn't mean you're going to burn up
doesn't mean anything
but
even as much as my rational brain says
that doesn't mean anything that's just a
few days of extra hot weather I'll bet
we've had those in the past
but when you walk Outdoors the first
thing you think is oh this is real
the the the anecdotal uh persuasiveness
is so high when it's 110 degrees
that even though your your conscious
brain is saying don't believe it don't
believe your sentences because they're
you know they're not reliable compared
to science not compared to data don't
believe your senses I know it's hotter
than you've ever felt it before don't
believe that that's just an anecdote
it's not useful data
and then you walk outside and you feel
it
and as soon as that Sun hits your skin
and you've never felt anything like it
like there are a lot of people yesterday
in California probably a lot I'll bet
there were millions of people yesterday
who had never felt that hot in their
life
walking Outdoors
don't you think at 110 there's a lot of
people who felt that for the first time
I'll bet every one of those people who
have felt that for the first time
just decided that climate change is real
let me remind you of my personal opinion
on climate change
which is that I think the basic science
is real
that's the most reliable part the basic
science meaning that all things being
equal if you added CO2 to the air it
should heat up
because that's just basic science but
as Jordan Peterson pointed out recently
there's so many variables that the
models are basically useless
and I will add to that
given that AI will be I think reaching
the singularity within three years
any prediction about humankind after
three years from now is just nonsense
complete nonsense it's entirely possible
that AI will solve climate change in
four years
solving it in that context would mean
developing a plan that was not obvious
to us but once you see it you say oh
 that would work it turns out you
just figured out how to make fusion
which could happen you know the the AI
is actually a big part of the advanced
um the advanced nuclear designs if you
have ai you can quickly adjust
your containment I guess I'm using the
wrong words but you can quickly
adjust your reaction would that be the
better way to say it somebody help me
out with the technical words but if
you're using Ai and you're very rapidly
adjusting your situation to maintain
your I don't know the reaction or
maintain the safety of it whichever it
is you need AI to do that humans can't
do that
so so AI is actually a critical
technology for nuclear as it turns out
the new designs
all right so I don't know about you but
a lot of people are going to believe in
climate change who didn't believe it
before I do believe climate change is
real
and I do believe
that humans are part of it
and I do believe that we can't predict
it at all
but I don't mind that we Panic a little
bit because it does cause us to build
new Industries and stuff I don't think
we're making all the right decisions
case in point Michael schellenberger
notes today on Twitter that uh
scientists claim that the algae bloom in
the San Francisco Bay
which killed over ten thousand fish was
due to climate change so that was a
claim at one point that there was Ill
this algae that killed a bunch of fish
and it was climate change but now we
found out it's due to the failure of
local governments to upgrade the
Region's Antiquated sewage treatment
plants so it was actually just the
government failure of sewage treatment
that the scientists decided was a clear
sign of climate change
would everybody be okay with the
following statement of fact
whether regardless regardless of how
true climate change is as a risk and
regardless of what is true or false
about the the central nature of the
claim I think it's basically true
regardless of how true it is
do we agree that much of the evidence to
support it will be absolute
would you go with me then so you don't
have to agree with me whether the basic
science is correct you could disagree
with me in that but could we both agree
that whether the basic idea is correct
or not the evidence shown is so
bad
and I think it's because there's so many
people who are trying to make a living
right because you get your best
scientists who do their work and say hey
we got this problem
and then all the Lesser scientists need
to publish a paper too I got to do
something on climate change because
that's important and then you get these
lower level studies and lower level
hypotheses and suddenly the public
doesn't believe anything
right because because science at that
point is lying to us Non-Stop
and so those few true things just get
you know the good stuff gets thrown in
with the garbage and you think it's all
garbage I mean I think the the main
crime against
um conservatives and Republicans and
anybody who doubts climate risk
I think a crime has been committed
against that group because they were fed
so much that they don't believe
anything
they don't believe anything
and let me ask you this should they
should they if you had been fed as much
as conservatives and Republicans have
been fed for years
would you believe anything
and that's a big problem is it's a
crying wolf problem right so I think
this time this is a real risk
but if you tell me you don't believe it
because they lied to you so many times
in the past I'm going to say you know
you know that's not crazy
if if I say I think the vaccinations
might be a good idea but I can't tell
there's just no way for me to know
but you say
well I'm not going to risk it because
they lied to me so many times in the
past then I say that's not crazy
that's not crazy you might be right you
might be wrong but you're not crazy
you're definitely not crazy
by the way how hard would it be to run
for president and win
is it hard to show respect for an
opinion you don't hold
it's not that hard
I mean I feel like I'm doing it right
now right
I'm giving some respect to the other
side it's not that hard and I don't
think it took anything away from my
argument at all in theory it would make
it stronger
all right
um
I have an observation that some of you
will hate
that people who have completely
conquered their ego
look like people with huge egos
and you can't tell the difference
and the reason you can't tell the
difference is most of us have damaged
egos so we're just projecting
and let me give an example
when I hear people say that Trump has a
huge ego
I say but that is completely counter to
all the way AC Acts
because yes he does a lot of bragging
does a lot of bragging I get that part
but it's also like his job you know he's
literally a marketer brander who became
president and both of those jobs are
about exaggerating your
your qualities
so but here's the part that doesn't make
sense if he's protecting his ego do you
think he would act the way he acts if
that was his main concern
do you think that Trump doesn't know
what way to act
for people to like him and respect him
the most
because I think he does
you think he doesn't all right well then
let me we we'd be guessing about him and
we can't read his mind so I'm going to
take you out of the guessing Zone and
put you into my own head
have you ever seen me say things
sort of a rhetorical question here have
you ever seen me say things that you
said oh my God that's sounded pretty
arrogant and a little more certain than
he should have been and he's got a big
ego there have you ever heard anything
that made you say that whoa we're
certainly interpreting that as Scott has
a big ego
right you've all seen me do it now
here's the question
do you think I wasn't aware
of how I would sound
in any situation in which I've acted
arrogant or egotistical to you if that
was your opinion do you think that that
I was unaware how I would be received
of course not
it's not rocket science
it's not it's obvious I know exactly how
I'm being received so why do I choose to
do it
why would I choose to do something in
which I know easily I know I it will not
be well received I will be mocked and
people have a lower opinion of me for it
why do I do it
we're yeah we're narcissism why do I do
it if I know people are going to have a
negative feeling about it why do I do it
hahaha
yeah sometimes it's for a fact that's
correct
sometimes it's for energy that's part of
for a fact but here's the thing I
couldn't do it
if I had an unhealthy relationship with
my ego
I don't think any of it's true
if I tell you something awesome about me
I don't think it's true
so you the thing that you can't tell is
what I think is true
so if I tell you
um
I don't know that I'm right about
something
I don't know if I'm true I mean I don't
know if it's true
it would just be an opinion
so
I would uh I would ask you to look for
this if you're trying to figure out is
somebody really their ego is out of
control versus they've completely
conquered it to the point where it's
just not part of their decision making
look for people doing things that they
clearly know would not be good for them
and then you know it's just for effect
right they're trying to accomplish
something
all right um
so in the uh whilst Wall Street no
Washington Post
had a editorial saying that the GOP
wants to be the education party
and I think it was encouraging the
Democrats to fight back against that now
my comment was that branding the
Republicans as the education party
is pretty good
it's not bad what do you think of that
the education party
yes or no does that sound persuasive to
you
do you think you could get any extra
votes with that
um
yeah here's my suggestion the parent
party is a better persuasion
if you say you're the education party
then Democrats say how can you be the
education party you don't even believe
in climate science
it's just too easy
as soon as as soon as you say we're the
ones who will educate you the other side
has plenty of ammunition plenty of
ammunition
but
if you say we backed parents
you have it all
the the parent party is The High Ground
education party is a low ground
the low ground fight you might win you
might not but it's a fight
The High Ground you're just going to win
the whole point of The High Ground is it
always wins and you can tell it in
advance as soon as you see it you say oh
okay that always wins
now the only thing that would beat that
High Ground is what's the one form of
persuasion that beats The High Ground
there's only one
what's the only way they can beat The
High Ground
fear
fear and that's what Biden's doing
is using fear persuasion and he's using
it brilliantly I would say
he's killing it right he's not the most
capable of person at the moment but on
this one you know narrow mission of
demonizing one side he's killing it he
really is it's all we're talking about
it's in the headlines it's dividing the
country people are talking about a civil
war
is working
now I'm not saying that means he gets
more votes but has he scared part of the
part of his base yeah yeah it's totally
working
so
um it was a poll in the Trafalgar group
they did a poll and they said that found
that about 57 percent of the likely
General voters said that Biden speech uh
calling Mega Republicans extremists
represents a dangerous escalation in
rhetoric
and of course Independence were even
more sure that it was a dangerous
escalation and a rhetoric
now
um I was asked is that a persuasion fail
if the public doesn't like it
so the public is saying hey Biden you're
you're ginning up all this conflict and
hatred and that's opposite of what you
said you do
so therefore is it a persuasion fail
there's a failure that he's doing the
opposite of what he said he'd do and
he's doing it as hard as you could do it
opposite of what he said he'd do that
everybody knows and he's doing it as
hard as possible is that good or bad for
Biden
what did I tell you about fear
persuasion
it's just really strong
it works
yeah this works he's killing it right
now
I think it's completely working now you
might say to me but wait if everybody
knows he's using this trick and and
everybody knows they don't want a
divided country
how could this possibly be working if
people are saying we see your trick and
we hate it stop doing that trick we hate
it we see it we see exactly what you're
doing don't do that anymore
it doesn't make any difference
the only thing that matters is he did he
succeed in making you afraid
that's all that will matter they won't
vote for something else
[Music]
the Republican just like always and he
always has to move two percent people or
make two percent of people stay home
that's all and does he have a fear of
persuasion that would get that done he
does
it that's not a prediction
I'm saying he's using a tool that is
appropriate to the job
does he succeed we'll see but he's using
the right tool if you have no ethical
Center whatsoever and I think in
politics you can assume that
all right
um Hillary Clinton is weighing in on her
emails here's the claim she made
so she tweeted that Comey admitted he
was wrong after he claimed I had
classified emails and she said Trump's
own State Department under two different
secretaries found I had no classified
emails
can you do me a fact check on that
how did I get to 2022
while thinking that there were
classified emails when she says there
were not and that it was proven
have I been fake news or is she lied
is she lied or is it fake news
but here's the interesting part
let's say I don't know if she's lying or
or not
but
um hasn't she just proven that that you
can be accused of having uh confidential
things when in fact you don't
didn't Hillary just give Trump his
defense
if you were going to weigh the possible
explanations for Trump having those
documents
what would you put the greatest odds on
that he what he meant to sell it sell
secrets
well let's say we're in a world where
nothing can be ruled out no matter how
horrible okay I'll give that a one
percent
how about he he had all those documents
only for the purpose of a biography
there was no other reason just for a
biography maybe I'll give that a solid
20 chance
that's not crazy I give it a 20 chance
anybody explains some of the documents
but on the other hand you don't really
need the original document you could
just tell the biographer what you want
him to know I don't know so no more than
20 for that one
the biggest possibility
oh then blackmail maybe there's some
stuff in there that Trump thought he
could hold as blackmail I'll give that
another 20 too
so but by far the biggest percent
is that there was some
misunderstanding about what Trump had
and had given back
and that it was more like a bureaucratic
who was in charge and who heard what and
was there an agreement about what was
confidential and what wasn't almost
certainly is going to be that
right and I think that uh Hillary has
basically
um bolstered Trump's defense
because if Hillary could be blamed in
her own mind here this is a fact check
but Hillary's claim is as she could be
blamed for having a bunch of classified
emails only to later find out none of it
was true
well in the context of trump it looks
like the same thing's going to happen
that he will be blamed of a bunch of
stuff and in the end you'll find out
well it was sort of a gray area or
wasn't true or totally out of context or
something yeah I think that's where it's
going to end up
um
so
I told you I was going to teach you how
to spot the latest Democrat hoax
if I told you the Democrats are working
with the media to develop their next
hoax what would you expect it would
include
number one it would include
a anonymous source
right if you're going to do a hoax you
need an anonymous source
that anonymous source would be reported
by
whom
either the New York Times or the
Washington Post because that's how you
get into a credible news-making entity
so it's going to be one of those and
then and then once the story comes out
it's going to lack detail right and it's
the lack of detail that allows
who Adam Schiff
and
um
uh swalwell Eric swalwell to tweet and
go on television and say well this
report from the anonymous source in the
Washington Post
uh if he did this and if he did that it
would be terrible
so
that's what you'd expect right that's
that's what it would look like and then
all the pundits would come on TV and and
support it
uh so that's exactly what's happening
so the latest is that there's a
Washington Post report
with a source that they won't tell us
anonymous source Washington Post
that shift and swallow are already
tweeting about
and it claims that um
some of those documents that were found
in mar-lago included
let's see included
foreign government something related to
foreign government defenses including
Nuclear So what what the report is is
that there's some at least some
information we don't know anything else
that might involve a foreign government
and their nuclear defense
so that sounds pretty bad doesn't it
like if you're just hearing that and
you're a let's say you're a low
information consumer of news and the
only thing you hear is the headlines
you'd be like oh shoot really Trump had
like the most sensitive of nuclear
defense secrets
all right let me give you an example of
what this could have included right
now it doesn't say that the information
about this alleged foreign government's
nuclear defense it doesn't say that this
is information
this brand new
right it doesn't say it's brand new it
also doesn't say it's useful
and it doesn't say it's dangerous
it could be all of those things could be
useful to somebody else could be
dangerous to America but it doesn't say
that
so remember what we don't know that's
important what we don't know
now let me give you an example of what
it could be
now I'm just making this up these are
just examples of what would be under
this umbrella
that you wouldn't necessarily have to
worry about
we believe that Iran is three years away
from having a nuclear weapon
number one
you know our intelligence agencies don't
have the capability to estimate that
because they're terrible at that right
it wouldn't mean anything
if they said three years or ten years I
would have the same amount of skepticism
because I think they're just guessing
anyway
suppose it said
um
Israel is unlikely to use nuclear
weapons
to attack Iran
how about that
you'd say to yourself oh that's just
sort of common sense but if it's in that
document then it's something about
another country's nuclear defense but it
would also be amazingly obvious
meaning that you know your own guess of
what would happen would be equal to the
cia's guess it wouldn't be much
difference right
so I can think of
um infinite number of examples in which
there could be a document that
legitimately talks about a foreign
government's nuclear defenses and yet
gives you no information whatsoever that
would have any value to an enemy
would would you agree with that
that if you looked at all the things it
could be whatever the specific topic is
99 of them are going to be completely
harmless
because most of them are just going to
be context
as in well you know France has a nuclear
Arsenal
blah blah blah blah blah blah
or you know if uh Iran builds their uh
let's say a domestic industrial domestic
nuclear power program
that that will give them the ability to
much faster develop nuclear weapons or
more of them
well that wouldn't be a secret
that would just be context
so
unless you know if there's something
like new secrets
in those documents you should assume
it's just context
so to to have a document that simply
references things about nuclear defense
I'm not even sure we know anything about
the nuclear defense of other countries I
mean maybe it says something like Russia
claims to have X number of nukes but we
think they have twice as many how would
that change your behavior
it wouldn't
it wouldn't and it wouldn't matter who
knew it it wouldn't matter who found it
so 99 of all the things that could be on
this document about a foreign country is
nuclear stuff is just innocent nothing
of no value to anybody
and any country that would have the
let's say willingness or need to know
probably already knows
yeah do you think there's something we
know that like France doesn't know
about another country is nuclear
capabilities probably not
all right
all right so then shifted his usual
thing new reporting this is a shift
tweet new reporting that Trump had
highly classified information including
on foreign nuclear programs
and he goes if true it raises you have
more questions see they have to do the
if true thing so today is If true time
now the other way to identify an obvious
Democrat media hoax is the timing
got a suspicious timing isn't it that
that the Mar-A-Lago document story
started getting boring
you know so there were no new news so it
started getting a little boring and
right on time
right right on time boom story to renew
it huh
how about that
so I'm going to call hoax on this one
everybody agree
yeah this has every every signal for
hoax in fact this one's just funny
because it's so obviously a hoax
so obviously hoax and I think it's funny
that we have been treated seriously
because this one this wouldn't say it's
the entire checklist right
am I wrong that you you could have made
this checklist in advance in fact we
could make the checklist for the next
one
we could do the next one make the
checklist Anonymous story Trump did
something bad followed by media hits
followed by swalwell and Schiff being
the only ones who are willing to destroy
their reputations claiming and
and the other part is that the
legitimate Democrats stay hidden
right so this is the phase of the hoax
where the legitimate Republicans the
ones who still have an ounce of
self-respect they're not doing what Adam
Schiff and swallow are doing they're not
getting ahead of the story like those
guys are they're saying um I'd like to
retain a little bit of credibility maybe
for later
so yeah this this one has just hoax
written all over it
well I guess Trump uh succeeded in
getting his quote special Master to look
into all those Mar-A-Lago documents
that'll slow things down I suppose he
wanted that but they're going to check
specifically for any attorney-client
privileged documents they're not going
to trust the FBI's look at them
and I guess he the nobody I think all
the smart people said that the special
Master would never be appointed because
it didn't make sense and then it
happened
and then people said oh that's because
that's a trump appointed judge Who was
appointed after he had already lost the
election so while he was already lame
ducking he appointed her and then she
repaid the favor is what the critics
would say
and I have to admit if if the if this
were the Democrats
I would have said the same thing I would
have said uh this looks like a little
too insideish
that the judge you appointed just
recently is the one that gives you the
ruling that was unlikely but went your
way
that's a little bit of a flag
so my guess is it's exactly what it
looks like
they got the friendliest judge they
could and they got a good result out of
it I don't know that it matters though
I don't know that matters they might
take a few documents out of the I don't
know potential
public disclosure domain or something
but I I don't know why they're doing
that exactly the special master
um I guess one day after Russia cut off
all the
the oil oil pipeline stuff was it oil no
natural gas
pipeline stuff
to Europe they signed a giant deal with
China's biggest petrol company
so Russia's going all in on China now do
you think that's bad for the United
States
that Russia and China are doing war
games together
and now they're tying their economic
Futures together is that good or bad for
the United States
is it good or bad for Russia
you know we're the the reason that we're
decoupling from China
is the reason this isn't good for Russia
do you know what Russia doesn't want
to be dependent on China
being dependent on Europe is one kind of
risk being dependent on China that's a
whole different deal now I do think that
Russia and China will continue playing
nice with each other but only because
they don't need a war you know two
superpowers with a shared border they're
going to play nice
but I don't think we should make too
much of the fact that Russia and China
are acting like friends because I don't
think China wants Russia to succeed
would you agree
I mean they want Russia to be uh just
successful enough that there's not a a
war or something that gets sparked by
poverty
but I don't think they want they don't
want Russia to succeed
so driving Putin into China's arms uh
should be seen as a huge loss for Putin
in in every way really
but I don't know if it'll be reported
that way
well I tweeted uh there was a guy named
Mark Wilson who had a tweet in which he
included a whole bunch of studies
showing that wearing masks Works a whole
bunch of studies
but to his credit he does put the caveat
that uh if you if the masks are not the
good ones
they don't work nearly as well and if
they're not fitted properly they don't
work nearly as well
and if you stayed in a room long enough
your mess probably wouldn't help you
yeah but for short encounters the
science that seems to say that there is
friction that reduces the amount of
virus even if you use the
crappy surgical masks
uh they're they're 10 times worse than
the n95s but they still make a big
difference according to all the studies
now
given that human beings do not wear
their masks correctly
um this does seem to completely support
the view I've had
which is
from an engineering perspective mask
wearing must make some difference
from a human experience probably not
because people just don't
don't take them seriously enough
everybody cheats with their masks let me
ask you this those of you who had kids
during the lockdowns
didn't your kids just play with the
other kids without masks as soon as
like almost right away
there was no real social distancing
among the kids
yeah I think there were like a few
families who locked up their kids for
the entire time but I think most of the
parents just said
just don't be in public
yeah just just don't make a big deal of
it but all the kids were still hanging
around
um just like always
I might I mean I had sleepovers Galore
during during the pandemic at my house
and nobody wore a mask nobody in my
house will wore a mask well maybe a few
vendors wore them or something
but basically
um and you know Christina was flying and
airports airports were Exempted from
masks
so I'd be sitting in my house my spouse
would go to a completely unmasked
um situation and she'd be there all day
long
with people with no masks and then would
come back
my kids would be playing you know step
kids would be playing with other kids
without masks all day long and then come
back into my house
there was no social distancing
not really it was all pretend because as
soon as people aren't watching nobody
did it
how many people invited their friends
over to their house and made them wear
masks while they're in your house
I mean some did sometimes but there was
there was so much flagrant ignoring of
the guidelines that you can't even say
that masks were they were barely
required it's almost like they weren't
even there in terms of effectiveness
so I think it can be true that if you
did a study you would see that it
reduced the virus but in the real world
everybody hates the mass so much that
they ignored them when they could and
probably didn't see much in the big
picture
so bannon's in trouble so he got
pardoned for this Federal
charges about that build the wall
charity thing that he had
and the allegations are that it was some
kind of a scam
so now the state of New York apparently
gets a shot at them and he can't be
pardoned for that not only because
Trump's not president because then there
would be a state problem not a federal
problem
does it feel like Republicans are being
hunted
Steve Bannon says he's being taken off
the board
because of the big elections coming
it doesn't feel like a coincidence does
it
just doesn't feel like a coincidence
do you ever think that maybe if somebody
is uh pardoned for federal offenses it
should include State offenses
I'm not sure I I love the idea of a
president pardoning somebody and then
the state Prosecuting them
that that feels like
oh there's just something wrong with the
system it's like pick one
either either don't have any pardons
or don't have a workaround so that you
can thwart the pardon
I don't know I I think I think pardons I
think a presidential pardon should be
applicable at the state level and local
level what do you think
otherwise
otherwise I feel like it's wasting the
Public's time and money
yeah and neither you could have a lively
debate about whether anybody should ever
be pardoned
like if there's ever a good reason for
that
but as long as we have it I think we
should use it in a more rational way
which is if the president of the United
States says for whatever reason remember
the whole point of the pardon is you
don't have to give a reason it's
whatever reason
I just don't think the states should
usurp
usurp the right to punish somebody once
the federal government said
no I don't know feels wrong to me
um
Britain's talking about now flattening
the curve of their electric use
and boy do people not like to hear that
term flatten the curve because that just
feels like another scam doesn't it it
just feels like oh God the wrong people
are in charge as soon as you hear that
flatten the curve no now the language
makes sense
it makes perfect sense what they're
trying to do
but
um yeah dear
what do you think about all this work
from home thing I saw an interesting
tweet from Jason Furman who said the
difference between economic research so
when you do research
it tends to show people enthusiastic
about working from home
but when he has CEOs who almost all hate
it you know there's a big difference so
somebody must be wrong is that the CEOs
are wrong
and and the employees should go work at
the office whereas the research that's
wrong that says that this work at home
thinks a pretty good deal
what do you think
what's wrong the research of the CEOs
here's what I think
I think it's hard to feel like you're
managing something if somebody's not
there in person
and you could argue that maybe there's
no management there at all
um another some some percentage of
people who work at home are just going
to take advantage of it right it's going
to be a pretty big percentage so some
people would just be working three jobs
and avoiding meetings and not returning
phone calls and
stuff so I'm sure it's completely good
or completely bad probably has more to
do with the individual I I would say
there are some people who are definitely
good work at home candidates and some
kinds of jobs and then there's a whole
bunch that aren't
so the CEOs I think I'm going to side
with the CEOs and Elon Musk would be at
the top of this list
for people who say if you're not
physically there
you're not really trying
the difference between you know being
there in person and being at your home
is so big
there are some jobs that doesn't make
any difference
but if you're trying to invent the
future
oh you got to be there right you got to
be there
I don't think there's a way around that
um have you heard of this term quiet
quitting which is all the rage now
quiet quitting have you even heard that
phrase it's in the business news now a
lot it has to do with
um employees who keep their job but they
don't do any extra work and they're not
engaged they're just collecting a
paycheck
right now
the news is acting like that's something
new
does that feel new
because they're acting like it's this
big Surge and people not caring about
their work
some of it's probably new uh here's
here's a little lesson on persuasion and
psychology too
if you make people drive to work
versus stay home
what is likely to happen what's
psychological phenomenon will happen if
you make somebody commute this ugly
commute to go to work
what's the psychological phenomenon that
happens then well the obvious one would
be they don't like their job
because it's got an ugly commute
but that only works sometimes
more more of the time you know what
happens
cognitive dissonance
because it's hard for somebody to
explain why they're doing something so
unpleasant when we live in a world in
which there are options
and so to explain their apparent
irrationality for having to commute so
long they will tell you that they love
their job
they love the job and they'll come to
believe it it'll be cognitive dissonance
so one of the benefits of forcing people
to do something unpleasant the commute
to come to work is it has the ironic
effect of making them like their job
more
does that make sense
because they have to explain to
themselves why they would put up with
such an ugly commute
because it doesn't make sense unless
it's a good job
you must love your job right so that's
exactly how cognitive dissonance works
so from the CEO's point of view if they
want the employees to love their jobs
they have to make them more unpleasant
I know right it's opposite it's opposite
of common sense now it's also not true
for every person right so that's if you
say to yourself well that doesn't apply
to me you might be right it might not
apply to you it's a it's a general
statement about how brains work and how
situations work and by the way this long
commute example
is one that I've used for years
it just happens to be what we're doing
right now but it's always been an
example of cognitive dissonance because
it's an easy one why do you commute so
long when you could just get a job where
you don't have to
and the answer is they've talked
themselves into thinking they love their
job
now what happens if you take all those
people and then say all right
spend uh two years working from home
well suddenly the value of their job
goes down in their mind because they're
not physically there
and they didn't have to sacrifice
anything to get their paycheck they just
sort of stayed home and it was easy
so everybody's feeling about their job
it should have gone down because of the
pandemic
because the pandemic made their job
easier
weird huh instead of liking your job
more because it got easier
it will make people dislike it more
not everybody you know it'll work in
both directions
all right
um
I don't know if there's any more quiet
quitting than there had been but if
there is the pandemic is a perfect
explanation of why that happened
um
if you
all right just looking at some of your
comments here
you're more effective at home
let me ask you uh all right this is a
collaborative intelligence question
I I've been trying to uh solve something
I'll bet you there's somebody here who
can solve this I'll bet you there's at
least one person who's going to solve
one of my biggest problems right now
yes when I sit down to work
um there's some kind of work that will
make me fall asleep instantly
I like to see a bull fighter or a light
entamer quiet quit uh
and I fall asleep instantly because when
I go completely into my mind usually
when I'm trying to write Comics or to
write something writing makes me fall
asleep
and the feeling I have is that when I
when I crank up my brain to its highest
level of
function which is what I have to do to
write writing is probably the only thing
that I would do on a routine basis
that takes my brain to the maximum
capacity
almost everything else you can do with
just half a brain right most most of
life is half brain stuff but writing you
have to go full Brave you've got to put
the whole thing out there or you get
nothing like 98 of your brain gives you
nothing if you're writing you got to use
a hundred percent and even that's not
enough most of them
so I literally lose Consciousness in
minutes
minutes
you know I'm not talking about it after
two hours of working
I'm talking about in 10 minutes of
looking at my laptop I can go from
completely awake like I am right now
like right now I feel completely awake
if I if I looked at my laptop right now
in 10 minutes I would be unconscious
with my head on the laptop
now
you're gonna you're gonna do a medical
analysis of me here's what you can rule
out
you can rule out diet
because it only happens in the
circumstance but the diet would be all
the time
you can rule out and sleep
because it does not conform to how much
sleep I have it doesn't matter
well-slept or not well slept it's the
activity that puts me asleep
you could rule out so you can rule out
tired and diet
right because those can be isolated and
they don't make any difference
now here's the next the next tip when I
go to Starbucks which I just started to
do
uh and have a uh a cold espresso but
probably there's some sugar in there I
assume drink
uh and I've got the the buzz of the
other people around completely awake
completely engaged and it's easy to
write
so remember when I'm at when I'm at
Starbucks
you know my diet is about the same as
always the same amount of sleep but I'm
completely awake
just retire yeah retiree would help
um but I've had this problem for years
and years and years
somebody says I'm depressed
right I don't think so
oh my brain is telling me to stop right
stop writing um maybe I don't know
hypnotized
put a thumbtack in the issue all right
here's my hypothesis you ready for it
I believe that when my brain is most
active
it draws either sugar
there's something going on with my blood
sugar that I believe that my
um how can I say this without being
attacked again
uh
if you were six foot eight and dumb
your brain would be a very small
percentage of your total energy need
right
because your body would be most of it
and your brain wouldn't be using
anything
but if your job is completely mental
and you weigh a hundred and
fifty Seven Pounds
I feel like I feel like when my brain
goes into its highest level of activity
it just sucks the energy
completely out of me
you know like running a marathon would
for somebody else
and I think there's some kind of
nutritional uh crash that happens could
it be sugar
do I need more sugar
or less sugar because I usually eat
something that's sugary at Starbucks and
it wakes me up
you think it's just boredom
ketones
what do you mean no
what do you mean I need ketones but I
would need ketones just as much in
Starbucks
say you're you're not doing a good job
of isolating
um
foreign
is definitely not nutritional and it's
not how much sleep I have it's
definitely not those things it's
something else
if it's nutritional it's something
that's happening in the moment and I
think that's what's happening I think my
brain is just sucking the energy out and
I got nothing left after five minutes
yeah the brain Burns glucose so if my
brain is burning glucose would it keep
me awake to eat sugar
does that make sense
uh
some of it I know some of you are just
going to be Maniacs about I need more
sleep
and it's diet well you have to
understand that I've tested all of those
things and they're completely irrelevant
to this
it doesn't matter how much sleep I got
the night before it just really does
eat fruit before you write
uh
cernovich explained this is why what
cernovich explained why there are fat
lawyers their brains crave glucose and
burn through it to the detriment of the
bodies
so that might be it
so do you think
um the other thing I thought is salt
I thought maybe I wasn't getting enough
salt because I cut down you know
somewhat accidentally
um
too much salt too much salt
yeah I think it's a glucose level
but has anybody ever heard of that has
anybody ever experienced a glucose crash
that was related to mental activity
um
to asleep what fasting try fasting
all right well
we'll see if we can figure that out but
in the meantime I'll just go to
Starbucks and get my writing then
all right that's all for now
um I think this was easily the best
experience of your day
might get even better who knows it might
be maybe but I'm going to say bye to
