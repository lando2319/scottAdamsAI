[Music]
hey everybody come on in
come on in it's time for
coffee with scott adams the best time of
the day
every day no exception so far i think
we've got about uh
7 000 of them in a row approximately
everyone better than the last it's quite
a streak
and we're keeping it alive and today all
you need
to be part of this great growing thing
called the simultaneous
some of the greatest people in the world
all over the world
about ready to lift their mug in unison
can't we all come together
of course we can we're going to do it
right now we're going to model it
pretty soon when everybody's doing a
toast together
that's when you know we'll all we'll all
be together
and all you need is a copper mug or
glass attacker chelsea and a canteen
jugger flask or vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid i
like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes everything better
not to mention your coffee itself or
your beverage
it's called the simultaneous step and it
happens now go
so let me give you a little hypothesis
i like saying hypothesis
i might say it a few more times because
it's a fun word
and so my hypothesis goes like this
the first part i did not make up okay so
the first part if it sounds smart
that's because somebody smart said it
first it's not because it came out of my
mouth
and it goes like this the origin of
dancing did you ever wonder about that
why is it that humans dance it and we
coordinate dances so we do group dances
like line dancing and
you know things where where the whole
group is dancing as one
where did that come from and why don't
other animals
dance together i think there is there
are examples
of you could get a parakeet to move to
the beat
but that's it you can't get a bunch of
parakeets
to move together like they're dancing
but humans yes
and the explanation i've heard i wish i
could attribute it because i don't know
what scientists came up with it
and it goes like this the humans were
relatively
let's say relatively weak compared to
some types of animals
let's say a lion or a big predator
now if you were a human and you didn't
have physical abilities to fight a lion
what could you do as a group to seem
like you were
big and scary compared to a lion
well if you're by yourself you might try
to look large
you know put your hands up and stand up
and try to make yourself
look bigger than you are but suppose you
were with
the rest of your village or hunting
party
what would you do as a group to look
like you were one big animal
that's right you would move together
if you could in unison move all as one
so that everybody that the lion sees is
moving in the same way
they're all moving left they're all
moving right they're all moving lifting
their arms at the same time
what would you think if you're a lion
you would say to yourself
i'm not fighting one tiny creature i
don't know what that is
but it looks like it's one big thing so
dancing and this was the hypothesis
which is not my own somebody
smart came up with this first uh the
hypothesis is that people dance
to look like they're together to look
as though they're one unit and therefore
more
impressive than whoever they're up
against you see this also in war
in war you see people see the group
dressed together
they have a commonality so it looks like
oh they're all they're all just one big
thing it's an
army but you also notice that music
has often been part of the war process
usually drums
imagine hearing war drums from the other
the other army
pretty scary right you hear the war drum
and you see people moving in some kind
of
unison it's all like one big thing
and so i give you this further
hypothesis
there may be one um one evolutionary
key to bring everybody together
now you're not going to end racism
because music is good
but the very act of sharing music
with other people would in theory make
you feel more bonded to them
in other words if all you did
be you black be you white be you
hispanic or whatever else you want to be
you i would imagine that if you came
together
just to dance and to enjoy the same
music at the same time and to move in
the same ways
at the same time i'll bet i'll bet
that you could you could study and find
that people's
uh whatever racial animus that they had
would be less
i'll bet that you could cause people to
work better together
think better of each other consider the
other simply an extension of yourself
through the act of coordinated movement
and dancing which brings me to the
simultaneous sip
people ask me is that nothing but an
opener no
it's more than an opener it is it is
designed
to do several things one is to tell you
how close i am to being done with the
introduction as i've told you
but the other is that doing ace the same
thing at the same time
which you do with the simultaneous sip
or many of you
does in fact bind you not just to me
but to the rest of the audience and you
become you
you have a feeling of being part of
something by the physical coordinated
act
it's similar to when you go to a
sporting event and you do the
you all stand up and well maybe some of
you kneel
and to do the national anthem and so
when you see the kneelers kneeling when
others are standing
this really hits you in the evolutionary
gun doesn't it
it feels and you can tell the impact was
so big
it's a really basic rejection
of the other because if you're standing
together
or kneeling together or moving together
or singing together
you're together but as soon as you're
saying
if you move this way i'm going to move
this way
that's that says basic an insult
i'll say insult but i'll use that in in
the big sense
of an insult to your biology as well as
the flag
it's just an insult to your basic basic
humanity i guess and so you can see why
that gets people going
which makes it a very good protest
i've often said all right uh moving on
i did this uh was it yesterday
i tweeted around to uh to ask you to see
if you had been
automatically unfollowed from ambassador
grinnell
so i had noticed this i don't know a
year ago that i had been unfollowed from
him and i
didn't think it was something i had done
so i re-followed him and then i asked
other people a year ago hey
this happened to anybody else it was a
lot of people
so i asked again as a follow-up how many
people had been
unfollowed now i don't know if it's just
a continuation from a year ago
and some people noticed a year ago some
people didn't notice till now
or if there's some ongoing issue
but it was a lot of people a lot of
people
said they were following him and now
they're not
and that was just one tweet from one
person you know even even with all of
the people who follow me
i wouldn't expect that many people to
say that they had been automatically
unfollowed
it doesn't it doesn't pass the sniff
test for some kind of an accident
so then i thought to myself well if
there's some kind of a pattern
we should see if it's at least not
limited to one kind of account
because you know there could be
something about one account that is not
common
so i asked people to check if they had
followed uh congressman mack
gates the theory here is that one of the
things that makes
ambassador grinnell interesting
is that his twitter feed is more
effective than most
in other words he's really good at
tweeting good at making a
good at making a point and therefore
good is supporting the administration
likewise matt gates is in that higher
level of
communicators and i thought well
if there's something happening with
grinnell's account you'd also see it in
gates's account
if there's something going on now again
that's not any kind of confirmation or
anything
it's just what you'd expect and so i did
the same tweet with matt gases account
and what do you think massive number of
people
in the comments said what the heck
i was following him but now i'm not
so i don't know what this means
and as i've said before i might be the
only person in the world who is willing
to say
that this is not some intentional
twitter thing
we don't know it's it's a mystery i can
tell you that
twitter doesn't know or at least
at least doesn't offer an explanation
and they have looked into it i've looked
into it twice that i know of
and couldn't find any reason for it now
um now you can of course because you're
all skeptical and cynical you're going
to say they know exactly what they're
doing
but i would put out there this
possibility
that there's no reason to assume that
it's coming from an internal
intentional twitter decision
there's no evidence of that because it
could as easily come from the outside
meaning that somebody on the outside has
an insider
who does something for them that's
really more like coming from the outside
right they just
might have one insider who has access to
something
or it could be a direct hack it could be
that literally nobody who works for
twitter had anything to do with it
but they also don't know what it's about
as possible
could be just a hack could be some kind
of apps having control of it maybe
not necessarily just tick tock but there
are lots of apps that you give
permission to
to control your social media and maybe
they're doing it
and those apps in turn controlled by
some malign
influence so it's a gigantic question
but what's interesting about this one is
it's so discreet
you know unlike the algorithm where
maybe it'll be a little hard to know if
something's happening or not
happening it would be the easiest thing
in the world
i would imagine to have some kind of a
bot or program
that would just monitor the larger pro
trump accounts and then just to be
careful
you would also monitor the largest say
pro-biden accounts
to see if they're having the same
problem because if it's across accounts
it just doesn't matter who you are or
what you're saying
you know any big blue check loses people
and they don't know why
well that would tell you as one kind of
problem more likely something about the
system
but if it only happened for one kind of
people you would not be too surprised to
learn that
in today's world uh that would tell you
something else
so i would think that somebody should be
writing a bot
that could just check on who's following
the big accounts
might require buy-in from the account so
you can get that data i don't know how
that would work
but there's got to be some way to
objectively just graph this thing
and find out if it's really happening i
don't think you'd have to be a twitter
insider in order to track it objectively
from the outside
but that's just that's an assumption
all right did you see the video
this is my favorite highlight reel from
uh from last night's big game
and by the big game i mean anything that
is happening in portland or around there
anything anti-antifa is doing my
favorite clip was
antifa uh made a wrong turn into
mega territory
[Laughter]
now if you haven't seen this video
and you like your videos of antifa not
having a good day
you're going to have to watch this one
trust me you're going to want to watch
this one
i don't condone violence unless it's
against antifa
in which case i condone it totally let
me say that again
if if you're dealing with domestic
terrorists who are wearing masks and
threatening your
your property and your way of life have
fun
right don't go to jail but you're not
going to see me condemn you
um so i'll
i'll just tease it and say that there
were
that there were some locals in a
suburban neighborhood
who were not pleased with the the
arrival of antifa and i'm just going to
say it didn't go well
let's just leave it at that you have to
watch it to get to get the full
entertainment
effect on it but nothing would make me
happier than watching every single
morning when i wake up
uh watching anti-fog getting beaten up
by the police
and or uh local
local conservatives
i must be a bad person i don't know
maybe i'm just a bad person
because i'm not even going to pretend i
don't enjoy that
i totally enjoy it i can't lie
all right let's talk about russian
interference
how long will it be before you ever see
an example of some russian
interference it'll probably be long
after the result of the election
but you know there's going to be claims
of russian interference
will they be as lame as the 2016 attempt
that look like a child's high school
project
to make bad memes and not show them to
anybody that's what the russian troll
farm did
they made bad memes that hardly anybody
saw
relative to the population hardly
anybody saw them
and they couldn't have possibly made a
difference if you see them
if you haven't seen them you say to
yourself well they're probably
kgb made and they're they're high it's
the highest skill level
you can imagine they probably you've got
psychologists and
you know maybe maybe every kind of
science they did they tested them
man these memes must be no no that's not
what happened
it was basically some russian with a
crayon
and a computer and it they just produced
crap and it's definitely not scientific
crap
so until you see an example of this
alleged russian
interference the smart money says
it's happening but not in a way we care
about
because it's going to be so trivial
that's just stupid
how about the story about trump had his
little
press conference yesterday and paula
reed of cbs
kept trying to talk over him and and
insist on her question even when she'd
had her moment
and then the president after several
tries to shut her up
he just ends the press conference
imagine being
all the other people who went there to
do nothing but ask a question
their whole day was about the moment
they were about to get to ask a question
on camera
and then paul and reed just ruined it
for everybody
by being being a jerk now i get that you
have to be
aggressive asking the president but
if we watch this as theater which is
really the only way to watch it
uh how did the theater go were you
entertained
yeah yeah i was entertained
i was totally entertained when the
president walked out i thought
i laughed i thought nice move i'm
totally entertained by that
now the anti-trumpers
will of course and have of course tried
to make it look like
oh he's having a tantrum he's a big baby
he can't handle the prashar
you know all the things that you'd
expect him to say but i
gotta say i think at a gut level
that his walk out worked first of all
it's compatible with everything he's
ever told you about anything
ever which is walk out
if things aren't going your way you
don't need to be there
you know that would be true in a
negotiation it would be true in a press
conference
so you see the president of the united
states is standing up there
on camera live on camera in front of the
whole world
and for a moment he thought
oh i don't need to be here because if
nobody's listening to me
what's the point so he turns and walks
away it was
it was one of the most baller things
you'll see because it was perfectly
appropriate
um yeah you could argue he could have
handled it differently but in terms of
theater it was perfect
because it was to be a played as strong
so unfortunately humans are so simple
that we do interpret things as either
strong or weak
when it's our leaders because we want
strong
even if we say we don't want strong we
want strong
because it's our leader that's who's
protecting us you don't want a weak one
you want a strong one even if you're not
willing to admit it
that was a strong play so i thought that
was all
uh all in his favor well played and
and to be honest nothing that could have
come out of the questions would have
been
good because all all of the things taken
on the context
all of the uh the president said this uh
all of that comes from the questions so
as soon as the cbs reporter gave trump a
reason
to not take questions boom
free money this reporter put a big pile
of free money on the table
because the question and answer period
can go wrong
but it can never go right you know what
i mean
the the president never answers
questions and then at the end of it
oh i raised my ratings my job approval
went up
because of the way i answered those
questions that's not even a thing
it can only be bad so this reporter just
gave him this big bag of free money
which was a get out of questions pass
and you can see him standing there
thinking
did she just put a big bag of money in
front of me with nobody's name on it
i feel like i could just take this big
bag of money
have no risk that questions go bad
still look like i'm in charge and
see you later good decision
i would go so far as to say that that's
why you hired him
that's why you hired him because of that
kind of stuff
have we learned this week that congress
is the wrong place
for budget authority during a crisis
i think we've learned that right now of
course we do want
uh budge we do want congress to have
budget authority
in normal times duh you know that's
representative government you know we we
wish it were more
more functional we wish that they could
compromise better
yada yada but congress is the right
place for that authority
so you put up with the with the pain of
it
but maybe not during a crisis because
if if timing is more important than
getting it right
as long as we have full visibility of
what our leadership is doing
i'd rather have a benevolent dictator
just for a while yeah yeah yeah don't
get excited no
nobody wants a permanent dictator nobody
wants martial law
because maybe that could turn into a
permanent dictator right right
i get it i get it you know nobody wants
a risk that a
temporary dictator becomes a permanent
one but
let's say dictator light you know the
the mildest version
of an authoritarian government would be
to do some executive orders that the
public is begging you to do
all right that's sort of the opposite of
being a dictator
your public is begging you to get this
done
in this case the emergency relief
begging you
please government please do your effing
job
can you please now under that specific
situation
do you want your leader to say all right
i'm just going to ignore
congress because it's the right place
for the decision
but they don't have the timing thing
down if they can't do it
on time it doesn't matter if that's
their authority they just don't get to
do it
right if you don't if you don't do it
you lose the right to do it
so we're in this strange situation which
jonathan
turley who he's my go-to on these
constitutional things with dershowitz
would be the other
voices i listen to the most and
he he says this which is just the
perfect way to put it
he says that uh it's absurdly
unconstitutional the executive orders
but it could be let's just say it could
be absurdly constitutional
but if nobody challenges it it's
practically constitutional
so in a practical sense it doesn't
matter if it's
unconstitutional have you ever been in
this situation before
maybe i mean historically maybe there's
some minor situations that fell into
this category
but just think of that point so long as
the the
population of the united states says ah
that's unconstitutional
but i'm not going to complain
and if the democrats say that's really
unconstitutional
but we're not going to take it to the
supreme court
it actually doesn't matter it doesn't
matter if it's constitutional
it's kind of mind-blowing isn't it
because we're so used to
it's got to be constitutional that's
like the minimum requirement for
anything right you can't be
unconstitutional we can have lots of
conversations about whether it's a good
or bad idea
but that's a line you can't cross
constitutional
and then we just did it looks like we
just crossed it running
hey constitutional line let's run right
off of this keep going
and i think it's going to work
because you know even if you don't like
the details of it
people are going to like getting their
check and they weren't going to get a
check before
even if it's not as much blah blah
now my take on the executive orders is
that they're too complicated
to really be good uh meaning that
you know it's delaying things and moving
things around and
eventually they'll you know you'll have
to pay the paper and pay back a loan
or move something back into a budget
that was robbed to do this
so it doesn't really feel like except
for the part where you get a check
i don't know i don't have an opinion on
whether these are the right things to do
or whether they're lasting but it does
give the impression
of a leader in charge again
so what people are going to take away
from this is is there anything in those
executive orders that's good for me
and the answer is going to be yes for
most people
most people are going to find at least
one thing on that list they're going to
say oh that's just good for me
well i'm not going to complain yeah it's
a little unconstitutional
but i don't want to get evicted it does
seem a little unconstitutional but
i like to eat so
we're seeing almost an entire new form
of government here
remember i told you before that our form
of government had evolved
without anybody voting on it yeah and we
turned into
effectively the the public through
social media especially
has way more control of things than
maybe has ever been in the past
because it would be difficult for a
leader to do something that the entire
public
spontaneously disagreed with violently
and i think you've seen the president
float ideas and back off and float ideas
and back off and it's mostly because of
the public
it's not because of the democrats it's
because the public
so this might be the cleanest
example because the public basically
said
in our minds you know i'm i'm gonna mind
read for all of you
all right in your mind wasn't there some
part of your mind that said
if congress can't get this done on time
somebody's got to do it right
some part of your mind said if congress
isn't the right place to do it
somebody else has got to do it because
you don't have an option of
not doing it because then you have you
know mass
starvation etc so
i think the public changed its form of
government
in their minds while you were doing
other things
you know while you were paying attention
the form of government
literally and fundamentally just changed
and the constitution became
wait for it optional
the constitution just became optional
is that good is it bad
don't know i'm not attempt i'm not
tempted to think it's necessarily bad
because in a situation like this it's
clearly better
i'd have to see other situations to know
if there's some kind of
slippery slope as some of you like to
say
here's a fun factoid
that uh i guess ari
fleischer tweeted this and there was a
study recently
i'm not sure i buy this i'll go further
i don't buy this
so i'm going to give you a study result
and as it was summarized by ari
fleischer
in his tweet i don't think it's true
but i'm going to tell you anyway it goes
like this
that if you do just three things
you have a two percent chance of being
poor in other words
if you were already poor as long as you
did these three things
you'd have a 98 chance of going from
poor to at least
middle class and the three things are
finish high school get a full-time job
and don't get married and have kids
until you're 21.
if you only do those three things you
have a 98
chance of having a decent life
pretty interesting isn't it now i put
this in the context of what i believe
is most missing from
school curriculums strategy for success
can you imagine telling a
telling young black youth uh
i like to use black use as my proxy for
anybody poor
so it could be any person of color any
white person any person who's just in a
poor situation and doesn't think they
can do
better because they feel sort of locked
into their situation
how many of them at age 10
were told that all they had to do is
these three things
and they would be successful
do you know what i was told when i was
that age
i was pretty much told
that this would make me successful not
directly
but i would feel that when i was
just a kid i would have said that these
three things
finish high school i would have changed
that to go to college
uh get a full-time job i would have
changed that to
you know get a good job and
wait to get married until after 21
i'm pretty sure that was part of my
upbringing because my
my mother started having kids at 18
and i think she it seems to me that that
was baked into my childhood
you got to wait a little while and you
know get things up and running
i don't remember if that was something
she directly told me
or it was just obvious but somehow i
knew it
and i would be really curious how many
people who could say
who could say as an adult oh yeah this
is exactly the life
strategy that i learned when i was a kid
how many people could say that
i don't know and so i think that would
be worth testing
you know you should just pick out a
classroom or something and say
we're going to teach you life strategy i
would give them my book have failed
almost everything and still win big
because that's
written for let's say 14 years old
and up and it's simple life strategies
about how to have a system
for something not a goal that sort of
thing
so i think it would be transformative
how much more would you study if you
knew that
it was the difference between success
and failure i mean i feel like it would
make a big difference
all right here's uh
oh let's talk about jerry falwell jr in
his photo
so there are some stories that i stay
away from
until they age a little bit and
sometimes they're just icky or it's just
about one person's personal problems
i just stay away from it so i'd been
staying away from this jerry falwell
embarrassing photograph with a woman's
story because i thought it was oh god
it's just another another religious
person who
maybe did something bad but then i
looked into the story it's complete bs
the whole story is complete bs
he basically did nothing wrong and it's
obvious
you know what once he tells you his
version of the story you look at it you
go
oh oh that was nothing that was actually
just a joke
and the joke was this his his uh
his or his wife's assistant who traveled
with them
in other words he and his wife and the
assistant were all in the same place
the wife might have taken the picture he
posed with the assistant because what
was funny was
the assistant was pregnant and she
couldn't uh
she couldn't button the top of her pants
so she was leaving it open
jerry falwell jr in an act of
self-deprecation
was noting that he was he had you know
gained a little weight
and so he was pretending like because he
had gained weight he couldn't
button the top of his pants so they took
a picture together
he had his shirt off but i think he was
on vacation so not a big deal
and you know his top of his pants were
unbuttoned
hers were unbuttoned if you don't notice
that she's pregnant
it looks like something's up it was
nothing but a gag
picture to make fun of the fact that he
thought he had gained some pounds
that's it it was it was so opposite any
kind of a sexual anything
it was it was literally as far as you
can go from a sexual thing
and and he had to take a leave of
absence about this now of course the
judgment part is i guess it got on
social media
so you know uh the worst part about this
is that he didn't understand that other
people would see it differently that's
it that's it that's the whole thing that
this guy had to like change his
career situation his his reputation
everything
over a freaking joke
don't make me defend jerry falwell jr i
mean i have nothing against him
but it's not my job to defend him but i
have to
because i don't want to live in a world
where somebody does a joke photo that
nobody is offended by
it wasn't at anybody's expense
right it wasn't anybody's expense except
himself he was making fun of himself
if you can't make fun of your fricking
self
and you lose your job for making fun of
yourself
seriously that's crazy
all right here's a little math you're
not going to like so according to fox
news some kind of survey they said that
one third of people
the population would not take the
coronavirus vaccine
now that's not too surprising right
one-third would not take it
but you say to yourself well that that
might be okay
because suppose two-thirds take it if
two-thirds took it
and then you add the any herd immunity
that happened whatever small amount that
is
you'd say oh there we are two-thirds
take it add a little natural immunity
boom you're at 70 percent uh
immunity virus is gone
that should get it done right so no
problem
if one-third don't want to take it it's
a free country
if two-thirds take it boom problem done
except except
according to dr fauci a vaccine might
only be
50 percent effective
ouch because then
you've got two-thirds willing to take it
but only half of them
back to one-third are actually gonna
take it and have it effective so you
would have only
one third of the country vaccinated in
an effective way because the other half
it didn't work
and then you add a little bit of herd
immunity
so you've got like 33 plus
10 percent maybe 10 natural herd
immunity
what happens if you can only get to the
40 percentage range with a vaccine
plus natural herd immunity i
you know now it's possible that the
vaccine would be better than 50 percent
it could be 75 could be better and we
hope it's better
but there's a pretty high chance that
the vaccine
won't get you there so just keep that in
mind
when when you're looking at what is the
right strategy
to be doing today you have to put your
odds on the vaccine
getting us to hurt immunity
along those lines yesterday i found
myself in the debate
with somebody online who did not have a
profile
a profile detail so often people will
tell you
in their profile what kind of occupation
they have either directly or indirectly
and this one was sort of silent on the
occupation
and insisted that the that trump was
doing a bad job
compared to other countries managing the
coronavirus
now i said i got into it and said well
you know too many variables it's too
early in the game you can't really tell
and he pushed back and said oh yeah you
could tell compare them to these
countries
and i said no you can't really compare
them that's apples and oranges
and then i explained a few examples why
and they said well what about this
country and i said
um that's just another apple compared to
another orange
same thing i just said just changed the
country
and then he came back and said what
about canada
and i started to think what is wrong
with this guy
why can't he understand that there are
too many variables
he could disagree with it but how come
he can't
why why can't he even understand what
i'm saying
and then i finally after several
iterations i said
what kind of art do you do
you see where i'm going right and they
waited a while and said
i do various things and then i said
what kind of artistic things do you do
and it turns out he does various
artistic things he's an artist
artist of in various fields but an
artist
now how many times have i made this same
mistake
of trying to debate an artist
so it's a waste of time because artists
could be brilliant in their field but if
that's their
entire domain of experience they don't
know how to
analyze things but worse they don't know
they don't know how
so it's sort of like talking to a
five-year-old about physics
you can't tell the five-year-old that
they don't understand physics
well i suppose maybe you could in that
case but
there's no place you could go you can't
win the argument
because that would require them to
follow the argument and they can't
and it's so consistent that the people
who only have experience in that domain
can't follow an argument and because it
was flagged
so clearly in the conversation that i
could just say what kind of art do you
do
and i can get it almost every time
because i've done this a number of times
guessing people's occupation by how
poorly they argue
you know if this had been an economist a
doctor
you know an engineer i would have picked
that up right away
because even their disagreements would
be in a category i'd say okay that's
you know i disagree but it's a good
point and i'll tell you why
you know you got an assumption wrong all
right but for your
for your benefit i compiled a tweet that
i just tweeted before i got on
about all the variables you would have
to look at in order to compare
any two countries so here
if you think you can compare two
countries i would like
you to show me how you factored in the
following things for any two countries
and the coronavirus population density
percentage of black population because
they have a higher mortality
so for example if you compare the united
states to canada
are you going to factor in the fact that
canada has
3.5 percent black population the united
states has
over 13 percent black population
and the black population unfortunately
has a
far higher death rates than like four
times so
who calculated that when you're
comparing canada to the united states
in terms of the death rate anyway and
have you have you factored that in
how about the average age italy is very
old
africa is very young big difference
how about the island status or near
island
status if i hear one more idiot
compare the united states or any other
regular
country that's not an island to an
island
i'm gonna lose my freaking mind because
it really helps to be an island new
zealand
doing great thailand doing great
um how about south korea kind of an
island
because it's only connected by north
korea and the dmz and you're not getting
much through there
so south korea kind of an island how
about mongolia mongolia is doing well
no water around mongolia no mongolia
is kind of an island it just happens to
be a land island
yeah there's physical separation i may
be wrong about that but the point
the larger point is don't compare
non-islands to islands
you could compare the islands all to
themselves that would make
maybe you'd be closer there but don't
compare an
island to the united states with porous
borders
how about the cultural norms of
conformity
do you think the united states norm
of how much we're willing to rebel
versus how much will
we're willing to conform do you think
that matches up to other countries
is your impression of germany that
they're a bunch of rebels
is your impression of south korea that's
all
rebels no it probably isn't
i hate to make sweeping generalizations
about entire countries and cultures
but i think there are differences in the
united states
if you said don't hit yourself in the
head with a hammer
50 million people would go to the
toolbox pick up a hammer
hit themselves in the head and say you
can't tell me what to do with a hammer
you do not tell me what to do with a
hammer i decide what to do with a hammer
if you don't want me to hit me hit
myself in the head good luck with that
watch this bam bam bam bam bam bam bam
and it looks like i'm making fun of
americans
nope nope if that's what you heard
you heard it wrong am i saying americans
are stupid because they'll just hit
themselves
in the head with a hammer no that's what
makes this freaking country
great our greatness as a country
and i'm definitely on board with the
united states being a great
country our greatness has
everything to do with rebellion we were
born of rebellion
we have we've fought a civil war
we've you know we got you know suffrage
we rebel we are a country
of rebels and that's also what keeps us
together
the fact that the fact that we're all
rebels
it is sort of a sort of a thing right
now not rebels in terms of the you know
the
confederate flag but uh rebels in terms
of we just don't like to be told what to
do
and if if there's something we're not
supposed to do we're gonna do it three
times
and we're gonna experiment and we're
gonna die
we will die for freedom
like it's taking a walk all right and as
long as the united states has that kind
of character
we will always be a dominant cult
culture
meaning that the country will do well
because that kind of risk
of taking and thinking outside the box
is why we're the most innovative country
in the world
it's all connected so you don't want to
take that away from us
you want to see that as our strength it
just doesn't work too well in a pandemic
if we're being honest it's not the best
match
for a pandemic but you gotta factor that
stuff in there
how about vitamin d exposure we better
look at that across countries we know
that that's a factor how about uh
strong states rights versus the federal
government
uh what is the situation in i don't know
uh new zealand are are there governors
really strong compared to the federal
government i don't know but you better
compare that stuff how about whether
they used hydroxychloroquine
early and often well that's a little
hard
because the other factor is how good is
their data the first thing i heard about
germany
in the in the very first days of the
pandemic
what i heard through just my own
channels
is that germany was widely prescribing
hydroxychloroquine from the start
because bayer a big german company makes
it
so they have you know one of their major
companies makes hydroxychloroquine
the doctors were handing it out like
candy that's what i heard
later i heard conflicting information
about their
their use of it so can you trust the
data
do you know what countries used
hydroxychloroquine
which doctors prescribed it how early
they prescribed it
you don't so you don't know about
hydroxychloroquine because
in general and this is another category
how credible is the data from that
country
don't know what about
when they got their first infection and
how big it was
if your first infection came to you from
two different coasts
and by the time you were on to it it
would already spread
well you're in bad shape but suppose
you're sitting down there in new zealand
and you see what's happening to the
other countries do you have an advantage
you do if it hasn't hit you yet
and you know exactly what's coming you
have a little bit of advantage to
prepare
how about if you're an international hub
for travel
that's got to matter how about how your
seniors are cared for
do you do it the same way do you have
senior homes or do you care for them
do you keep graham at home is that your
culture that matters
how about this one there's a new one i'm
going to throw into the mix
the number of sex partners you have
on average do you know how much sex they
have in brazil
brazil's not doing too well right do you
know how much sex they have in brazil
a lot more than japan all right
look it up brazil is near the top of the
number of partners and amount of sex
you can have they have a lot of sex in
brazil
japan not so much now if you get this
from close
personal contact it's not exactly a
sexually transmitted disease but it kind
of is
because if you have close physical
contact well
so can you compare countries with high
sex rates to low
i don't think so how about the fake news
effect
we don't know exactly what what that
influenced but it certainly influenced
the rate of hydroxychloroquine use in
this country
it definitely influenced the um
the debate on masks so if you don't have
much
fake news in your country isn't that a
big advantage
does new zealand have as much fake news
as we do
i doubt it i doubt it
so that's got to help how about your
privacy
limits in china no limit on privacy
you they they can i mean no limit on
lack of privacy
the government can take all your privacy
they want
how about the united states opposite
opposite
we'll die to survive we'll die to keep
our privacy
in china they might die too but the
government would kill them so
that wouldn't be a problem for china's
government
then how about the lying about contact
tracing
if you have never lived in the real
world as an adult
who worked for a big organization you
would probably
think this and be completely wrong hey
there are some countries who are doing a
good job of contact tracing
and some like the united states who are
not
if you think that's true some countries
are doing
good on contact tracing and others are
not
you've never lived in the real world
here is what is
far more likely to be true nobody's good
at contact tracing
unless you're a super small country and
you just had a few infections
then in that case it might be a thing
but if you take out the
the smallest of the cases where it might
actually work
anybody else who got a hold on this
virus is going to claim
that it's because of what they did
that's what leaders do
if the leader had said i'm going to dunk
my head
in a bowl of water and swirl my hair
around
and see if that makes the coronavirus go
away
and other things that country did
actually did make the virus
go away what will the leader claim will
the leader claim huh
i did this thing i put my head in a bowl
of water shook my head after i took it
out
and i guess that didn't make any
difference to the coronavirus
no leaders don't do that they tell you
they tell the news and then the news
tells you it's a good thing i stuck my
head in a bucket of water
or look at the trouble we'd have leaders
try to connect
what they did to any good outcome
if you don't know that that that's a
universal truth
then you might be mistaken and think
some countries
did contact tracing really well
it's not a thing it's not a thing
no largish country
is doing contact tracing well
they're not now the exception might be
a no privacy country like china they
could just look at your phone
and they can just say hey you were
within a mile of somebody who had the
coronavirus
so we're gonna we're gonna board you up
in your house for three weeks
all right you can't do that in the
united states so comparing china to the
united states is just stupid
because there's so many differences
how about this how about which type of
coronavirus
you got early now we heard a little
about this
in the beginning remember and i haven't
heard much about it lately
so it could be that this doesn't matter
but didn't we hear that there might be a
different
form of the virus on the west coast of
the united states than we got in new
york city one might have a different
characteristic in terms of spread and
lethality
i don't know if that's still true so i
feel like my knowledge is stale on that
but it could be a factor and then how
about comorbidities
does your country i mean this is related
to age but does your country have a lot
of other health problems etc
so if you don't know all of those things
comparing two countries
is crazy let's talk about this uh
lebanon blast uh get back to that
um i've developed a number of go-to
people for different
topics and my go-to person for
the middle east especially when israel
is any part of the conversation is
jake novak jake if you're watching
hey jake so you should follow jake novak
as one of your clearest voices
not only of a lot of business stuff but
of of
of israel and um
as jake has noted um
and i don't know where he's getting his
information but he generally has good
information so i would trust it
he said almost all the people of lebanon
are rightfully blaming hezbollah
for the blast and their iran-compliant
government
not israel or the united states
and jake says i wonder how many people
realize how historic and encouraging
this
is and i didn't know this did you
didn't you just assume that the
residents
of beirut would say that's got to be
some israeli thing or some american
thing
death to america but you're not seeing
that are you
you're not seeing that at all this is a
big deal
as jake says this is a big
big deal like this is one of the biggest
deals
of all the deals this might be the
biggest one
and you know it's the dog that didn't
bark so it's harder to see the dog that
didn't bark
so and jake is good at that so
yeah the fact that they're not
protesting israel in the united states
after something big blew up in their
country
blaming iran that's gigantic
gigantic anyway
uh yes it was a story that uh simon
cowell
was testing his new e-bike and
fell off in his driveway and broke his
back
i know i know i've been promoting these
e-bikes as
the future of transportation and they
really are
you got to get one of these things if
you have any chance
you know financially that you could pull
it off and you like bicycles
uh they are dangerous bicycles are crazy
dangerous
it was the reason i almost didn't get
one and i got to tell you that if
if i had only had regular bicycles
probably i would have said uh at my age
especially
maybe a little too dangerous but when
you have the e-bike
feature it's just so much fun that
you're willing to take a lot of danger
so don't break your back on your e-bike
so there's a report that twitter
is mulling over the conversation of
buying tick tock
what do you think of that my take on
that is that that's
probably a just a polite meeting
my guess is that tick that that twitter
is not
serious about buying tick tock but if
you're a big social media platform
you probably feel like you have to be at
least a participant in the conversation
you would have to at least you know hear
the details
before you said no so my guess is that
twitter is just
being a good uh good citizens basically
and saying well you know we're in the
united states
we're an american company there are only
a few companies in the world who could
take over tick tock
so we should at least take a meeting i'm
guessing it's not that serious
because i don't think it fits well
because twitter skews more
adult tick tock obviously skews
way to the young side it doesn't feel
like it fits
snapchat probably doesn't need to buy
them because they're going to knock them
off and just reproduce that function
i think instagram's going to do the same
thing i mean why wouldn't they
so you should have you know the facebook
instagram people
and the snapchat people just basically
knocking on knocking it off
and they have enough of a platform that
they have enough of a network effect
that they could get it going
but how about microsoft i would think
that microsoft would be the most
natural buyer because that would get
them into some kind of
social media platform in a bigger way do
they have any
does microsoft have am i am i blanking
on something that microsoft is doing in
terms of social
networks i feel like they're doing
something that i'm just blanking on
well if they don't have a big social
media platform
maybe this is a way to get it but i
don't know what you're buying when you
buy tick tock
exactly are you buying just the
customers
you know just the customer list is that
it oh linkedin
yeah i'm sorry yes uh that's what i was
blanking on is that microsoft now owns
linkedin but that's a different kind of
social network
uh i wouldn't call skype a social
network
yeah thank you for filling me in i knew
there was something there
i just couldn't produce it was linkedin
but
irrelevant to the conversation because
it's not the right kind of social
network all right um
that is everything i want to talk about
today
i hope you enjoyed this episode of
coffee with scott adams
and i hope that you learned something
and i hope that when somebody tells you
to compare
two countries for the coronavirus you
find my tweet
maybe save it and just present it so
people can understand
especially the artists that they can
understand oh somebody said x bike xbox
live
too yeah that's right microsoft has xbox
live
well you can call that a social network
i can see that
all right that's not for now i'll talk
to you tomorrow
