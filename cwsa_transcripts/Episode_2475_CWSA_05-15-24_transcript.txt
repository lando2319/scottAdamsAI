hey there we
are thanks for finding
me looks like locals is in the house do
we have Rumble any Rumblers any
YouTubers is everybody here or just just
locals I want to wait to see oh there's
a YouTube in the house anybody from
Rumble today is Rumble here
yet sometimes Rumble might take a few
more seconds
all right well I think if we've got
YouTube and locals we probably have
Rumble so we're probably in good
shape no video
yet
okay let's see if I can make the video
come
on
huh so no video yet
huh um what does anybody on YouTube oh
there we go we got video just took a
moment we got video
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and
you've never had a better time and let
me tell you today is going to be
special would you like to see me do
magic today I'm going to do magic today
I'm going to cure thousands of people of
mental
illness
literally and if you'd like to see that
and all the amazing things all you need
is a CER micro glass a tanker gel
orstein a canteen Jugger flask a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee and join me now for
the unparallel pleasure the dope mean h
of the day think makes everything better
it's called a simultaneous siping
happens now
go yes I am indeed going to solve mental
illness for probably thousands of you
really truly this is not a joke and
it'll happen in just a few minutes in
next five minutes some of you are going
to have the biggest problem of your life
solved not all of you but some of you
it'll be kind of exciting wait for
that well Peter Zan tells us that the uh
that uh American companies can now
petition the government to apply for us
protective tariffs if China says they
have to transfer their technology so you
know if when American companies or
foreign companies work with
China China often or maybe always says
that they have to transfer their
technology to them and now if they
demand that apparently us companies have
an option they can they can apply to the
government to put a tariff on
China that's actually a pretty good idea
I I mean I I don't see it in the news I
only see people Zan saying it but he's
probably right I mean I I doubt he'd
make it up so I'm going to say that uh
that's a very
trumpian that feels like a trump-like
policy Trump never had that policy as
far as I know uh if he had I would have
said it was good so I'm going to say
it's good uh even though it's not
Trump there is a study that
suggests that uh driving uh if you're
texting and driving you're probably a
psychopath now did you really need a
study to know
that that if somebody is operating a
dangerous motor
vehicle 80 mil an hour and they're
looking at their
phone do you need to do a scientific
study to find out if there's something
wrong with that person's
priorities maybe their
empathy well I think it's a little more
complicated than being Psychopaths I
think some people just have a different
um relationship with
risk isn't that fair to say how how do
you know you're measuring Psychopaths
who don't care if they get you know kill
you in a crash versus somebody who just
has a high tolerance or risk and they
think they're good at texting and
driving at the same time but it feels it
looks the
same but I will tell you that anybody
who makes a phone call in Starbucks is
definitely a
psychopath and that what I don't
understand I know that they think oh
it's a public place but you look around
the public place and you see all these
people on laptops clearly trying to
concentrate how do you not know that
making a loud long cell phone call in
that environment makes everybody want to
stab you how do you not know that you'd
have to be a
psychopath all right um I think think
I'm just going to go ahead and do it I'm
going to cure a bunch of
you so I tried a uh a
reframe with my audience uh yesterday
and I think the other day as well in
which if you get ruminating and you're
thinking too much in your head that you
simply use two words get out and you
treat yourself like you have two
lives so here's the reframe and by the
way I checked this morning and my
Audience by an overwhelming number of
comments said they tried this and it
completely helped their mental health
instantly let me say it again just I
don't know how many people dozens dozens
of people this morning just before I
went live here I do a pre-show with with
my uh subscribers and I asked them if
they tried the technique and I'll
describe it again but they said they did
and just dozens of people said it
instantly helped them M so here's the
technique you know how when you're in
your head you're living in an imaginary
world you know you're thinking about
what happened which doesn't exist the
past and you're thinking about what
might happen which doesn't exist the
future so you actually when you're in
your head you're living in a world that
doesn't exist but there's an external
world where you're touching things and
doing things and doing chores and
exercising and working and doing things
the external world is
real so what I found is that these two
words get out will immediately take you
out of your internal World your
imaginary world and put you into the
real one and you just remind yourself no
get out of the imaginary world get into
the real one get out get out and those
two words will actually become a trigger
or a key that helps you do the thing
that you want it to do so you associate
words with actions especially CS of your
own body and those will become
sticky it doesn't take long you just
have to say something and associated
with a feeling or a situation gets
sticky really fast so I want you all to
try this and you're going to be amazed
the next time you're too much in your
head and you got recurring thoughts or
whatever just say out loud get out get
out and you're not talking just about
getting out of your head you're talking
about getting out of the house just
stand up and walk
outside if it's cold stand up and walk
around the
house but the get out is a reminder that
you are two people you're not one person
there's one of you that lives in the
completely imaginary world of your mind
and the other one lives in the real
world but the only one that has a
problem is the imaginary one so you can
starve the imaginary one of its energy
but just ain't get out I I choose to
walk through this doorway and now I'm in
the real
world I guarantee ba based on the
comments I got back this morning I
guarantee that a healthy percentage you
just just solved one of the biggest
problems in your whole life now that
ladies and gentlemen is why I wake up in
the
morning I remind you I don't really need
to
work but this is why I do it because it
has some value and I find that waking up
without the at least the potential to
add something to the world uh sort of
meaningless and stupid so I like to make
sure I've got at least one thing going
on at all times that could make a
difference and we'll see if that makes a
difference I guarantee that'll work for
some percentage of you guarantee it
because the the overwhelming response
from the people who tried it is just too
strong all right that is your gift for
the day and uh I'll ask you tomorrow how
many of you tried it and even by
tomorrow watch the comments it'll be a
wall of comments who said oh my God I
tried that and it
worked the greatest reframe ever
maybe there's a technology called shot
spotter that allows the police to know
where a gunshot has been fired in their
city and and wokeness is reporting on
the xplatform that Senator Warren and
Senator Mary and representative Ayan
Presley they're trying to get rid of
shot spotting in
Boston why why would you want to get rid
of a technology that helps you know
where there's some violence with
guns can you guess take a guess why
would you want to get rid of
it well it turns out that they put most
of the shot spotters the technology in
black neighborhoods
and they're saying that's racist so get
rid of
them do you know why they put them in
the black
neighborhoods uh it wasn't because
they're
black that they put him in the the high
crime
neighborhoods now what
exactly do Warren mky and Presley think
they're going to to get out of this
that's good for the people of Boston
were the people in Boston clamoring for
less or slower police response to
shootings was somebody asking for that
it's like hey hey there was a shooting
in my neighborhood and the police were
here in
seconds that's pretty
racist aren't they supposed to be there
quickly if there's like a
crime I don't understand any part of the
story is there something missing is it
possible the story was reported with
like important context left out or is it
just as stupid as it
looks I'm going to go with I think it's
just as stupid as it looks I
think
so how could everything be racist so I
was seeing a clip uh that Tucker Carlson
was talking to uh quarterback Rogers and
tuu was saying that during the Occupy
Wall Street years when there were big
protests about all the rich people in
Wall Street that it was just that same
time when that was at its peak that the
New York Times suddenly had a
substantial increase in references to
racism and racist and racism and white
supremacy and then suddenly The
Narrative changed and it was no longer
about hey those are rich people it was
all about hey those white
people that's
right the allegation is
this and and I've always said this by
the way I've told you that I've been the
victim of extreme racism in my career
extreme I lost my job at a bank for
being a white guy I lost my job at the
phone company for being a white guy my
TV show was uh basically cancelled
because I wasn't African-American and
they were going to to do a a block on
UPN of just black
programming so I've been super super
discriminated against but I but I
sometimes forget to tell you this all of
the Discrimination was at the hands of
white men and white
women I've never been discriminated
against as far as I know by a black
person like ever I can't think of any
case where that's ever happened how
about an Asian-American
discriminate against
me can't think of a time about a
Hispanic American discriminating against
me anytime anytime in my
life can't think of one anybody who is
half
black discriminated against me ever not
once I mean I can't think of any time
but how many times have rich
white people discriminated against me
well a lot a lot and let me tell you
 rich white people are the
worst I think I can say that right
because I'm a right rich white
guy I I can criticize my own people I
believe that's fair I believe
criticizing my own people is fair so
sometimes people misunderstand me when
they say that I'm a victim of extreme
racial discrimination and gender it's
it's all from white men and a little bit
from women but mostly mostly it's white
men who do you think canceled me uh from
newspapers do you think there were a lot
of uh uh black owners of
newspapers there might be some but I'm
I'm not even aware of any actually so no
white people white people cancelled me
it's always white people and the occupy
Wall Street thing just sort of brings
that up it's like wait a minute there
was all this pressure against rich white
people and then suddenly there's all
this you know CRT n SG and Dei and it's
it's all we're talking about it sounds a
lot like the rich white people threw in
a little diversion doesn't it that's
what it feels
like don't know what's true but that's
what it feels
like uh just before I got on I saw there
was
a huge Improvement in the full
self-driving feature on the Teslas so
something that'll make it five to 10
times
more uh let's see more self-driving
meaning that uh far fewer human
interactions and at the same time um
apparently the California Air Resource
Board the carb never even heard of them
uh have some kind of deal where they're
going to raise my California gas prices
50 cents next year and every year
after in order to reduce
emissions they're actually going to just
price me out of
gas now this is in addition to the
existing gas TX so it's not like just a
gas tack it's it's raising the gas T
yeah 50 cents a gallon right 5050 cents
a gallon
and that's real that apparently that's
going to actually happen now at the same
time I was trying to decide between a
nice American
Bronco gas vehicle mostly because I like
their look and they seem to be you know
they'd have
utility
um or a
Tesla now I'm not sold on electric cars
just cuz I don't have a charger in my
house but if I put one in I suppose it
wouldn't be the biggest deal because I
don't take long tricks trips anyway
usually so I think that if California is
going to try to price me on a gas unless
I'm going to
move I might want to go for the Tesla
but then somebody said that the
insurance is more for the electric cars
is that true is Insurance more for a
Tesla than a similarly priced vehicle
I've never heard that before any confirm
that because I I don't know if anybody's
done the full cost of
ownership because I always thought the
electric was a lower full cost of
ownership for the car dealer um there's
a separate question about Recycling and
all that stuff I see a no I see a not
really I see a yes I see Nos and yeses I
see doubted right so that might be fake
news well I am seeing yeses though I'm
seeing yeses and
NOS Well it can't be that big of a
difference
then some people saying maybe a little
but nothing
important 10% more somebody says all
right we don't know exactly we're a
little mixed on our fact checking here
but it doesn't look like it's you know
double or
anything so I guess so at the moment
given that uh I did learn that a bicycle
would fit in the back of a Tesla an
ebike and it also has a bike rack I'm
leaning pretty heavily toward the full
self-driving Tesla because I think I
might actually use my vehicle more if it
drove
itself here's the thing I don't like
about long
drives I don't like that it forces me to
think their
thoughts like the car forces me to think
about you know the road and everything
and I don't like think about something
I'm forced to think about for a long
time but if I could just sit there and I
don't know do you pay attention or do
you stop paying attention to the road
until it tells you to I don't know would
it feel different
mentally I guess I'll have to experience
it to know but anyway I'm leaning toward
the Tesla over the gas
car at the
moment speaking of Elon Musk he's uh
reiterated that the terms CIS and
consist gender are considered
slurs and you'll get a warning on X if
you keep it
up um now I think I played this just
right and what I mean by that is uh for
how many years have we' been hearing
this term CIS and
cisgender for I don't know maybe eight
years or something when did it pop into
existence but it's been years now right
and the first time I heard it I thought
huh I don't know what that even means
and then also the second time I heard it
and and the thousandth time I heard it
every time I said you know I should
probably Google that I should go figure
out what that means because it kept
popping up and I didn't know what it
meant and I managed to ride that all the
way until it was banned now I don't need
to know what it
means I played it just right I I refused
to know what it was and that it didn't
matter because it turned into some kind
of an insult and you're not supposed to
say it anyway so well played Scott well
played by ignoring it um I had a
philosophy teacher in college who used
to who taught the inbox trick which by
the way has influenced so much in my
life and the inbox trick goes like this
if somebody puts something in your inbox
let's say something they want you to
deal with you leave it there for two
weeks that was that was his method if
somebody asks you to do something you
leave it you you age it for two weeks
and and this was his theory he said if
it's important they'll take care of it
themselves like if you're not dealing
with it they'll find some other way to
get it done because it's important if
after two weeks they're not clamoring
for
it it wasn't important in the first
place now I spend so much time thinking
about that
about whether wait does that really work
I mean it doesn't feel like that makes
sense but when you try it it does seem
to work I can't tell you how many times
somebody has asked me to do something
urgent and I just threw it in the mental
inbox I'm like nope and then a week
later they say never
mind never mind I figured out a way to
do it all right it's a great
trick all all right uh there's a new
study that says there's a compound in
cannabis that might uh be protective
against Alzheimer's and
Parkinson's so it doesn't say that you
could get this benefit by smoking it
it's a compound in it but I'm going to
guess that you probably
do because I'm trying to figure out why
the older I get the smarter I
am it's probably the protective benefits
of the Cannabis compounds
not only do I not have Alzheimer's but I
think my IQ is at least
doubled wait if I think that probably
means I do have
dementia damn it there's no way out of
this get out get out all right I'm
back all right uh here's my theme for
the rest of the show it's called are we
still a
republic are we still a republic I'll
see if I can make this theme work
first story uh nearly 40,000 ballots in
Nevada were counted after election day
40,000 now that would be illegal those
would should not be counted 40,000 but
the question you ask is well it's just
40,000 right out of the whole
state how much did uh Biden win a Nevada
by
34,000 there were 40,000 illegal
votes that mostly went to
Biden and he only won by that amount H
huh that's
weird that's weird now on one hand you
could certainly understand why those
votes were counted because if they were
real
votes if they were real
votes even if technically they shouldn't
have been
counted it doesn't feel that bad does it
if you think to yourself well they
intended to vote maybe the mail got
delayed you know you don't have a result
yet why not at least you can enfranchise
your voters and make sure their vote
counted on the other hand does anybody
believe that this was totally legit that
just coincidentally the exact amount of
votes came in after the
date does anybody think that's
legitimate it might be
can't rule it
out but yeah so you you're asking the
right question what about the postmark I
think there are two standards but I need
a fact check on this depending on the
state I think that the postmark would
matter or the when you received it
matter I think it I think it depends on
the state but I need to I need a fact
check on that anyway this is the claim
that the votes came in after the fact
should not have been counted but they
were and may have changed the result for
at least one
state well the Rasmus and Poland company
asked this question
directly um to find out if we're still a
republic uh and here's their lead and
I'll just tell you what they said after
the Constitutional Convention in
1787 when Ben Franklin was asked what
kind of government the convention had
created he said and I quote and by the
way I always think these um historical
quotes are just made up I I never think
these are like the real quote but
allegedly Ben Franklin said a republic
if you can keep
it well rasmon asked the
public um are we still a republic and
did we keep
it only 39% of likely us voters believe
America has done a good job of keeping
the
Republic 39%
47% think the Republic the founders
created has already
fallen 14% are not so
sure 47% think the Republic has already
fallen
47% um but here's the question I'm going
to test you
on for those of you who are uh new to
this new to my live streams you're going
to be amazed
watch this watch how they can answer the
question before I ask it
go just go show off go on show show your
stuff there we go the answers are coming
in I haven't even asked the question yet
but watch this look and and you and
you're all right you're all correct okay
here's a question that you've already
answered without even knowing the answer
without even knowing the question uh
what percentage of Voters according to
rasmon believe the federal government
today has the consent of the
Govern
26% 26% believe the government is acting
with the consent of the
government and you knew the answer
before I asked the question because
you're the smartest audience in the
history of the entire Republic which
doesn't exist according to most
people all right
how many of you saw a uh there was a
little news story because KL Harris used
the F-word when talking to a bunch of I
think they were uh some kind of
Asian-American women's group I think and
uh she said that you know sometimes if
the door is closed you've got to quote
kick the effing door down except she
used the whole
word now so the story
was hey she used an F-word
now can we all agree that nobody cares
about that right nobody cares that a
politician swears I kind of like it
actually I have to admit I like it if
they don't do it all the
time and they use it for those moments
when they really need to you know
accentuate a point I think Trump uses
cursing better than any politician of
all time because he doesn't overuse it
he'll just throw in a you know an sww or
mostly an sww I think he doesn't use the
FW it's well
done but I think uh I think you missed
the headline on this
story I I want you to go back if you saw
the clip or if you haven't seen it go
look at it I want you to see if you
maybe missed the the top line of what
the story should have
been she was
drunk really obviously
drunk now it could have been some other
inebriation
but she was very
inebriated now how is that not the story
the story is she used an f- word no how
about the story is this is the way she
did it and you should kick theable W
down how do you ignore that
part no the story wasn't about her
choice of words it was it was about a
choice of drinks
that should have been the
story just think about the fact that you
got Joe Biden shuffling around
his pants halfway to the helicopter
where it looks like it and that the
number two person is appearing drunk in
public now I I'm sorry I'm going to stop
saying maybe drunk can we stop saying
maybe that was drunk as all right
you can't look at that and think she was
sober you can't no I I I challenge you I
challenge you to look at that and say oh
yeah that's
sober how is that not the
story and and do you not see it are
there people who can't
recognize you can't recognize a drunk in
public that's about the easiest thing
you can
spot but because you used the f word it
it diverted everybody like a magic trick
it's like oh the real magic trick is she
used that
word
wow all right um CNN's Daniel Dale the
fact Checker is back and he came to fact
check Donald Trump's
speech
huh I feel like he's always on vacation
when Trump gives or when Biden says
something where where's uh Daniel Dale
fact checking Biden you they they only
pull them out when Trump gives a rally
now here's the funny part remember I
told you that you don't understand the
news unless you know the
players right if you don't know what the
players have done or who they're
connected to you're kind of Flying Blind
everything is about who knows who and
who did what and who's connected to what
so even this story so if you just turned
on the TV you would
see a fact Checker uh talking to a
couple of C and hosts and doing a bunch
of fact checks on on Trump and if that's
all you knew you'd say wow that Trump
sure tells a lot of Whoppers and that
would be your impression now let me tell
you a little bit about the players one
of the hosts Abby Phillip is a promoter
of the fine people
hoax she believe she believes and she
has promoted on the air that Trump said
the neo-nazis were fine people do you
ever remember Daniel Dale factchecking
that I don't think so I don't believe
I've ever seen him take a run at that so
if you didn't know that the fact Checker
who seems to be absent when Biden does
anything uh if he didn't know he was
talking to a purveyor of the fine people
hoax it looks really different doesn't
it but once you know he's talking to a
famous I assume lying because I don't
think anybody's dum enough to know that
that was true um anybody in the news
business um it changes everything it's
like oh a famous hoaxer who has a job as
a News
host anyway here's something interesting
RFK Jr said that
um he says he doesn't want president
Trump to have a second chance in office
in part because he says Trump was rolled
by his bureaucrats uh to impose
lockdowns and shut down businesses uh
policies that made things worse all
right so RFK Jr let's let's pull some
things together so RFK JR says the
president Trump is too influenced by
experts is that a
problem is it what if it gone the other
way I I'm trying to imagine a world in
which uh mean old orange man Trump
overruled the entire scientific
consensus of the
time how was that going to
go and and I ask you if we had a
president RFK Jr and the entire
scientific Community said you should do
X but RFK Jr said no do
y would you be comfortable with that now
I get that he was right about things
you and and that the experts were wrong
we all get that I'm not saying that if
you take one approach versus the other
you'll always get the right answer no
but I don't think there was a path where
Trump could ignore the experts during
the
pandemic that that's completely re uh
revisionary history if you put yourself
in the context of the time he couldn't
ignore the experts
even if he thought fouchi was
 he couldn't really ignore him
because fouchi was agreeing with the
other
experts it wasn't really about fouchi
and by the way um I will tell you from
my I won't call it my own reporting but
you know everybody has sources I'm
pretty sure that Trump thought fouchy
was
 but the entire scientific
Community was sort of on the same sish
you know except for the few notable
people who were dissidents and got it
right so how in the world are you
supposed to expect him to ignore experts
the next time would you be comfortable
with that now if next time looked
exactly like the co thing then yes right
if there was a mysterious new virus yes
yes I would expect Trump to know it's a
second trick but what if it's a brand
new situation
you know let's say there's a volcano and
all the experts say you better wear a
mask for 2
weeks do you want Trump to say you don't
need a mask I
don't no I I kind of want to hear what
the experts say because I don't think
we're at the point where you can ignore
them or that you want a non-expert to
overrule them right in front of you how
is that better but here's the
interesting part how can it be true that
Trump is a
uh a dictator and he has authoritative
authoritarian um instincts when at the
same time he's being criticized for
listening to The
Experts you have to pick one right he's
either the person who ignores everybody
and does what he wants or he's the
person who takes expert advice including
generals including military people
doesn't mean he agrees with them all the
time I get that
but no you don't want him ignoring
experts so you have to decide so you've
got somebody who's running as a Democrat
is saying that Trump is not dictatorial
enough and he's letting experts
influence him at the same time another
Democrat now I realize RFK Jr is not
running in the Democrat Party but he's
Democrat and so the other Democrat Biden
is saying he's a dictator and he's not
going to listen to The Experts
so it's all made up neither neither of
those uh images ring
true let me tell you what I think Trump
is I think he's a practical person I
think he looks at every situation new he
says all right what works in this
situation does following the experts
make
sense sometimes yes sometimes no and I
think he's done a good job of calling
out when to ignore them because he has a
few times and I think gotten it right a
few times so I don't know it's tough to
criticize him for bending to The Experts
because we're looking at it with u that
20120
hindsight yes if Trump knew today
everything he knew then he should have
chosen differently but he didn't and how
could he it it's ridiculous to imagine
that he could have known then what we
know now that's that's just bad thinking
that's bad
analysis all
right um so we're learning that uh
Democrat Congressman Dan Goldman
apparently met a number of times with
Michael Cohen the big star witness in
the stormy
trial and uh he met to prepare him for
the trial
now you say to yourself huh that
certainly would support Trump's theory
that it's a organized Democrat plot and
it's not just the legal system doing its
thing but rather it's the Democrats
coordinating with the Department of
Justice in this case the store witness
so it looks exactly like the fix was in
but it gets better it turns out um the
judge the judge's
daughter uh
uh so Dan Goldman is a client of the
judge's daughter your your consulting
firm so the judge's daughter has a
consulting firm that consults Dan
Goldman let's see if you just hold this
in your head the judge's
daughter is paying a rep a democrat
congress person who's a Biden person who
is then advising the key witness in the
trial that that same judge is
in had to you know
basically end
Trump now is this a case of it's exactly
what it looks
like I love this
trial I didn't think I was going to love
it so much but the thing is it's making
it so clear what's going
on even if you're a Democrat
you see it by now don't
you if you're not just batshit crazy you
see it right you see that all the legal
cases were
bogus all of them you can see it really
clearly with a stormy case but it's not
a coincidence that the other ones are
delayed because there's some real
problems with the other ones real
problems so I feel like this is going to
be the Rosetta Stone for at least normal
Democrats normal meaning somebody who's
just you know not crazy
basically uh I think that they're
looking at this I think the freed
zakaras on CNN are looking at it and
saying flat out this is lawfare this is
a political
prosecution how in the
world how in the world do Democrats win
when CNN says they're doing a political
prosecution and only fewer than uh like
half the people think that the country
is not even a republic anymore how in
the world does Biden win without
cheating all
right uh number of
supporters well I think let's talk about
Cohen um I saw MSNBC saying he's doing a
great
job I was watching Morning Joe just melt
down today arguing with because there's
another there's a New York Times Sienna
poll that says uh Trump's up by 11
somewhere I think Nevada and and they
were just they were just melting
down Morning
Joe that is mental illness
right because you know I feel like you
know if I'm watching the conservative
news and I see somebody say something
that to me is you know clearly more
propaganda you know just team play it's
being a little unfair they never look
crazy the the people on the right the
Republicans they always look like they
know exactly what they're doing I'll use
Shan Hannity as my example does does
Shan Hannity ever look like he's
insane
no if you think he's saying something
that's not true or leaving out some
context looks like he's doing it
intentionally now you can have your
opinion about that but it doesn't look
crazy it just looks like he's pushing a
version of things that his audience
wants to hear nothing crazy about it so
it looks completely different over on
the other side when you watch
MSNBC I I only see mental
illness now I by the way I don't see
that in CNN so it's not just about you
know whether they like or don't like
Trump when I watch CNN I look at people
who look to me like they know what
they're doing in other words I I get the
Shan Hannity effect from CNN I think I
can't read your mind but I'm looking at
your eyes and your mannerisms it doesn't
look crazy it just looks like you're
pushing a view of things that's
different than the other view of things
somebody else is pushing but on
MSNBC they do legitimately no joke no
exaggeration no
hyperbole they almost all look mentally
ill do you see it
too now if if I thought that CNN was
also just as mentally ill then I think
you could say Okay Scott you're just
being a team player you know you're just
saying oh everybody in the left is
mentally ill no I'm not saying that at
all there are plenty of people on the
left who don't come come across that way
at all not even a little bit but MSNBC
consistently looked mentally
ill I would guarantee if you if you look
at the percentage of those hosts who are
in therapy it would be higher than any
other network would anybody take that
other side of that
bat would you take the bat that if you
looked at all the onair hosts of all the
different networks that the highest
percentage in therapy would be MSNBC
would anybody take that
bet I wouldn't bet against it it to me
it looks obvious
same same thing with it's basically a
whole bunch of commas there's just
something going on there that's
different than having a different
opinion well anyway uh so the way MSNBC
was treating all of Trump's supporters
who were showing up in court is that
they're all uh supplicants and they're
all sucking up to them and maybe they
want the VP job and and all that is that
a good frame that the see the people are
uh let's see the Speaker of the House
John
V ramaswami Byron Donaldson a few others
I think now when you see those names do
you say to yourself oh obviously these
These are the suck-ups these are the
ones who just want to ingratiate
themselves with Trump at the maximum
amount is is that your take on
it now it doesn't hurt to make the
presumptive candidate happy so you can't
say that's a nothing right it does
matter what Trump wants and it does
matter that some people want to work
with him or be productive parts of the
administration so yeah yeah there's
going to be a little bit of support
going on but I don't think that's
exactly what's happening let let me put
the frame on it that makes more sense
and Byron Donaldson did this for
us he's beating the gag
order it's just a way to beat the gag
order all he's doing is bringing in his
proxies and by the way MSNBC said he was
editing their comments before they made
them I don't know about that and I think
if he did that would be you know
potentially a gag order issue so I don't
know that that's true that was just
reported by somebody who wasn't under
oath uh and MSNBC so you know use your
judgment on that but my take is um what
do these people have in common Johnson V
and Byron Donaldson let's just take the
last two vake and Byron Donaldson what
do they have in common
besides the fact that somebody would say
they would like you know to be vpus or
have a role in the administration what
else do they have in
common besides being drum
Sports it's not
obvious is it a
coincidence that Trump brought the two
best communicators in the Republican
party no three best JD Vance JD Vance is
there I forgot about him the three best
communicators in the entire Republican
party
plus the speaker of the
house that's what he did he brought the
three best communicators in the
Republican
Party V ramaswami Byron Donaldson JD
Vance they're not just
good they're good at a whole other level
they're good at a level where the
Democrats don't even have any body at
that level their best person is below
all three of them their best
person doesn't communicate as well as
any of those three now what about
Johnson he he's a very capable
Communicator he's not he's not on the
level of a ramaswami Vance Donaldson
he's not on that
level but I'd also like to point
out that in Trump trump will never say
this CU he doesn't need to two of the
three people that I've called out as the
best communicators in the Republican
Party are not white
men I love the
fact that you know if I didn't bring it
up because I'm provocative it doesn't
need to be brought
up the Republicans simply show you their
hand here's my
cards here's what I got I got a vake
I got a Byron Donaldson what do you got
AOC come on
really what do you got uh Adam
Chef Eric sell show us your
cards right and then you throw in JD
Vance and it's it's
crazy I mean those are by far the best
communicators you'd agree right uh all
that's missing is
maybe Ted
Cruz you know Ted Cruz should be that
list as the you know great
communicators but uh Johnson is there
because he's the you know he's the most
important Republican I suppose you'd say
who's elected at the moment
so to me this looks like a curated group
I want to bring in the best
communicators and the most important
Republican and what did the news do they
could not
ignore they could not ignore it
oh yeah um Matt Gates is now Matt Gates
is more of a Firebrand kind of
Communicator so he might I don't know if
he's the number one choice that I would
bring in for this because he he brings
his own you his own set of complaints
about him uh but yeah he's a great
communicator that's
true so to me this is just a huge
display of not just support for the
president it's a clear indication that
it's
lawfare do you think that you would get
this group of cats to show up at court
to support Trump if there was any doubt
about whether he was guilty or innocent
no the fact that they show up is really
strong evidence that they that the
question of whether there's any guilt
has already been
removed before the trial is even over I
don't know anyone who thinks any any
crime has been even demonstrated or even
listed that's what VES said say can you
tell me the crime we've been we've been
watching this this you know Court
situation for what days and days and
days almost over now list the crime tell
me the crime MSNBC can you list it can
you describe it in a way that's even
coherent because no crime was
demonstrated and no crime was even
called
out now under those situ under those
conditions is it safe for the top
Republicans you know the ones who want
to make sure that their reputations are
not destroyed is it safe for them to sit
in the court and back the defendant
absolutely so the message that it's so
safe that even these other Republicans
are not worried about being tarnished by
being in a criminal case for Trump you
know being in the audience they're so
safe because it's so obvious even CNN is
calling it an AS lawfare that it does
nothing but add to the gravitas of
Trump's
complaint that this is so bogus that the
most respectable Republicans can show up
and sit there and they don't have to
 did did the Republicans who
supported him have to tell any
lies no they simply had to describe what
they saw that's it very
safe so the fact that Trump has once
again figured out how to beat the media
by bringing in his strongest players
making them get time because you know
it's it's a the fact that they're there
at all is a show they got to cover the
show
yeah and this is one of the things I
always say about
Trump is if you don't understand the
show and the show is the whole show it's
like everything he does if you don't
understand the show you don't understand
anything and and this was this was a
brilliant scene within the larger show
the Trump show a brilliant scene
everything about this was right now I'm
going to say it again because every time
I say it I think it's
interesting the biggest story about
Trump's campaign so
far is that it's
Flawless how are we not talking about
that right cuz that wasn't true the
first camp pain you know he was a little
little uh little too edgy maybe although
probably got him elected you know the
more provocative he was it probably
added energy but at the moment he
doesn't need that he doesn't need he
doesn't need any scary
energy he's killing it I mean I've never
seen performance at this level and I
would
guess that whoever he's taking his
advice from and I could only speculate
about that but
keep doing it whoever is advising Trump
and again is Trump a dictator I doubt it
because this looks very much like he's
taking good advice doesn't it in your
opinion doesn't this look like Trump is
really well advised and taking the
advice it looks like that to me and
that's the president I want right I want
the president who if the if the experts
are acting crazy maybe ignores
but if they're nailing it you know he's
going to surf it I think he's he's
surfing I think he's surfing the uh V
wave and probably probably the other
folks as
well good advice keep it
up um and then MSNBC is trying to put
down some suppressive fire by saying
that everybody who works with Trump ends
up like Co and her
Pence imagine msbc and seeing these
three cats show up four of them Johnson
vake Donson and
Vance and and they've got to make them
act like they're clowns or something
they couldn't it's their strongest
people and so instead they say well you
know if all these strong people keep
defending Trump and they work for the
administration maybe they don't know
they'll end up like Cohen or they'll end
up like Pence do you know how you end up
like
Cohen there's only one
way it's acting like
Cohen Trump trump didn't turn Cohen into
Cowen he was already Cohen right you're
not going to see Byron Donaldson turn
into Michael
Cowen and and the Pence thing was a was
a a once ever one and done I mean really
the only problem that Pence had was how
he handled January 6 and I'm not even
sure who's wrong
I know you don't like it but um I've
always appreciated that Pence was trying
to figure out what was the right thing
to do now maybe you think he got it
wrong that time but I've never I've
never disrespected pets for taking a
stand maybe he got it wrong maybe he got
it right but I respect that he took he
took the hard stand I I'll always give
him that credit even if you don't like
it well uh Biden's out there again uh
after getting fact checked hard by the
media for claiming that uh inflation was
1.4% no that inflation was 9% when he
came in well it was more like 1.3 or
something and so it actually went up to
nine in his administration and now it's
down to three something but it's above
where it
was so he goes out and after getting
fact Jack hard he says the very same
thing the next day what would cause
that why would it be that knowing he
would get slapped down he would go out
and just say the same damn thing that
everybody just called a giant
lie well I have two possible
explanations number one it works because
the fact checking is only on the right
leaning networks it's not getting fact
checked probably anywhere else do you
think MSNBC is factchecking that
no I don't think so it it would be news
itself if they fact checked
it so he probably knows that because of
the media bubble that everybody's in he
could just keep saying it just just keep
claiming it until it sounds true now I
you know as you know Trump uses that
technique as
well so you
know sometimes it's just Hy hyperboy and
directionally true and if you repeat it
enough people think it's true so it
could be that he just knows that lying
works
the other possibility that I find more
tantalizing is that his staff has given
up and I think that's the
case I believe his advisers have
literally given up on him because I
think that behind the scenes they're
getting dementia uh tear
Downs here's what I think is happening
uh Mr President um about the thing you
said yesterday um I just want to give
you little fact check that uh the media
is treating that you know unkindly and
uh the facts don't really support what
you said so maybe maybe you could soften
that a little bit or kind kind of find a
different way to do it what do you think
he says to that I think he starts
dementia screaming oh get out of here oh
what are you trying to oh it really
really did go up oh and then after that
happens about three times and you look
the polls and you see he losing anyway
and there's probably no way to reverse
it do you say I'm going to go do that
again or do you say well screw him let
him go out and just kill himself I mean
not not literally but let him go out and
just sink in the
media look at the face of Tony blinkin
I'll talk about him in a moment look at
the face of grin John
Pierre they have they have the
capitulation face like there's something
happening they don't like and there's
nothing they can do about it it is all
over their faces and they both look like
they gave up so the other story is about
Tony blinkin over in
Kev and he announces that Kev is not or
Ukraine is not going to have elections
until the war is over which basically
means no
elections and then he goes and he he he
plays with the band he's playing guitar
and singing uh and people said that's a
terrible look to say there's going to be
no democracy and you're up there playing
your thing and and it was just a
terrible terrible look and I said to
myself do you think that Tony blinkin
would not be aware that that would be a
bad play he would obviously know it
would be filmed he would obviously know
it would be a story he would obviously
know it was the wrong choice
to look like he's all having a good time
in the war
zone it looks like capitulation to
me to me it looks like he knows the game
is over and maybe even the entire
illegal operation in Ukraine will be
revealed under a different
Administration he had the eyes of a
person who looks like he thinks he's
going to
jail now I can't read his
mind but look at his eye in the last
couple days and look at Karin jeene Jean
Pierre's eyes and her demeanor she looks
like she already was told she's
leaving because I have this Theory I
don't remember if I said this stop me if
I said this on the live stream yesterday
I may have SED on the man cave
separately
that if you're the campaign for Biden
and you know that your your uh your
candidate can't talk in public what are
you going to do well you'd better have
great
surrogates so Trump can't talk in public
because he's a gag he's gagged so he
brings
in the best communicators of all time
who happen to be
Republican Joe Biden can't talk in
public but he's got a problem his
spokesperson can't either so youve got a
spokesperson who can't talk in public
without embarrassing the party H talking
for somebody who can't talk in public
because he's he's just too gone don't
you think that the
campaign has been trying hard to replace
John uh Ken John Pier if they haven't
been trying to replace her they are not
doing their job because their only hope
is to get rid of her right away and
bring in a strong player who can
actually support Trump's or support
Biden's point of view without Biden
doing it and they got nobody to do that
now they got nothing
so I think her uh Ken John Pierre's
problem is from the the Biden campaign
that's my guess
yeah all right uh let's see what else
uh
so uh Biden has agreed to
debate he's agreed to two debates so
Biden says uh he was talking tough in
his little video saying he wants two
debates
was one in the end of June and one in
September end of June would get Trump
pass his his legal case that he's in and
the other ones are delayed so he
wouldn't have that trouble and
uh here's what you have to
say take a look at the video of Biden
saying he agrees to two debates and sort
of challenging Trump and watch how many
edits there are in the
video so I think he talks for 30 seconds
somebody said there are five video
edits I caught at least one do you know
what that
means it means they couldn't trust them
to read a teleprompter that was only 30
seconds long that they had to edit out
so many
mistakes that that it looked
like they're they're only like a week
away from doing like a one of these uh
black mail notes where you cut out the
cut out the letters from the newspaper
and paste them on the page I think
they're going to start taking individual
words that he's ever spoken and just put
them together with Clips until he's not
wearing the same outfit like look for
look for his clothes to change while
he's talking that's coming up it'll be
like the inflation is and then his
necktie will change to another another
one It'll like oh and Biden oh Trump oh
oh it's going to look like that so watch
for his necktie to change while he
talks all
right in the meantime oh well so here's
my prediction my prediction is he will
not
debate and that he will cancel the June
debate why why will he cancel the June
debate two possibilities number number
one oh oh look there's a fake pandemic
there there's an emergency I'm so busy
I'm so busy with my emergency that I
couldn't possibly debate because I got
to run this country it looks like
Russia's attacking Russia has upped its
attack on Ukraine well it wouldn't be
right for me to be debating when I got
to be managing this war situation so
it's either going to be I can't do
it the other possibility is he's going
to claim that Trump is asking for
something
unreasonable so let's say Trump says uh
Biden also said he only wants to do it
if it's moderated by uh Lefty entities
now he didn't say Lefty entities he
named the ones that have done it
recently you said it has to be one of
those and they were all left leaning
entities so what if Trump says how about
we do the June one with a you know at
least one right leaning entity and maybe
the September one was something else
something like
that that gives Biden the opportunity to
say well I guess you turned down to
debate didn't you I offered hey but you
you asked for those conditions and oh no
that's unreasonable why don't you do it
the way we always did it they were the
same entities that were in the primaries
nobody complained then so I guess you
just you're afraid to debate aren't
you or
yeah so there'll either be like reasons
that um or or it might be that uh he
doesn't want to give oxygen to Trump
because he's such a bad person like
something new will happen to new hoax oh
but based on the new hoax I can't even
give this this dictator white
supremacist any air uh so I'm going to
cancel because the public should not
shouldn't even hear him
talk let's see in the comments how many
of you think there will be a June debate
given that he couldn't do a 30- second
video about the
debate I think it's a trick I think he's
just buying
time and he could be buying time until
they replace him and he knows it's going
to
happen could be it could be
capitulation it could be that Biden kept
saying oh I can do it I can do it and
his staff knows he
can't but it could be that the staff
said if we can get him to do the debate
in June and he falls
apart we still have time to replace him
because it's before their
convention isn't it it's before the
convention
right oh give me give me a fact check in
that when is the DNC DNC convention is
when it's after that right is it before
or after it's after
yeah so it could be it could be a Hail
Mary by the staff so the campaign staff
might know full well that you can't
survive a debate and it might make the
polling you know 20 point difference or
something and that would give them the
juice to finally replace them yeah July
and August are the their conventions
okay yeah end of June is a
suspicious because it's uh it's
perfectly timed to replace him if he
fails so maybe that's the play because
that would look like capitulation as
well all right meanwhile the uh Trump
campaign has a new ad in which they're
saying that uh Biden is denying reality
about the economy acting like it's fine
and here's their framing they say is it
dishonesty or
dementia oh that's so
good is it dishonesty or
dementia because the trumpers know that
the public doesn't think the economy is
great you know inflation is high they
know that so if Trump if Trump gives
them two options well if you agree with
us that the economy is not as good as it
looks how do you you explain Biden
saying it looks
great two options
dishonesty or
dementia he either doesn't know the
difference or he's being dishonest do
you know what would have been a worse
way to go to say lying or
dementia lying wouldn't have landed as
well but
dishonesty dishonesty is wider isn't it
dishonesty gets all the way to Hunter
Biden and
Ukraine dishonesty is a much more clever
word in this context because if he just
said he lied what would people say they
say well Trump lies
too if you say he's
dishonest well now it's not as clean as
everybody
lies because it might be true that all
the politicians lie except for Thomas
Massie and Rand Paul Maybe um
but it's not necessarily true that we
think of them as thoroughly dishonest
because Trump will have been so
vetted that um if if if you have 91
indictments and none of them land it's
going to look like oh maybe maybe he
does tell some Whoppers but all the
politicians do but
dishonest dishonest is a different level
that's a very good choice of words for
the ad
all
right um Mike Ben
reports that uh apparently the
government of the United States uh did
some grants to some groups to study how
to censor Target groups without
triggering the Martyr
effect how to censor
Americans
Americans the government funded
grants to
study how to censor
Americans without the person being
centered knowing about
it just think about that now their claim
was that they were trying to get rid of
the the haze
speech you know the the bad stuff but of
course you know goes deeper than
that so the way they did it was they
discovered that if they if you simp
cancel the person at the top the person
who's making all the trouble they become
a martyr and they get
stronger
hello does that sound like something
that happened to me they made me a
martyr and I got
Stronger Yeah does it look like it
happened to Tucker they made him a
martyr and he got
stronger yeah yeah I don't know about
Alex Jones uh I I thought I heard that
Alex Jones is going to have to close INF
Wars because the the laware against them
is that true he's going to close it and
reconstitute it as something else
because it has to go
bankrupt yeah well there are some people
who definitely became less strong when
they got canceled but the idea was to go
after the people who boost them so that
they wouldn't know so they would just
censor the the lieutenants as Mike Ben
calls them the people below the
influence ERS because if there are
people with a million people in their
account who keep retweeting these same
influencers you can just stop the
million people
retweets and then it just looks like it
looks like people don't care when all it
is is you got rid of the
lieutenant that is a real thing that was
that is really happening in the United
States um you will see I'll tell you in
a few days about a book of mine that's
coming out that 20 years ago I predicted
this very thing I predicted a concept
called the prime influencer the idea
that you could use big data which is
what they're doing to identify who are
the influencers and it wouldn't be
obvious and that if you could turn off
the influencers you could basically
control
everything and that's what they're doing
exactly like my fictional book from 20
years ago and that ladies and gentlemen
is all I want to talk about today so I'm
going to say goodbye to the uh YouTube
and Rumble and ex audience I'm going to
stick with the subscribers here on
locals um where they get a lot more than
just the Dilbert comic a lot more and
I'll see you all tomorrow same place
same
time let's see if this
works
