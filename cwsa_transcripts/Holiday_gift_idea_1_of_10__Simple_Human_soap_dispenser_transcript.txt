all right here's my holiday recommendation 
the first item is by simple human and it's  
an automated soap dispenser all you do is 
put some uh regular dish soap in it any  
kind will do you can use it for your hands 
or for the dishes and here's what it does  
Boop what best thing ever if you just want to 
wash in a cup or wash your hands it has to be  
charged every now and then and it is a pain 
in the ass if you're reaching for something  
and it squirts your hand but if you put it in 
the right place and keep it charged awesome
