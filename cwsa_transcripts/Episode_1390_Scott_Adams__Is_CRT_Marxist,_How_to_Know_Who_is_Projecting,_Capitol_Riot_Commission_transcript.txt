or less

unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that's better than
well i'm not even gonna say it you know
you know the thing
it's called the simultaneous sip and
it's gonna rock the entire world
right now go
hold on you feel that
yeah that was the feeling of the
simultaneous sip
going all around the world same time
christian you're way too nice you don't
even have a comment for me to read
but thank you so what about the news
there are three words we're going to
talk about today one is
ceasefire the other is marxist
and the other is peacock because
persuasion
depends quite a bit on the words you use
of course
we want dale we want dale dale uh
dale might appear he might see dale
let's start at the top and we'll get to
all the persuasion tips that are
embedded in this
as we go i just saw a tweet from
somebody on
twitter named just
jess and she reports in her tweet
she says so turns out the new friend i
went on vacation with
doesn't believe there was an
insurrection
so vacation over four days early
friendship way over mind blown
now this uh tweet suggests
some advice i would like to give to all
of you
i don't usually give travel advice not
really my domain but sometimes
sometimes i can give you travel advice
that's quite good
here's my travel advice number one
uh don't plan a trip to north korea
just don't do it i feel like i'm on you
know solid ground there
don't go to north korea not a good place
for a vacation
number two never go on vacation
with someone who believes you can
conquer a superpower
by putting on a horned hat and occupying
a room
at the capitol because if you're going
on vacation who think with someone who
thinks you can
conquer a superpower with a horned hat
and occupying a room well then you're
not on vacation with somebody who's
smart or who has your back
or even understands anything about
anything in fact the odds of you coming
back alive
not a hundred percent
um here's a word i would like to
introduce into the argument about
china and fentanyl and as i tweeted
moments ago
i said let's not directly negotiate with
china on
anything until there's a ceasefire
on sending fentanyl our way and then i
said that has to be hello
in other words where i don't think we
should talk to them about
anything else in fact i've suggested
strongly that we should we should remove
all of our diplomats
just talk to them indirectly through
some other country or something
because i don't know if they're going to
like that situation if they're such a
bad player that they can't even get
diplomatic relations with the united
states but they don't deserve it
china doesn't deserve diplomatic
relations with the united states
while we're in a hot war and the reason
i would say
that we should wait for a ceasefire is
that they are killing us with fentanyl
they are doing it intentionally they are
doing it every day
and they could stop it like that because
they know exactly who it is who's
sending it
we gave them the name china knows the
name and address
of the one person who's sending the
fentanyl
you know they added the whatever drug
cartel is doing in china
so let's call it a ceasefire because
when you call something a ceasefire
people understand you're in a war and
people are dying
right now like dying right now
so if we say weak ass stuff such as
gosh china we'd sure like you to do more
about
restricting the fentanyl trade and then
china says
oh yeah absolutely we're going to get
right on that as soon as we're done here
i'm gonna pick up the phone fentanyl
trade will be completely done
and then it doesn't happen repeat
repeat repeat china will just say yeah
we'll take care of that
and just not do it so let's call it what
it is
it's a hot war they're sending uh death
chemical warfare and unless there's a
ceasefire i don't think we should talk
to them about anything
just anything all right
um i saw a tweet that
got me thinking maybe it'll get you
thinking too it's just a
user on twitter named reald or at least
that's the username
and real said i'm telling you when men
get defensive
whatever you accuse them of you were
right
and it makes me wonder how does
riel think men act when they're falsely
accused
if there are any men here can you answer
this question when you are
falsely accused of something and let's
say it's something important
important enough for you know somebody
in your life to
bring it up when you're falsely accused
of something
what's the best play there are you
supposed to act
offensive or are you supposed to act
defensive
because i feel like there's a little bit
of a trap you've sent here reald
which is uh it's very convenient that
when you
accuse somebody of something you can
know that they're guilty by them
defending themselves
so somebody says i hit back hard
well i'm sure that's worked really well
for you
i know what you're saying that some
people hit back hard because you just
feel like you want to or you have to but
you can't tell me it worked i'm sure it
didn't work
and so this brings up a larger question
which is
when one person accuses another of
projecting meaning hey you're blaming me
of the thing you're doing
how do you know which one is right so
you got two people
who both think the other one is doing
the only crime
and is projecting it on the other and
the other thinks exactly the same thing
but in reverse
no i think you're doing the only crime
i'm not doing anything
but you're projecting on me have you
been in that situation
where you both think you're projecting
and you both think you're innocent but
the other one is definitely guilty
how do you sort it out how can you tell
which one of you how do you know which
one of you is projecting
would you like a way to do it
let me give you a way to do it okay
if somebody is innocent of a thing
and you say hey i think you're
projecting on me because that's actually
your crime
and let's say it's not what would
somebody say
if you falsely accuse them of projecting
well i think they'd say something like
well what do you mean
or make your case or can you give me an
example
how exactly what did i do give me some
details
that would be one way person could react
if you say i think you're projecting
but you're guilty of that crime here's
another way
go nuts they go really nuts and they
won't talk to you for the rest of the
night
which one is projecting one of them says
i don't know what you're talking about i
don't think i'm projecting give me an
example of that
what you know can you give me some
details that's one person and the other
one is like
i knew you wouldn't be honest you're
doing it again
i'm not going to talk to you for the
rest of today which one's projecting
yeah it's easy now you'll never convince
the other person they're projecting
but they know it because that's why they
exited the conversation
so when somebody gets too mad to talk to
you and exits
the conversation it's because they know
they can't
prevail based on the facts so
if you're wondering if you're crazy
that's how you know
if you're willing to talk about it
you're not the crazy one
if the other one says i'm not even going
to talk about it i'm really mad at you
and by the way you did something
terrible last year
you know who's projecting so use that
tip
the only good it will do you is at least
you'll know which one is projecting
it won't solve the problem because the
projector is still mad at you and
it's going to be mad at you tomorrow but
at least you'll know which one is the
crazy one and that's worth something
all right um so joe biden has uh
once again crossed the creepy line so
hashtag creepy joe is is uh
is trending again today so this is what
he actually
said if you haven't seen the video you
have to see the video because i'm not
going to be able to
to do it any uh any justice
somebody said i look stoned i think
maybe i always look stoned
but i'm rarely stoned at this time in
the morning
later sure but at the moment not
so this is what joe biden said he he was
he looked at a girl in the audience and
somehow this makes it worse it was a
daughter of a veteran
and he said quote i love those barrettes
in your hair man i'll tell you what
look at her she looks like she's 19
years old
sitting there like a little lady with
her legs crossed
now i didn't see a picture of the person
in question
they just showed a you know a close-up
on biden when he was talking
so i don't know how old she is and i
think it matters doesn't it
well it matters a little bit how old she
is it's bad no matter what
but how you how you filtered it would
depend a little bit on what you look
like
and it's all bad so you know how she
looks isn't going to make it good
but it's part of the story and it feels
like feels like we should have that
information
and here's the thing
has nobody told him not to do this
anymore
somebody in the comments is saying uh
that maybe she was nine or ten she was
eleven somebody says
well okay i guess we don't know but
that's not terribly important to my
point
my point is that you know this doesn't
mean that he's uh
that he's a pervert or something i mean
we can't we can't really go all the way
there
but man is creepy it's definitely creepy
and he had to have been warned don't
talk like that in public anymore
but but
he went there so i'm just wondering how
i'm wondering how democrats who
supported him
are feeling about him now are you still
feeling good
did you get exactly what you wanted
there i'm glad they don't have
trump with all of his accusations and
such
but they've got this instead uh
chuck schumer is mad at the gop that's
new
uh he says shame on the gop
because they they killed a bill the
senate republicans did
to create a capital riot commission
despite some of the republicans voting
with the democrats didn't get enough
votes to overcome the
filibuster so that's not going to happen
now does it really matter
well i suppose they would have preferred
having a commission
but they also get credit for trying to
have a commission and then having the
republicans turn it down
so they get the issue either way in
terms of persuasion
i would say that the democrats get the
win
i give the democrats the win on
persuasion
because whether they got that commission
which would have been really good
persuasion
or it got turned down by republicans
that's still good persuasion
you have you have either the change or
the issue
so it was a win-win scenario for the
democrats they took the lesser win
they didn't get the commission but it's
still a win
so uh good play by the democrats
whether you think that's ethical or not
you can decide
but in terms of technique it was pretty
solid
um russia says would you consider
reading
super chats aloud at the end of the
streams or gather them to
well i don't know if there's an easy way
to find them at the end of the streams
um one of the problems with this model
is if i'm
looking at my notes or trying to keep my
thoughts together
and as super chat goes by it's kind of
hard to
divert so i do the best i can so all i
can promise you on the super chats is
they are more noticeable that's all i
can tell you beyond that i don't want to
commit
because it wouldn't be fair to the rest
of the listeners
um so there's a new study
and i don't think any of these studies
should be considered
conclusive maybe not even persuasive
because there you know science science
flails
flails around until it narrows in on the
truth and we don't know if it's flailing
or narrowing at this point
but there's a new study that says
there's no credible
natural ancestor to the covenant virus
meaning it just doesn't look like it
came from anything natural
but there's an allegation that the
chinese scientists tried to cover their
tracks with what's called
retro engineering to make it look like
it evolved or
came about naturally i don't know how
you prove any of that stuff
and if you could prove this stuff
why didn't anybody say this earlier
you know why was it a year ago that you
couldn't even say this in the news
was it just because the news was
blocking it because in person
i did talk to people who said it all the
time a year ago
privately the smartest people i knew
were saying oh yeah you could totally
modify virus and make it look like admit
modified
you could totally do that
so we're now we're just being surprised
that maybe
it's possible we still don't know if it
was modified
but certainly if you're just calculating
the odds
if you didn't know anything except what
we know at the moment
you'd have to say that the odds are
exceedingly strong
in favor of the accidental release from
the lab
no evidence of an intentional release i
think that's still crazy talk
but certainly certainly coincidentally
having a lab exactly where it released
would be too
too much of a stretch for me anyway
all right so um
here are some things we know about
republicans according some
to some recent polls i was reading an
opinion piece on cnn by frieda
ngitis and apparently um
a majority of republicans 61 percent
depending on what poll you're looking at
but a majority uh believe the election
was stolen
from trump and cnn of course
reports this as my goodness how dumb
those republicans are
how dumb they are 61 percent of them
think that the election was stolen oh
how dumb they are
but they didn't ask them is there proof
if they said is there already proof
that the election was stolen well i
think you'd get a different answer
but don't you think that people are
saying in this situation
you should just assume it was stolen i
figure it's just an assumption
because if you have a situation in which
something can be stolen
stolen why wouldn't it be
if it can be if you leave your door
unlocked in the bad neighborhood
long enough can't you assume you're
going to get robbed
you just don't know if it happened
already or if it's going to happen when
you go home at night and
you discover it but you don't have to
wonder if you're
if your home will be robbed right let's
make it more obvious
you live in a dangerous neighborhood and
you leave your car
unlocked and the windows down and you
leave some valuables in your car
do you have to see the proof that your
stuff got stolen
no you could just go to work you don't
need any proof
your stuff got stolen because it's it's
parked in a bad neighborhood
with valuables on the seat and all the
windows are open
and nobody's around watching it you
don't really need proof
you just need to know that that was the
setup
and then you know what happened if an
election
involves electronic devices have the
electronic devices been hacked
there's no evidence of that no evidence
have they been hacked remember there's
no evidence
what would you say about could the
machines have been hacked
given that there's no evidence probably
either they have been or they will be
because it's just like the car with the
valuable on the seat
and all the windows open you don't have
to wonder
if it will happen that's off the table
if is off the table it's only when
when is it still a good question has it
happened already
or is it in our future but if it's just
off the table
if you're if you're a smart person
nobody smart
thinks that if is the right question
nobody
i'll say it again nobody smart nobody
zero people
who are smart thinks
that it's not going to happen eventually
or has already happened nobody
you you can't find me one smart person
who thinks that it won't happen
or hasn't happened one or the other
it's a pretty big claim right
in person nobody will nobody will
disagree with that
maybe on twitter somebody will disagree
but in person
in person nobody will disagree with that
who's smart
all right there's a let's see another
poll
there's something like 23 percent of
republicans believe
in the q and on what cnn calls mythology
that quote the government media and
financial worlds in the u.s
are controlled by a group of satan
worshiping pedophiles
well
um what do you mean by controlled
maybe that's the key word because you
can't you certainly can't say
that there are no pedophiles
in power that's obviously not true
but we don't know if they have enough
power we don't really know if there's
satan worshiping
but certainly there's at least a
sprinkling of them we don't know if
they're in control
but this is used as part of an argument
by frieda
that the republicans are forming sort of
a human bomb
meaning that if 61
believe the election is stolen and you
know 23
believe that the satan worshiping
pedophiles are running the country
and um
you know this is like a time bomb
waiting to go off
and then the third piece of evidence
that frida gives
and this is the fun part are you ready
for the fun part
i was holding out on you for the fun
part uh she's concerned
that on top of this q anon belief and on
top of the belief
of the big lie as they call it that the
election was stolen
on top of all that which is bad enough
it's like a powder keg
there's a there's some suggestion that
the democrats are similar to nazis
and she's worried that if democrats are
unfairly being compared to
nazis on top of these other two beliefs
from republicans that that's a time bomb
that's a time bomb now has anything
made you more happy today than knowing
that democrats are concerned
because republicans are unfairly
comparing them to nazis
has has anybody ever done that before
i've heard of it is it a thing i believe
that
people have compared people to nazis
before
i feel as if that may have happened oh
yeah
four years straight plus every every
republican president ever
and so now the democrats don't like this
being compared to nazis business
now i would tell you my personal
assessment of the risk
close to zero close to zero
if you look at the capital uh protests
riots
whatever you want to call them if you
look at the capital situation
that doesn't tell you that things are
ready to erupt
it tells you the opposite if that group
had gone there
heavily armed well i would be just as
worried as everybody else on the
democratic side
i'd be really worried about that but the
fact that they were aggressively unarmed
i mean aggressively unarmed at least in
terms of you know serious weapons
or didn't use them if they had them it
really tells you what the intention was
the attention was speech clearly the
intention
was speech to make their feelings known
and then they did now turning this into
uh
you know an insurrection and trying to
put them all in jail of course
is a democrat unethical dirty trick
but seems to be working for them
so i tweeted this morning that critical
race theory is racist
because in in lots of reasons but in one
particular reason that it marginalizes
poor white kids because imagine being a
poor white kid
and you go to school and learn that
you're part of the oppressors
not only did you not get any money out
of slavery
apparently your family did not make and
keep their family fortunes from all that
slavery oppression money that they made
because they were white
and they were born into a poor situation
but they're being called the oppressor
yeah it's a double fu it's a double fu
and can somebody do a fact
check on this for me i need to fact
check
because i feel like this might be like a
racist
data point and not real but i want
somebody to
check this out for me is it true or not
true
that black women specifically women
are doing better than white men
at the moment just recently in the last
few years
is that true because i think that
they're doing better
in terms of average pay for starting
salary right
i believe a black woman
being hired into let's say a corporation
on average makes more money than a white
man
i'm saying choose and i'm seeing false
it's something i've seen
but i don't have it in front of me as a
fact somebody says i doubt it
look it up
those of those of you who say i doubt it
look it up now i think the reason is
quite obvious
because the corporations get a they get
a twofer
right because the corporations want to
hire more women they want to hire more
minorities
if you find a qualified woman who is
also a minority
her value is gonna be pretty high she's
gonna have
three job offers you're gonna have to
offer a little bit more to get it
and and solve two of your problems your
your misogyny problem and your racist
problem
so it makes sense like everything i know
about economics
supply and demand right what is the
greatest
demand type the greatest
demand type for labor is a black woman
am i wrong if you're if you're a
corporation and you're
you're trying to do the right thing
you're trying to have more diversity
in every way both in in gender
and in ethnicity isn't the black woman
the highest demand
now i'm not making a joke i'm not
there's no hyperbole here
just straight economics straight
economics
and yeah and if the and if that woman
had been
part of the lgbtq community in any way
well that's a three-fer
a three-four is rare so don't you have
to pay more for a three-fer
you do right because that's how
economics works you pay for
for rarity so do me a fact check on this
but i wondered how critical race theory
would explain if it's true because i'll
need the fact check
but i think it's true that at least for
beginning salaries
just recently last few years that black
women with equal education
etc are higher paid than white men
i don't know for sure but i think that's
true
um i did a little uh narcissism test
and man is this fun once you know how it
works it takes the most frustrating
thing in the world and turns it into
just sort of a hobby
and one of my hobbies is identifying
narcissists by their tweets
and here's how you do it so i tweeted
this and then i'll
tell you the trick i started out by
saying i like the idea of accurate
history lessons all right that's the
part i'll talk about later
i like the idea of accurate history
lessons it's the first thing i say
i like accurate history
but can someone show me an argument for
how critical race theory
is supposed to make things better in the
future
i only see generalities such as quote
helping kids be prepared for racism
so what do you think i accurately
predicted
would be the response to that tweet
the response was why don't you like
accurate history
racist my first sentence was
i like the idea of accurate history
lessons
people who are not narcissists will read
this and they'll say
okay you know i guess we all like
accurate history so we're good so far
and then they'll look at the rest of the
point a narcissist
won't be able to see the first sentence
like actually they won't be able to see
it it's like it wasn't even there
so they won't see the part where i like
the idea of accurate history
and then they attack me oh you're racist
yeah let's hide history
let's not tell anybody about slavery
so those are the ones that i used to
think were just
some kind of weird paid troll but now
that i know that narcissism is an actual
constellation of behaviors once you see
this behavior
you go oh it's one of those now it's
it could be cognitive dissonance but
within the narcissist world
that happens regularly so the narcissist
is triggered into cognitive dissonance
just all the time it's non-stop that
their whole world is a series of
cognitive dissonance
maybe it's not true for all of us but a
little extra for that group
so um when they
when the peacocks come out and this is
the other word i wanted to teach you
about
um when i call these people peacocks
it works way better than saying somebody
is a vulnerable narcissist because
nobody knows what that is
well two percent of you know what it is
but
if you call somebody a narcissist they
just argue that they're not
and they're not even sure what it is and
maybe your definition isn't
the same as theirs no value whatsoever
compare that to calling somebody a
peacock
see have i taught you that visual
persuasion is the best
yes i have besides fear fear is always
the best persuader
but unethical in many cases but peacock
you see it right and it's a ridiculous
bird
and it's just showing off that's what
the the narcissist is
the narcissist only comes into comment
to make you look worse so that they'll
look better
it's a low self-esteem play and if
somebody comes in and says
uh some insult to you generally
without any specifics about why you're
wrong
and they say well you know you racist
piece of crap of course you think we
shouldn't teach history
that's a narcissist but don't call them
a narcissist
thank them and call them a peacock so i
like to say
thank you peacock uh we all we all see
how amazing you are
run along so the peacock wants to be
recognized
as amazing somebody who has better
thinking skills than you do
somebody who has higher ethical
consideration than you do
somebody who's more generous than you
are so
instead of fighting with them which just
gives them fuel
you just say thank you peacock you are
quite awesome and we all know it
my my experience is that they go away
immediately
they just go away immediately all right
here is an explanation that i saw on
i think it was on cnn in an opinion
piece no it's
not in cnn so is one of the founders of
critical race theory way back in the 80s
was explaining its value and here's the
explanation
kids of color need honest information
about society
as much as white kids do so they're
prepared to deal with racism
feigen said we are founded on racial
oppression
where i start with this is concrete
history
i don't even bring in concepts
so the point of it is that
kids of color need honest information
about society as much as white kids do
was anybody arguing about that do you
remember anybody being on the other side
of that
did somebody argue that no no we want to
teach the the good history to the white
kids but we don't need any honest
history for black kids
or people of color whoever said that
so i don't know who she's arguing with
because i'm pretty sure everybody likes
accurate history
um and then the fact that we're founded
on racial oppression
i i take that as you know that's honest
enough sure
um how does it prepare you
how does it prepare somebody
like what do you do so let's say you're
uh you're a black kid
and you learn your history according to
critical race theory
you know so now you understand why
everything is the way it is
now what and so
[Music]
you do what the obvious
implication is what
history is great but what's the point of
it
well this is where we get into marxism
are you ready let me give you my
persuasion tip for the day
for republicans what do you hear
republicans say when they
when they're criticizing black lives
matter or they're criticizing critical
race theory
what do republicans like to say it's
marxist
it's marxist it's marxist
is that good persuasion
do you think that anybody's hearing that
and saying oh i didn't know it was
marxist
i changed my mind no
persuasion value calling it marxist
and here it doesn't matter if it's true
or not true or a little true
doesn't matter has no no persuasive
value
it's completely empty there's nothing
there it's just a word
you've actually wasted your time and
other people's time
by even using it there's just no point
to it
so if you wanted to be persuasive
without using that word that just
doesn't have any persuasive power
primarily because most of the public
doesn't know what to do with it
like i i actually looked it up this
morning
because i wanted to see if i was missing
something like is there more in the
definition than i'm aware of
it turns out there wasn't and so i was
confused
too like why is it why is it marxist
have i ever told you that explaining to
somebody a concept
doesn't ever persuade anybody concepts
just don't persuade unless somebody's
sort of
already to be persuaded and then they
just need a reason and
then yes but if somebody's on completely
the other side
explaining a complicated concept doesn't
convince anybody of anything
you need a fear you need a picture
you need something simple that you can
repeat something that sticks in the mind
those are all the things that persuade
people and more
but a but a concept with a word you
don't understand necessarily
nobody nobody's ever been persuaded by
that
so if you wanted to make this persuasive
then you have to connect it where is
marxism connected to critical race
theory
the best i i know of and this is my
interpretation maybe i'm missing
something big here
is that critical race theory would make
people feel guilty
and they would operate on their guilt to
try to
move resources from the people who have
them to the people who have less of them
is that what it is is it only about
guilt
and getting rid of money from rich
people
i don't know if if the point of it is
that you're saying hey
critical race theory is just a scheme
and the real
the real payoff is socialism and that
you know marxism socialism
using them kind of similarly if
if that's what you think the scheme is
and i
i'm not sure i think that yeah i'm not
i'm not convinced that's a scheme
but you could imagine that it would help
to build guilt
so you could ask for reparations to
build guilt so you could have some
special
special laws or something but i would
say that it's based on
guilt so crt is
specifically a guilt strategy and i
think we should call it that
it's a guilt strategy for the purpose of
moving resources how's that
would everybody understand the seer
critical race theory
its purpose is to make you feel guilty
if you have resources so that you're
more likely to put those resources
in their direction right
but at least that's easy to explain
there's no hard concepts there
guilt therefore you better do something
for me
one word guilt now how many people
if you were to talk to them privately
just one on one nobody's listening
how many of those people would say you
know we should build a system
that's based on guilt like feeling bad
who would think that would be a good
idea versus let's say building a system
based on competition based on how hard
you work
based on doing the right stuff going to
school
wow paranders
says critical race theory is marxist a
subgroup of critical thinking all right
so far that's just a concept so
let's get to the good stuff check the
frankfurt school you're making it worse
the whole idea is to enticing to destroy
the current system not to make it better
okay i agree with all of that you said
but when you're talking about persuasion
don't tell people to check out the
frankfurt school
because they just won't and the few who
do are not the ones
who are going to be moved by animal
spirits and and guilt and feelings
anyway
so just in terms of and and by the way
thank you for that
that was way too generous i would have
read i would have read your
tweet for 10 of that but i appreciate it
um or would have read your comment so
let's call it guilt and it's a system
based on guilt and i don't think there's
anybody in the world who thinks that's a
good idea
privately it's good for the leaders
probably
um all right um
and uh reuben gao on on twitter
summarized it this way said critical
race theory is a wealth
transfer device that uses guilt and envy
to benefit one group
over another so that's what it is it's a
wealth transfer
system based on guilt
now we probably have a lot of systems
that are based on guilt
but i think we have to yeah and somebody
says power
everything is about power everything
everything's about power so sometimes
saying it's about power
doesn't get you to any insight because
it's all about power
everything all right so i wouldn't use
that word marxist if you can use
guilt and envy or real words um
and that will make things fair
all right um
same as uh peta accusing you of guilt
so does peta use uh guilt as their
primary
thing i don't know i don't feel like
peta uses guilt
i think peta
wants to make you feel bad about hurting
animals
but is that guilt exactly it was just
feeling bad
i don't know i'm not sure that's exactly
guilt
but it's in the neighborhood
so do you think that you should ever
make decisions based on
shame or guilt
let's say in your personal life if
somebody says
you did x you know years ago or whatever
do you think you should make your
decisions today
based on that bad thing you did years
ago
well you could maybe make you feel
better
but it's a bad strategy how about a
strategy that is you do as well as you
can without hurting anybody
and then once you've done as well as you
can for yourself without hurting anybody
then you get generous how about that
um who is that simple
i don't know what you're talking about
um feeling shame or guilt over something
you can't control
is useless what about people
insisting on apologies after you've
already apologized once
what do you think of that i feel as if
uh
apologizing has a real use i mean it's a
very
powerful social tool so apologizing
needs to be a thing
but suppose somebody has apologized how
much more do you need to beat them up
after they've apologized i'd say zero
is the right amount i think you've got
to move on after that
laura says the worst thing the left has
done with this is destroying our ability
to agree to disagree
and they've done this through social
media and their censorship yeah
um i don't know it's just the left who's
done that i think it's social media in
general
has just amped us up to the point where
you can't even be in the same room with
somebody who
who disagrees with you let me ask you
this which
what is if you were to make a list of
things that are
uh sort of crazy would republicans or
democrats have a bigger list
because you know on the right you'd have
stuff like q anon
but on the left you'd have all kinds of
stuff
right
apologizing just gives your opponents a
club
apologizing once and doing it
sort of in good form you know or a
proper kind of apology
a proper apology um you say
exactly what you did wrong
in words that the person you're
apologizing to would
understand to be accurate you got to do
that
it's not an apology unless you can state
it in your own words in my opinion
it's not a proper apology so you have to
restate what you did wrong
apologize but then you need to be done
if if you're being beat up forever over
it and you've already apologized and
you've shown that there's no reason it
would happen again
uh then it's just a power move and at
that point you can stop being guilty
marusha says mandatory acr training
would give the crt training would give
the right exactly what they'd want
access to leftists they'd be forced to
hear
arguments from the outside interesting
so
but i don't know that critical race
theory has any room for other opinions
my guess is that once you get in that
room
uh you're not allowed to have
a varied opinion
here's an interesting thought that means
i've got to go
um apologies are useless if you gave a
damn you wouldn't have done it in the
first place
i don't think so no i think people can
make actually just mistakes
you know your judgment is never always
as good
sometimes you're drunk and horny and
tired people make lots of mistakes
you know you i think there is such a
thing as a genuine apology
i feel like i've given them uh
guilt and shame works for diet plans
uh yeah i i think there's actually a
role for guilt and shame
you just don't want to overdo it all
right i've got a good run and do
something else and i will talk to you
tomorrow
