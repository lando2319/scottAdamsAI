so today we're going to predict what
happens with the pandemic using bocce
balls now if you're new to this it's
based on the scientific principle that
all things can be predicted by rolling a
hard ball at a plastic water bottle I
think it was Aristotle who came up with
this first I don't remember
right then but we get all set up here
and as you can see that where perhaps
you can't weigh down there is a water
bottle that water bottle is very far
away if I can hit that water bottle over
then everything will be good so there's
a lot riding on this there's the first
ball
oh no we might be in trouble this
pandemic might last longer than I
expected
I've got a few more balls though there
are eight of them seven more tries to
end the pandemic it's all riding on this
but this lame-ass that wouldn't that's
that's not gonna get it done all right
I'm gonna back up just to make it
interesting
mmm here we go let's send that pandemic
come on come on
Oh very close
all right this ball this ball says we're
all going back to work on May 15th ready
oh no oh well it's not May 15th
I've got a few balls left
I don't know folks sometimes fate can be
cruel I need for it to come down to the
last ball here we go fingers crossed
all right there are only three balls
left to end the pandemic because as you
know the simulation is all wired
together probably doesn't seem like
bocce and a water bottle would be
connected in any way to a pandemic but
you'd be wrong oh no not even close well
do two balls left and this pandemic
isn't gonna end itself so there's a lot
riding on this one one more after this
to end the pandemic I have to hit the
water bottle possibly possibly oh so
close
well people it's come down to this
[Music]
now whoops hold on I know what you're
thinking you're thinking Scott we can't
take this chance and this is where the
rules of bocce come in really important
because it turns out
fortune-telling bocce you can really
play any way you want
so there's your pandemic right there
take that all right
cheating no that's not cheating that's
fortune-telling
it's so different
well I'm not gonna take a chance on the
pandemic are you kidding me
we'll take a walk in the backyard mm-hmm
I'm gonna take you through the the
underbrush you ready I lost my dog
Snickers Snickers all right let's go
imagine you're in a dune buggy
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Applause]
was that exciting sometimes the dog
hides them here Snickers or sometimes
over here if you see any dog in this
picture oh there are signs of a dog
around here somewhere
that did not get there by itself
[Music]
we have the bait and it worked oh great
take the ball and hide it in the bushes
again that's exactly what I was hoping
you would do now I wasn't playing fetch
I just saw you that ball so that you
could run into the underbrush never to
be seen again okay you could actually
hear the airplane I will find her we're
going Oh
spotted
she thinks she's get away but we're
gonna follow her wherever she goes
turns out I've got black pipe back here
though didn't know I had dear God don't
let any sorry I didn't mean for you to
see this I was expecting to be some dead
bodies back here that is the Livermore
Airport you are correct
I think the neighbors are in their
backyard it's just their family said
they're still separating there we go
alright that's enough for now
I just wanted to tell the future with
Bochy stickers stay
good girl stickers come that's a good
girl
all right roll over roll it none of this
is working okay I think we're done here
all right well it was good seeing you
all and I'll talk to you tonight
