okay
well the most
important news of the day and uh i don't
say this lately
if you haven't heard this news report
let me be the first one to tell you
there's a new documentary that
investigates whether bigfoot murdered
some north
northern california pop farmers
no i'm not making that up there's an
actual documentary
looking into whether bigfoot murdered
some northern california pop farmers
um and the investigative journalist
heard a story that still haunts him
about a savage bigfoot attack
so that seems credible enough it's in
the news
in related news cnn will uh host a
special of its own
to determine if racism is the cause of
bigfoot's attack
no that's not true no just the cnn part
is not true
the other part's true there's a
documentary about
bigfoot killing people in my
i state don't know how far away this
happened
but i am in the same state as a
murderous bigfoot
and if you think i'm happy about that
one more thing to worry about i wake up
this morning i'm like
oh what do i have to worry about i'll
see
this climate change could be some riots
what bigfoot
somewhere on the loose in my state and
how many of them are there
and did the bigfoot have any accomplices
right these are the things we need to
know on 420.
all right in other news ron desantis
just became president
in 2024
you need some details on that yeah ron
desantis just became president
in 2024 he's not you know we're not
there yet
but he did something he did something
this week
that if this doesn't guarantee it just
guarantee he'll be president
let me tell you what it is and in the
comments i want to see if you get it
it's not a headline but it will be
it will be a headline it goes like this
this is actually so this is so clever
that it's funny you ever see something
that's so
somebody just does something that's so
smart
that it actually just makes you laugh
because you didn't think of it
here you go so there's a new law
i guess he just signed it in florida
desantis estate and that grants a civil
legal immunity to people who drive
through protesters
blocking a road
you see it
it's over it's freaking over
talk about picking up free money
are you not laughing seriously how many
of you
are laughing out loud because
why did he think of this nobody else
thought of this
oh somebody says a few states have that
now but even so
the fact that he would make this change
or at least sign it who knows who was
behind it
but he signs this thing just at the
perfect time
i can't think of anything that would be
more on point
than this
i'll tell you he just won the presidency
it's over now
um let's see uh
meanwhile minneapolis minneapolis mayor
jacob
fry or frey i don't know he said he said
this in public
compare compare these two political
actions
all right the ron descent is one one one
of the smartest things you'll ever see
politically now here's the dumbest thing
you'll ever see from mayor jacob fry
he said yesterday in public he said this
that's the funny part is that he said it
in public regardless of the decision
made by the jury
regardless of the decision made by the
jury there is
[Laughter]
there is one true reality which is that
george floyd was killed at the hands of
police
that's like the dumbest like a
politician ever said in public
now i happen to think he's right
right so from a purely uh
factual standpoint i think he's probably
right i think it would be fair to say
that he died at the heads of police
which is not funny just the way this
this idiot is treating it as funny
so let me give you my final opinion
on chauvin and george floyd
now of course we've all had preliminary
opinions which maybe in some cases we've
revised as the trial goes on
just the way things should work right
the trial should change your mind or
solidify your opinion that's why we have
them
and i would say that my my opinion has
drifted
from the beginning so here's my final
opinion
having seen i think enough of i haven't
watched every minute but i feel like i
saw enough
of the defense and the prosecution my
final opinion
is this chauvin's actions
probably were
were a deciding factor in floyd's death
probably in other words in my opinion
probably
chauvin's actions killed floyd
now i think that there's a good
likelihood that there are other factors
which would add to the reasonable doubt
question
but on the question of what's most
likely
most likely what he did had some effect
probably an important effect on the end
of floyd's life
did he know it well that's a separate
question we'll talk about that in a bit
whether he knew it but certainly the
thing he did
in my opinion and again we have to have
only an opinion here
because we're not doctors and there's
some there's some difference of
expert opinion right but in my opinion
it's more likely that chauvin did end
the guy's life
i won't say the guy because we'll treat
him with more respect let's say george
floyd's life
was ended probably
had something to do with chauvin however
do you go to jail because you
probably were part of it well that's
where it gets a little tricky
right so i do agree that jacob fray or
fry the
the mayor is probably right
that it was homicide
i think that part is sort of technically
true but to say that out loud when
things are so sensitive is just dumb
this is just
dumb politics all right
we're going to talk more about the trial
have you noticed
that the trolls are out
um sometime this week it was and
yesterday i noticed it when i was
talking with ari cohn
a bunch of somewhat obvious trolls the
ones who have
zero followers and they don't have a
profile picture and they just signed up
that sort of thing so a bunch of of uh
trolls that i had not seen for
quite a while in the political process
they've gone quiet for a while
but they came out recently and
i just got hammered on some tweets about
the
the chauvin floyd case and
it looks like most of them are paid
trolls who is paying them
who are paying all the trolls who are
who are talking about my comments about
the case
and saying that no matter what i say
about it that therefore it's proof
i'm a racist what kind of troll would do
that
and who would pay them would they be
independently operated
it could be could they be democratic
operatives maybe
could be i mean that would be consistent
with what we've seen
and we have a history of that democrats
hiring trolls we know that's a thing
that's a genuine confirmed no doubt
about a thing
democrats have higher trolls for social
media purposes
but is this what's happening
here's another hypothesis
and it's just a hypothesis
china already controls our media
both news and social media
via artificial intelligence
so this is the hypothesis now how could
you prove it
well i don't know of a way directly so
you know short of
some kind of cyber magic where we could
actually determine is happening
don't know if that's going to happen but
here's what to watch for
how often will our news media and social
media
create a narrative which is exactly what
china would want us to create
if it happens over and over again that
our narrative
corresponds exactly to what china wants
it to be
at some point you have to ask yourself
if that's a coincidence
now let's take the floyd trial we'll
take this as one data point
which does not prove the hypothesis
right so
so understand that anecdotal stuff any
one situation
doesn't prove anything but it's what to
watch for
right to see if this was repeated enough
where the patterns
becomes you know hard to ignore
so what would china's if you could
imagine what would be their best
interpretation or narrative that they
would want the united states to adopt as
its main one
well they definitely would not want us
to say that
fentanyl was a big cause do we all agree
china is intentionally sending fentanyl
and large amounts to the united states
to kill our citizens we know this to be
true this is not in any kind of doubt
do they want us to get really really mad
and
understand this is what's happening
china's sending fentanyl and killing
tens of thousands
of people a year do they want us to
think that and really focus on that
no what would china like us to focus on
instead of focusing on china sending us
fentanyl
racism the number one thing and there's
no doubt about this right the number one
thing china
wants is for the united states to think
racism is the dominant
theme in america and that's what we
should be focusing on because it will
tear us apart
and it also makes it easier for them to
put uyghurs in prison camps
right if you're china you want the
united states to have a whole bunch of
racism problems so that they can do
anything they want with their uyghurs
and say look hey
you know you can't talk you know we're
not going to even address what you're
talking about but you can't say anything
right so when you see that the official
narrative of both the news and social
media
at least the the left-leaning portions
are solidly solidly
identical to what the chinese narrative
would be for us if they wanted to give
us a narrative it's
exactly what's happening
is it the reason it's happening
what do you think do you think that
china
already has the ability to do what i
just described
use ai maybe tick tock social media
trolls etc maybe direct payments to some
people maybe some people are just
agents working for for our media
do they have the power to create this
narrative and did they do it are we
watching it happen right now
there's no way to know is there
but um if i had to bet
without knowing but somebody said you
know
gun dad you just gotta you gotta bet
i would bet probably
i would bet probably what we're seeing
is is chinese
china the country not the people
every once in a while i like to stop and
pause chinese people
i love like i love chinese people
americans in china wherever they are but
the chinese government
we've got a problem with so just to be
clear that we're always talking about
the government
when we talk about china in a negative
light
and you can see that i riled up the
obvious trolls
today so look at my twitter feed and
look at the
the troll activity and ask yourself
if those trolls look to be speaking
proper english
so the first question you ask is is the
is the way they phrase things does that
look like it came from an american now
you have to be careful
because there are lots of americans who
don't have english as a primary first
language
but just ask yourself you know
it's just part of the the fact pattern
all right
um
here's a little rule i would like to put
out there just to play with it whoever
tries to control the narrative wins
if nobody else is trying
okay in a situation where there's only
one entity that even cares
how the narrative goes that they always
win
if they're if let's say they're a
superpower or they have some power
anybody powerful who cares enough can
change the narrative
so long as there's nobody else trying to
change it in a different way
in the floyd case
it feels that to me that if there were
some entity that wanted to control this
narrative
that there's not really in some kind of
organized pushback
it's just a bunch of us trying to figure
out what's going on
really i mean i i feel as if
even though we politicize everything in
this country
i feel like at the bottom of it all
the the real most important thing that
americans are feeling is they want the
they want the court to come to be right
right there's probably nothing we want
more than for the decision to be
right whatever that is and
i feel as if china might have a
different
opinion of what they want to happen so
they might have the only one the only
narrative preference that is strong
enough
and they have the power to make it
happen that there's no counter narrative
that anybody's doing in any organized
big
higher trolls use ai kind of way right i
think they're just fighting alone
if it were something that had more to do
with let's say national
uh integrity or defense i would suspect
that we have spooks
who could push back on the narrative
right
and then maybe there's something like
any you know an even
tension there all right let's talk about
the shove shove and trial we now have
both the defense and the the prosecution
have done their final
uh arguments and uh i told you where i
come out on this
is that i think chauvin is guilty uh
well guilty let's say not in the legal
sense
but i do believe that he is likely a
cause
at least at least a major cause of
floyd's death the question of whether
there are other factors whether he knew
about it
those are all go to his uh go to his
defense order guilt
but in my opinion he did something now i
heard from
robert barnes yesterday i was watching
you know fray and barnes on
their podcast which is tremendous by the
way it's the best
it's the best i hate to say it because i
do a live stream too
but if you're not watching uh frey and
barnes f-r-e-y
and barnes talk about this case you're
really missing
the best analysis of it and
i i've seen some different analyses they
do the best job i'd say
and um
here's where i come out on all this
uh my verdict is that i don't believe
shovin was completely aware
that what he was doing was dangerous
now does it matter i'm sorry i spelled
it
i confused the mayor with
frey and barnes f-r-e-e-i
um so the correct spelling is uh viva
v-i-v-a
f-r-e-i and i apologize for for getting
that wrong because i just did the story
about the guy with the other spelling
all right so the um
here's my take i don't think chauvin was
aware
that he was doing it and the reason is
that he did it right in front of
everybody in slow motion
it was compatible enough with
common police procedure the other police
officers didn't seem to
be alarmed or looked to stop him there
was
you know there was some distraction from
the
from the crowd so it's not clear that
chauvin was either smart enough
or aware enough to do you know cpr
what it was called for so my verdict if
it were me
is that reasonable doubt has been
clearly established
at the same time i think he's probably
a big part of what killed floyd and
probably didn't do what he should have
done
can we allow that can anybody have a uh
is it possible to have a reasoned
opinion
that the guy is sort of guilty of
something
at the same time that reasonable doubt
might allow him to go free can both be
true i think they can
right so let's talk about where this is
likely to go
by um now keep in mind that i don't have
a legal background so anything i say on
this
you know grain is grain assault and
maybe we can see
how dumb i am at the end so we'll see
how it actually turns out then you'll
you'll have a better idea how dumb i am
about legal stuff
but my take is this i believe that the
jury has now heard
three separate jury instructions
i don't think you'll hear this analysis
anywhere else all right
but this is my take the jury has heard
three
different jury instructions
and the jury instructions are everything
in this case
it's everything for example if the jury
was instructed
that it doesn't matter what chauvin was
thinking
it didn't matter if he knew it was
dangerous or not well that gives you one
outcome
if the jury thinks it does matter what
chauvin was thinking and that he didn't
know he was doing anything wrong
well you might get a different outcome
right now that my examples might not be
perfect
but these are the things which are
known we know that the defense was
accused
of misstating what the jury instructions
were so that's two versions
one is what the the judge gave the
actual jury instructions
one is what the defense claimed they
were
which was you know debunked and
then there was what the prosecution
claimed it was
which i believe also was misinterpreted
now the judge went to solve that by
agreeing that he would re-read
the instructions and make sure the jury
knew that the lawyers could not
introduce new evidence etc and that they
have to listen to the real instructions
from the from the judge and they should
ignore anything that that a
that a lawyer says about the
instructions i think i got that right
roughly what do you do if you're the
jury
keep in mind that now they've heard
three sets
of jury instructions and the jury
instructions will completely determine
how they vote to the extent that they
even follow the instructions
all right so now you've got three sets
of instructions
and you've got 12 jurors who are normal
americans
give me 12 normal americans give them
three different sets of instructions
what's happening during deliberations
right have you ever worked at any big
company or been in a business meeting
with 12 ordinary people who have three
completely different sets of
really pretty confusing instructions
and it's a complicated freaking thing
whatever is happening in that jury room
has nothing to do with
the data has nothing to do with reason
has nothing to do with justice right
it's just a bunch of people who could
not possibly be asked
to make good decisions under these
circumstances
and somebody's life actually lots of
lives if you think of
you know the outcome there are lots of
lives on the line
and they don't have a chance the jurors
just don't have a chance it's way too
complicated
and three sets of instructions there's
no way they can un
unwind that stuff and come to some smart
conclusion
if you put if you put if you replace the
entire trial
with the best lawyer in the world like
you know whoever it is let's let's put
in
ellen dershowitz just for our example
and just say all right we won't even
have
a jury we'll just have alan dershowitz
decide
because at least he knows the law he can
he can sort out the complications and
you know he can at least handle the
argument
i don't even think he can handle this i
think i think even somebody as
qualified as the best lawyer in the
world would say you know
it's kind of it's kind of a gray area i
gotta admit
now all of that suggests that the result
should be that the burden of proof to a
reasonable doubt
beyond a reasonable doubt has not been
met
in my opinion that standard hasn't it's
not even close
right my subjective opinion not being a
lawyer and not being on the jury so i
didn't get to see everything they saw
so from a different perspective bias
though
it may be i'm imagining i have the same
kinds of biases everybody else
but to my mind
reasonable doubt is easily met
but again i'm not qualified nor informed
it's just my opinion at the same time i
think
probably chauvin is guilty of doing the
final acts
that killed mr floyd um the
prosecution started with an emotional
appeal
appeal in which he talked about the
humanity of
mr floyd mr floyd and you know how
he loved his mother etc and he was
popular within his family
how much of that has anything to do with
the case
how much of the emotional appeal has
anything to do with the facts of the
case
none of it right so when you watch
the prosecution play obviously to
emotion and not even really talk about
the facts of the case
for a big portion of the closing how do
you feel about that
because i would like to know that the
system didn't allow that
i would prefer a system in which the
judge said
everybody understands the human being
shouldn't be killed
you don't need to make us feel worse
about it just deal with the facts
you know did it happen is there guilt
under the law
how is it even legal
this is a real question how is it even
legal
to spend a bunch of time making people
just
feel especially bad when you know the
point of that is to overcome
their understanding and they're dealing
with the facts
how is that even legal seriously
now i get that you need to do a little
bit of it
you know you do need to establish that
we should care about everybody right
he's not he's not a criminal that you
just say well we don't care if he's
guilty or not
it wouldn't matter he must be a bad
person so you don't want that
but it's one thing to establish that
your person is a real person
you know worthy of all the protections
of the constitution
it's another thing to just use gross
emotional
blackmail basically or manipulation on
the jury
while we're all so if you're going to
say to me
what does a travesty of justice look
like
it looks like any of the lawyers trying
to convince a jury to use their emotions
over the facts
and we saw that right in front of us we
watched
that happen how is that cool
i'm sure it's legal but it's not cool
and i got to tell you if i were in the
in the jury
and i had to sit through you know one
more minute of george floyd was an
awesome guy
which i believe is actually true you
know
this sounds like he was pretty awesome
he had some drug problems
and people have drug problems and you
know if you did
other crimes those are other crimes but
uh
so i don't know why that's legal all
right the other thing is the so the jury
of course will be influenced by
maxine waters claiming that there should
be more confrontational stuff
which even the judge pointed out is
probably grounds for dismissal
or what do you call it grounds for
appeal
so here we have a situation where this
is how ridiculous this is
chauvin apparently is probably going to
go to jail
for a different crime did you know that
i heard this on fray and barnes too
that uh that apparently chauvin has a
whole separate
legal problem with allegedly not paying
his taxes for years
so he's going to go to jail for 10 years
or something anyway
beyond that we have an emotional case
not a factual case we have three
different sets
of jury instructions we have 12 people
who couldn't possibly
at least collectively all of them
couldn't possibly understand the
complexity
of even what the charges mean or how to
sort them out
we don't there's no such thing as 12
people who can do that it isn't even a
thing
and let's see what else is wrong with
this
um
yeah well i guess that's the main thing
all right and we know that it'll be
overturned on appeal or at least the
appeal would be pretty solid
so you've got uh jurors who are worried
about their own life
if they're smart you know somebody said
on social media well they were
they were instructed not to watch the
news so they don't really know that
they're in danger
they know they're in danger come on
of course they know they knew before
they took they got on the jury
everybody knew that if you're on this
jury there was a little bit of extra
danger
um so here are the charges now that
you've heard the whole case
let me describe what the charges mean
and see if these apply
there's second degree unintentional
murderer so that would allege that
shoving caused floyd's death without
intent
so no intention is required while
committing or attempting to commit
felony third degree assault
meaning that the third degree is default
the third degree assault was intentional
infliction of substantial bodily harm
so was chauvin in intentionally
inflicting substantially
bodily harm in a way that a reasonable
person could have known
you know death was a possibility and i
would say
no because he was doing something that
has worked lots of times without killing
anybody
and is actually part of police procedure
described as the least dangerous thing
you can do under some sort of
circumstances
so i'd say at least in terms of
reasonable doubt
there's so much of it here that i don't
think a reasonable jury if they were
basically on the facts second degree
unintentional murder i don't see any
chance
now there is a chance in the political
sense you'll be guilty of that
but not on a factual basis i don't think
it's even close
then there's the third degree murder
charge that says
uh that the death was caused by shoving
perpetrating an act
eminently dangerous to others and
evincing a depraved mind without regard
to human life
so an example that i understand would be
shooting into a crowd
you weren't trying to kill some specific
person
but you were certainly not caring if
anybody died and
and your actions caused it did is that
what happened
do you think that um he would that
chauvin was perpetrating and act
eminently dangerous to others now this
is where it gets complicated
he was doing something that only was a
danger to the person he was dealing with
and he had a specific reason to do it
which could be a good reason or a bad
reason but he had a specific
reason that was within the realm of
police
work so i don't see how this could
possibly apply but i guess you'd have to
really be a lawyer to know
but how is the jury going to even deal
with this question
like i read this question and i don't
even know how to deal with it
do you think the jury does all 12 people
they're they're all more capable than i
am at dealing with the complexity of
this
question what exactly are they
determining
are they determining chauvin's guilt or
is the jury
trying to figure out if their own
reading comprehension
sucks
because that's really what will
determine whether he goes to jail
whether the jury has good reading
comprehension
there's your system for you all right
then how about second degree
manslaughter now here we get into
something that
at least has a chance of being factually
proven
and that that charge alleges the show
and causes floyd's death
by quote culpable negligence whereby the
person creates an unreasonable risk
and consciously takes chances of causing
death or great bodily harm
so do you think that what shelvin was
doing
was consciously here because here's the
mind reading part
you have to know that chauvin was
consciously doing something that was
obviously
dangerous but again it was police
procedure
it was considered the least harmful way
to do this situation
floyd was kicking there's reasonable
doubt all over this thing
because in order to say he's guilty of
this you have to know his state of mind
he didn't even testify how in the world
are you going to read
chauvin's mind to come up with he
consciously knew he was doing this
when he did it in slow motion in front
of witnesses with cameras
there's so much reasonable doubt here
this would be the easiest
if it were not political it would be the
easiest case in the world to win
but because it's political who knows all
right
um now i heard some people say to me
that their interpretation of the uh the
jury instructions
were that shavin's state of mind and i
think the prosecution said this too
that what shalvan was thinking or
intending doesn't matter
it's just what he did
but do you think the jury will ignore
will take the prosecution's
interpretation and just ignore what
chauvin was
thinking would you do that
would you ignore that chauvin might not
have known he was doing anything
that could have been dangerous how do
you ignore that
because even if it's technically illegal
and you should go to jail for your
actions
would you on a jury actually put
somebody in jail
if you knew they didn't even know they
were doing it
really because i'm not sure i would
even if i understood the law had nothing
to do with intention
i would still include it in my decision
because i'm a human being and it does
matter
i don't care that it doesn't matter
under the law
i'm a human i'm a juror
see one of the things that many of you
don't understand
is that the law is very specific about
what the jury is supposed to do
but once it's your responsibility as a
human being
and an american and you put been put on
a jury what is your responsibility
is your responsibility to protect the
law
no it's not your responsibility is to be
responsible
that's it your responsibility is to do
the right thing
as you would want it done to you you
know or as you would like the system to
be
so if you think the law is not an
appropriate law
and maybe the law does say it doesn't
matter if you knew you were doing it or
not
you're still going to put that in there
i would
i wouldn't even consider following the
law
if i considered the law unjust
would you and why why would you do that
um so i would certainly would ignore any
instructions that said
that i i couldn't consider my own
feelings about whether the law should
even be a law
speaking of that well let me tell you
what i would do if i were in the jury
and
i got a lot of pushback from trolls
maybe chinese trolls on
on social media here's what i do on the
first day of deliberations i'd say
mind reading isn't a thing and if you
don't know what he was thinking
we're done here that's it
that would be my entire deliberation and
no matter what they said
you know what arguments or what topics
when they got to me
i'd say well you know mind reading
still not real it's still only imaginary
and while we can be right quite often
about people's intentions
we're not often right enough that i'm
going to send somebody to jail because
you think you could do it this time
mind reading not real and then when
somebody says but we're supposed to
ignore what he was thinking
i would say sure you can do that i'm
done
and unless you can convince me that mind
reading is real
there's nothing to talk about right i'm
just dumb
but i would also vote guilty on all
counts
to protect my family but i would tell
the public i did that
so after the trial i would go to the
public and say
i didn't really consider any of the
evidence in this case
i just um i just voted guilty for the to
protect my family
now what did what happened to me when i
said that on twitter
coward people said coward
you see what's happening in the comments
here nice a moral
coward would you do it for money that's
not the topic
so who else thinks that that would be
cowardly
let me let me let me break this down for
you
if you would put if you would put the
outcome of this trial over your family
i i applaud your braveness your bravery
is
is impressive you would actually kill
your own family
to protect a system which is not doing
anything useful whatsoever
and you would be very very brave for
that so congratulations
for all of you i applaud you you're a
better person than me
those of you who would kill your own
families to support
a verdict which has no bearing on
anything and will just be political
congratulations you're very brave and i
wish i could be more like you
now what i would do as opposed to
that impressive bravery which all of you
seem to have
killing your families to gain nothing
nothing at all but you did kill your
family
maybe so very brave of you
here's how i would have played it i
would have broken the entire
system in other words the moment i went
to the press and said i didn't use the
facts to vote
because i was afraid for my family
the appeal wins right that's the end of
the system
so i would break the entire system
because it's all
bad it's it's based on emotions and
politics
it's not based on the facts if you want
to protect the system you have to break
it
the only way to protect our system in
this case
is to just break it now i do think that
if they tried him again
in if they could find some circumstance
to get you know to get the emotion out
of it
and he's guilty that's fine i mean i'm
not i'm not
uh defending chauvin he looks like a bad
good
bad dude to me i don't feel any love for
him
and for those of you who think hey scott
you must be defending shovin because
he's white
you don't know white people very well
white people don't defend
guilty white people it's sort of
a strategic superpower
take take two cultures and you don't
know anything else about them
except one of them punishes their guilty
people and rewards the people who are
not guilty
and the other one doesn't do that
who comes on ahead in the long run well
i think popularizing your criminals and
uh that's probably a bad strategy for
the long run
all right speaking of injustice uh
there's a youtube star named james
charles do you all know him
so james charles is a young man who does
makeup videos so he does
i get i guess um
how would what would be the most uh
non-offensive 2021 way to say this
i don't know what his sexual orientation
is
it's it's at least bisexual but
i'm i don't want to characterize them so
so
it's at least bisexual that's all i know
um
or gay or he doesn't non-binary who
knows what it is what it is
but that's not important what's
important is he does make up videos in
which he has 20 over 25 million
subscribers
he's enormous if you've ever watched his
show
he's really good i've watched his uh
i've watched his content a number of
times christina is a fan
and apparently he's really good with
makeup
so you know he's just sort of
quite gifted in makeup and explaining it
so in terms of talent he's very talented
and in my view he's
he earns he's earned everything he got
he's just really good at it
uh but here is what he is accused of and
apparently has
admitted in part that he did some
sexy texting with some people he says
claimed they were 18 but now we know
they might have been 16.
now he admits doing it but he also
admits it was a mistake but he also
says that he asked them and they said
they were 18. or he assumed they were
18.
now keep in mind he's a young man so
he's not like
you know some old creeper so had they
been 18
they would have been you know not too
grossly end of the range of
you know people get together not like my
situation which
has you all upset um
so here now here's the the kicker
youtube
demonetized them
all right now keep in mind the the facts
that we all understand and i don't know
that there's much difference
in the in how we interpret the facts is
that he admits what happened
he says he was not aware any crime was
being committed
because he wasn't aware of their age
right and how old is he
somebody says he's 21. can somebody
confirm that
because it does matter if he's if he's
close to 18
and that matters right um
so he's admitted it and he said
he wouldn't have done it if he had been
aware that they were
the age they were now he got demonetized
do you know how much money is involved
if you have 25 million subscribers we're
talking about
millions tens of millions of dollars
that youtube
took from him based on a crime he has
not been committed for
so he's not he's not been he's not been
convicted
of any crime not only has he not been
convicted of a crime
but his telling of it is at least as
plausible as the alternative telling
it's not like he has an implausible
story
right it's not implausible
it's actually quite plausible do you
believe that had he known they were 16
he would have left permanent records on
text
or messaging that could be discovered
later
obviously he could be blackmailed by
anybody that he had said this to
so i'm seeing people saying that he's 21
almost 22. all right that matters
so here's my problem again i don't want
to be the guy who's
who you know i know the trolls will come
and say
scott you're you're defending um
people trying to do things with underage
kids no
i'm not doing that i'm just saying if
somebody doesn't know they're committing
a crime
very much like the chauvin case right if
they don't know
how can how can youtube demonetize this
guy
so apparently this is youtube's response
and if this is not chilling i don't know
what is
so this is a quote from youtube
if we see that a creator's on and or
off platform behavior so things they did
not on on youtube harms our users
community employees or ecosystem we may
take action to protect the community
so in other words youtube can demonetize
you if there's something you did in your
private life
that you have not been convicted for
not been convicted for innocent until
proven guilty
but youtube doesn't like it because
they're going to say it harms them
they can kick you off
how many of us are vulnerable to that
well i
am so apparently this this rule
gives youtube all they need to kick me
off
right now for for things i've done
outside of youtube so in other words
if you look at my twitter feed you can
see that countless people are accusing
me of being a racist
because i think probable cause should be
important in a
in a legal trial of course i would have
the same opinion if the races
were reversed in the case of course i
would because reasonable doubt
is more important than all of that stuff
right
but youtube can now quite reasonably
look at my twitter feed
and say hey hundreds of people are
accusing you of a horrible thing being a
racist
we don't want any of that so even though
you've never done anything on our
platform
which would cause us a problem we have a
rule which would allow us to kick you
off
based on you not being quite the kind of
person that we think
is good and we think you might be
dangerous to people on our platform
just think about the power that that has
they have the power to control your your
economic
life and also the power to take it away
based on them not liking what you did
outside of your dealings with them
that were not even illegal or had not
been convicted for
that's pretty bad um
there's a cnn some cnn propaganda
happening right now
in which they're writing a story about
two friends uh
i think it was a white woman and a young
black guy
and they were talking about how they
were treated differently by cops
at a traffic stop now when you hear that
story you say to yourself well i know
where this is going to go
the the police will treat the young
black man very roughly
they will treat the white person in this
case a woman
i think they would treat her less likely
and now we'd see another evidence
that the police are brutal against black
people which is
exactly what you want to see when the
floyd
virgin is coming right so if this looks
like they're throwing matches into
gasoline
they are but then you listen to the
the actual story and it turns out that
the police
handcuffed and briefly detained the
young black men they
they found because there was a warrant
out
by somebody with his exact name and i
think it was an unusual name
you can tell from the recording that the
police realize they have the wrong guy
and then later they found out that
somebody else had used this fellow's
name
when stopped and didn't have id i guess
so there was
somebody unrelated to this story some
other person at a different time
who would use this purpose not perps i'm
sorry he was an innocent guy
this perp had used the innocent guy's
name and so when the innocent guy was
stopped by the police for
whatever normal thing they briefly
detained them
determined fairly quickly that he was
the wrong guy probably just from photos
i assume
and then released him with something
that sounded sort of like an apology
now is this a case of the police
treating this guy poorly
i don't think so don't you imagine that
if the
white person had had an unusual name and
an arrest warrant under that name
they would have at least held the other
person until they found out if they had
the right person
and then released them when they found
out they didn't how in the world would
those two cases be treated differently
you know one is speeding and one is got
an arrest warrant it turns out wrong
it's a wrong arrest warrant but one has
an arrest warrant
these are not equal
so here's here's a comment that's
happening right now
and you want to ask is this a chinese
bot
so let's look at this one so somebody
named sheena 345
m we don't know if this is a real person
or troll says
why is scott so obsessed with supporting
a knee on the neck
for nine minutes
exactly the opposite of what's happening
but you can see that the
the trolls are trying to to gin up an
imaginary situation
in which i was supporting a knee on the
neck for nine minutes
after i just told you it looked to me
like the officer probably killed them
meaning that it was the the proximate
cause the last part of the cost
we don't know if there was anything
before that we don't know if the
fentanyl was enough
we don't know if anything else was a
cause we just don't know that it wasn't
so is that defending it or
are you possibly uh not a real person
and rather a troll who has come here to
create as much
racial animosity as possible because if
all you're doing is trying
to create racial animosity
um i'm going to assume you're a troll
and i'm going to assume you don't work
for this country
because i can't believe an american
would do something so bad to america
i'm sure they would but i'd like to i'd
like to assume that you're
a foreign entity if if you're trying to
make something out of nothing
all right so watch for the chinese
trolls there will be a lot of them
um oh here's and here's another one
steve cortez you all know steve cortez
from
twitter and tv etc twitter has suspended
him
apparently he uh oh i just realized i
i'm going to get suspended if i tell you
this story
oh how can i tell you the story without
getting suspended
for the same reason that steve cortez
got suspended
in this case i'd be getting suspended
from youtube
how can i tell you i don't know if i can
can i well i'll give you i'll give it to
you in broad strokes
i guess you'll have to google it
yourself because i don't have freedom of
speech
in any practical way i mean legally i do
but not in any practical way on this
topic
so let's say that steve cortez
he cited a stanford study
and i won't even tell you what the topic
is because if i told you the topic i
would get
kicked off of social media but it's a
legitimate
study and the stanford and it disagreed
with the narrative
and because he cited a legitimate
at least we now at least a legitimate
organization stanford
just because he mentioned a study he was
kicked off of social media
and i can't even tell you what it was
about because if i were to suggest
that a study exists on this topic that
that violates the narrative
i would get kicked off of social media
according to what i understand are the
rules now
right
it was about masks
it was about masks so it was a study
that alleges
that mass don't work and that the study
showed that
now you know my opinion which is i don't
think there are any studies
this one or any else that tells you
anything i believe all the studies are
pretty close to worthless so um
i would not have been on the same page
with steve cortez on this
but i certainly would have retweeted it
because if a legitimate organization
does a study on an important topic
i would retweet that even if it didn't
agree with my preconceived
notions this is pretty important so
uh and let me let me give you my opinion
on masks
um if you're anti-mask
i know most of you are i'm certainly
anti-mask
for people who've been vaccinated
but if you're anti-mass and certainly
young people
and outdoors people so i'm more
anti-mass than
than mask for most of our situations but
i still think
on a risk management situation you still
want to take them seriously
here's my take on why i still think
masks are important
depending on the situation
fact-check me on this there are no major
industrialized countries
who believe masks don't work in this
context
am i right if we were being fed
a a scientific lie
or even if you know this country was bad
at reading
scientific data and we had gotten the
wrong answer on asks
you would expect that the other
countries would be all over the map
you'd expect that there would be more
countries that just said mass don't work
like germany would you expect to see
great britain or france or germany
south korea japan
australia canada
wouldn't you expect one of those
countries
to say masks don't work i know what
you're saying sweden but sweden
is not the case i'm pretty sure sweden
says masks work
they just would have a different opinion
about you know when to use them etc
i think check me on that so i don't
believe there is
any country you know there may be some
smaller countries and
third world countries but i don't
believe there's any major industrial
country
with a robust scientific community
who is has a different opinion
right can anybody fact check me on that
and i don't think sweden counts and
states don't count
i'm talking about entire countries
now there may be places where they're
playing it differently
sweden's a case where they're playing it
differently it's not a case where they
say masks don't work
so um
just fact check me on this so this is
where i come down on it
i'm no expert on masks but in any case
where there is ambiguity
you would expect that at least countries
would disagree
you could certainly see that people
within countries would disagree and that
wouldn't tell you what you need to know
but there's no entire country
that has a robust scientific community
that's on the other side
ask yourself why are they all wrong
all of them don't know
um so where i am unmasked is if it turns
out
that masks made no difference i would be
surprised
but i would not be wrong
does everybody understand that so i'm
pro-mask
but later if we were to learn that they
made no difference at all and they
actually were bad for us
i would still be right do you understand
that
because it's a risk management decision
and if you see
all of the medic all of the best experts
in every country are on the same team
the risk management says to go with that
team right
even if it's wrong if it turns out
you're right
and you're right all along the masks
don't work that would have been a good
guess
[Laughter]
you could be right by guessing but let's
be honest it wasn't based on your
your scientific knowledge because we
don't have any
all right should be an individual
decision
somebody says oh somebody says steve is
back
uh good
somebody says are you left of bernie the
same way you identify
as black
that's a longer discussion but
how you identify determines how people
receive your message
so from a pure communication standpoint
sometimes it's good to be on the same
team you're trying to
convince
let's see oh at least one person liked
my show today i saw a lot of griping
today
um yeah just looking at your comments
here for a moment
life is risky yeah separate from the
science there's a decision of whether
your individual rights should let you be
massless if you want
um oh okay well some of you like the
show
thanks for that and let's go watch the
rest of our day happy 4
20. i plan to enjoy it quite a bit
and i will talk to you tomorrow
