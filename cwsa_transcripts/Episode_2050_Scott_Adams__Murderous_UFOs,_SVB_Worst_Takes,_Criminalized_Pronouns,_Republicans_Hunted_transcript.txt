good morning ladies and gentlemen and
anything else you'd like to be
welcome to the finest thing that's ever
happened in the history of civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams and
there's never been a finer moment and if
you'd like to take your situation up a
notch and you're the kind of people who
like to do that well then all you need
is that copper mug or a glass of tanker
cell assistant canteen jug or flaska
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure that dope means and the day the
thing makes everything better it's
called this simultaneous Sip and it
happens now
yeah that's good stuff and happy St
Patrick's Day
to all of you
probably racist I don't know it's hard
to know well I'd like to give a shout
out to a prankster who got me pretty
good today and I have to I have to
confess this is a good prank
[Music]
see if I have the answer to getting rid
of the prank yet well looking into it
all right so when I tweet before the
show I tweet the link to the locals um
the locals Community as well as YouTube
and apparently when I do that some
prankster has apparently hacked my
account
and so where it used to show my image
automatically you know taken from the
the locals account the Tweet
automatically replaced it with a picture
there's some pranks to put there of
Dilbert with a KKK necktie
so I didn't have time to do the show
without looking into it we're looking
into it so somebody got into my account
or got into the locals account or did it
on Twitter somehow I don't know so I
didn't even know what they got into but
they got it somebody got into something
they they shouldn't have gotten into and
my first
my first thought was oh I'd better get
rid of this right away and my second
thought was this is a really good prank
that's like a seriously well executed
prank so I'm going to let it run I'll
just leave it there yeah I put it in the
comments it was a it was a hack
but
we'll uh we'll draw some more attention
to me
because you know I hate that all right
I've been asked to look into the video
of Tucker Carlson talking about UFOs
and of course you sent me on a wild
goose chase because I thought it was on
his show but apparently it was some
separate thing he did but I found it
now if you don't know the story
Tucker tells the story of and I hope I
get it approximately correct
that he was cut that he knows or it was
contacted by somebody who was a tenured
professor at Stanford and with some kind
of a brain injury expert and allegedly
Tucker was told by this very person that
he was personally contacted by the
government some years back
to look into the brain injuries caused
by UFOs
what yes the claim
allegedly
is at over a hundred or so here let me
see what's up with that
oh okay already taken care of
so so the the racist breaks already been
removed but it was a good prank so let
me let me just give a little hand
whoever did that
nicely done nicely done
um anyway so the story is that uh this
brain injury expert
was told by the government in the
military that a hundred or so people had
been wounded or killed by UFOs military
people
right over a hundred people killed by
UFOs murderous UFOs now the way they
killed people apparently was with some
kind of you know radiating force that
was giving people brain damage and
sometimes they died if they got near it
and so
people who quite reasonably said uh what
do you think of this so here's my take
if there's more to this story this is
the only part I saw
the evidence that is true
comes from a telling by Tucker Carlson
so the first thing you say is
do you believe
Tucker Carlson
separately I'll ask you about the source
but do you believe that Tucker Carlson
is accurately recounting something that
somebody said to him
I'd say yes
let's say yes I feel confident
that that's certainly not the sort of
thing that most people would make up and
I don't think he would like I see no
signs that he would just make up a story
so so let's say that we believe that
somebody told him that
that's all we know
this doesn't even look slightly credible
to me not even like a little bit
because a hundred deaths how in the
world would you keep that
how would you keep that a secret
I mean really how would you keep that a
secret
and
secondly if you have one source
first of all do you know it's a 10-year
professor do you know it said
a tenured professor who other people
think is sane
has a tenured professor never done a
prank as a tenured professor never lost
their faculties and imagined something
that wasn't there
I mean there's just no credibility to
this at all generally speaking a single
source
is going to be far more likely wrong
than right
would you agree with that general
statement that no matter what this story
is a single source
you'd bet against it I would bet against
a single Source all day long
so who knows anything's possible when it
comes to these UFOs but I would say the
quality of evidence would be at the the
lowest rung of credibility
um
Ben Stein is getting the peacock
treatment today
so he did a little video in which he
said I'll I'll summarize paraphrase a
little bit
he said that 60 years ago when he was
young black Americans looked like they
weren't doing well
and you know just observationally it
looked like they weren't doing well but
in modern times they have at least the
opportunity to have a good life and go
to go to a good school if they qualify
and get a good job and have a good time
and that was his entire entire
observation is that things have improved
for black Americans
and do you think he was called a racist
for that
of course he was he was immediately
labeled a racist for saying that things
used to be worse for black Americans but
they've improved and and under the right
conditions you could have a real good
life
now
do you think that people took him a
little too literally
does that ever happen
do you think that when he talked about
black people that people may have
assumed that he meant every single one
was going to live a good life
because I don't believe that would be a
reasonable way to interpret his
observation it's more about opportunity
you know individuals are still going to
have racism they're still going to have
problems but he's saying there's this
you know golden highway to success and
anybody can get on it
now
I couldn't find anything racist with
that but did it matter to Democrats no
because this is not about racism and you
know that right it's not about racism
it's about taking Republicans off the
field so anybody who says anything about
race
anything
they'll just get labeled uh racist so
they can take their voice off the field
now these are all political things
there's nothing about racism whatsoever
but uh he's getting the peacock
treatment now
and uh looks familiar doesn't it let me
ask you this
uh
what percentage of stories about public
figures are accurate in the first
telling in the first wave of news
you hear a story about a celebrity or a
public figure how often is that accurate
and within the right context
that's close to zero if it's in the
political realm it's really zero it's
actually zero in the political Realm
because what makes the initial story a
story is that something incredible
happened
that's why it's a story they don't do
stories about somebody acted normal
today
they did they do stories about whoa
somebody did something unexpected today
now Scott Alexander which was a
pseudonym for a blogger
had the best take on this number of
years ago he said if something in the
news looks incredible you're like whoa I
can't believe that happened
it didn't
that's that's the rule if you if you
hear the news you're like whoa I can't
believe that person said that
they didn't
they didn't say it that's why it's
incredible because it didn't happen now
they might have said the exact words
quite often
but when the context is removed the
exact words can be actually even
reversed in meaning just by the change
of context so a good general rule for
following the news is that all political
stories are false in the first telling
all of them
right so you say to yourself well that
can't be true because you know the
people who support the people are going
to tell the truth right no no they're
not now the people who support whatever
politician are going to tell the the
untruth that supports them meaning that
they'll leave out the context that's
inconvenient right so any news about
politics in 2023 is fake in the first
telling all right here's the here's the
second question
if you buy that as a general rule of
course there are exceptions right
everything's hyperbole but generally
speaking how long does it take
for the fake news about a political
situation to be clarified so that even
the people who disagreed with it
eventually say okay that does look
different than what I thought some time
ago what's the general time it takes
for a fake story to be clarified
accurately
some Say Never
but I think the never I think that never
applies to some people who just can't be
convinced but of the few people who can
actually change their mind
I'd say one to five years
one to five years
that's the approximate time it takes for
a fake news story about politics to
evolve into something true how long did
it take before we found out that the 50
signatures on the hunter laptop document
were Liars basically how long did that
take two years you say how long did it
take to find out that Russia collusion
was a hoax
three years
something like that
yeah how long did it take for the public
to get
a more complete video about January 6.
a year or two two years
two years right
yeah so one to ten years is how long you
have to wait to find out if a political
story is real
and and I would include as a political
story anything about bigotry
because those are political stories if
the public figure is known to be
associated with one side right the Ben
Stein story is not about racism it's
just a political story because he's a
political figure
the story about me
I don't know if you've if all of you
have realized it yet but that was
completely political
the political right looked at it looked
at the context said well that was
alarming but I see what you did carry on
the political left didn't look at the
context and didn't care because they
only care that I'm a political figure
and they wanted to take me off the
chessboard
so if you think that the initial version
of any story about a political figure is
true you haven't been paying attention
almost never it would be the rarest
thing if the initial story held for five
years you just don't see that
yeah to take you somebody mentioned
O'Keefe take the project Veritas story
do you think that whatever you heard in
the last few weeks about project Veritas
do you think that will be the same thing
you'll understand in five years not a
chance
I don't know what's true and what's not
true but I can say confidently in five
years you'll have a different opinion if
if you're a person who can change their
opinion
so keep that in mind
several years ago I got mocked for
saying Republicans would be hunted
headlines today more than uh I think
this is on Fox News more than a thousand
people will face new charges because of
January 6.
new charges a thousand
a thousand people
all Republicans
will face charges that all of us know
they would not face if they were
Democrats in a similar had they done
exactly the same thing or a similar
thing we know that the Democrats would
not have been charged
we know that
now how do you like my prediction the
demo that Republicans would be hunted
if you said to yourself Scott a hundred
percent of Republicans aren't being
hunted well then you're bad at
understanding life it never means a
hundred percent
it never means a hundred percent
yeah Republicans are behunted by the
thousands now
you can actually say out loud without
any political spin on it the Republicans
are literally being hunted by the
justice department they're looking for
them they're hunting
they're finding them and then they're
punishing them and there's no doubt
about it it wouldn't happen if they had
been Democrats nobody questions that I
don't think there's a Democrat that
would doubt that they would not be for
for the types of crimes they did they
wouldn't be charged
you know the trespassing and interfering
with the public event they wouldn't be
charged for that nobody would be except
Republicans who are being hunted
apparently the Biden Administration is
proposing or thinking about
making it a violation of Title IX
to use the wrong pronouns
so I guess in the school well I don't
know too much about this story but
apparently it would be some kind of a
hate crime if you use the wrong pronouns
uh
that might be the worst idea I've ever
heard in my life
might be however the good news is I have
a workaround for you I did a little
research today and I found that there
are some black academics which is
important that they're black academics I
have wanted to classify racism as a
mental disability or a mental disorder
I Google it it's a real thing and it's
not just black academics or other people
who think so too what do you think do
you think that actual racism the real
kind not the fake kind do you think the
actual reason racism
should be considered a mental
disorder which would allow it to be a
disability
well whether or not that makes sense or
not I'm going to extend that thought
logically to bigotry in general
bigotry in general
so don't you think that
um
somebody who's a racist
it's not that different from somebody
who's just a bigot in general right so
you could be a bigot against let's say a
race or religion but also a bigot
against trans people or you know
non-binaries and and be a big in every
way
if you were a bigot
about everything from race to religion
to you know you name it would that be
considered a mental disorder
there are experts who say yes
so your opinion may not be important
they're experts who say yes
so if I could get an expert to say in
writing and apparently a psychologist
would be sufficient
could it could a psychiatrist or a
psychologist both of them actually could
they give you a medical note that says
you have a disability
in the field of bigotry and they can
even give examples unwilling to use the
correct pronouns
and unwillingness or inability or
inability the patient I can I can
certify that this patient is either
unwilling or unable to use correct
pronouns my diagnosis is uh that they
have a disability because that would be
the kind of disability that would
prevent you from getting jobs and you
know you know operating in a normal way
in society which is what a disability
does it allows you to have less access
to society in some way
so
I think
they're just to protect yourself
you should get a psychologist to give
you a medical diagnosis of bigotry as a
disability now you say to yourself what
maybe I can't get somebody to do that
but I remind you
years ago when activists wanted
marijuana to be illegal in States
they started with medical marijuana and
the the critics said no you're going to
try to get that medical stuff legalized
and then you need to sneak in with a
regular recreational stuff after
everybody gets comfortable with the
medical stuff it's just a track it's
just a track
but there were always doctors who were
willing to say that you needed it for
medical reasons
weren't there did anybody have well if
you were in the right state if you were
the right state did you have any problem
getting a doctor to say you needed it
for medical reasons not your regular
doctor no not your regular doctor but
you could find a doctor
you could just Google it and find a
doctor who would be let's say just a
little bit more flexible than the
average doctor about whether or not you
have a medical problem that weed is just
right for
but most people could get one
you don't think that there would be a
psychologist or a psychiatrist somewhere
who would advertise I will give you a
bigotry diagnosis
so that you could be take advantage of
of whatever benefits you get for being
disabled now one of the benefits is you
can't be fired
simply for your disability
you can be fired if you can't do the
work I think I think that's the legal
right you know if if you can't do the
work with reasonable accommodations you
can still be fired because you still
have to do the job
but I would think that I could get some
psychiatrist to say no Scott you have a
bigotry disability
and therefore you cannot be fired simply
for your opinions
or what you said
it'd be sort of like
you know Tourette's
you know you can't really help that you
shouted out something profane
do people get fired for having
Tourette's
I would think no right because that
would be a
you think yes well I would say yes if
it's maybe a customer facing job but if
you're somewhere where everybody
understands that you have a a disorder
that I would think that the workplace
would allow it
a little more yelling than usual but
basically you make some accommodations
give them give them an office or
something whatever it takes
all right well I think there might be a
workaround if we could get those bigotry
diagnoses and you would be protected
from the law which is kind of ridiculous
at this point all right I'd like to tell
you the worst opinions I've seen on
Silicon Valley Bank
all right the worst one is the so-called
moral hazard argument
that if you allow all the depositors to
be made whole
that would create What's called the
moral hazard meaning you would
incentivize people to take more risks
than the system can handle so you really
need to be tough on people who take the
wrong risks and things go wrong because
if you're not tough on them then
everybody will take more risks
so the thinking here is that the the
managers of the banks
would not have done what they did
except for work except for knowing that
their depositors were protected
except
their Pro their depositors were not
protected
and the Silicon Bank people did
did their bad stuff in the context in
the context of knowing that their
depositors were not protected didn't
make any difference
so we want so some people want to make
sure that future Bankers if they're
going to do something that's let's say a
little risky
that they would know that the only thing
that could go wrong for them is that
they would lose their jobs which are
really good jobs if you're the top of a
bank
you can lose your job and your
reputation you'll be shamed and scorned
in the community but the thinking here
with this moral hazardous stuff is that
those things are not enough to stop you
from bad behavior so you you wouldn't
have you wouldn't be stopped by losing
your job for sure being shamed and
scorned by all your neighbors who lost
their money maybe having to move out of
the community but what would really
what would really make you want to do
bad behavior is knowing that the
strangers
who are called depositors people you've
never met knowing that those strangers
would be made whole
that would allow you to take the risk of
losing your job losing your reputation
being scorned in society and having to
move
so that's the thinking there the
thinking is
that people will stop doing bad behavior
because of people they've never met
might have a there might be some cost to
that
but by the way you can always blame
those other people
if they lose their money because they
knew there was only a 250 000 limit on
insurance I mean they knew it so it's
their own damn fault and then here's the
site the follow-up bad opinion
is that uh
um the depositors need to learn to do
due diligence so it's not just about the
leaders of the bank you have to train
depositors in the country to do a better
job of of researching their Bank
right so you need you need a few big
Banks to fail and all those depositors
to lose their money and that will make
the other depositors say whoa I better
stay under that limit and I better watch
my risk
that is a terrible opinion
because if you teach
if you teach people to manage their risk
with banks there will only be four Banks
left
it does not make sense to keep your
money in the 19th biggest bank
as I said before when people ask me did
you have money in Silicon Valley Bank I
said
I have a degree in economics
I have a
an MBA and I was a banker for years you
think I'm going to put my money in the
19th largest bank
seriously
I mean what that to me as soon as I
heard that anybody had money and then
the 19th biggest bag I just laughed I
said you don't know anything about risk
management
being in the 19th biggest bank is the
worst idea in the world
being in one of the top two
might be better should be but being in
the 19th largest back is stupid from the
bottom to the top there's nothing smart
about that now I get the Silicon Valley
Bank had a sort of a clever situation
where they wanted you to put some of
your personal money in your Venture
Capital money and you get a little extra
benefits somehow with that bank but
that's not enough reason
that is not enough reason at all the
only reason that small Banks survive is
because depositors don't do due
diligence
the minute they did due diligence they'd
all go out of business
it'd be crazy to keep your money in a
small Bank
unless
you trusted the government to have your
back
and if the government wouldn't have you
back in the situation where you know
like Silicon Valley bank then you should
pull your money completely out and put
it in the top two Banks or under your
mattress or some damn thing I don't know
what you're going to do with it like I'm
not going to give you any advice but
it's a terrible take that depositors
should do their own research
and let me give you uh one specific
suggestion I got
from somebody on Twitter who was making
this case that the depositor should do
their their work so here's what you said
and I swear this actually happened this
actually somebody said this in public
in public
on Twitter
this individual said anyone going and
reading a short bit of History could
develop a reasonable risk model talking
about depositors of banks uh so he wants
people to do a short bit of History to
find out about history before you open
your checking account
so how much history should do you look
into before opening your checking
account
with this solid good advice here well
this person suggests you don't have to
but you could start with reading about
the Second Bank of the United States and
Nicholas Biddle versus Andrew Jackson
so the suggestion here is that before
you open a checking account with your
bank you should do some history in the
Deep dive of the banking system
for the through the history of the
United States and especially look at
this case of Nicholas Biddle versus
Andrew Jackson
because what we learn about Andrew
Jackson's time is totally relevant to
today
this is the worst advice I've ever seen
there's somebody who thinks that an
ordinary depositor can research the
history of the United States and come up
with a risk management model
for their checking account
for their checking account
ridiculous
well the uh Congress heard from the
let's see who is it Mr Ortiz who is the
border patrol chief talking about the
border and the situation on the border
and he said about the border border I
like to say border too much
that it's not controlled
this is the guy in charge of it
he says it's not controlled meaning is
open
I mean not completely
but basically we don't have a border
security he also said that Trump's wall
should have been built
and uh I think he backed the
um
the the people who were accused of
whipping migrants on horseback
they were on Horseback not the migrants
you know that turned out to be fake news
and
so that whipping whipping migrants on
Horseback how long did it take before we
figured out that was fake news that was
less of the Year wasn't it
was it less of the year I think I think
most of the people who knew about horses
and stuff knew right away but I think in
terms of the public when do you think
Democrats found out that was fake
never right never yeah I'll bet I'll bet
it's never been covered on CNN though
but it's never been covered in MSNBC I
don't know but I bet it's never been
covered
so do you think you maybe in a few years
there might be a story about it on the
left and then they would find out and
better for the first time
uh Ultra Derrick uh says I I'm confusing
depositors with investing
now if I'm talking about depositors you
know what I mean a checking account
don't pretend that I'm in cognitive
dissonance because I just demolished
your mental model and and now you're
hallucinating because that's what's
happening
I don't think anybody was confused that
opening a checking account is an
investor in a bank
I don't think anybody was confused by
that
all right uh so the border is a mess
um
Rasmussen did a poll
asking people what they thought about
the Arizona
voting integrity
and the result was 55 percent of likely
Arizona voters believe it is likely that
problems with the 2020 election in
Maricopa County affected the outcome
including 35 percent who think it's very
likely now the 35 percent
probably is pretty close to the you know
the serious Republican member
but at 55 percent
doesn't that suggest that a number of
Democrats are now convinced
are are Democrats in some number now
convinced that Maricopa
didn't look
copacetic
yeah we're private
um yeah so I don't have an opinion of
what dinner did not happen there but I
haven't seen any convincing evidence
that there was anything wrong but a lot
of people believe it so there's your
there's your quality of
propaganda
it's good now I call it propaganda
because it's unproof in allegations but
I'm not saying there's nothing there
I'm saying I haven't seen evidence of it
um
the anti-trumpers are losing their frame
let me explain that if you're an
anti-trumper you have this idea in your
head your frame
that everything Trump did was a bad idea
and everything that's the opposite of
that was a good idea
but it's really hard to hold that frame
when you see that Biden did the opposite
of trump and it's just everything went
to hell
and everything that Trump did is
starting to look smarter and smarter
with time as I predicted it would
but here's a
good example of that so on CNN they
often have these political analysts and
opinion people and one of them is Julian
zelazar who you might know is he's like
the worst in the Watergate guy when CNN
needs to remind the public that orange
man bad
they have a few people they bring out
all right we need to remind them orange
man bad it's been two days so we'll need
an opinion piece
Julian zelzer you always say orange man
bad so write us an article about
something but make sure you say orange
man bad
now I don't think they have that
conversation but it feels like it
so
here's something that this deep
anti-trumper said
um
about Biden
for the 2024 presidential election
will establish a similar dynamic because
he was talking about Reagan versus
Carter he says for abide me it will be
important to avoid looking like Carter
it will be important to avoid looking
like Carter meaning that even this
anti-trumper thinks that Biden is
starting to look like Carter
specifically
Carter didn't campaign too much against
Reagan when the hostages were being held
in Iran
so it was interpreted that Carter wasn't
sort of trying hard enough to win the
reality was he was I guess working to
get the uh the uh
the prisoners released
but it was a bad look and and and even
an anti-trumper is saying it's going to
be a bad look if Trump comes in looking
like Reagan
and Biden is looking like Carter because
there are a lot of our minds like have
that model in her head and it's just
going to be devastating for Biden if
that's the model that people have in
their head oh it's a it's a Reagan verse
Carter election version two
in fact the more times you hear is
Reagan versus Carter version two the
more likely the more likely the Reagan
in this example which would be Trump is
going to win
because if you can put into people's
mind that this is just Reagan versus uh
Carter as just a replay
and I have to admit it looks a lot like
it doesn't it
in my mind that in my mind that analogy
fits like a glove
so I don't know how many other people
would be you know primed to
automatically accept that analogy but it
would be persuasive
it would be persuasive I always tell you
the the best story always wins
what's the best story if Biden runs
against Trump again
if Biden wins a second time
would you say oh that's surprising
or would you say all right that's just
more of the usual
so a second Biden win would just be more
of the usual
the most interesting story would be the
comeback story
where Trump comes back and saves the
country from everything that Biden did
that's the better story
now even if you're a Democrat you would
still recognize the better story
you wouldn't love it
but you know what the better story was
you certainly know what it looked like
so this whole Reagan versus Carter
dynamic
could be really important
you know the the more people talk about
it the more it will become the opinion
of the public and then the public will
just start viewing things through the
Reagan versus Carter frame and you won't
even care that Trump is running you
won't even look at the people who are
running you'll just look at history and
say well Reagan versus Carter
and but and I don't think that analogy
is off
all right first uh Republic Bank got
rescued by some banks that got together
and decided to do that so that's good
news
um
I think our banking problems are not
over but they're not going to be a
debacle
I I think it's just a challenge that
needs to be managed like a lot of other
things
so that's my take
um I don't make any recommendations
about what you do with your money
because I'm not right every time
but my opinion is
that we're going to work our way through
it
and the economy will stay intact
um I saw uh Greg Garfield say this
yesterday I guess in the five or the day
before talking about any story about
Hunter Biden
you get Hunter Biden exhaustion
we've heard so much about Hunter Biden
that if tomorrow a news story breaks it
says well a new update to Hunter Biden
murdered a family and then cannibalized
them himself he ate every one of them
himself if you heard that story today
you'd be like yeah Hunter's he's a bad
man
what else is in the news let's see what
else
like we're we're so
um conditioned to see that there's
nothing that Hunter Biden does that
could be so bad that it causes anybody
to act
like we don't have yeah we're numb to it
so it's just like outrage fatigue about
this one thing and here's a perfect
example
so now apparently we have some banking
records that would know that uh
that the Biden's three of them Haley
Haley Biden you know the x of Beau Biden
who died and then Haley dated Hunter
later
um
which by the way I don't have a bad
opinion about
I I know you probably think that just
because I mentioned it that I'm judging
it I actually don't judge that at all
I don't judge it at all and the reason I
don't is that
I'm not them
I'm not them
and whatever they needed to make
themselves happy
that was entirely up to them they were
both legal adults
and it's not like really surprising that
somebody would like somebody who was
like the person they married it's not
like really surprising the fact that
that any of us are grossed down about it
is about us
that's about us
if two people figured out a way for you
know to legally be happy in an adult way
I have no problem with it no problem no
I get that it you know is uncomfortable
for the family I get that it's a bad
look I I get this bad politically but
you know life is short
life is really short and it's really
brutal and when I see two people find
some little sliver of Happiness I'm sure
they liked it while they were doing it
if they find a little sliver of
happiness and it doesn't bother me and
it's completely legal and they're adults
I'm out I'm out you've told me
everything I need to know about this
situation that's such a side so we can
judge him on you know maybe corruption
if that gets proven but uh yeah his
personal life is still his
um I wouldn't want to be judged by any
of that
all right um
so this big Chinese company gave what uh
I guess Biden's lawyer is calling good
faith seed money
to the Biden family which got
distributed to Haley and Hunter in small
amounts presumably because bigger
amounts would have caused higher notice
now what do you think it means when
somebody a company gives you good faith
seed money
good faith seed money that is the most
lawyer lawyerly term for a bribe that
I've ever heard
because this does say it's not for a
purpose
that they were given money for no
purpose
obviously there was some you know
presumed purpose but even the lawyer
can't figure out like a legal obvious
reason that it happened you have to go
with good faith and Seed money which is
kind of brilliant
because what else are you going to say
right if you had to say something
that was pretty good
but it's still kind of ridiculous I mean
it still says they weren't working for
the money nobody gives you good faith
seed money
has anybody ever given you any good
faith seed money hey I'm not going to
ask anything of you but it's just sort
of a good faith seed money situation
so if any of you would like to give me
some good faith seed money
and required nothing whatsoever from me
in return
well that is your right that is your
right
I don't encourage it but you have a
right
to give your good faith seed money which
happens all the time I mean such a
common thing I don't even know why we're
questioning it everywhere I go
people are trying to give me some good
faith seed money and asked of nothing in
return because that's a normal thing
that happens in the real world
um in my opinion
this is probably enough to conclude that
they were taking bribes from other
countries
for Access I don't know what would make
it illegal what's legal or not but
if you had heard this story first
can you imagine
can you imagine how you'd feel about it
if it's the first thing you'd ever heard
about the Biden operation
and you'd never heard anything about
Hunter you didn't know about his
personal life you didn't know about you
know Haley you didn't know anything and
the first thing you heard was they took
all this money you'd be saying send them
to jail send them to jail it's obviously
corrupt I mean after a trial of course
but obviously corrupt lock them up now
but we've been so exhausted as Greg said
Garfield
I can't even get outraged by it
like I tried to I looked at it like
I guess I'm outraged Scott
it's bad for the Republic
you can't do that if you're related to a
current or past vice president or
president
nope nothing
absolutely nothing
I literally am not outraged
I know I should be
like I'm positive I should be but I
don't have any emotional reaction to it
am I alone
are you feeling the same thing like
intellectually you're like oh yeah
that's a major crime but your body
doesn't feel it at all
like we've been drained of feelings
about Hunter Hunter Biden there's no no
emotional content
it's hard to believe
yeah and again if this is the first
thing you saw you couldn't stop
screaming about it it's quite an effect
all right um
here's a claim by Robert Kennedy Jr and
a number of you I think many of you have
made the same claim
that Ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine
were not allowed because doing so at
least by the authorities because doing
so would have made
the emergency authorization
which allowed the vaccinations to be
developed would allow that not to have
happened at least under that cloak
because if you have the treatment you
can't do something risky to make a
treatment if you have a treatment
already how many of you you agree that
that's the reason
that Ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine
were
were depressed
okay now how would you tell the
difference between that which is a
perfectly reasonable assumption I agree
with follow the money
so I agree that anybody involved in
making money on vaccinations
almost certainly
was also involved in talking down
Ivermectin hydroxychloride totally agree
so does that prove that Ivermectin and
hydroxychloroquine were work
does that does that show you that they
work
no
no but I think there's some assumption
that although science is completely
useless
for everything
the exception is it works for Ivermectin
and hydroxychloroquine oh yeah the
science is always lying and it's always
about follow the money but the exception
would be these studies we've looked
about looked at for Ivermectin
hydroxylchloroquine oh yeah we don't
believe in vaccinations because we think
science is all liars and money Chasers
but we do believe in science when it's
this other money chasing and other
people
now I get
I got that you know maybe the people did
the studies weren't directly benefiting
from Ivermectin but somebody was I mean
somebody would have made a lot of money
on Ivermectin I mean it might have been
a you know a generic maker or something
but somebody was so in both cases money
would be presumably behind the science
but for some reason we accept that the
Ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine
are somehow subject to good science and
that was the one time that people
weren't lying to us to make money but in
this other case we can be sure they were
lying to us to make money
now
here's my take
I completely agree
with the fact that the big Pharma
companies were
let's say maybe stretching things and
cutting some corners and didn't do what
we wish they had done and all that
but none of that says the product
doesn't work
also none of the science says it does
the science does say it does some of it
but since we don't believe any of the
science what does it matter what science
says
it doesn't make any difference
so the only thing I'm pointing out this
is not a conversation about whether
vaccinations work is not a conversation
about whether hydroxy or Ivermectin work
I'm not in that conversation
my conversation is if you don't trust
the science
you can't pick winners
it's either all bad or it isn't
and I think it's all bad
so I don't believe anything about the
vaccination science as of today and I
don't believe anything about the
Ivermectin or hydroxy chloroquine now I
heard somebody say but Scott
um
all you have to do is uh
you'll use your own experience so
somebody said I took Ivermectin and I
got better
so the The observed experience is more
useful than the science what do you
think of that is your observed anecdotal
experience more useful than the science
go ahead
a lot of people are going to say True to
this
some some people say yes
yep
there I think there are actually some
situations where it is true
right if you had the kind of thing which
let's say you'd had a rash for suppose
you'd had a rash for 10 years so you
couldn't get rid of it and then you got
a recommendation and you rub some cream
on it and it went away in an hour
if it went away in an hour
after five years
but the science says it doesn't work
would it be reasonable to conclude that
the science is wrong
I think so in in that really specific
case I think the anecdote is stronger
than the science
now that doesn't talk to side effects
but if you rub it on and it goes away
after 10 years of nothing else working
and it happens the same day that would
be a pretty big coincidence
unless it worked
and given that you know scientific
studies half of them can't be replicated
I would say that your anecdotal
experience is much stronger than the
science in that weird little case
but generally speaking here was my
response to somebody who said they took
iverbectin and they got better so
Ivermectin works
so I explained that I got coveted
I watched television and I got better
fairly quickly fairly quickly so I'm
pretty sure it was the television
watching
because I don't think it was a
coincidence I was watching television
which I didn't do as much of when I
didn't have uh covet so I watched a
little extra television rapidly
recovered
anecdotally I believe television cures
covid
that was my experience so that was
pretty strong strong evidence there all
right
um but we've reached a point where we
used to say trust the science
and that actually sounds like a punch
line doesn't it
it actually sounds like a punch line
trust the science because it's been used
as a punch line
a lot of times I think I've used it as a
punchline
it used to be it used to be the highest
level of smart thinking uh I know you
you Savages are using your anecdotal and
lived experience but we smart people we
we follow the science you know if you
don't follow the science oh well I don't
want to be judgmental but that would put
me up here with the smart people and
that would put you down with the Savages
and the wild animals but you know you
don't have to follow the science but all
the smart people do
I feel like it was only five years ago
that followed the science was the most
respectable thing you could say and that
today you sound like a freaking clown
anybody who follows the science because
the science said so you just have to be
a clown
yeah so we've actually replaced follow
the science with follow the money
and there's a large
proportion of the public who believes
that gets you a better answer and so
they say we followed the money on the
vaccinations and we didn't like what we
saw
and we ignored the science because if
you follow the money you don't need the
science the science isn't you know
dependable so they said we got the right
answer because we found that the people
making it were doing sketchy things that
were all directly related to making
money
yeah except here's my problem
they would have done all of those
sketchy things even if it works
even if this even if the vaccine is a
good idea they would have done all the
same sketchy things
they still would have wanted Ivermectin
and hydroxxic chloroquine to go away
they still would have wanted all their
competition to go away they still would
have wanted the government to guarantee
it they still would have wanted to get
the government to say they can't be sued
they still would have wanted the
government to write their massive checks
they still would want you to think that
the shots were more
more let's say more safe than they were
so the fact that the big Pharma did
every sketchy thing you could do
clearly just to make money it doesn't
say anything about the quality of the
product because they would do that
whether the product worked or not and I
don't believe that everything they've
ever made doesn't work
I just think some of it doesn't
all right
so follow follow the money and follow
the anecdotes is what we have left
because the science has done such a bad
job now here's an example of The High
Ground maneuver I tweeted this and it
ends the conversation
or should on Tick Tock and being banned
all right so Congress is noodling about
how do we ban this thing or do we ban it
you know can we you know take out the
data part and make the data safe and
what if Chinese still owns it but is
there any way we could get some
guarantees that there wouldn't be any
bad behavior but you know it's also
about persuasion that they could
persuade this it's not just about data
and should we ban it or ban it later or
ban just some things or something so
that's what I call being in the weeds
that that's being in the weeds
once the Pentagon and the Department of
Justice have weighed in and said this is
a national security risk and it's not a
small one
which they have the Pentagon
and the Department of Justice
have agreed it's a major Homeland
Security risk let me explain how
decisions are made by people who are not
absolutely incompetent
when the Pentagon tells you it's a
national security risk you immediately
cancel it in America and then you take
your time figuring out if that was the
right answer
we're doing it backwards we're talking
about all the ways you could do it and
if you do it no
that is the wrong way to make a decision
the right way to make the decision is
first you remove the the risk
and then you make sure that it was the
right decision and if it was the wrong
decision well you can reverse it
you can reverse it oh so what people
don't have Tick Tock for two weeks
who's going to die from that
this is the easiest decision in the
world
just the simplest dead simple decision
ban it first figure out the specifics
later and then I will add to that don't
let 16 year olds back on it no matter
what right maybe 18. don't let minors on
it just no matter what if you're going
to make any change at all you know do
that one that's the obvious one
now you tell me is this a hard decision
why is anybody even having a
conversation
just ban it and then figure out if you
made the right decision that's the
correct order
and nobody will argue with this by the
way you won't see anybody say you know
we really should let this National
Security risk you know continue until we
get the right answer
that we'll never agree on anyway
crazy
crazy stuff all right
um
I think in some ways all right look here
in some ways this is why I think
somebody would want to cancel me
because this is the sort of persuasion
you know I tweeted this this is the sort
of persuasion that actually moves the
needle right not everything I say has
any impact on the world but every now
and then
um I can develop a high ground position
that really will change opinions
and I would argue that the first time
you heard decide now and then figure out
if it was right later if you had not
heard that but some of you were still
saying you know
we better make sure we do this right it
doesn't have to be today you know let's
let's make sure we've talked it out I'll
bet a lot of you were thinking that that
was reasonable
but the moment you hear if it's a
national security risk stop it
immediately and then figure out
what you did the moment you hear it you
you adopt that opinion that's called The
High Ground maneuver persuasion
so
people who are as who have this level of
persuasive technique I'll just call it
technique it's something anybody could
learn
are dangerous they're dangerous because
I can move maybe a hundred thousand
votes in in a day
or opinions not votes it's hard to build
votes but I could probably move a
hundred thousand opinions in a day
and I'll bet I have oh you know I don't
have no any way to measure it but I'll
bet I have I'll bet I have I've got a
million a million followers on Twitter
who who who could have seen this tweet
do you think a hundred thousand wouldn't
say oh yeah
yeah if all not all Millions hit but if
a million saw it you don't think that a
hundred thousand would immediately say
yeah that's right just banned it
immediately figure it out at least I
think all I think all nine hundred
thousand would say it immediately but at
least a hundred thousand
so I would claim that I can move a
hundred thousand people's opinion in a
day
that that's my claim minimum I think I
could move a million on a good day
but I could move a hundred thousand in
one day
and and it's not some it's not because
I'm special it's because I have a
specific Talent set
anybody who had the same Talent set I
think could do the same thing
I mean sirovich could do it you know if
you want to name some names soon if it's
you could do it you can move a hundred
thousand people in one day
um
pandemic conspiracy theory
people are still angry or disappointed
in me that I do not accept the
conspiracy theory that says the pandemic
was planned from the start and the
technical problem
so people are mad that I haven't
accepted that the pandemic was a
pandemic it was planned from the start
the the virus was created for this
purpose and that the people conspiring
did it to gain power and money
now here's why I don't believe the
conspiracy theory
the people who believe that conspiracy
theory would you agree have a low
opinion low opinion of the people
involved would you agree
the people who accept the pandemic
pandemic as being all planned would you
agree that they have a low opinion of
the people involved with all that okay
very clearly right now here's your
mistake
about me you believe that my opinion is
based on having a higher opinion of
those people
W because I think they didn't do that
so does that look like a higher opinion
oh no they wouldn't do that
no I have a lower opinion than you do
much much lower I don't believe that
there's anybody in large numbers who
could coordinate this and be undetected
so far now you think you've detected
them but not in any you know legal legal
way obviously
I don't believe people are that smart or
not even close to that smart so here's
my rule on conspiracies
a conspiracy in which one person and one
person only knows about the conspiracy
could be
that's something I might believe
conspiracy with three people involved
yeah yeah three three people had common
interests maybe they could keep a secret
yeah I'll take three
about 10 people
well when you get to 10 people the odds
that one of them doesn't
you know break out of the the thing and
tell it gets smaller but you can still
imagine 10 people
you know coordinating certainly like if
it's a mafia thing or something yeah
yeah you can imagine 25 people
but I can't imagine hundreds
you know there's no conspiracy theory
where hundreds of people have to keep a
secret that's just not a thing
and I think the pandemic
I don't know if it'd be hundreds but
it's not five people it would take more
than 10 people you know who would have
some connection to the conspiracy I
think it would take
a hundred or hundreds
so no I don't buy any conspiracy theory
in which hundreds of people would have
to keep a secret
it's not impossible
it's not impossible
somebody said D-Day D-Day was before
internet
yeah before the internet and uh and if
the uh everybody's on the same side
you'd probably keep a secret
but in the in the real world people are
too fractured you know all it would take
is
you know one member of The Conspiracy
Theory to disagree politically with
somebody else in the group and then
they'd narc on them
so the only thing uh so I don't want to
really have a conversation about whether
it was or was not a plan demic
here's the only thing I want to sell to
you
never assume that my opinion of people
is higher than yours
you'll always you'll always be missing
the right context always assume that I
think people are even less capable than
you do
generally speaking on average on average
you know some people are highly capable
of course
all right
um
did I tell all of you about the prank on
me or was it just on locals
YouTubers did I tell you about the prank
somebody played on me this morning
I was only locals
oh it was a really good prank
did anybody see it
normally I wouldn't like it if somebody
does a prank on me if it was just like
clumsily done but here's the prank so
every every day I tweet
um
I tweet that I'm going to be on here
doing the live stream and I tweet the
the URLs when I tweet the uh the address
for the
scottadams.locals.com it used to put my
profile picture up there that I have on
locals so it would just you know
automatically grab that image and put it
with the the Tweet but somebody hacked
me somehow I don't know who or what they
act and they replaced my profile picture
with a picture of Dilbert wearing a KKK
necktie
and when I tweeted it you know I don't
get to see it until after it's it's
posted so that this is why the the prank
is so good
when I tweeted I'm just tweeting a link
so I don't see the image the image is
added after the fact so the fact that I
would have to tweet it before I would
know that it would put a it would put a
KKK image there
is pretty good and I don't know how they
got into it like I don't know what they
hacked or if it was an Insider it could
have been an Insider I don't know but uh
and they're they're looking into it now
with locals to find out
but
even though the prank is on me
would you agree that's pretty good prank
I gotta say that's
that's a plus
a plus
nicely done
I liked it so much I just kept it up
there
[Laughter]
I don't know if it'll change
automatically if they they fix it I
don't think it does but uh
I just keep it up there
see what happens
all right
um I put it in a comment that I knew it
was a prank
so
um I think I mentioned I was going to
talk to Larry Elder for his show but he
had some construction the neighbor was
doing construction so it was too loud so
we postponed that till Monday I think
Reuben should comment on it no nobody
needs to comment on it let's just let it
be what it is yeah I wouldn't make it a
national story or I think
by the way it's not like you know it's
not like Dave Rubin was behind it or
anything
I don't think so
uh
wouldn't have noticed the tie if I
hadn't pointed it out
well that's probably part of the prank
part of the prank is probably that
maybe I wouldn't notice
I've already discussed this
what did I already discuss
oh I told you about well you told me I
didn't maybe maybe I said it early
oh I told you about the prank okay so I
know I told it to the locals people
before I got on it's hard to remember
what you've just said
versus what you plan to say
it's actually hard when you when you
give a lot of public speeches the most
terrifying thing is that you say a
sentence and you say to yourself as
you're on stage
did I just say the same sentence twice
because you can't tell after a while you
just don't know did I say that yesterday
was that today did I just say that
um
yeah all right that's all for now I'm
gonna go talk to the locals people
privately because they're special the
only place you can find the Dilbert
cartoon Dilbert reborn is now on the
scottadams.locals.com platform but if
you're on YouTube you should be hitting
that subscribe and like button all that
other stuff because it's good for all of
us it's good for everybody
and
there's a lot more content there I've
been doing a lot of robots read news
Comics as well
lots of stuff as well as my over
how many micro lessons do I have now so
on the locals platform I put these
little two to four minute lessons that
give you a life skill like a total life
skill a thing you can use that's useful
in two to four minutes
and there I think there are over 200 of
them now yeah it's 200 or so so believe
it or not I came up with 200 things
that I could teach you that would be
useful right away
and I'm adding to them as we go I'm
going to add another one today probably
and that's All For You YouTube I'll see
you tomorrow
thanks for joining
