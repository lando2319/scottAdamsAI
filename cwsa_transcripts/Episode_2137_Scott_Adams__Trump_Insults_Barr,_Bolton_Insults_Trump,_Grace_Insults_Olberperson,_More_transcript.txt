good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization and
possibly robots too and if you'd like
this experience to go to levels that I
know you deserve and you know it too all
you need is a cup of mug or a glass of
tanker Chelsea's time the canteen
geographlask a vessel Liberty God
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
the other day the thing that makes
everything better is called
simultaneous shipment happens now go
ah
yeah that's the stuff
well today I'll be talking about uh
Trump insulting Bill Barr uh John Bolton
insulting Trump Nancy Grace insulting
Keith olberman sadist trolls insulting
everyone in an actress insulting a
DeSantis
for a time when we used to have news
remember that
would lose like it's called n ews news
news
have you heard of it now it's pretty
much just people insulting people and
then reading a page about it
it doesn't really feel like news anymore
um
here's something interesting that's
happened I know a lot of you are you
know boycotting this or that but have
you noticed that the Fox news page just
completely stopped following news
it seems like they gave up an old news
thing
didn't they I mean CNN's news is just uh
opinion pieces insulting Trump
and then some things you already knew
happened uh there's still a war in the
Ukraine well thanks for the Deep
investigative uh look there
so I don't know if it's is it purely
economic I think there's an economic
problem right they just don't have
investigative anything
it looks like they gave up on their
investigative work
and all they do now is report the things
they saw in other media
that I think Fox News just does the same
thing I do just read other media and
talk about it
it doesn't look like anything new
but CNN's no better
all right um
so Elon Musk has invited Alex Soros onto
his spaces I don't know if he's
responded yet to the offer
but the question will be
uh Progressive DA's and whether now that
he's taking over for his father
whether he will be still
um
funding these Progressive DA's now we do
know that the sun is quote more
political than his father
which you know by itself is fine because
our system allows people to be as
political as they want perfectly legal
and ethical
but the funding of the DA's I don't
think
I don't think
it worked the way any of the Soros is
imagined it should or could work
so I would be amazed if he could go in
public and say yeah we're going to do
more of this
so that's why I think this musk offer is
so important I love the fact that the
the news can be doing its celebrity
insulting stuff
and the the only thing that was
important to us this week
is what Elon Musk offered to solve
which is what's up with these
Progressive DA's ruining our cities
and so Moscow offers
to put Alex or Alexander I don't know
what she is Alex or Alexander don't know
which one he prefers Sorrows on and to
actually just talk about it and probably
solve it
actually just solve it it's so different
than the regular news
I feel like when you watch Regular news
it's just going to be people talking at
you and you don't know who was lying
but I feel if if musk brings somebody on
to talk about a specific topic they're
trying to actually solve it
which would be interesting because
because you wonder if
um Alexander Soros has the same sources
of information same
I don't know same inputs as the rest of
us do and wouldn't it be interesting to
find out and wouldn't it be interesting
to see him defend it
you know defend what they've done so far
I mean I I don't think that could be any
more useful or entertaining at the same
time
so I'm loving uh must doing that
um apparently musk has also invited Don
Lemon
and Rachel Maddow to do shows to do
their shows on Twitter
promising them that they would have much
bigger audience than they have right
there
and I like I don't think either of them
will say yes but I like musk's instincts
to make sure that he's always on the
side of free speech and on the side of
any political party
so there you know there's always so much
you can do to look at objective
but at least that's in the right
direction it's not like you see MSNBC
you're offering me to go on their show
right he's the only one doing it yeah
and and I would say that these are
legitimate offers because you know Don
Lemon and Rachel Maddow are completely
associated with one side
so there's you know it's not like it's
not like they say it's not like he's
looking for the weakest member of the
other side you know that trick oh yeah
we have both sides we've got uh Hannity
who's amazing and then Combs who's
really bad on TV he's the other side
yeah the the Fox News trick which works
so well
all right um
so that's good
um
so tweet by Jonathan shedler talking
about a new study
that suggests that people who publicly
shame and Dogpile on social media are
not motivated by moral outrage or desire
to do good huh
huh
is that true what could they be
motivated by the people who shame and
Dogpile on social media what
what could it be what could it be
what could that be
what what what oh well the study says it
could be sadism
that they just get off of the cruelty
uh complete surprise
is sort of what Jordan Peterson's been
saying for a long time
we figured out a way to boost the worst
Among Us
it was it was like we made a tool to
make sure sadists could get maximum
contribution into society
and
to me this helps
so I've got a troll who's been bugging
me lately and you probably say to
yourself well why don't you just block
them
just block them it's easy or mute them
or something
but this particular troll is too fun
I'm having trouble torturing him in
public because he you know didn't
understand my situation so he's flailing
around
so sometimes torturing the troll in
public
is good clean fun and I recommend it
but uh you know don't try it at home if
you're not a professional
all right yeah people on social media
are mostly broken people
um I I hide my sadism behind my
profession
no I'm not a sadist but when I'm on
social media I'm going to go after
people hard if they deserve it I mean if
they have a cup
um but I tell myself it's all for good
reasons
so the libs of tick tock had a tweet
about a Denver city council member candy
see the Baka
who is running for re-election I think
she lost but she was suggesting that
white-owned businesses should be tax
extra to give that money to Black owned
businesses
and she lost imagine that
that open racism was not as popular as
you thought
so candy Chewbacca
lost her uh re-election bid
bummer
do you think we've reached Peak wokeness
now I've said we have what do you think
now just to clarify Peak wokeness
doesn't mean there will be less of it
right that's very important now
things
Owen hopes Scott watches his show and
gives his opinion
okay
um
what was I talking about
I don't know your comment got me
sidetracked there p k wokeness yeah so
Peak work just in my opinion means that
you can now openly mock it
that's what the peak is the peak isn't
that there will be less of it it's just
that we can now openly mock it without
without the same risk that you had
before
and I think that's true in every domain
you can just openly mock the the
walksters
all right
um
so Trump has responded to Bill Barr who
apparently thinks some of the charges
are valid the
the Mar-A-Lago boxes stuff
and he said that bill Barr is a gutless
pig
a gutless bag
I don't even know what that means
I mean it feels like those are opposites
like a pig is something with a big gut
but he's not even as good as he's not
even a good pig
he's like a gutless pig
that would be like a boneless chicken
no boneless chicken would be good but a
gutless pig well I guess you have to gut
the pig before you eat it I don't know
it's all very confusing I don't know if
it's his best work but I like to note
that all of the news today is about
people insulting other people
so it's not important in any way
but it's just the only news we have is
who insulted people it's a very light
news day today I have to warn you
no more UF no more UFO news
we have a lot of in this country would
you agree red flags
would you agree that you see a lot of
things that are starting to develop that
you say wait a minute that's a little
bit of a red flag isn't it you know like
you see freedom of speech being
curtailed and you say whoa whoa whoa
that's a red flag it's a red flag but I
would like to suggest there's one red
flag
that's in front of all of us that's the
biggest of all red flags
to the point where there's never been a
bigger red flag
and here it is
the sitting president of the United
States who is running for re-election
doesn't feel the need to campaign
he's one of the least popular presidents
of all times the polls should say that
he would lose and he doesn't feel the
need to campaign
that is the reddest of all red flags
ladies and gentlemen
there is nothing scarier
than the guy who's behind
feeling he doesn't need to campaign
because if the guy who seems to be
behind in the polls does no effort to
campaign and he wins
it's gonna get ugly
it's gonna get ugly there is no bigger
red flag in the country than the guy
who's running for re-election
from behind
is not campaigning
now we imagine that the reason is that
you know his surrogates do it and he's
doing his job and you know maybe he's
all
less of it we I don't know about that I
I think that under every situation you
would campaign unless you thought you
didn't need to
am I wrong you would campaign unless you
thought it wasn't going to be a real
election
you know with actual voting making the
difference
it doesn't look like he believes it's a
real it's a real election coming up and
if the president of the United States is
acting like it's not a real election
there's no bigger flag than that
that's the biggest of the biggest of the
biggest
you cannot get a bigger red flag than
the guy who's behind
and president
not campaigning
and you could try to sell us about you
know he's busy or you know his health is
not 100 but he'd be fighting for
president you could try
but I'm sorry that's not the message I'm
getting
the message I'm getting is that you've
already fixed the election
now I I don't have any evidence
whatsoever to back up you know that kind
of speculation I'm just saying that's
the message they're sending us
how how else would I interpret this
because I don't interpret it as he's too
weak you know physically weak because if
that were true he would drop out
am I wrong if he were unable
and they know he'll be unable for the
next year
he would already drop out because they
want as much time as possible to get you
know a good substitute in there
so
I just don't know what to say about this
except they're sending a screamingly
you know direct message to us that the
election won't be real
I I don't know there's nothing there's
nothing redder than that red flag that's
all I have to say about that
all right um
a Hamilton actress
uh
got on stage at some Tony Awards or some
stupid award thing that we don't care
about
and uh cleverly referred to Ron DeSantis
not as the governor of California but
hahaha the Ku Klux Klan Grand wizard
and the audience did they laugh oh how
they laughed
oh how they laughed at the cleverness
involved in that government
um
but I'd like to remind you if you
believe that getting rid of trump
gets rid of the baggage
that's not a thing
that is not a thing
you you could eliminate from your
consideration the fact that Trump has
baggage
because they would just transfer all
their over to DeSantis and he
would be the grand wizard of the KKK on
day one when he got ahead of trump in
the polls
there is no difference in how much
baggage a republican brings to the race
no difference because the Democrats are
just going to see the ridiculous MSNBC
version of all the candidates
and to them it looks like they all have
baggage
so yeah I I would say the the number one
biggest reason for not voting for a
trump
has just been taken away by the
Democrats the Democrats have removed
your best reason to not vote for Trump
that he's trouble and all of his baggage
will you know come blowing back on you
because you know you're just trying to
mind your own business and be a
you know just be a candidate or just be
a citizen and suddenly it's your fault
too I mean right now
if you wore a make America great again
hat it would not be safe to go in public
would you agree
would you agree that most places in the
country it would not be safe to be in
public
supporting your choice of president
somebody who was president
now what do you think if you were a
DeSantis hat after he became president
let's say he becomes president now you
go outside where your DeSantis hat safe
you're all safe now because nobody's
going to think you're uh KKK wizard
right no no they will paint him as a KKK
Wizard and it will be unsafe to wear his
 hat outside
you can't even go outside as a
republican if you have an opinion
that's the country you're living in you
can't go outside
you can't go outside
safely
all right
um John poulton says that Trump should
drop out of the race
and I don't think Trump's ever had a
better week
how would you like to be running for
president and have John Bolton to say
that uh that he backs your opponents
isn't that like the best day ever
yeah and and I saw some pushback from
Democrats saying whoa whoa whoa you have
to remember that Trump actually hired
Bolton and that would be an indication
of how bad he is at judging people so
Trump's a bad judger of people because
he once hired Bolton
except
did you hear how Trump described the use
of Bolton
he was so insane you know in warlike
that Trump used him just as a threat he
would just put him in the room to scare
people
he didn't even use them as like a an
advisor
he uses him he literally used him as a
scarecrow
literally a scarecrow
he just put him in the just put him in
the corner and said
you know you better make a deal with me
because well look at the Scarecrow
you're not going to want to make a deal
with the Scarecrow because the Scarecrow
wants to just bomb you I might give you
some options you know you talk to me
I'm a deal maker maybe we could work
something out but if you don't make a
deal with me uh look at that scarecrow
scarecrow is going to get you
scarecrows under the bed
John Bolton's under your bed watch out
watch out he's in your closet he's under
your bed
and I he's going to get you if you don't
make a deal with me
so I'm not sure the Democrats quite
understood how Trump was using John
Bolton there
um Keith olberman questioned Nancy mace
representative Nancy mace when uh she
was making some comparisons to Hillary
uh Hillary's uh email getting rid of her
email and destroying some devices of the
hammer and uh oliverman said that she
was hallucinating and those things did
not happen
now
Nancy base of course gave him the link
to his own you know favorite Network CNN
to show him that even CNN says it
happened
it very much happened she did destroy
devices
government devices phones I think with a
hammer
you know she had people do it but the
same thing and olberman was not aware of
that
he acted like somehow the news hadn't
gotten to him
which is weird
so uh
so Nancy Grace
responds she goes fact a hammer was used
to destroy government devices in Hillary
Clinton's server was wiped out with a
program called bleach bit all fact check
by CNN link below and then she says in
her tweet maybe your weed is stale who's
hallucinating now
maybe your weed is stale
this is some good insults today
all right we got your gutless pig
we got your weed to stale
we got your Ku Klux Klan instead of a
governor yeah yeah we got some good
insults today
I hear some insults to Anderson Cooper
um who was it who said I think RFK Jr
was backing this comment somebody said
that 10 million of Anderson Cooper's 12
million dollar annual salary is from
Pfizer
now I think that was meant to be
hyperbolic in the sense that Pfizer
doesn't write him a direct check but if
Pfizer is 80 of your advertising during
a show it would not be wrong to say that
80 of his pay
comes from Pfizer that's not exactly how
it works because the the revenue of the
network
comes from different places and a lot of
it is Carriage fees did you know that
how many of you know
what the carriage fees are
for a network for a cable news show like
CNN or Fox News let me explain it
if you were to order a cable cable
service to watch TV you would want to
make sure that you got at least the
basic channels
now
so you'd go to Fox and you'd say hey we
want to carry you for free
for free you don't even pay anything
and we'll let people see your show with
all your advertisements now you'd think
that Fox News would say yay I have more
customers and they'll get to see my
advertising
so the more customers to see me the
better because we're selling advertising
but
Fox News and CNN and the other news
sites are so important to any cable
operation that the cable company pays
Fox News to be on their Network
and that's actually I think where they
get most of their money I don't think
it's advertising and I don't think it's
directly based on how many people watch
it
although they could probably charge more
if more people watch it so
just know that that's where they get the
money it's not it's not in advertising
models so much as a charging cable
companies to have you on there modeled
um but yet it's true that uh Pfizer is
doing most of the advertising on
Anderson Cooper's show it would not be
possible for Anderson Cooper to disagree
with Pfizer
would you say that's fair
we don't we don't assume there's any
scenario in which you would say
something the Pfizer disagreed with
so is that news
are you really watching the news what
one of the biggest areas of news is
Pharma
and the guy who's reading it to you
cannot say something that his sponsor
would not like I mean that would be just
too expensive
all right
um
here's an interesting Factor you do that
North Korea is always trying to hack
everybody's crypto
but apparently they're so good at it
that it's funding their nuclear program
uh like half of their nuclear program is
funded by crypto hacking
now who had that on their prediction
card for cryptocurrencies uh I think the
cryptocurrency will be good except oh
except for the part where it causes a
nuclear confrontation
who in the world thought that crypto
would cause a nuclear confrontation and
I assume it's all uh
it's probably all Bitcoin I don't know
that but it's probably mostly Bitcoin
do you believe getting rid of Biden gets
rid of the BS no nobody believes that
uh what can you buy with crypto
apparently uh it's good for buying
nuclear weapons
all right do you know that story about
Cuba was going to put a Chinese
listening Post in Cuba
and we got all got all excited about it
well apparently the government says Ah
they've been doing that kind of thing
since 2019. business as usual
now I have a theory
that it's not bad for adversaries to
have listening devices on each other
I don't know that that makes you less
safe
I feel like you know having uh our spy
planes fly over each other might make
you safer
because you got a better idea what each
other's doing that always seems like a
better situation than the worse now
might they pick up secret Communications
well I hope we're not sending any secret
Communications
through things that you can see from
Cuba
is that even a thing can you pick up
secret conversations
from Cuba
I know I you could pick up normal
conversations
but maybe they have some way to I don't
know decode stuff that we don't know
about
uh so I guess the story is we shouldn't
be too excited because it's sort of
normal business and don't you assume
we're doing the same thing
don't you assume we're sitting off of
the coast of China with our listening
devices
so I'm not terribly sure it's the worst
problem in the world it just sounds like
the big country is all listen to each
other and try to know as much as they
can about the other and I don't know
that that makes us less safe it might
actually make us more safe as long as
we're both doing it
as you know is fairly transparent
everybody knows the other is doing it
I know keeping an eye on each other
might be better than not
might be
um
so CNN's trying to spin things as usual
and they got their Chief propaganda this
Dean Obadiah who likes to say anything
bad about Trump
and he's saying that there's a big
difference oh big difference between
Hillary getting rid of her emails
and or even having stuff that she
shouldn't have on her servers and uh
Trump's documents oh a big difference do
you know what the difference is
are you aware of that the big big big
difference these are completely
different
yeah the difference is that Dean Obadiah
read each of their minds and she that he
read Hillary's mind and found out that
she had no bad intentions
no bad intentions
so that's fine but then he read Trump's
mind to find out that him keeping those
documents was bad intentions bad
intentions
so how can you compare good intentions
to bad intentions that wouldn't be fair
would it I mean who does that who
Compares good intentions to bad
intentions I mean one is bad it has bad
writing the name bad intention and then
the other is good because why because of
the word good right isn't it good
intentions so those are those are
opposites completely different
if you're a mind reader
if you're a mind reader
we value actually gotten to the point
where CNN reports mind reading just
matter-of-factly
without any you know uh sort of hedging
it well you know we're just speculating
about this
if they said we're just speculating or
or a person in this situation you would
expect them to think this way
perfectly reasonable
but to Simply State as a fact what the
two of them were intending
that's not exactly news it's not even an
opinion
is that an opinion to say that you know
what a stranger was thinking in their
hidden intentions
there's not really even an opinion
it's just is what it is or
propaganda or idiocy or something I
don't know whatever it is definitely not
news
all right today was a no news day as you
could tell it was literally nothing but
people insulting people
and and misinterpreting people
nothing else happening
what's going on
is there something big happening is
there something big coming all right let
me give you the news about Ukraine
uh there's a counter-offensive and uh
some stuff's getting blown up
um
that's really all we know
and we've got like two photographs
got two photographs so that's it
yeah Silvio yeah Berlusconi died
but I suppose that was going to happen
no way around it
uh
uh I know yeah there's a road that was
destroyed I mean why is it that the
biggest news
is about a highway situation
all right here's what I think I I think
we're seeing the effects of the news
business being gutted
I I believe there's news out there
I would guess that Monday is probably a
day when there'd be a lot of it out
there
but there wasn't any there was basically
no news today
there was nobody who had enough money
to do an investigation
to come up with something that wasn't
just a public figure giving you a public
speech
or writing something in public and then
we talk about it well all we're doing is
talking about what people talked about
nothing else that's all I did today I
just talked about what people talked
about
there was no news
what Tom fidden's house rated by FBI
that's not true is it
tell me that's not true
please
that's not in the news is it
yeah okay I don't think that's true now
somebody says it's true
well I'm saying a bunch of yeses over on
Youtube Youtube says it's true
Tom says it
holy
sh oh a couple months ago
somebody says it was a couple months ago
why did I never hear that story
interesting
yeah
all right
um
it's not true all right so forget about
that somebody says it's true somebody
says it's not true
I don't know
um
he's just trying to fit in because his
shirts are too tight they're not fitting
uh did I discuss Dylan going blonde no
uh killer whales
we do have killer whales
can't find anything all right we're
going to say that that's not real
oh yeah there was the the four Colombian
children found in the jungle I tried to
read that but
uh
never use a crackhead for your bag man
okay
the Russian was eaten by a shark
yeah I I saw some kind of thing about
Lauren Southern's divorce
that somehow made news
I thought we are completely and totally
on the news
I mean why why does anybody's divorce
make news
um
San Jose police Union executive indicted
for a fentanyl smuggling
I think that happened a while ago though
right
uh major lab leak origin of course
well why why do we care about news about
the Wuhan lab League
what else is there to say about that
don't you all assume that's exactly
where it came from and that it's
confirmed
is there anything else to say about that
you know I'm not believing the excess
death reports
because I think that the quality of data
the quality of data is so bad that I
don't know that we can tell that I
wouldn't deny it
because there are lots of reasons that
you would have excess deaths but
I just don't trust it don't trust the
data
all right uh 42 year old from ESPN who
died I don't know about that
you don't plea believe people are dying
no of course I believe people are dying
insurance companies went down
as as anybody's Insurance gone up
is anybody's life insurance going up or
does not work that way
yes of course they they do have the
option of
raising their prices if you believe that
there's
oh typing sucks I love it the people who
believe the 4chan rumors about my
pandemic opinions
you guys are so lost
you actually believe the opposite of my
opinion and then went off went off
imagining that that you heard something
real
all right why is it that the news is not
covering the excess deaths
have you ever thought about that
I don't see Fox News covering it or
Breitbart or CNN
so one of the things I tell you is you
should ignore the news the political
news yes it solely reported to be true
by one side
but if both sides are are ignoring it
and if it's true it's the biggest story
in the country wouldn't you agree if
it's true that the excess deaths are big
and unexplained
it's the biggest story in the country
so you're telling me that neither the
left nor the right is reporting the
biggest story in the country
but yet it's true
there's nobody who has a political
incentive to report that correctly
nobody not the left and not the right
see that that's the part that's
a problem for me if you look on Twitter
it's all over the place right there
there's tons of very credible looking
uh claims about excess deaths on Twitter
but it's not in the news
and
generally speaking you would expect at
least you know the right would have some
advantage
in in at least putting it out there
they can't because Pharma sponsors them
that's not a bad Theory
yeah that's not a bad theory that it is
the biggest story in the world and that
our news organizations literally won't
cover it because of Pharma
all right I buy that
that explanation is sufficient
but I'm going to still say that we don't
know because I don't trust internet data
I don't rule it out not at all so there
there's no skepticism in terms of saying
the that it probably isn't correct
because I think there are too many
reasons why it might be high there's
just lots of reasons it would be
surprising if it's not high it's just
putting a specific reason for it on this
little harder
all right
Jamie Foxx
all right let me let me say this about
Jamie Foxx I think I said this maybe on
the man cave The Jamie Foxx story which
if you haven't heard it he had some kind
of major health problem but the family
is not revealing the nature of it
so this allows all the uh the vaccine
Skeptics to say oh it was a vaccination
and it's vax injury and that's why
they're not talking about it
other people say it definitely was not
that there's no evidence of that
whatever it is is something else
and
uh here's what you should learn from
that story
it has nothing to do with Jamie Foxx
Jamie Foxx is the least important part
of the story
he simply a mechanism that people are
using to sell their their political
opinion
so the anti-vaxxers use them to sell
their anti-vaxx opinion the other people
will either ignore it or say it's not
true because that's their political
opinion
but none of this is about Jamie Foxx
he's actually unimportant to the story
the story is just people using it
to sell their version of events
now you know that's the same thing that
happened to me
when I got canceled
how many people in America do you think
care about my opinion
I mean really
how many people care about my opinion
maybe maybe a few people who follow me
that's about it
but when I got canceled it had nothing
to do with what I said or what my
opinion was
you know that right it wasn't about me
which is one reason I don't take it
personally because it wasn't about me it
was about people taking an opportunity
to sell their version of events which is
anybody who ever supported Trump must be
a white supremacist
that's all it was about it had nothing
to do with what I said it was just an
opportunity
and it's an opportunity to take somebody
off the field
right
um
you weren't even close to being canceled
well I was canceled worldwide so my
I was economically canceled
Steph poor staff so there's still people
on the YouTube who believe that I was
pro-vaccination and pro mask
because I got fooled by a Reddit and uh
in the 4chan hoax
sorry about that
uh yeah JP Morgan settled on some kind
of Epstein stuff but I don't think that
means anything or we know anything about
it
do you believe there was a pandemic
that's a word thinking question I don't
do word thinking
uh will you attend and speak during the
musk Soros spaces well I'll tell you
what
um I would be surprised if Elon Musk
ever
ever uh makes any move that would show
that he knows I exist
because I think my reputation is too
toxic right now so I think if I
volunteered to talk in the Alex Soros
um let's say it happens it's not it's
not scheduled but if it happened and if
I volunteered to talk I believe I would
not be selected
because
if you're Elon Musk do you want the news
to be Elon Musk runs a right-wing spaces
uh here's a quote from that you know
accused racist guy
it's just problem is it probably doesn't
need and by the way
whatever he may or may not think about
me personally
probably isn't that important I mean he
does have to manage reputations and
companies and stuff so I don't mind I I
would have no problem with anybody in a
in a professional sense
who wanted to keep a distance from me
on a personal level then I would judge
quite harshly
uh like I said I did have one friend
only one
who said it'd be better you know to keep
a distance from you
now that that's you know you're never my
friend again that that was the end of a
very long
you know uh friendship but and it's
permanently done there's no coming back
from that
I'm permanently done
but only once everybody else either just
stayed away or didn't say anything
um have you watched the numerous black
YouTubers that have Amplified your
cancellation clip
well I do know that uh Black Americans
specifically black men
did not have much of a problem with what
I said after they found out what was
behind it and you know what was the
background the first impressions were
the same for everybody
but I would say black men didn't have a
any special problem with it
because once you understand it you know
it's advice that applies uh
bi-directionally
right
and I'll use this example again if you
were a black American family and you
were looking to move into a new
community
and you looked at one that had a KKK
headquarters
but you figured most of the people there
would be fine most of them are probably
not racist but they do have a KKK
headquarters right in that little town
I would recommend you don't move there
would anybody disagree with that
you should you should stay away from
them
yeah so if if you have reason to believe
there's a group of people who have been
let's say trained
to not like you actually trained to not
like you you should stay away and that's
what the ESG and the Dei and the CRT do
they they train black Americans
to have a negative opinion about white
Americans and you should stay away from
any population group if you can
that would you know have a higher
disregard for you because it's a free
country you could go where people mostly
like you or don't care one way or the
other
so the the advice that I give is to say
for any race
engender too I was I would say if you're
a woman
and you had a choice of moving into a
place where you knew there was a bunch
of
anti-woman people
no go there find it find a place where
that doesn't exist
if you're lgbtq
and you have a choice of where to live
I wouldn't go where there's negative
opinion about me why would you
I would go where there's the where you
could find the highest opinion which
might be
you know some very blue place
but that's what I do I'd stay away from
the haters
there are some people who say but Scott
if you don't make an effort
to make sure that you're interacting
with everybody things will become
segregated even if you didn't want that
and you know that that has all kinds of
costs to which I say
if you're talking about individuals
of course
I've never recommended that you
discriminate against an individual
right if an individual black guy comes
in for a job interview you should
absolutely look at them as an individual
and forget everything else
I've never said differently same with
your personal relationships
if you fall in love with somebody who's
A different race
it's not my business and everybody's
fine with that
just go ahead and do it
but if you're talking about a population
group
you can make a safety decision based on
the group because it's not it's not
discriminated against an individual and
there's nothing illegal about that
there's no constitutional rule that says
you can't make a safety decision about
yourself
it's completely legal and the reason is
completely legal is that there's no way
it could be illegal you couldn't run a
society where you're managing people's
risks without them managing it you know
people have to manage their own risks
all right
and by the way the reason that it
doesn't make sense to discriminate
against any individual
for their immutable you know
characteristics is that it's not good
for the system
it's not good for the person you you
were bigoted against but it doesn't help
you either
it literally doesn't help anybody
because it just cuts you off from you
know 90 of the world so you would be
cutting yourself off from the you know
talent and beauty of 90 of the world so
it's not good for you it's not good for
the person you discriminated against
it's not good for the system that you
both live in
I've never supported that
so you know most of my critics imagine
that's what I meant discriminating
against individuals I would never
discriminate against an individual that
makes no sense on any level
all right
so
um
did you hear about the guy at a festival
who warned the cashier that the car had
a trump bumper sticker I did and that's
another example of a haunting
Republicans yeah the story was
there's somebody at a drive-through must
have called I think they probably called
the the restaurant and said the car
ahead of me as a trump bumper sticker
now I think the idea was to treat them
differently like refuse service or spend
their food or something
and
um
that that was pretty shocking
it was a drive up I would drive up yeah
drive up or drive through
uh
uh I saw yeah I saw a mouse with a
pencil I saw that video
they said it through the speaker okay
um
yeah and then I guess the woman who was
told that was not on board with that at
all
so the good news is that the restaurant
itself laughed it off as not not
reasonable
so that's good
yeah Reddit is having a big boycott
today so I guess the Reddit users are
mad because a lot of the apps are being
taken off of
Reddit the apps that work with it
because the API price went too high so
the app scan for it
now the the volunteer mods are all up in
arms
what do you what do you think of the uh
criticism from the right
that pride is the wrong approach
because first of all pride is literally
you know
discouraged
in on religious grounds pride is
discouraged but that's you know specific
religious
point of view
but do you think that Pride still makes
sense for the lgbtq community
don't you think they need less Pride
don't you think they have too much
now when I say less Pride I don't mean
about their choice of gender or
sexuality
because that doesn't require any Pride
at all
it just simply is
so you know I'm not I'm not proud of
being bold I I just am I just am
I I don't have any Pride about it at all
I I just haven't
so that's the same same way I feel about
the LGBT community which is if you tell
me you just want to exist and and live I
say excellent
same page let's all just exist and live
and be good to each other how about that
but as soon as you come in and tell me
that you got Pride about your thing
then what do I say well like what's my
automatic reaction
to the fact that you have pride about
your thing that's different than my
thing
what's wrong with my thing
like why are you Pride why are you proud
but if I said I were proud I would be
canceled
do you think do you think you could get
away with saying you were proud to be
um straight and white
I have I have a straight white pride
no you would be called a white
supremacist a white supremacist right
you can't have pride
so I think that lgbtq should be
condemned before having Pride because
it's very discriminatory
if everybody else gay have pride
and say it out loud then I don't think
anybody should be able to do it
yeah yeah to me it's an insult
it does come off as we're a little bit
Superior and we're proud of it
that's how it comes off
that doesn't mean that's how they mean
it
I'm not saying that how people mean
something can be completely different
from how it's received and the whole
point of pride month is not to change
the opinion of the lgbtq is it well
maybe it is maybe it is
maybe it is a little self-referential
actually I'm modifying my opinion as I
as I think about it if if the pride is
meant to be self-referential meaning
they're talking to each other
that's fine
it just shouldn't be my business that
they're proud or not proud I I just
don't want to be involved and
that or you know any of it
I don't want them changing my opinion
but if they want to change their own
opinion and they're all in on it and
they want to feel better about it and
and pride is a word that makes somebody
who might feel
let's say it makes somebody who might
feel uncomfortable in their
preferences
maybe it makes them more comfortable so
if that's the purpose of it then that
would be good make people comfortable in
their own skin but if you're trying to
convince me
not the right word
not the right word you you had me at
Freedom
right
do you live in a free country yes
is there anything else to talk about no
are we good absolutely
totally good
do I have to defend myself and tell you
I'm proud nope
nope you're a hundred percent with me
there's nothing to discuss
but I'm proud you don't need to be
it's more than you need you you already
won stop selling past the clothes
oh that's what it is
that's what it is I just figured out
what it was that was bothering me it's
selling past the close
now I get that not everybody's closed
right so they probably need to convince
some people who were not me but if I'm
already sold
on your complete value as a human being
and your complete freedom to do what you
want then if you keep selling me
I'm going to get uncomfortable
and I might even change my mind if you
sell me too hard
so that's why it feels a little bit like
but you know part of the problem is that
you know I'm just one person
and they're talking to the world
so you know my my personal impression of
it
probably shouldn't change their strategy
but that's my impression of it
all right yeah coming after the kids is
separate
conversation
how many of you think that there really
is a long-term plan among the Democrats
to normalize
I don't even want to use the words nah
never mind I don't like the topic
I'm gonna forget that topic
Ben Franklin was proud of his humility
if you're proud of your humility
I assume that was your joke right that
you can't be proud of your humility
I'm kind of proud of my gluttony
all right yeah the the proud boys didn't
do so well do they
humility is a social media driven yeah
um
long-term goal to make it acceptable
certainly by some
did you see the story about Megan Fox
and uh two of her boys that she dresses
in girls clothing allegedly
and and allegedly the boys don't think
that they're girls
but the mother believes that they are
that that's the way it's being uh
portrayed on social media but that
doesn't sound right
do you believe that story is true
I don't I don't know
there's something wrong with this story
so I'm just going to say we don't know
what's going on if there's one if
there's one thing I can teach you
is that all initial stories about public
figures are false
yeah so Robbie Starbucks I guess lived
in her neighborhood at some point and
used to see your kids at the park with
his kids
so I'm going to say that all all stories
about public figures are false
at least first they all are so I'd say
you don't know anything about that
yeah there's a report that she said the
kid was non-binary when in the womb
do you believe that
I don't believe that I mean that's the
story but I don't believe it
and if she said it I don't think she
meant it
you know as a literal
so I would question you not to believe
anything about that story
you know maybe if you saw the kids
themselves talking about it you could
believe that but you're not
so I I would I would just let that one
go because I just don't think there's
enough
credibility in any of that
um
what
uh you believe she said that no I'm not
saying she didn't say it
so I'm not saying she didn't say it
I'm saying it might have been a sort of
a Hollywood thing to say
you know what I mean that that's like a
recreational opinion
that doesn't sound like a serious
opinion
that sounds like a recreational opinion
like one she wants to you know maybe
making the point that she thinks these
things are
determined at Birth
I mean it might have been just some bad
way to make a point
she's not going to date you
do you think I would want to date Megan
Fox
like in the real world
if she offered it do you think I would
take it no I wouldn't
believe it or not I wouldn't I know
that's hard to believe
I I promise you
she is beyond my crazy limit I do have a
limit
I I absolutely have a limit of how much
crazy I'm willing to take she's well
she's well beyond that now she could not
possibly be worth it
now I know what you're saying oh boy
she's so attractive and yes she is she's
insanely attractive but can you imagine
like what comes with that package
can you even imagine what comes along
with that
I mean no I'm sorry she would not be in
my top million list
but she is unambiguously uh you know
beautiful
all right
um
that's all I got for you today YouTube
I'm gonna say bye maybe it'll be better
news tomorrow if the news organizations
get on it get on it news organizations
