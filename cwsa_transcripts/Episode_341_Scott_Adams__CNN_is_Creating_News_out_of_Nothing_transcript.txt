[Music]
hey joanne hey everybody
get in here sharona you're always quick
tyler
another quick one sam
it's time for coffee with scott adams
it's the best part of your day except
for all the other parts
that are going to be pretty awesome too
and so join me
grab your cup your your mug your chalice
your glass your stein
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and raise it to your lips and join me
for the simultaneous sip
so i've been watching cnn try to make
news out of nothing
and it gets funnier and funnier the more
nothing there is
because they they don't have the option
of doing what i do some days
which is i get on here and i say you
know not much happened so i think i'll
cut it short
they don't have that option they have to
do the same amount of news
every day whether there's news or not
and for the next few weeks there
probably won't be a lot of news unless
we get surprised
we could be surprised
so my favorite made-up news story
is about the russian interference and
how it
affected the election now keep in mind
that the russians are accused of
spending
thousands of dollars
[Laughter]
doesn't it sound funny so apparently
russia
spent thousands of dollars trying to
influence
the entire election in the united states
thousands
russia spent less trying to influence
the election in the united states
than i did
you know if you if you count let's say
the uh
if you were to count the value of my
time you know if you just
if you just uh added up the hours i
spent
talking about politics put a dollar
amount on my hourly wage
i spent more than russia to influence
the election and that's not even a joke
i mean way more than russia but nobody's
investigating me because apparently
that's legal
um so there is i'm watching cnn the
anti-trumpers
in general trying to shape that story
to make it from nothing into something
so they've got to find some kind of
threshold where
all right yeah it was a small impact
but it was the deciding impact
here's the problem with that number one
it's not like there was one thing that
decided the election
there were thousands of variables and
every one of those variables
had to be exactly what it was to get the
result you got
but if i had to p if i had to choose
among the weakest variables oh and by
the way
i think even nate silver was tweeting
about this yesterday
somebody fact-checked me on this but i
think even nate silver was saying
that the russian ads were so small that
the odds of them making a difference or
you know
is kind of a head shaker to imagine that
it made any difference
but i keep saying so show me
show me the ad can somebody show me
the actual ad and i think i tweeted it
last night so i'm going to see if i can
find it
i hate making you wait while i look for
things on my phone but
you could have another sip of coffee and
it would be totally a good use of time
oh here it is
actually chris hayes tweeted this and
then i retweeted it
so here's one of the actual uh alleged
russian memes so there's jesus and jesus
is talking to a
modern looking man and the man has got
his head down like this
and then jesus is quoted as saying
struggling with addiction to
masturbation
reach out to me and we will beat it
together
and then it goes on to say you can't
hold hands with god when you are
masturbating
and use our hotline if you need help
so apparently there's a hotline for
people who are
addicted to masturbation
now i'm thinking to myself well
i don't know
i don't i don't know who paid for these
ads
was it the kremlin did the
did the kremlin say hey mean farm
make us some memes that will guarantee
that trump gets elected this is what
we're trying to do
what what do you have any ideas and
and they're you know they're
brainstorming they're like let's see how
do we get trump elected
how do we get trump elected maybe we
could speak
out against masturbation
and then the people who would have
stayed home
to you know or you know
they might go vote instead so it could
be that russia determined
with all of their technical proficiency
that the average trump voter was likely
to stay home and masturbate
instead of voting but maybe maybe if
they used a clever persuasive meme
it just takes one you know you don't you
don't want you don't want to go too far
you know two memes would be way too much
that would be too many memes you'd be
like
yvonne why are you making so many memes
well we're trying to influence the
election
you don't need more than one meme just
just hit that masturbation thing once
that should you know free up a lot of
people who would have stayed home on
election day doing their
you know and uh throw a little jesus in
there
because we know that the trump
supporters they like their jesus they
like their masturbating
you think you can cancel them out
so first of all there is a reason
that the anti-trump media doesn't show
you
the memes that the russians made because
we have seen them right
it's been a while it hasn't been a long
time since you saw the memes
but for a while they they were in public
and you looked through them and they
were no better than this one
this meme was one of the best ones
their memes were absolutely ridiculous
there isn't the slightest chance that
the kremlin
was behind this effort because if they
were they would have
they they would have murdered all the
meme makers for doing such a bad job
you know i got to think you get fired if
you do that kind of work and even in
russia
so there's an article this morning i
forget who it doesn't matter somebody on
cnn
had an article that said yeah but you
have to consider that the
margins were razor thin there were razor
thin margins in some of the states so
so maybe you know maybe the masturbation
meme
made a difference but then they went on
to say
that you could probably identify where
the impact was
by looking at the african-american vote
and i swear i'm not making this
next part up you're gonna laugh when i
say this
but but the analysis was
that the the 2016 election
far fewer black people voted than they
did when obama ran for president
do i need to say anything more about
that
cnn actually said that the memes
might be working because fewer black
people voted
when obama wasn't running
and not only that it was one of the
biggest drops
in history or the biggest from number of
black voters from one election to the
next it was the biggest drop
now was it also the biggest
increase when obama was running
this was actually an article that they
ran now they did acknowledge that
you know the first black president was a
reason that people could show up to vote
but did did they need to even make this
point at all
since they have zero evidence and
there's an obvious
reason why it happened that was the best
they could come up with
for why russia actually had an impact on
the this
razor thin election that was it that was
their best evidence
so so far we've seen the masturbation
theme
and the fact that fewer black people
vote when there's not a black
candidate that's their evidence
man the president's in trouble now
then and then i watched
cnn's john berman talk about how the
president's tweet
used quote mob language
that's right they've decided that the
president
is not technically guilty of any crimes
but we know he's up to something because
in his tweet
he called cohen a rat and you don't call
people a rat
unless you're mobbed up in some way and
i believe that john
berman referred to it as the nexus
of russia wikileaks and trump
campaign the nexus
remember i was telling you about all the
different ways that cnn tries to make
something sound like a crime when it
isn't
it's like well this imp this information
would implicate
implicate this would suggest
suggest or there's a nexus
potentially a potential nexus
where the hell is the crime don't tell
me what's implicated and possible
don't tell me what you imagine don't
don't tell me if
show me a crime further they make fun of
giuliani for saying on a number
occasions to some version of this
well what the president is accused of
doing
didn't happen and even if it had
it wouldn't be a crime and you know
excuse me
i just had to do that
i overslept i'm not ready for today
so they're making fun of him for saying
that what the president did
um didn't happen first of all it didn't
happen but if it did it wasn't
illegal and cnn
mocks him for that as if that's not
fair to say now i would say that in
a normal conversation if somebody said
oh
i didn't do that and by the way it isn't
bad
you would kind of think there was
something up right because you don't
need to add the and it isn't bad even if
i did
because that sounds like you really did
it but in the context
of a legal case whether or not you did
it
is perfectly good question and whether
or not it's illegal
is another perfectly good question so
within a legal context
it's perfectly reasonable to say it
didn't happen and if it did
it wasn't even illegal that's two levels
away from reality
cnn is so cnn is there's something wrong
here
and and there's two levels
preventing you from even getting to that
wrong place anyway
um cnn carried on their front page a
story about robert
de niro talking about his difficulties
with trump
do you know what do you know what
article and or
uh apologist i gotta get rid of the
apologist
so do you know what article i am least
likely to click on it's robert de niro
talking about how he feels about trump
and it's also bad to think that that's
the most interesting thing about dinero
right now
the most interesting thing he has going
on
is that he's kind of punchy and he talks
about trump
like everyone else in the world so i did
not click on that
i don't recommend you do it either
so the the other thing that cnn is doing
is they're talking about the quantity
of legal things that are swirling around
the president
they're talking about it in quantity as
soon as you hear people talking
in quantity instead of quality
it means they got nothing
so what you're saying is like well there
are six different cases swirling around
the president
tell me your best one what's your single
best case that would put the president
in jeopardy
just pick one and by the way i'm writing
about this in my
my book loser think here's the technique
if somebody gives you the
laundry list of reasons that are all bs
if somebody says for example the
president is x
because of these 10 reasons instead of
trying to argue all 10 reasons
because if you do and you debunk them
all in order starting with the best one
and went right down the list
what would happen when you got to the
last one on the list
and you would clearly debunked it in
front of the person you're talking to
what would they do would they say oh i
had 10 reasons
you just debunked all 10 of them
therefore
i guess i changed my mind will anybody
ever do that
no they'll add an 11th reason
or here's the fun part they'll start
over from the top
[Laughter]
they will start over from the top like
you didn't
just debunk it and when you say i just
debunked that
here's what i just said what will they
do then
they'll go to number two they'll go to
number two
just like you didn't just debunk it
you've all been through this right
so here's what i recommend instead
when somebody gives you the laundry list
of all the reasons
say how about this we don't have time to
debate them all
but why don't you pick your number one
best reason
just one and make a big deal about just
one
and you say can we make a deal
if i can if i can shake your confidence
on your best reason
will you agree to rethink the quality of
the rest of your reasons
so just make sure you give me the best
one i don't want the second best one
i want your most solid reason give me
that
we won't talk about the rest because if
your first reason is good
you will have changed your mind i will
change my mind to your way of thinking i
don't even need to hear the others
one good reason is all i need to agree
with you but
would you agree that if i can make your
best reason
look ridiculous you'll rethink the rest
of them
that's what i would do all right
there's this weirdly interesting story
about a character
who goes by the name of sargon of akkon
i guess
who uh seems to be popular with people
on the right but he's not
an alt-right and hates he hates the all
right
he hates the alt-right so much that he
said some bad things about them
carl benjamin is his real name and
he said it in a way that
um was judged uh hate speech
by patreon the the platform where he was
getting all of his
or a lot of his funding and they dropped
him
now here's the interesting thing he
didn't
he didn't say his alleged hate speech
uh somebody's saying it's pronounced
akkad
sargon of akkad okay
um he didn't say what he said
on their platform so patreon kicked him
off the patreon
platform for something he said on
youtube
so that's the the first thing that's
getting people hopping
but since i've been hearing about this i
said to myself
um hey
i was laughing at a comment uh i said
what did he say that
got him kicked off and it took days for
me to find
some reference to it because i guess it
probably all got deleted or something
and i thought man if jordan peterson and
sam harris and all these guys dave rubin
you know these are all people who are
super rational
reasonable pro-speech people if they're
all
hopping mad about it so much so that
they're looking at creating
a whole new platform i guess what he
said
what must have been just so uh i don't
know
politically incorrect that you know i'm
going to read this and i'm going to say
to myself oh that's not so bad i can't
believe he got kicked off with that
platform
and then i read what he said
i'm not going to tell you what he said
but
i would certainly expect to be kicked
off a platform if i said it
in fact i can't imagine anybody not
getting
kicked off a platform for saying what he
said
so i'm not going to repeat it now some
have said
oh he was speaking ironically yeah so
the the essence of it was he used the n
word to talk about alt-right people
so he was insulting here's where it gets
complicated
he was using the n-word to insult white
people
who are racists but also i think
it no or was he do insulting the
the questioner he was he was using it
against somebody white
and therefore that has given people
cover to say
no no no he used the n-word but he
wasn't talking
you know he didn't use it against black
people he was using it in
an ironic or kind of intellectually
clever way
and if he don't catch the if you don't
catch that that was the case then it
looks bad
but really it was more of an
intellectual thing he was saying
that's not what i saw it's not what i
saw
what i saw in the words was that he used
the words and then explained
that the white person he was talking
about was just as bad
that kind of gets you kicked off of any
platform
so i'm in this um let me get to my point
there before you
get bored with it my point is
i am continually asked to join
various boycotts and causes i am
often asked to support various people
who get
kicked off of things or are
or censored etc but it's kind of a trap
because the moment you support them you
are associated with their speech
no matter how clearly you say that's not
why you're doing it
so it's pretty brave for
sam harris and for jordan peterson and
those guys
to to take up the cause
because it's going to associate them
with the language
and i don't know how i don't i don't
want to be associated with it so i don't
know how to be part of the cause
although i i have you know
sort of uh let's see
i don't like too much censorship
but i don't think you can say that
there's never a line
can you say there's never a line
i think that's really the question i
think instead of free speech or no free
speech
the question should be is there ever a
line and if there's never a line
that would be a reasonable thing to say
and i've asked this before but
why is it that i can't click a filter on
social media
and simply never be exposed to people
who talk like that
so that i would never see them but if i
wanted to i could
how how does that not make everybody
happy
i suppose because then i guess the
neo-nazis would
have a thriving life online or something
i suppose that would be a problem
anyway um
did he get the 48-hour rule um
it's been 48 hours i haven't seen any
kind of clarification
but if he did clarify and it makes a
difference i'll take a look at that but
i don't think he did
so apologies and clarifications don't
count for him
there are some things that if you really
said them
an apology wouldn't make any sense
because
he's not he's not really being um
punished
i don't think for the choice of words
i think he's being punished for
the thought so unless he changes his
mind
which would be unusual um and i don't
know how he would apologize since he's
banned on
everything but anyway if somebody wants
to if somebody wants me to send the
uh send me the clarification and or
apology i would be happy to take a look
at that
but i can't imagine there's some
situations where you know like let's say
if you murder somebody
you know an apology doesn't make any
difference
you know if you so so there's some
things clearly that
don't have an apology doesn't make any
difference
now there's also a story about putin he
has a war on rap
and although he said things about it
being part of the culture and therefore
they should support it
apparently the russian government is
acting against rappers
and rap music to which i say
at what point do you get to treat
language as a medical problem or a
social problem
does language and let's say
music in particular does it ever rise to
the level
of being dangerous for society
um i'm going to say something that
you're all going to hate
you're all going to hate this probably
half of you will never come back again
in our country rap music has to be legal
because
it's just baked into our free speech
thing it has to be legal
but in my opinion
um there's a certain cultural
you know message that comes with rap
music that is
uh terribly harmful
for people terribly harmful
now when i was young and thinking way
back when al gore's wife
tipper tipper gore tried to get
um music i guess with their records at
the time
records and cds there she was trying to
get them labeled
if they had offensive stuff in it so
that it as a consumer you would at least
know if this music had offensive things
in it
and i think she largely succeeded in
that because music is kind of labeled
now isn't it
and at the time i said to myself you
know i was probably 12 or whatever i was
i thought oh my god
old people old people are so funny they
think that if i listen to this music
i'm gonna i'm gonna start acting
differently but i'm not that dumb
i know the difference between music and
something that matters
i'm not going to be influenced by this
music
and then i grew up and i studied
hypnosis and i studied persuasion and i
studied influence
and at this point it is completely clear
anybody who anybody who thinks that
advertising works
you know if you even understand that
advertising works
of course the music changes children
if you're 10 years old and you're
listening to rap music
because your older sibling has it it is
absolutely programming you
from a scientific perspective i mean i
suppose you could run some tests on this
but i don't think you'd have to wonder
how the tests would come out
it absolutely makes a difference
and does it make a difference to the
point where it could kill you
yeah absolutely yes rap music
this will be the part that gets taken
out of context
rap music is lethal
just not too many people the vast
majority people
will not have a negative experience for
music
but there are a lot of people on the
edge and those
those people on the edge it could make
them
deadly it could make them hurt
themselves it could cause them to do
drugs they wouldn't have done
to live a lifestyle they wouldn't have
lived to get a tattoo they wouldn't have
tried to get to speak in a way that they
wouldn't have normally
spoken i i watched
i watched white kids
uh turn into black culture with saggy
pants and
speaking the way they hear on the music
etc
i've watched i've watched rap music
completely reprogrammed kids
completely changed their entire cultural
dna i've watched music do that
in you know um somebody said they would
not allow their kid to
listen to rap music you really don't
have a choice
your kids are going to listen to all
that stuff they're going to see every
movie they just go to their friend's
house
if your kid has a smartphone your kid is
listening to rap music
there's no way around it so here's the
thing in the united
states i do not suggest that we try
banning rap music
just because it's impossible and it
would be too far off of our
cultural um preference i guess for
free speech and expression but
it's dangerous as hell rap music
is absolutely killing people no doubt
about it
but you know what else kills people cars
sports
bicycles swimming pools
slipping in the shower all right we live
in a world where all kinds of stuff is
dangerous
and we don't we don't eliminate all the
things that can kill people
yeah we'd i don't know how many people
have died on weed it's
closer to zero so in the united states
the you know the debate if you will is
sort of settled in the sense that we've
decided
we'll we're just going to let all that
stuff happen but in russia
when they're saying should we stop this
stuff
they're not wrong
you know if you gave me if you told me
there's a culture
in which they're already accustomed to
not having free speech
since they don't already have free
speech let's say it's china let's say
it's russia
if they don't already have free speech
would they be worse off to be denied a
certain kind of music
if it actually makes society better
i don't know it's not as obvious as it
seems
uh in this country we have such a
investment in free speech there's no way
around it right
it's going to be the way it's going to
be i don't recommend changing it
but it is unambiguously absolutely
corrosive to society and
if russia or china do not want their
society to be
corroded and to become a drug culture
like the united states
they might want to get rid of the
influences that turn your culture into a
drug culture
and rap music does that absolutely
so i would you know if i had to put a
number on it let me guess
i'm going to guess how many people in
the united states
are killed every year by rap music
probably 20 to 50
000 maybe if i had to guess
how many people die just in the united
states per year
because there is rap music now i'm
saying rap music but i'm real
i mean the the cultural attachments that
come with that so that
what comes with rap music is if uh you
know the drug culture that comes with it
um and maybe the you know the
uh the anti-establishment sort of
culture
maybe get a tattoo you sag your pants
you can't get a job it changes your
whole
life your life trajectory
maybe you're more likely to carry a gun
because it's part of that culture
i would say yeah 20 to 50
000 people and that's just a guess right
if there's somebody here who says my god
scott
that couldn't possibly be true you know
it's a lower number than that i wouldn't
argue too hard i'm just giving you my
best
opinion based on based on what it does
what it does to people in general and
how some of them it might push them over
a line
i'd say 20 to 50 000 here
but how many people die die in cars
more scott
you might be going down a slippery slope
well the thing that keeps me from going
down the slippery slope
is that in the united states it's still
unambiguously
legal and i don't i don't recommend
changing that
it's completely legal and i agree it has
to stay that way in this country
uh it's not the genre there's a
there's christian rap well okay i i hear
what you're saying that rap
can be separated from you know the
culture
but you know what i'm talking about you
know what i'm talking about
would you say rap is a poison um
no not in the technical sense
i would say that rap um
well let me put it in a larger context
we have we have a cultural preference
for saying that thoughts even if they're
damaging thoughts
are in a different category than
physical health problems
so if you break your arm everybody says
that's a health problem
but if you get a negative thought that
ruins your life
nobody says that's a health problem
because you're
otherwise mentally healthy you don't
have mental illness
you just have a bad idea to set you on
the wrong path
so let's say your bad ideas that you
should become
you should join a cult and murder
yourself kill yourself
let's say the bad idea is that you
should become a suicide bomber
let's say the bad idea is that you
should cover yourself with tattoos
before you're old enough to go get a job
right
so these are ideas which could damage
people's
potential and by the way i love tattoos
i'm i'm a big fan of tattoos
but it's unambiguously true that it
could hurt your job prospects
because other people don't like tattoos
so
we make that artificial that artificial
distinction
between an idea that can kill you and
a physical problem like a virus and i'm
not sure that's warranted
maybe it has to be that way but it's a
sort of an artificial you know
distinction
um
all right what about
flynn well
the flynn story just seems boring
only all of the legal stuff the legal
jeopardy
swirling around the president
it's all just boring but
um and you're also seeing that uh cnn
reports that the president is
seething
he's seething what does that mean
can you imagine that anybody who would
be in president trump's position
would not be seething how would you
not be angry about all the legal
jeopardy
[Music]
uh
yeah so i've said this before but i'll
recap
my thoughts on flynn
are they he did get a bad deal
and that he didn't do anything that
looked criminal to me
uh and even the lie apparently was oh
let me talk about this one thing i i
spend a lot of time talking about
how cnn distorts the news
but uh
but it comes from both sides
and oh i know what i want to talk about
i want to talk about climate change in a
minute here but
the the flynn story
um there there's this question about
whether he lied oh so here's
here's the twist on this so if you
listen to fox news or
news on the right they'll say
the two agents who interviewed flynn
do not think he lied
does that matter so
here's an example of so that you'll see
this on fox news all day long
uh you'll probably see it five times
today they'll say the agents
the fbi agents who interviewed flynn say
they didn't think he was lying
what does that mean that's completely
irrelevant
because if they found out later that
there was some information
that disagreed with what he said in the
meeting
that would be the two agents didn't
think he was lying when they were in the
room
then they found out later that what he
said disagreed with some other source
and then they would change their mind oh
i guess we didn't know that but
that's opposite of of the reality so
every time you hear
fox news say that the two people in the
room
said he wasn't lying it doesn't mean he
was
i'm just saying it doesn't mean anything
there is literally
no news value and the fact that the
people who were in the room
at the time didn't think he was lying at
the time that doesn't mean anything
because if they found out later there
was some information that showed
you he lied that's all you needed now
i'm not saying that that's what happened
i'm just saying it's completely
irrelevant that the people
in the room at the time didn't think he
was lying
now there is the problem of why he would
lie about something
that had no no purpose and i think
everybody agrees with this statement
that there's no obvious reason why he
would have lied
there's nothing he was protecting he
wasn't doing anything
illegal it didn't he he was literally
just doing his job
you know making contacts and stuff and
so if you don't if you can't explain why
he might have been lying
like even even a hypothesis well
hypothesis is he lied because of x
you can't even do that it's it's pretty
obvious that he just didn't remember
because if you compare the didn't
remember explanation to every other
explanation
there is no other explanation that
anybody's come up with
now maybe somebody has a better
imagination than i do and maybe they'll
come up with one
but given all that the odds of
um given all that the odds
of flynn not getting a pardon
zero i
i think flynn gets a pardon because
[Music]
the base would be pretty pissed if he
didn't let me ask you this
how angry would you be at president
trump
if he did not pardon flynn
show me and try to use words that tell
me
roughly how much that would bother you
i imagine if you actually saw flynn
taken to jail it looks like you'll
probably get off without jail time
but yeah you would be angry
there there are some things in politics
that you just don't like
but there are other things that would
make you personally angry
this one i think feels personal doesn't
it
doesn't whatever it happens to flynn
because here's the thing
can you relate to flynn
you know don't you feel like that so
could have been you
there's something about the the
normalness
of flynn's problem which is that
from the evidence it appears they just
forgot something and got trapped
lost his lost his reputation lost his
uh financial stability lost everything
and it was in the and it was uh he was a
casualty
in the service of a witch hunt
apparently because they haven't found
anything that would would say
that would violate that uh
observation yeah so
not only did flynn have 30 years of
service to this country
let me let me put it another way flynn
risked
his life for the country for years
he put his own life on the line for the
country for years
and then when the country
got to thank him they entrapped him
and doomed him it might be
the most insanely um
you know unfair miscarriage of justice
that we've ever gotten to see play out
in front of us
you know normally when somebody gets a
presidential pardon
they've actually committed a crime like
a serious crime
you know it might be a white-galler
crime might be some other but they're
real crimes
whatever happened here is unlikely to be
a real climb
in fact we can't even decide if it was a
crime
how often do people go to jail or lose
everything over something that
might be a crime sort of if depending on
what his interior thoughts were
because if his interior thoughts were i
don't remember that conversation with a
russian
no crime happened but if his interior
thoughts were i'm going to lie about
this and there's some reason
well that it was a crime but we don't
know what his interior thoughts were
so we don't even know if this was a
crime
so um
yeah he's a criminal somebody says
how can you be a criminal
can you be a criminal because somebody
else thought
your interior thoughts were inaccurate
how do you cr how can you criminalize
somebody
for forgetting something it looks like
that's what's happened
anyway um so i would say that the the
odds of trump
um pardoning flynn uh
assuming that you know that he doesn't
get off on other purposes
um you know in other words maybe the
judge just throws everything out i don't
know
i suppose anything's possible but
if if lynn is still in legal peril
i say trump pardons him
and it's a slam dunk never look back
in fact i'll even go further
let me uh let me go further for you
if trump sacrificed reelection
to pardon flynn should he do it
there's your question of the day if no
there's no way to know that you know any
one thing would make a difference
but if trump knew that pardoning flynn
would cost him the second election
if he knew it we can't know it but let's
say he did
should he do it anyway
yep do you know why because he's the
commander-in-chief
and the commander-in-chief doesn't leave
anybody on the battlefield
period the commander in chief
does not leave a war a wounded soldier
on the battlefield boom
yeah there's no question about it is it
if you think about
his his years of service and you think
about
how he's being screwed by his own
country apparently
the commander-in-chief can't leave
somebody on the battlefield
we just don't do that and i would say
that that principle
is bigger than the election
that that's one of those principles that
keeps the entire country
safe right one one of the reasons that
um you know if you're another country
and you're thinking about
getting into a war with the united
states
one of the things that's going to scare
you is that we're not going to leave
anybody on the battlefield
and you know the fact that somebody is
or is not left on the battlefield by
itself isn't important
but the the psychology that comes with
that
that you don't leave anybody on the
battlefield
is so strong that it's it's part of the
i would say it's part of the
psychological armor
that makes our fighting forces the most
you know powerful in the universe as far
as we know galaxy let's say
so i don't think there's
any competition for what is the right
thing to do
if you're the commander-in-chief you
will give up your own reelection
to maintain that we don't leave a
soldier on the battlefield
period um
so that's my call i think this is a slam
dunk and if anybody's worried about
um if anybody's worried about flynn
going to
uh jail
zero chance of that you know unless it's
temporary but
he's not going to serve a whole term for
sure
they're saying that trump will go to
jail if he doesn't get reelected
for what don't they need to find a crime
you know i suspect that if trump
announced tomorrow that he wasn't
running for reelection
um and by the way i think trump can
pardon flynn and he can run for
re-election and it probably doesn't have
that much difference
but just if it made a difference he'd
still have to pardon him
uh and i would be
i would be surprised
if trump doesn't win re-election easily
you know you probably saw the whole
democrats
did i talk about amy siskind who is a
prominent
democrat supported hillary and said that
she's she's announcing in advance that
she would not
support a white male candidate on the
democrat side
because that's not the way the country's
going etc
and i thought to myself well it looks
like we got
four more years of president trump they
better come up with something really
good if they're gonna
[Music]
if they think they're gonna win it win
next time
all right i'm going to get off now and i
will talk to you
later
