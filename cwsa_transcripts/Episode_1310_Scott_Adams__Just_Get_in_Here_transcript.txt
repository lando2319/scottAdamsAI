hey everybody
come on in come on in it's time
this will be one of the yeah one of the
best ones
ever of all time
it's not my fault either it's just that
the stories are fun and interesting
today
you might even learn something yeah you
might
and all you need is a copper mug or
glass attack which has time canteen
jungle flask a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid
have i mentioned that i like coffee and
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day the
thing that makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous sip and it's
making waves all around the world
as you lift your glass for
the unparalleled pleasure that the
simultaneous sip here it comes
go
ah just imagine if you will
seven plus billion people doing this
simultaneous sip
all as one yeah it would be good
well here's the news today and the first
thing you're going to learn
uh prince william was asked if the royal
family is racist
totally fair question hey is your family
racist
people were expecting him to say yeah
we're totally totally
but no he didn't go that way instead he
said
that the royals are quote very much
not a racist family very much not a
racist
now have i taught you
how to answer this question i believe i
have because i've seen some people on
twitter
who were all over this because it makes
one of the most
classic mistakes of persuasion you could
ever make
don't put i'm not racist
don't say i'm not a serial killer
don't say i'm not an idiot
because the brain forgets the not part
it's the the idiot part that they
remember
so if somebody asks you are you a racist
family the correct answer
is the royal family
treats everybody uh as equally valuable
and always will imagine that quote
as opposed to oh no we're very much
not a racist we're very much very much
not racist nope nope
pretty convincing wasn't it
never make this mistake that prince
william made
now what's interesting is can you
imagine any group of people
who have had more media training and
experience
don't you assume that the royal family
especially the younger ones
have had actual legitimate media
training about how to handle this stuff
and this is a pretty big mistake it's
interesting that it wasn't part of his
training
or he didn't remember his training i'm
not sure um
here are the two people i would most
like to interview
um i'll probably do more interviews
going forward but only if i have a good
reason
so sometimes i'll probably interview
some people while i definitely will
interview some people coming up who have
some books
coming out so those are always
interesting
um but i hear the two people i would
most like to interview and on specific
questions i would like to interview
aoc on nuclear energy
just see where she's at on that um you
might know that michael schellenberger
testified yesterday on nuclear energy to
the
uh senate committee on energy and
natural resources
and his his main message was that if we
don't
stop closing our our nuclear plants and
if we don't
start building new ones especially with
safer newer technology
we're going to be in real trouble we
just won't have enough energy
so forget about the green new deal we
just won't have enough energy
just like texas just like california has
experienced
so i would love to see aoc just take a
strong position on nuclear energy
whether it's for
or against because i feel like her
opinion moves things
and i feel like her opinion is actually
probably the right one
she just doesn't emphasize it much and i
believe that she's
open to nuclear energy as a part of a
solution
and wouldn't it be good to get her on
record because it might be
one of those things that everybody
agrees on right
we might as well find the it would be
the most important thing
that everyone agrees on probably right
energy is really close to the top of
concerns
so it's the most important thing that we
actually probably pretty much agree on
weirdly so we should put that on record
and
maybe we can move in the right direction
there but in the positive
in the positive sense i think at least
our government is pro-nuclear
feels like it i mean i don't have a full
sense of all of them
but it feels like the the energy in our
government is
is moving nuclear and again i'm talking
about the newer safer technologies
even though the past has been pretty
safe um
i would also like to interview bill
gates
specifically on green new deal and
that and the reason i like to interview
him
is that uh he needs help
he needs help communicating and i think
his blind spot
is that he doesn't take critics
seriously
in other words if somebody criticizes
him he just sort of lets it lay out
there
now on one hand it is what makes him
awesome
the fact that he is so in my opinion
singularly focused on solutions you know
building toilets for africa
figuring out how to get clean water and
third world countries solving malaria
stuff like this i don't think he cares
too much about the critics
but he should and here's why because i
think his voice is way more important
than other voices specifically because
he's non-political
he's aggressively non-political
relatively
right everybody's a little bit political
but i would say he's probably the least
overtly political person in the game
who's also the smartest
who also unambiguously has the world's
interests
and even poor people specifically uh in
mind
and i think that because of whatever
weird thing happens with his reputation
people think he's putting chips in you
and he's trying to make money and
sterilize africa and
you know all these things that the fact
that he doesn't bother defending against
those
claims i think weakens his voice
and i think his voice should be stronger
not weakened
so he would be a perfect person for me
to interview because i could help him
with his communication strategy
which i think is lacking
you should see a video if you haven't
followed a z-dog
anybody follow z-dog spelled letter z
d-o-g-g and he's a doctor who has a
an interesting talent stack he's
probably one of the best
communicators ever
right that's a big statement right but
watch a z dog
explain anything complicated he's just
one of the best
clearest explainer of complicated stuff
you'll ever see so you should follow him
but he's talking in a recent videos
i just saw he was talking about how one
virus might protect against another
as we're trying to figure out why is it
exactly that the
seasonal virus went to almost zero
at the same time that the coronavirus
was a pandemic
like why is it we didn't get both of
those and the
preliminary answer as z dog explains is
that we do have examples of one virus
giving you some kind of protection
against another
now that doesn't fully explain what
we're seeing
but as z dog states
it's not meant as the full explanation
but it might be a significant part of
you know why we're seeing what we're
seeing so listen to his explanation
that's great
he's also on locals by the way if you
want to if you want to see more of him
um there's a
deep fake of me
singing the song what is love
what is love
now did you think this was going to
happen so quickly
there's literally already a deep fake of
me
i think all they do is take some various
photos of me and then
put it to music and there's some kind of
ai program that
automates your lips and actually you can
see your lips singing a song you've
never so
you've never sung now it isn't too hard
to look at it and know that it's a fake
because it's sort of jumpy
and you know the pixels move around and
stuff but i think that's
only a function of the low processing
speed and you know sort of a
a low technology approach to doing it
just something you can do with an app
right
this was done with an app
i think just an app on a phone i don't
know which one
but imagine what you could do with a
super computer if you could do that with
an
app already you could already produce a
video of me
singing a song i didn't sing with an app
what happens when that app gets better
you won't believe
anything you see in the news anymore
well if you're believing anything you
see in the news you probably shouldn't
but
it's got to get worse all right
so to me that was like a an interesting
like point in time
the first time you become a deep fake
yeah you'll always remember where you
were
the first time you became a deep fake
all right i have to circle back to this
megan markle stuff
ah god i think everybody's in the same
position right
which we fundamentally don't want to
talk about this topic
because it shouldn't be world news
it just shouldn't be in our minds
but it's a good example of how the media
tells you what's important
my the part of my brain is telling me
this very clear message
don't talk about the royals scott let me
give you two good reasons
number one it's completely unimportant
number two you know your audience is not
really too much about the royals right
pretty good reasons it's not important
and you don't care
now watch this i'm gonna do it anyway
why i don't know
i actually don't know because those
reasons are real reasons
is not important and i know you don't
care
i'm still gonna do it now this is a
perfect example of how the media
can tell you what's important they can
they can manipulate you like a puppet
and it's happening to me right in front
of you
i'm literally out of control
i'm going to talk about this thing i
don't want to talk about
because i'm on the puppet springs that
this is how persuasion works
sometimes sometimes you can feel it
and you know it's happening and you know
you you think you have control over your
body you could just get up and walk away
but you don't and if you haven't had
that experience yet
of knowing of having your your brain
having two people in there
and they're just two people and one says
you know this is stupid
and the other one says we're doing it
but you know it's stupid
we're doing it can't explain it
there is a theory that we only imagine
we are one person
but that your brain is better better
framed
here's a reframing for you that's a good
one
it's better to reframe yourself as a
bunch of competing
almost personalities because there are
different parts of your brain they have
different interests
there's a part of your brain that's just
afraid and that
that part is saying no don't do it
there's a part of your brain that's
logical and saying i think this will
work out
there's a part of your brain that only
cares about i don't know your body
there's you know so you got you got all
these different sort of opinions if you
will
that are almost like personalities so
thinking of yourself as a tribe which
shares different parts of a brain
is sort of a productive frame i think
you i think you'll benefit from that
so this is what's happening one part of
my brain says don't do it the other part
says you're doing it
and that part won so a good way to
imagine
your brain is competing voices and
sometimes one gets stronger
you don't know why all the time all
right here's what i'm going to add to
this story
uh meghan markle said quote that there
were concerns and conversations about
how dark his skin might be when he's
born talking about their
their baby who i believe if the news is
right would be
something like 12 to black
now here's the first question where
people are really concerned
about how dark a baby would be who is
12 black like how dark
could a baby be right
we'll get to whether it's even
appropriate to talk about it
but the first question is
what kind of a serious conversation do
you have
about a baby that's 12 black
like is there is there even a chance
that that kid would um look
black is that even a thing this is a
real question by the way
so it sounded like a statement in a
question but it's an
actual question would there be
some scenario in which that kid could
come out
looking basically black
somebody says yes in the comments so
i'll rely on the
the science people to answer that
question i feel like no
but i'm acknowledging a lot of people
are saying yes you might know
you might know more than i do on this i
think it's
i feel like you'd have to have a little
bit of black on both sides
am i wrong about that if you had
at least a little bit of black for both
parents
then you have a chance that that little
bit of black and both gets combined
right and then
that's how you get a red head right the
only way you get a red head
if one of them is red head and one is
not since redhead is
uh a uh not a dominant trait the the
other
the other pair has to have a little bit
or you can't get a red head right
i think that's right so but anyway
regardless of the
specifics of genetics
what does it mean to say you were
concerned and you had conversations
about it
is concerned the same as racist
is it can you not be concerned about
things and discuss them
without being a racist what topic
exactly
is there that you can't even discuss
does that exist what would be another
example of a topic
that just discussing the topic without
without
knowing what the opinion is but just
bringing up the topic
is racist in and of itself is that a
thing
because if you were if you're the royal
family the way you
are received by the public is your whole
job
isn't it the royal family's entire job
is to present an image
that does something positive for the
country
i think so if if somebody was having a
conversation
about how will the country respond
to any difference in our brand is that
not
a fair conversation unless you injected
something racist into it
now if somebody in this conversation had
said we're worried he'll come out black
and that's bad because we don't want
black people
well that would be just racist but what
if they said
and i wasn't there so i'm just
speculating what if somebody said
you know if the public
ends up having this impression this will
have an impact on the royal family
and maybe we should prepare for how best
to address it
because we know we're not racist but
other people might be
and how they view us well we'll have to
deal with that
and we should plan ahead for that
suppose that was the conversation
would that be racist would it be racist
to say
none of us are racist but we think we'll
have to deal with this it's
a public thing i don't know
i just feel as though once when you have
a third-hand report
about other people who are not in the
conversation they can't defend
themselves
and you make a statement that there were
concerns and conversations
you need to be a little bit more
specific
because we're all leaping to the
assumption that you can't even talk
about the topic
without being a racist but i'm talking
about the topic
right didn't meghan markle talk about
the topic
she brought it up didn't
oprah talk about the topic
she did she was in the conversation so
why is it that the royals or whoever
allegedly
talked about it why is it they can't
have that conversation
but oprah can on television
and that i can when i'm talking about
why can i talk about it
well i won't get canceled right because
i'm not saying anything racist i'm just
talking about it as a topic
that might affect other people in some
racist way
so i feel as though leaping to the
conclusion that the royals are racist
because of this one statement that they
were talking about a
topic that's not fair
that is not fair especially when you
don't list the person so they can defend
themselves
all right there's also news that nancy
pelosi tried to organize a coup
now i'm going to describe what she did
and i want you to see if my
characterization of it as organizing
a coup or attempting to is fair
just see if this that's a fair statement
all right this is what happened
so i guess uh pelosi time ago
when trump was in office she said quote
this morning i spoke to the chairman of
joint chiefs of staff mark milley
to discuss available precautions for
preventing an
unstable president and this would have
been trump
from initiating military hostilities or
accessing launch codes and ordering a
nuclear strike
the situation of this unhinged president
could not be more dangerous
and we must do everything that we can to
protect the american people
from this unbalanced assault on our
country and our democracy
i guess tom fitton at judicial watch has
a lawsuit to try to find out more about
this situation
but hold just hold this idea in your
head
that nancy pelosi speaker of the house
had a private conversation with the
joint chiefs of staff
head about basically taking trump out of
power
based on her assumption that he was
unstable
but i think it matters if
that's a common opinion the fact that
most of it well i don't know what
percentage
but at least half of the country does
not think that trump was
unstable sufficiently that you should
you know take his powers away
yeah they may think he's unstable in his
you know trump-like
extension eccentricities but not in
dangerous to the country
kind of way so
there are two ways to look at this if
you could know for sure
that trump was unstable and dangerous
then she was just protecting the country
would that be fair if you knew for sure
that trump was just obviously unstable
and dangerous
then i would say in that situation i
would say you know
i know we have you know rules and
procedures and constitutions and stuff
that have to be followed
but we can all see that this is a
dangerous situation
and in this one case i think the
grown-ups have to take
control and just fix this even if they
have to bend a rule to do it
but that's not the case and we're
looking at the same trump right
it doesn't look even a little bit
dangerous to me
not even a little bit so in the case
where
there is clearly a major difference in
observation
what do you make of the speaker of the
house talking to the joint chiefs of
staff about a coup
it's just a coup isn't it
to me this was a coup attempt and i
don't know how
i can't even think of another way to
think of it
because and
and imagine the precedent imagine a
precedent where
one party a an obvious political enemy
can claim that the other one is
unbalanced
without any evidence that would suggest
that whatsoever
at least nothing that would you know be
medically suggestive of it
and that and that the joint chiefs of
staff could just take control
she literally tried to organize a
military
coup
i feel like this really happened now
have i told you
uh too many times yet that what you
decide is important
uh you think is your own decision
but it's not we are programmed
citizens we are told what is important
and until the media you know that not
just fox news but the
larger media until the media tells you
it's a story
that pelosi organized a military coup
but it didn't work out
until you until they say that's a story
nobody will treat it seriously
it doesn't matter what the facts are
it's irrelevant
now every time you say to yourself but
wait in my own private
thinking this should be the biggest
story
irrelevant because what you think should
be a big story
doesn't matter the only thing that will
be a big story is whoever decides what
the news is
decides it's a big story and the
decision has apparently been made
this this won't be one so the most
important thing that happened last year
actual a literal admitted
attempted military coup
that's not much of a story we'll mention
it and then we'll move on
um now i suppose you could argue that
it's not a coup
if the only thing she wanted to do was
remove his
military power but i think if you remove
the president's military
control that's kind of a coup
all right tucker carlson's making news
as he
often does for going hard at a reporter
the social media reporter for the new
york times
named taylor lorenz now it's important
to the story that you know that she's a
youngish i don't know how young she is
but she's youngish
woman so that's important to the story
[Music]
telecom act of 1996 allowed media
consolidation yeah that didn't help at
all
so um now the new york times is uh
pushing back and
saying that you know attacking their
reporter is
is not cool and tucker
has pointed out and this is why we love
him
there are some things that i swear to
god there's some things that only tucker
carlson will say out loud
right they're things you're thinking or
maybe you say on social media
but there's some things that only he
says out loud and here's one of them
reporters destroy people's lives as
their job
reporters destroy people's lives for a
living
it's routine it's the most common thing
we see as a reporter writes a story
destroys somebody's life and tucker says
quite reasonably why doesn't it work the
other way
why can't we criticize you even if it
destroys your life
because you're in the business of
destroying lives why is it not fair that
you should also be the subject of that
now i i haven't heard anybody else ever
say it quite like that but once he says
it
i think to myself well yeah
do you know how many individual
reporters have
attempted to destroy my life
quite a few you know over 30 years
quite a few people have taken a swing at
me to try to actually destroy my life
now if somebody went after one of those
reporters legitimately right
with real complaints about real things
that happen and it happened to destroy
their life
would i feel bad about that not really
because that's the game they got in
right it's the same reason that
i i control how much i complain about my
own critics
because i intentionally got into a job
where you attract
critics so you know that's part of
something i accepted
all right so we're watching that story
that's fun speaking of my critics
although i'm not sure this is a critic
so this is actually from
somebody who is uh fairly objective
oddly enough somebody put tried to put
together my predictions
uh over time to see how well i predicted
now i noted when i looked at the list of
predictions there are tons of
predictions
that aren't on there and the ones i
remember of course are the ones i got
right
so the number of predictions i got right
that are not in the list
and yet still uh claimed that the claim
is that if i said something is 100
likely to happen
it comes to 73 percent of the time
now that's even lacking lots of the ones
that i got right
now i don't remember too many times i've
said 100 likelihood
and i feel as if maybe that was a
judgment call i don't know
uh because i make such a big deal about
saying nothing's 100
that i'm not sure i really said a lot of
things were 100
maybe i did but um i don't think you
could uh
this is a tough thing to measure so
you'll see some predictions missing
but i like the fact that uh even the
person who was
doing the uh predictions
noted that they appreciated my
predictions in a
falsifiable way and i do it publicly so
you can see if i'm right or wrong
and i appreciate that all right here's a
prediction i made which is
not on that list of predictions
uh and i don't know why some are not on
it but
do you remember that i predicted on one
of these telstra
on one of these live streams that when
the
pandemic first started and the
vaccinations were
first first talked about
and i said that as soon as the
vaccinations are given
you will see stories of somebody who
died
immediately after or had a medical
complication
and i told you you need to know that
these are coming
and you need to ignore them because when
millions of people get a vaccination
it's guaranteed statistically some of
them will die right after it and you
won't know why
because people die and often you don't
know why
and so i told you don't assume this
means the vaccinations are
are deadly could be you can't rule it
out
but it doesn't mean that it just means
that there's a timing thing there was a
vaccination
somebody died sure enough there's a utah
mother
in the news today like the the most the
most
reliably predictable thing that could
ever happen and she died suddenly after
taking the second dose of covet vaccine
and then also their danish health
officials they halted the
astrazetica shots because they found uh
severe blood clots in in some people who
received the doses
now was it also predictable that there
would be some kind of statistical
cluster
of problems that seemed to coincide with
the shots
yes what were the odds that there would
be a coincidental
purely coincidental cluster of medical
problems the same kind of medical
problem
uh this seemed to be before you've
studied it closely
this seemed to be closely related to the
shots what were the odds that was going
to happen
a hundred percent because remember we
they didn't say in advance there's a
chance of blood clotting
blood clotting was one of i don't know
infinite number of things that might
have gone wrong
and i'm not sure blood clotting even
quite makes sense with the vaccination
is that something that could happen i
don't i'm not a doctor so i don't quite
see the
the mechanism that connects them but i
suppose anything's possible
um so there was a hundred percent chance
that
some kind of medical uh coincidental
cluster would happen
in some country somewhere
soon after shots it was guaranteed
does that mean that these blood clots
are from the vaccinations
nope it just means that they're smart to
take a look at it
and i think that they're doing that so
do not
take these anecdotal one-off stories
even if it's a cluster of people with
the same problem
it's guaranteed by the law of laws of
big numbers and statistics these were
going to happen
but i'm not saying that that the shots
are
risk-free i assume there's some side
effects
to somebody in special cases
biden's going to do his first public
address as president tonight i guess or
today
and he hasn't done a press conference in
50 days
are you gonna watch the biden speech
just to see if he falls apart
because i think he can still read right
that's all we'll be watching for us to
see if he can function
but i guess i'll probably watch that but
i suppose he can still read the
teleprompter
um looks like the public is uh by
majority happy about this
covid relief package do you know why
people are
happy on average about the covid relief
package
because they don't understand what's in
it except for the free money part
if you want to make a legislation
popular
make it too complicated to understand
except for the part about where we're
going to send you free money
and then you're going to have a popular
popular bill there
so it doesn't mean anything that people
are in favor of it
because of course they would be in favor
of it the part they understand
which brings me to um a comment
by hotep jesus who you should be
following
on twitter hotep jesus
uh you can just google him he'll pop up
and he tweeted this he said we need to
introduce the bill to congress which
halts all bill's submission then mandate
all bills to be five pages
instead of hundreds of pages like they
are now in 12 point
uh times roman font double spaced and
written at a fifth grade reading level
and then the president should read all
bills aloud now i don't think the
president would have time to read all
the bills because there's lots of
unimportant ones
but i would only add to this idea
that five pages five pages
why does it need to be five pages if you
can't put your
what the law is on one page you need to
go back and rewrite it
now the big problem of course is that
these big bills are
omnibus or whatever you want to call
them where lots of different things are
stuck in it so it's just a big
big thing to which i say fine
if you can't fit all of that stuff on
one page
it can't be in the bill simple
because human beings can't understand
hundreds of pages of stuff
so what would be the point of hundreds
of pages of legalese that nobody can
understand
there's no point if you can't put your
bill on one page
and an ordinary person a citizen can
read it and say oh i get it
i see the basic idea here if you can't
do that that need not be a bill
and if you have to break out lots of
little ones
from these omnibus bills well maybe
you'd have to do it
now at the moment the the lumping them
together is what helps you pass a bill
because you have to bribe different
senators and
people in congress you have to bribe
them basically to say yes to something
they didn't want to say yes to
so you say well we'll give your state
you know this
this money and your state will get this
so you'll get re-elected
and vote against the vote for the bill
you don't want so
that pork has a as a bribery function
that is essential to the operation of
our government
but if you had a one-page rule
it would kind of go away because the one
page would
basically get the public involved i
would also say that when i start my
new city someday when i build a city
from scratch
there are a few things that i will do
number one there will be no need for
identification
because your your face and your
biometrics will always be your
identification
so you'll never need a driver's license
in my new city
again this this imagines you could
create a city where the federal
government doesn't have control i know
that's not possible
uh maybe it's an island maybe i'll start
my city and on the ocean 12 miles out
but uh another thing would be a law that
says
lawyers can't use legalese that it would
be literally
illegal to write a contract or a law
that the average person can't easily
understand so you just can't use
legalese
and you would get rid of the need for
most lawyers
you wouldn't even need lawyers if
contracts were written in in just
ordinary
language and that's one of the things i
did with my own lawyer
over the course of my career through
lots of cases where
where somebody would want to do a deal
and maybe it's not that much
money involved but you don't want to
spend forever dealing with a lawyer for
what is not such a big deal and so i
would just take my lawyer's
first draft and i would just rewrite it
into
ordinary language and then i would give
it back to my lawyer and say
am i saying the same thing you said
except you can understand mine and my
lawyer would often say
yeah yeah you know mine's like
a little more precise but yours says the
same thing basically
so we'll go with yours so you can
actually get your lawyer to agree to
using real language if
you know if you have that kind of
relationship
all right it turns out that even cnn is
reporting
that the biden's plan to deal with
saudi arabia over the khashoggi thing is
basically trump's plan
so biden is just adopting trump's
approach to saudi arabia which is
you know penalizing some of the
individuals with sanctions and stuff
but not but not punishing you know
uh mbs the the the guy who ordered it
so here's another one of my predictions
right and
this prediction is not on my list of
things i got right but i'm getting it
right as it goes and that goes like this
that the longer trump is out of office
the better he'll look because biden will
be forced to do
the same things that trump did you know
kids in cages
and the saudi arabia thing there's going
to be a whole bunch of stuff he does
that's just going to prove trump had the
only solution because he'll have to
follow the same solution
and cnn also finally the k-file group
within cnn
uh is reporting on governor cuomo
downplaying the nursing home deaths
so on their website it's just one line
it's over on the right yeah the most
de-emphasized part of the
the page though with just one line of
text no picture
just a line of text over on the far
right with some
less important stories but they're
covering it
right so we'll give them credit for
covering it they're certainly not
emphasizing it
as you know fox is emphasizing it every
day
senator rand paul introduced a bill to
fund students instead of systems
what that means is if a kid wanted to go
to a different
school than the public school then the
funding that
that the school gets would move with the
child
to a private school for example and now
that would create
a competition in schools and it would be
the biggest step toward dismantling
systemic racism
because as you know the teachers unions
are the source of most
systemic racism that lingers in this
country
and the reason is that if you fixed
education
then that doesn't fix every form of
systemic racism
but it does make it a lot less important
you know if
every black person in this country can
get a good education
which is certainly not the case right
now it goes a long way
toward making things look better for
everybody right
so fixing the teachers unions which are
the source of bad schooling because they
they make it impossible to have a
competition
but senator rand paul would try to break
that log jam with this
this bill that would give funding to the
students instead of the system
and i will say the same thing i've been
saying a number of times
are there only two senators
because i thought they were like a
hundred right
but why is it that anything that happens
is that's worth a damn
comes from the same two people if it
doesn't come from rand paul it comes
from tom cotton
am i wrong i feel like there's only two
two people who are even trying to do
work
like it just feels like the rest of them
aren't even trying or something
how many senators have you never even
heard their names
what the hell are they doing right so
rand paul
taking on like i said
biggest problem in the country or one of
them right the the school situation
um tom cotton taking on china
in a number of different ways one of the
biggest problems in the world
who else is doing anything
a ted cruz actually yeah ted cruz also
uh he does he does emerge as somebody
doing actual things
but it's kind of amazing isn't it why
would you why would you go through all
the trouble to get elected
and go to congress or go to the senate
and then you don't do much
somebody says taylor green's doing a lot
well josh
yeah josh hawley you could throw him in
the mix he's
yeah he's making some noise but it does
the point stands there only a handful of
people who are doing anything
i would like to throw in this tip for
you
remember i told you that every every
live stream i'll try to tell you
something that's useful
i told you about how not to use the word
not
when you're denying some claim so you
got that
but i would like to add this if you're
trying to build your sk
your skill stack your talent stack the
most
accessible skill is success
meaning that if you were this describes
me perfectly
at about the age of 12 i said to myself
wait a minute why are some people
successful and some are not
and i asked myself is it technique
are some people just using a different
technique or is it just luck
is it just pure luck and it didn't look
to me like pure luck it looked to me
and i started following the stories of
successful people
and whenever there was any story in the
press even as even as a child
anybody who was successful i'd read that
story like every word of it
say okay what's the pattern what did
they do and then
later as i got a little older if there'd
be a book about how to succeed
i'd read it tip on how to succeed i'd
read it
it turns out it does take some work i
mean you'd have to read the books you'd
have to find out which ones to read etc
but there is no more accessible skill
than success
and since that's sort of a domain that
i've
wandered into people's own success
had had to have a better strategy how to
know what is and what isn't
had to have a system not a not a goal
how to build your talent stack
so since i'm mostly dealing in this
self-help realm
it occurred to me that there's some
number of people
who live their entire life not knowing
that success is a learnable skill
now i'm not saying that everything i
tell you has to be like the last word
on what to do to be successful although
i think it's a good start
i'm saying that if you if you take it as
your mission
to find out the body of work around what
works and what doesn't
what is successful what isn't and you
make that as sort of a
part of your system so uh in my case i
had a system
which is that i would continuously learn
what other people
think works and doesn't work in the
realm of success
now of course people say a lot of stuff
turns out not to be so useful
so you have to you have to be pretty
aggressive about filtering
and seeing what really works for you and
experimenting etc
but i'm just going to leave you with
this fact if you didn't know
that success the techniques of success
are learnable and somewhat easily
compared to let's say learning a foreign
language which should be hard
learning engineering that's hard
learning math
that's hard but learning the techniques
of success are weirdly simple
you just have to be exposed to them
that's all
so um here's a
question what are the recommended
therapeutics
for coven 19 in the united states so
let's say you go to the doctor
and they test you and you've got covet
what therapeutics do you get in the
united states
now the reason i ask is that we see
reports of various
therapeutics from ivermectin to
a bunch of things with big words
let's see monoclonal antibodies
bamlan of the meb and edison
and uh i think i pronounced those
correctly let me say them again
but bad enough something so i think you
got those
and they massively reduce
hospitalization these are
lilies monoclonal antibodies so we keep
hearing these stories
about various therapeutics that reduce
hospitalizations to
zero basically right
or close to zero so i asked the question
given that we hear all these reports of
therapeutics that reduce the risk to
zero
why are people still dying
right so i asked the question what
therapeutics do you get
in the united states do you know what
the answer is do you know what
therapeutic you get
if you go in and you do test positive
for covet
nothing nothing
that's that is the current the current
therapeutic
is that if you have a confirmed case of
covet
you get nothing go home tell us if it
gets worse
and i feel like i didn't quite know that
until today actually
a number of people confirmed it but
what is the point of therapeutics if you
don't get them
now i i'm assuming that when people come
in with
worse symptoms or maybe if they have
some comorbidities
that the that the doctor or the hospital
will be a little bit more aggressive
and getting into some of these but
correct me if i'm wrong
don't most of the therapeutics have this
quality to them
if you don't get it really soon it
doesn't help as much
because i think there are a number of
therapeutics that aren't so good when
you're close to death
but are terrific if you get it early
right
but we don't give that to people early
why is it because the ivor mexican
doesn't work
or these monoclonal things is because we
don't have enough
is there some place where we could say
okay
a hundred percent of the people who come
in with any kind of comorbidity even if
it's just
a little overweight we're going to give
you these monoclonal antibodies we're
going to give you ivermectin
and basically take all the people who
are at risk and just
eliminate the risk couldn't we
is it just a supply problem is that it
somebody says insurance is the reason i
can't
confirm that that would be true but i
wouldn't rule it out
i would not rule out a distorting effect
from insurance
i'm not going to make that claim but i
think you'd have to look at that for
sure
um yeah and
you know of course people are saying
there's not enough money in therapeutics
et cetera i don't know that that's the
case there's a reason that they're made
the companies that make the therapeutics
didn't make them not to be used so they
want them to be used
all right so i feel as if we could
almost say the therapeutics
we don't use them until they're too late
in many cases um there's a
oh but the the study that said these
lily monoclonal antibodies
were successful it took about five
minutes for
anatoly lubarski one of my favorite
skeptics to weigh in to say that the
study is not very good
often have you heard this there's a
study that shows that something or
something
helps with the coronavirus and five
minutes later uh it's not a very good
study
so even i could recognize that it wasn't
a very powerful study
meaning that there weren't enough people
feel that you got the right answer but
uh so it's a little weak
uh just so you know michael amina who's
been the one
most advocating the quick cheap
tests which are not legal in the united
states because the fda requires a
prescription
to get a test and i think reporting is
still required
two things which almost prove that our
fda is corrupt
we just don't know who at the fda or
what kind of
corruption it is but i think we can
conclude at this point that the fda
has a corruption problem and this the
uh the rapid testing thing i just shows
it as clearly as you could possibly show
it
now i'm open to a counter argument if
the fda would like to argue
that they have reasons for these having
a prescription
and a reporting requirement if there are
reasons i'd like to hear them but
short of hearing the reasons you have to
assume corruption at the fda
but michael meena announced a massive
public health research study with
citibank
and i if i have this right they're going
to use
just in a test scenario they're going to
test these rapid tests on i think
probably just citibank employees for a
while and see if it makes a difference
i don't know if it's citibank employees
only but
the point is that there's going to be
some testing on this
and it will be harder for the fda to say
no
this could be really really important
for future pandemics and
maybe it helps us mop up a little at the
end of this one
but we should have been doing this a
year ago we really should have
let's talk about the george floyd trial
um so jack posabic is reporting on this
i don't know who else is reporting on it
i feel like the only thing i'm saying
about the the
trial is from from jack um
and he tweeted today i don't know who
needs to hear this but nearly every
potential juror
called in the george floyd case
testified that they were terrified of
being
doxed and their families threatened if
they served on the jury
you should just stop the trial now
we should stop the trial
you got to stop the trial this is not
fair
because somebody is going to say yes to
serving on this jury
and i don't think they should i feel as
if this situation
is just not fair
to the poor citizens who are just trying
to do their civic duty
and to do a trial stop the trial
stop it right now move it you know maybe
move it somewhere where
people would be less concerned but man
if if nearly every potential jury has
this
fear the people who don't have the fear
and maybe say yes to serving either
means they're going to vote to
they already know they're going to vote
to convict
which is the worst possible scenario or
they're not aware enough to know that
they're in danger
and you don't want that person making
life and death decisions either
right you should stop this trial right
away
in the same way here's something i've
told you before that
um you don't decide what your product is
the customer tells you what business
you're in so if you think you're
providing one kind of service or a
product
but your customers keep asking for
something that's a little different
and then you start giving that thing
that's a little different that's the
business you're in
you're in that business your customers
decide what business you're in
by telling you that's what they need and
then you just move to that business
i think we have to apply some of that
thinking to this trial
normally normally
the court system tells us
what the trial is and the court system
says we've got this system
it's a jury of your peers it's going to
work with these rules
and that's good that normally works but
what happened here already
is that the customers in this case the
jurors
just changed the product they just told
you this isn't the product
the product that the court system thinks
they're selling
you know in a in a figurative sense is
some kind of fair justice system
that's like every other fair trial we've
had
this isn't like that this is dangerous
to the jurors this is really dangerous
to the jurors
and it needs to be stopped they need to
just call it off right now
and try to figure out how to do it in a
safe way but it needs to be stopped we
should not be putting
citizens who are just trying to do their
civic duty
in front of a firing squad it's it's
outrageous
if i were one of the
lawyers for the george floyd case here's
one of the things i would be arguing
uh as somebody said to me on twitter um
scott
how can you say it's the fentanyl that
might have killed george floyd we know
fentanyl was in his system we know
fentanyl kills you quickly the way
george floyd died
but at the same time there was a police
officer's knee on his neck
and so somebody said uh scott there was
a knee
on his neck for nine minutes
so to which i say if i'm
uh if i'm the defense attorney for derek
chovin i say um
if you look around the courtroom you'll
see a number of men wearing neckties
how many of them will be strangled to
death
by their neckties by the end of today
because they'll be wearing those
neckties for hours
how many of them will die from
strangulation
and the answer is probably none
and you know why because things that
touch
your neck don't kill you
watch this
still alive still alive
i can breathe
so it turns out that things can look
like they're strangling you
and not even barely be touching you at
all
how about that in fact if i were the
attorney
i would take off my neck die wrap it
around my neck
hold it as tight as possible and give my
closing statement
while holding it really really tight
so that the jury could not possibly miss
the point
that things can look like strangulation
and not be right since they're only
arguing
a um you know the defense only has to
argue
reasonable doubt and so if the if the
main thing
is this this visual video
that has there is a there is a knee
touching a neck
right anybody who says that shouldn't be
looked into
well i disagree you need to look into
that right
if somebody dies while a policeman is on
their neck
you have to look into that but the
reasonable doubt is just all over this
thing
right well he passed out but we assume
that he might have
anyway because he had the kind of drugs
in him that makes you pass out in those
situations
now the the part that's going to be
dicey is what about the
um whether they should have known
that there was a risk you know he was
saying i can't breathe
but he was also saying that before they
put him on the ground
so a reasonable person could have
thought well he's just saying this has
nothing to do with his position
but i believe on the video that the
officers asked him if he was on any
drugs
does anybody remember that did the
police officers not
ask him directly what drugs he was on or
if he was on any drugs
i think he did and i believe that george
floyd lied
and said he was not now
how would this have gone if george floyd
had said
yes i have some fentanyl
well he probably didn't know he had
fentanyl but yes
i have a number of opioids in me
what would the police officer do if
somebody who said i just took a bunch of
opioids and i have a breathing problem
now if that cop doesn't treat that as a
medical problem
well that's a problem right because
every cop should know
that somebody who takes too many opioids
could die
and their breathing problem might be the
you know the
the warning that that's gonna happen
pretty soon so
he should the cop would have handled it
completely differently one imagines
if george floyd had not lied to him
about his medical condition
so if you're saying hey why didn't
the officer believe him when he said i
can't breathe
why did the officer believe him when he
said he didn't have any drugs
the fact is he was dealing with a liar
when when george floyd said he wasn't
taking it
he wasn't on anything don't you think
the police knew he was on something
not necessarily opioids i mean that
would be hard to tell
but they knew he was lying right so once
he had established that he would lie to
the police officers
when he said that he couldn't breathe
and that's sort of a common thing that
people say
oh i'm handcuffed i can't breathe right
this is probably
probably one of the most common things
police officers hear when they
they try to control a person so i don't
see any chance
that you're that there's going to be a
conviction on the murder charges
there might be something in terms of
procedure or something that was violated
i don't know
um so we're hearing more stories about
harris
watching cnn prepare uh
kamala harris to take over is kind of
funny because it's a little bit
heavy-handed it's just a little too a
little too obvious what they're doing
but there's a story today that's just
sort of building her up to get ready to
take over
and here's what the cnn is saying
quote she spends a good portion of each
day
around four to five hours with biden and
their team behind closed doors
according to white house sources now how
many hours a day
did pence spend with trump
closer to zero right
now i do think that they talk a lot but
do you think
pence spent a four to five hours around
trump every day
i don't think so i don't think so
so this is of course softening you up to
to see her as a co-president
because she's just always in the room uh
and then
they quote jim clyburn saying the
chemistry between the two of them is
great
said representative jim clyburn do you
remember any stories about the chemistry
between
pence and trump i don't recall
any chemistry stories do you
all right
and those says learning on the job is no
small thing for the second in command
learning on the job learning what
is she learning how to be a vice
president
what does learning on the job mean i
feel like it means
in this context learning to be the
president
which of course the vice president
should do um
and she's taking it says she then says
she's taking a very strong
hands-on approach to his most important
projects
that's right she's taking a strong
hands-on approach to his most important
projects
which sounds a little bit like she might
already be making the decisions
we're like moving in that direction
and then this this last part which is
just laugh out loud funny
biden himself strategized the passage of
the stimulus package
and personally worked the most critical
senators
now wouldn't that be just every
president
doesn't every president talk about the
strategy of getting something passed
if they want it to get passed wouldn't
that just be every conversation every
day with every president
what's the strategy to get this passed
best but i feel like they had to add it
in for biden to make you think that he
his brain still works oh biden he's all
over the strategizing
yeah he's still good
all right i asked yesterday on my
local's
channel uh which is a subscription
service locals.com
i asked my uh followers there what they
got the most
value out of and the answer i saw the
most was
reframing how to reframe a situation so
you just
think about it in a more productive way
and i realized that most of what i do is
reframing
and it's super powerful so i'm going to
be doing more of
more of that i'll give you an example of
some of the reframes
one of them is systems versus goals just
reframing the way you think about
success
from a goal-oriented to a systems
oriented
thinking about how you prepare your
skills
from being really good at one thing to a
skill stack where you have
a combination of skills that work well
those are reframes
um reframing equals apologist
no it doesn't it's nothing like that a
reframe is
could be used in any context has nothing
to do with politics per se
reframing in politics is usually just
more politics
but reframing about success or how you
how you look at the world that's
that's useful uh
harris is there's the military
industrial
yeah i see what you're saying there
reframe success well you know there are
lots of components
within success that will be reframed and
uh i will reframe biden
well um i don't think that of reframing
so much in terms of a person i think of
reframing
in terms of how you you visualize things
or how you
how you imagine things in your head
um odds that biden speaks live
well i think he will speak life
um i met if warm kiss ready to go
okay that's an interesting concept
uh reframing equals antifa
yeah antifa did a clever reframing
whereby calling themselves anti-fascist
you can't be against them without being
a fascist
so that was pretty clever that's more
persuasion than framing i think
um all right so more on that later and i
will talk to you all tomorrow
and that's it for today
all right youtubers
jill biden's done more than melania i
don't know what has jill biden done
i have nothing against jill biden i
think she's
probably doing a great job by the way
uh question on jen
saki what is the effect of you saying
circle back
uh on jennifer orsaki's use of it
i don't quite understand the question
but the the circle back thing is just
something people are talking about
because she says it a lot there's not
not too much to say about that
um let's see i want to see that comment
again
yeah i don't understand the questions
saw 700 so
ask it a different way i'm not sure i'll
be here much longer
somebody says bill gates is a eugenicist
no he isn't so all of those things like
you know bill gates is a eugenicist and
you know he's going to put a chip in you
those are crazy those are crazy
and they're they're so far from being a
rational opinion
that it almost has to be seen as mental
illness of some kind some some mild kind
of mental illness
where you where you imagine that the guy
who's literally doing the most
to help the world is actually some kind
of a devil character
i mean that's that's a weird it's it's
kind of mental illness but i don't know
what i would call it per se
somebody says scott adams is a toad
perfectly reasonable opinion
will houses in your city have virtual
reality headsets installed maybe
how much roblox the stock did i buy none
but i'll tell you
i i have i've witnessed a child hooked
on that
program roblox and i've never seen
anything like it
there is something about that that has a
stickiness
that's just crazy are you on bill gates
payroll i am not
why would you even assume that
somebody says bill is no patriot
bill is no patriot you know i'm going to
agree with you on that
because i don't see bill gates being a
nationalist
he does seem to be a globalist but not
in the globalist
bad way but rather he just sees his
mission as being outside of
you know not not restricted to the
united states so i would
i would i wouldn't say he's not a
patriot
it's just not his his brand
um akira the don plays your tunes yes he
does he's got a really good
a good one of that
how will you overcome the secret cabal
if you run for president
what's the oh the secret cabal of people
who are really in power
well you'd have to do it with the way
trump did it the first time which is
surprise them
because there are there are certain um
let's say gates to keep people
out of power but if you overwhelm the
gate before they know what you're doing
it's too late that's what he did
um
who paid for the fraud i don't know what
you're talking about
have you experienced telepathy not that
i'm aware of
i've experienced things that like have
that sensation
why let nerds who are by definition
socially
inept run society well you talk about
bill gates right
i i would say that bill gates does a
really good job of sticking to the
things that bill gates is good at
which is looking at complicated
situations and trying to simplify them
and figure out what's a good strategy
if you could tell me there's somebody
better at that
maybe elon musk right maybe jeff bezos
there are a handful of people you'd say
okay are really good at this looking at
complicated things and
picking out what's important that's what
he does if he told you
how to have good manners or something
that would be you'd be the wrong person
um
are you interested in power structures
uh
interested sure i don't know what that
means
do you go to aaa no
why do you ask is it because i say that
alcohol is poison
by the way that's another reframe
somebody said that
it was helpful in stopping drinking that
just saying that alcohol is poison
and just repeating it whenever you see
alcohol
makes it so all right that's all for now
and i'll talk to you
tomorrow
