and congratulations
you made it to the highlight of
civilization yeah you did that good job
you woke up this morning and you said to
yourself i think i'll do something
amazing today and then you did you
showed up here
just in time unless you're watching this
on recorded replay in which case you're
just as awesome but a little bit delayed
how would you like to take it up to a
higher level yet
highest level of awareness possible yeah
let's max it out and all you need is a
copper mug or a glass of tanker
chelsea's diamond canteen jugger flask a
vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip and it's happening now
get ready everybody go
you know
you'll always remember where you were
when you took the first simultaneous
step
probably right where you are right now
in most cases
but you won't forget that will you
so
yesterday
was an interesting day for me
as my days often are
and it was interesting because i heard
from a couple of different people that
i'd
said something or done something that
had an impact on their lives
and i i saw two people in particular
believe that videos that i've produced
have cured mental health problems
uh
and
it was real people saying
their stories
and i thought uh
how many people have had that experience
is it more than two
because the videos were created for that
purpose
but i don't have a direct
way to get feedback
how many of you in the comments
feel that something i produced or said
a video usually
fixed a mental health issue for you or
somebody close to you
oh my goodness
that's a lot of yeses
is this real
um
over on the locals platform they see
different videos than you do on youtube
so they see what i call my micro lessons
now the micro lessons are designed to
reframe and reprogram people
and i'm seeing a wall of yes's
now are you answering the right question
the question was specifically
a mental health problem
it's a wall of yeses
i was not expecting that
oh my god
something's happening
you know you i'm gonna just turn the
screens toward each other you have to
see this
youtube you've got to see this
i'm not making this up
look at the comments
i'm going to ask you again how many
people
feel that i help them cure or reduce a
mental health problem with a with a
video that i created
can you say that
i wasn't expecting that at all
holy
what is going on here
good lord
i don't know
my head is exploding
i don't even know what to make of this
i'm a little bit stunned
now i'm wait i'm wasted here's what i
expected i thought i'd get two or three
people
i didn't expect to see a wall of yes
wow
all right well
there was a specific video that
people were talking about
was it one what was the number on it
i wrote it down and now i can't find it
anyway if you check my twitter feed less
791
yeah so my video labeled 791 if you're
looking for it
uh
791 i think that's right that sounds
right
so that was the one that cured people's
mental health problems now if you're new
to my live stream i'm a trained
hypnotist
and i'm writing a book right now on how
to do that
but apparently that book's going to be
more important than i thought
so what the book would try to do is
capture all of the reframes
that people seem to have responded to
and i guess whatever it was that fixed
all these people's mental health
problems it was a reframe but i don't
know which one it was so i'm gonna have
to go figure it out myself
was there a specific reframe that i used
or was it more the totality of it was it
like a
one specific like sentence because
usually it is it's like one sentence
that
switches your brain
the addiction reframe
systems it's different stuff okay so i
guess i don't know exactly what it was
we'll figure that out
um
tick tock has announced that it's going
to be
helping people with elections in the
united states
now that's good news isn't it so a
chinese-owned company is going to help
american voters make decisions on who to
vote for
that's actually happening
a chinese-owned company
has announced that it has a whole
variety of things it's going to be doing
to help american voters
make the right decisions and not be
fooled by fake news
what could go wrong
what could go wrong
when you have the chinese government
in charge of deciding what american
voters will see before they make a
decision
i see no problem with that whatsoever do
you
so helpful so helpful
so one of the questions i'm wondering is
um do you think the tick tock algorithms
will show people a lot of news
on the topic of china sending fentanyl
precursors to mexican cartels to kill a
hundred thousand americans again this
year
if you had to guess do you think the
tick tock algorithm will give you a lot
of that
a lot of news about the uyghurs
how many tech talks about the uyghurs
are we're going to see a lot of them
because they want to give you the facts
right
give you the facts just straight facts
how in the world is this legal
now i understand that the data is going
to be stored at some oracle
american facility
but
that's just the data
that's just the data
what about the algorithm the algorithm
is the one that's programming people not
the data
if the thing you're worried about is
china has my data
they were going to get your data anyway
probably i'm not sure if the data is the
big thing i mean i'd be worried about it
i wouldn't want them to have my data
but
isn't the algorithm the big thing
if they still control the algorithm they
decide
what we see
and how often we see it
that is all it takes to program your
brain
what do you see and how often do you see
it nothing else that's it and they have
complete control of that
and we're letting that happen
oh yeah that's okay
do they let that happen to them
does china let their citizens get
programmed by american media companies i
don't believe they do
i don't believe they do
do you know why because they're smart
do you know why we do allow our foreign
adversaries to reprogram the minds of
our own children
because we're dumb i guess we're dumb
or we're already controlled by china or
something
but
if trump is going to run for re-election
banning tick-tock needs to be right up
there at the top of his list
because it's sort of like the wall
it's easy for everybody to understand
and is right
if it's easy to understand
and it's unambiguously right for america
that's just like a classic
trump
campaign thing right it's simple
and it's obvious
and we're not doing it
you can't get a better campaign topic
than that
all right uh
how many of you followed the story of
andrew taint
and um
and i know some of you think that i'm
pronouncing it with an n but that's just
a yani and laurel thing you hear it that
way because i primed you
um but i'm actually saying t-a-t-e
so if it sounds like taint
to you
um that's probably just a
psychological phenomenon that's
happening on your end
but uh i heard there was this video of
him allegedly beating up a girl
have you heard that
there's a video of him allegedly
beating up a girl
so i said to myself
well i'm going to have to see that
to find out
how evil is this guy
and i first watched it with the sound
off
and then i listened to it with the sound
on
and here and that was an interesting
experiment
when i listened with the sound off i
said to myself
why is everybody so concerned about this
it looks like consensual sex to me
there was hair pulling there was
spanking
but there wasn't much in terms of
resistance it looked like two people who
had
probably negotiated
probably negotiated what was in and what
was out and it looked like they were
just doing their little kinky fun now
that was with the sound off
and then you turn the sound on
you turn the sound on
and it just sounds really frightening
and i say to myself was any of that
manipulated
because even if you heard the same sound
but you'd heard it sort of muffled i
don't think it would have sounded the
same
there's something about the loudness of
the sound
compared to the video
for example
there there was a part at the beginning
where uh it looks like he slapped her in
the face
when you see it with no sound on
it looks like it probably was more like
a you know within the context of
negotiated kinky play
more of a gets your attention not
intended to hurt
so without sound it looked like this was
a slap hey
sort of like that
now i'm not i'm not defending
or condemning right so i'm not giving
you any opinion on what's happening i'm
just describing it
so if you hear it without the sound
it looks like something that easily
could have been within the realm that
two people negotiated i don't know if
they did so i don't know what the woman
said afterwards by the way has anybody
heard from the woman
did the woman say afterwards
that she
she was within the realm of things she
had negotiated or was she not
i don't know
but when you hear the sound it's
frightening
because the sound of the slap
goes from something that i would have
imagined would not have even made a
sound
because remember he's in you know he was
an mma fighter
if he wanted to hurt her
it wouldn't have looked anything like
that
if his intention had been to hurt her
the visual would have looked a lot
different i think
i think now i'm not defending him right
i want to be really clear
because i don't know what was the
situation you know i don't have
information but i will say that when you
hear it without sound it looks
consensual
or it looks like it could be you don't
know for sure but it looks like it could
easily be within the realm of two people
doing something that maybe you don't do
but maybe other people do
let me ask you this in the comments
have any of you ever been involved in
sex play
in which there was hair pulling
uh light slapping
and spanking
and the other person who was a recipient
of such
clearly enjoyed it
so as expected there's a combination of
hell now and yes
lots of yeses and lots of no's right
now what do you what would you conclude
if you're one of the no's
if you're one of the people who said no
what would you conclude about the people
who said yes
are they all people who
uh sexually abuse people and
are not aware of it
you know maybe maybe the woman didn't
like it as much or could have been
either way it didn't have to be the
woman
but
do you do you imagine that women
don't enjoy this kind of play sometimes
some women in some situations with some
men
see the trouble is
that what you see visually is well
within the realm of what i would
consider
fairly routine
sexual practices that are not exactly in
the middle mainstream but they're not
too far out
but as soon as you hear the the audio
it turns into an assault
and so the question i would ask is there
anything about that audio that's been
manipulated
and i would look for specifically the
sound of the slap
because remember the two people were not
mite
there was no
but the sound of the slap is really loud
and the edit doesn't exactly match what
you see on the video
it looks like it looks like there might
have been a little
little video audio trickery going on but
i don't know anyway so let me say again
i'm not defending him
because
i don't like him
so if there's one thing you can be sure
of
i'm not going to defend him
right because he's a nemesis
so
but just be aware
that the days of if you saw it on video
it's true are long gone
it does not mean it's true if you saw it
with your own eyes on video if you heard
it with your own ears on video it
doesn't mean it happened it really
doesn't
that used to mean something it doesn't
mean anything anymore in fact i would
argue
that the more famous it is
the fact that it's on video is the less
likely it's true
so just be careful about that so i'm not
going to defend them i'm just going to
say be careful about what you believe
all right
and i think i would want to hear what
the woman said about it afterwards i'd
probably base my decision on that i
haven't seen that
um
i had a friend who i talked to yesterday
who made me laugh
for a long time
because he
he escaped the scenery
and it's funny when somebody does it and
here's what i mean he stopped using
social media except for
an obscure hobby he has so he follows
one hobby but that's it
and the the reason he described i wish i
actually i do have his actual words he's
gonna give you his actual words
for describing what he was experiencing
and what i heard when i saw his words
was it sounded like somebody who had
just achieved a higher level of
awareness and was trying to deal with it
all right
uh i gotta read the exact words
um
oh damn it not going to be funny but the
idea was that once he noticed that
everybody was playing a part like a
character
he couldn't debate politics anymore
because he wasn't really debating the
topic
he was in a play with characters
so there would be one character who
would be the american flag wearing
american guy
and there would be another character who
would be the
the left leaning i'm so left person
and then the third one is what made me
laugh he goes and then there's always
a coach
some kind of coach for whatever the
and i just lost it i thought oh my god
there is always the american flag guy
there's always the leftist crazy guy and
there's always a coach
there's always a coach
and it's always a coach for whatever the
and i
thought why is there always a coach
there is always a coach am i wrong
and when i heard that i just thought oh
my god
it is so obviously
it's just like civil war recreations
you know how the people who dress in
civil war outfits and they go do the
fake battles to recreate the battles
that's all social media is now it's
people literally taking putting on a
costume
and going to do symbolic battle
they don't know what the real date is
and they don't care
and one of them is always a coach
and i thought no this is exactly like
halloween
politics has just become halloween so
what happens a few weeks before actual
halloween
people start talking about what costume
they're going to wear
and what costume do people pick
well they do it for a variety of reasons
but often
often people will pick a costume that's
sort of how they're feeling
like oh on the inside i feel like a
devil
i'm going to be a devil
or i feel like livestock because i'm in
my cubicle all day i'm going to dress as
a cow
so at some level the halloween costume
you pick is a sort of a lifestyle
decision of who you want to pretend to
be
and i think that's what politics have
become
because we definitely don't have the
data to use data to make decisions it's
all sketchy data and we definitely don't
have the logic skills
but everybody knows how to act
everybody knows how to pretend
so instead of debates is now just
pretending
and if you understand people's reactions
as pretending to play a role everything
makes sense
if you imagine that they're trying to be
logical and failing it's just really
frustrating
because because you'll be like why
why is your logic failing
why
or is it me you always have that
question
and the answer is nobody's even
pretending to use logic they're just
dressing up it would be like asking
why are you dressing like a devil on
halloween when you know you're not
really a devil
that's not really the right question is
it
why are you dressing like a devil when
you're not really one
it's exactly the same with politics why
are you arguing that case when you know
that doesn't make sense right
it is compatible with with the costume
you're wearing but you know it doesn't
make sense right you do know that
that's what it feels like
and once he described the situation that
way i couldn't see it another way
it just feels like people wearing
costumes
all right
so watch for the coach of whatever the
how many of you seen the
the video there's a black and white
video from long ago maybe the 60s
in which a a russians
an ex-russian spy allegedly
who defected from the soviet union i
guess the soviet spy
was explaining the soviet union
secret plan
to brainwash
their enemies like americans into
accepting socialism that would destroy
america from inside
you've all seen that right
i can't tell you how many people have
sent that to me
yeah what's his name
yeah blah blah how many of you think
yuri um your years e besma buff it
wasn't black and white it was just
shitty video
yuri besmondov
right
how many of you think that he was a
credible person telling you something
useful
did you believe what he was saying
sounded pretty good didn't it sound
pretty credible
it's complete
he's absolute
now i hadn't watched the whole thing
before i'd seen clips
and
i imagined it was from the
clips so i'd never bothered to spend any
time listening
so i listened and i listened to an
extended app you know explanation it's
really obvious that it's
it's really obvious
now
i'll tell you why and maybe it'll be
obvious after i tell you
number one
uh on your detecting
checklist
what is number one on the checklist if
something's a hoax or a prank
let's say it's intentionally wrong
what's the first thing you look forward
to on the nose exactly
two on the nose
what is it that americans are afraid of
that those darn communists are trying to
infiltrate the brains of our children
ever since the 60s we've been afraid of
that
and there and there's that
there he is
just the way you'd expect
the exact person
telling you that behind the scenes
that's exactly what the bad guys are
doing they're reprogramming your
children
your children
so it's a little on the nose isn't it
now that doesn't mean they don't want to
reprogram your children
because i was just talking about tick
tock as somebody said
but here's the difference
tick tock can reprogram your children
in an hour
in an hour
tick tock can change your children's
opinions in an hour
do you know how long the soviets were
willing to wait uh 15 to 50 years
because that's how long they said it
takes to
educate the next generation of kids
to believe in all this socialism
well
have i ever told you the trick about
doing something random and then claiming
credit when things go your way
for example
when biden said he was going to release
the
national oil
reserves
to
increase the supply of oil and therefore
decrease the price
what did all of the experts say
they said but there's so little of that
oil that even if you released all of it
which would put us at some risk because
we wouldn't have the reserve then even
if he used all of it it wouldn't change
the volume enough
to change the price
much
but what did biden know
well he knew that if prices went up he
could say it would have been worse right
would have been worse
and he knew that if prices went down
which in the long run of course they
were going to go down then he could
claim credit
so if you know something's going to
change anyway you know the you know
business will go up and you know
business will go down
you do what all dilbert managers do you
change something
you change something and then claim
credit
so do you think that the russians were
or the soviets or maybe just this one
guy yuri do you think that it was clever
for him to say oh yes
the reason that people are asking for
more socialism
is because we
we've been hypnotizing them for
decades do you know what causes people
to ask for more socialism
a good economy
that's what doesn't
it was going to happen anyway
socialism was coming
no matter what the soviets did
because if you've got a bunch of rich
people and they're living the good life
and they're living right next to people
who do not have a good life what are the
people who don't have a good life going
to do
they're going to say i have a good
reason you should give me some of your
stuff and what would be the good reason
socialism
right it was going to happen on its own
and it happened everywhere
is there a country somewhere that had a
good economy and the poor people weren't
asking to get a bigger share
that happened nowhere
so the first part where uh the socialism
is you know embedded into our schools to
make everybody socialist i feel like
that was just going to happen on its own
and he's sort of taken credit for
something that's a normal trend
right
then what about the demoralizing part
that once we don't trust anything and we
get all demoralized
do you think we're more demoralized than
we've ever been
not really
the only thing we've done is woken up to
the fact that our news was probably
always fake
did we did we come out behind
by learning that our news was always
fake
because when this guy took this guy yuri
was talking
this wasn't a time when the cia was
hypnotizing the citizens
and you didn't know it
the cia was actively
you know
managing movies and tv
to hypnotize the public to get some
result that the government wanted
was that good
are you better off now
knowing that the soviets are trying to
influence you
not soviets the russians
and the chinese
and also knowing that your own
government is trying to influence you
i'd say we're ahead
how did we come out behind
to me we're way ahead because now we
understand that we were being hypnotized
way back then
and not only by
opponents but by our own government and
quite intentionally and quite
aggressively
so
i feel like uh yuri
was more of an opportunist
was he selling a book by the way
does anybody know was he selling a book
at the time
because if he wasn't selling a book
i would worry that he was still working
for the soviet union
and if he wasn't selling a book
it means that he probably was not so
much an ex-spy if you know what i mean
he might have been a current spy
he was a professor okay
but people are always selling a book
i don't know
so i would say i wouldn't trust anything
about him because his
explanations were academic and generic
and they really described things that
were going to happen anyway for
different reasons
and his
two on the nose part is a big flag
yes i am selling several books
does that make me less credible because
i'm selling books
it would depend on the book you're
selling doesn't it
but anyway the beauty of my books are
the funny ones you can either laugh or
not laugh
and that's all they're trying to do and
the ones that are self-help you can look
at the people who already tried them and
you can see what their outcome was
so you don't really have to depend on me
for credibility
um yesterday i came upon just by
accident the first ronald reagan press
conference from 1981
and i tweeted it around
it's really interesting
if you look at reagan's first press
conference
check his let's say
his skill level
his communication ability and compared
to biden and trump
it's really interesting and i'll tell
you what my impression was and i think
yours might be different right because
we're all going to have a subjective
impression
but my first impression was
my goodness this guy is good
wow i mean i remembered him as being
good
but he was really good
like his his charisma and his control of
the stage and
and uh how he kept he kept the
conversation at a high level
like he didn't get in the weeds he kept
everything at a higher level
was masterful
he was great
but
here's a big butt
when he started taking questions about
all different things
because it seemed like in those days
they would ask you more obscure
questions
somebody would stand up and say
mr president
the
native american
reservations
have
spotted eagles that are being destroyed
by the tractors what are you going to do
about it and and it'd be some topic that
the president's never even heard of
and then they have to respond to it
now
it seems like they used to ask that kind
of question all the time
and it was really good for
seeing what the president would deal how
he would deal with he or she would deal
with the question that
was tricky
and i don't think they asked questions
like that anymore
but reagan was actually a little bit
stumped
because there were things he had made no
decisions on didn't have a thought on
and he kept having to say well yeah well
well we we've just been here nine days
we've been working on this big
legislation and when i'm done with that
uh you know we'll be able to look at
some other things but i don't have
anything to tell you about that now
now i do think there's a way to say that
confidently
and in a way that makes the country say
oh okay i get it that's that's coming up
you haven't done it yet
but
he did seem a little bit
scared and lost
during the questions where he didn't
have a
prepared answer so what i saw is that
where he had prepared answers
like a good actor he could deliver his
lines and he would wow you i mean his
presentation was really spectacular
but when he didn't have prepared lines
he did look a little lost
he did look a little lost and i thought
you could actually detect
maybe the beginnings of some lack of
capability but that's probably my
imagination
because we know that you know toward the
end of his term there were more
questions about his mental capability
but if you look at it through today's
lens and compare it to trump's
performance and to biden
it's really really interesting if you
have any historical
curiosity
all right
you know it's funny we keep redefining
terms
and my critics are
are funny
so here are some things that my critics
have told me in the last 24 hours
that if you got the jab
you were taking a dangerous experimental
drug
that's one thing they said
and that people who voluntarily take a
dangerous experimental drug are called
cowards
so the people who do something that's uh
dangerous
and they volunteered to do it are
cowards
this is different than how i used to use
that word i used to think that people
who volunteered to do something that was
dangerous
would be called uh
brave
but now they're called um they're called
cowards
and i also learned that
uh staying home is called freedom
that's called freedom
but getting a vaccination so you can
travel the world is a form of slavery
because you're doing what other people
want you to do which is get the shot
so while i was in bora bora and
santorini
and peop my critics were in their
basements staying home because they
couldn't travel
they were experiencing something called
freedom
while i was suffering
in a
five-star resort
with my lack of freedom
and that's what i learned this week
so here's my uh takeaway on that
i don't know what is the best take on
anything
necessarily
but i'll tell you what the lowest worst
take is
here's the worst take
that there was somebody during the
pandemic who was operating on fear
and there was somebody who was not
nothing like that happened
you were either afraid of the shot or
you were afraid
of not getting the shot
by which they could make a good decision
so it was fear and guessing
so you used whatever you were most
afraid of and then you rationalized it
that's all that happened there was
nobody brave
every single person made a fear-based
decision were you afraid of the
government afraid of losing your job
afraid of were you afraid of
not being able to travel were you afraid
of being alone or you're afraid of
something
so to imagine that some group were
afraid and cowards
and some group were not is really the
lowest level of understanding
it's not even a logic problem it's like
a low level of understanding
what a human is
that's like a complete misunderstanding
of how a brain works
how people operate in the real world
we're basically just afraid of stuff and
then rationalizing our choices after the
fact that's pretty much all we do
we're afraid of stuff and then we
come up with reasons why it makes sense
that's it
and if you think we're a reason-based
species
and that some of us are brave and some
of us are not
nothing like that's happening
you're just gonna be confused if you go
through life thinking that's that's what
your reality looks like
all right um
and then because i can't talk about a
story without becoming part of it
um i was asking on
twitter because i keep seeing graphs
showing there's all these excess deaths
after the pandemic have you seen those
on the internet a graph that's showing
we expect this many deaths in a normal
situation
but it seems like everywhere they're
higher pretty much globally wherever you
can determine it they're higher
now
let's do a bias check
if you believe that the data is correct
what is the most reasonable
hypothesis for why they're higher go
so here you're going to be just giving
you the most we don't know
because nobody's saying they know
all right so could we agree that nobody
knows
but what is the most reasonable
hypothesis for why they would be higher
uh
somebody thinks has to do with how the
the financial
incentives work okay
um
people who died with covet instead of
because of i don't know if that fits
into excess deaths
the data could be wrong
right what about the odds that the data
is just wrong
some are saying the most obvious is the
is the lockdown
some are saying is the most obvious is
the delay of health care
some are saying it's obesity
people got fatter and less active
what about increase in depression
depression there's there's a hypothesis
all right
so
here's what i think is how to identify
the worst take
the worst to take would be it's one of
those things
no matter which one you picked
i think that's the worst thing
because
people did get fatter
and there's no there's no question that
made a difference
people did delay care
there's no question that delayed
the vaccinations themselves
may have had
don't know this but may have had more
complications than a normal vaccination
which doesn't mean it wasn't a good idea
it just means there might have been more
more complications
so there are lots of reasons it's
probably probably five different reasons
but
let's rank them
rank rank let's rank them in order give
me a give me uh let's say
let's give you a one to ten on this
so ten means that this would be a really
important variable and one means it's
not much of a variable
what are the odds because we don't know
what are the odds that the data is just
misleading
go scale of 1 to 10 what are the odds
that the data is just misleading
i'm saying eight or ten right there's a
very high chance of it very high chance
but if i told you the data everywhere is
consistent
so the way we collect data in the us is
different than how they do it in the uk
but all the people collecting data are
finding the same thing i think i think
that's true so now if i told you no
matter how you collect the data doesn't
matter how you do it you end up with the
same general direction that there are
excess deaths
okay would that tell you that maybe it's
not a data problem
if i told you that everybody no matter
how they collect it gets the same answer
does that does that tell you maybe not
data
so am i lowering your percentage
on that one
yeah it still could be the data
because it could be everybody
that's totally possible all right how
about the next one the next one is um
that the elites whoever they are
whoever controls the pharma companies or
whoever the pharma companies control
that there's some elite group
who is intentionally
hypnotizing you not to notice the excess
deaths
so it that under this hypothesis
which i don't believe
the
the
vaccinations themselves are causing the
excess deaths and that fact is being
hidden from you by all the elites give
me the odds on that the odds that it's
the vaccination themselves
and the truth is being hidden by the
elites
give me your odds
i'm seeing everything from two percent
to 100 percent
yeah i don't know i don't know the odds
on that one
so
how about the odds that it is delayed
care
now doctors
doctors say the problem is probably
delayed care
because the types of problems they're
seeing people die of
are
the ones that need constant care
so it turns out there's a a pretty
strong correlation at least anecdotally
i don't believe there's any randomized
controlled trial
but anecdotally doctors are saying the
people we're seeing dying
seem to be the ones that could have used
treatment like
diabetes and
cancer i think were the two examples
there are two that you really need to
stay on top of them to reduce the the
death rate
now i suppose that's true and i don't
know that that's been true proven
suppose it's true that it's obvious that
the people dying are the ones who didn't
get continuous care because of the
pandemic that would be pretty convincing
but i don't trust the data yet
so here's how once again i become part
of the story i'd forgotten
temporarily that alex berenson is back
on twitter
so somebody tweeted that i should
have a conversation with him
and he saw that and he weighed in and he
uh he and his uh
his statement is this on twitter he said
but yes the excess deaths are real so
he's confirming that the excess deaths
are real
and i think i believe that so so far
so far i am tentatively believing there
are excess deaths
just because so many people are seeing
it in so many places right so so far
we're on the same page there probably
are excess deaths
but he says it's happening in all or
nearly all of the mrna vaccinated
countries that part i don't have data on
and don't believe
so
i believe that there were so many mrna
countries
that unless all of them are experiencing
this
the fact that nearly all of them are
experiencing it would tell me that's not
the problem
if all of them were i'd say oh there's a
problem
but if not all of them and only nearly
all of them then i'd say
maybe it just means that a lot of
countries who can collect data can also
have lots of vaccines
so it seems like there's a correlation
between
are you are you a country that even
could get the mrna
vaccination
and if you are
um
you know what does that say about you
too all right
so
what do you what do you think do you
think the shots are the most obvious so
alex berenson says it's the most obvious
explanation
is it the most obvious
because i would think most obvious is
what the doctors say
the actual doctors are treating people
are saying the most obvious explanation
is delayed treatment
but why is alex berenson looking at the
same data and saying the most obvious
explanation
is one that agrees with something he
said before
we have the data
well one of them is being
consistent with prior
statements
if you were looking for a cognitive
dissonance which i don't see here yet by
the way so there's not there's not a
signal for it
well maybe there is
do you think this is a signal
if doctors are the ones saying the most
obvious thing is delayed treatment
why would somebody who's not a doctor
say the most obvious thing is the shots
themselves
when the doctors
are not saying that that's the most
obvious thing
what what is the definition of obvious
i would think if doctors don't see it
but a non-doctor does
it doesn't qualify as obvious
it doesn't mean now experience it is
wrong he could be the one that's right
and the doctors could be wrong
but
i think obvious is a word that doesn't
fit does it
yeah so you could say that the word
obvious is a tell
for
something out of the ordinary here
but i don't think you can conclude that
he is wrong based on anything that we
know now
now here's some other data there was a
va study
which looked at only veterans and only
unvaccinated ones
and it found that long coved causes all
kinds of problems especially heart
disease later
so if we know that long coved
causes people to die later
it could just be that
so if you took the
delay in treatment and you added it to
the fact that long coven itself might
cause you to have a heart problem down
the road and this is down the road
so so the va found that you could have
these problems months down the road
so we're only months out of the pandemic
itself so this is exactly when we would
see
covered long covered problems killing
people at higher rates exactly now
so
anyway i would say that that would be
the most obvious ones would be the covet
itself
the delay in care the increase in weight
you have to question whether the data is
right and then you can't you can't rule
out the vaccination
can you
and alcohol yeah drug abuse exactly
drug abuse would certainly be in there
to in there as an obvious choice too
um
but what i worry about is that the
people who are anti-vaxxed from the
beginning they need to be right
if you are
from the beginning you need the excess
deaths
to be high and unexplained
you need that
so the only way the anti-vaxxers can be
right is if the
as if the excess deaths are from the
vaccination
so i would worry that cognitive
dissonance or confirmation bias are
kicking in
but uh everybody is i think we're all
subject to it now right
wouldn't you say would you say it's a
true statement
that every one of us now is deeply in
the grip of confirmation bias
because whatever you thought was true
you have found a reason to believe it's
true based on data
i can do it
you don't think that alex berenson could
do what i'm going to do right now
i could easily tell you that everything
i predicted came true because i have
right there was some that didn't but
but most of the things i could argue it
came true and here's my data but people
who said the opposite
the very opposite of what i predicted
also say they were right and here's my
data
we we both have data
it turns out the data is useless
turns out the data is completely useless
all right
that turns out to be
the bulk of what i wanted to talk about
yes no mandates
no mandates
was there a topic i missed is there
anything that uh that i should have
talked about that i didn't i feel like i
missed something it was like a big topic
or something
oh so the salisbury hill thing is what
helped you
huh
the car bomb we talked about the russian
car bomb that i i think it was probably
ukraine and if it wasn't ukraine why not
if ukraine is not trying to kill russian
leadership
why not
all right here's a
question i have for you
do you feel that things are
uh
forget about where things are but just
the direction of things it feels to me
like everything's starting to trend
positive
does anybody else feel that
does anybody feel like you know there's
still some things we don't like
well let me make my argument
energy prices are falling now remember
my argument is not that things are good
my argument is that things are no longer
moving bad
right that they're trending in the right
direction they're not good yet but
they're trending right so the stock
market has improved
the
um
supply chain problem i feel like we've
gotten past the worst of it
maybe there's more ahead
but i feel like we got past the worst
i'm not really seeing enough
worry about starvation
and i don't know if that's a reporting
problem or we're not sure
but i feel as if
um
our stocks are down today somebody said
i wouldn't look at today to be anything
let's see about there
1.6
that's no big deal that could come back
in a day
so i wouldn't worry about that
so
so we've got uh we're working through
the shortages we're working through the
economy
um it looks like climate change
will be addressed with nuclear nuclear
is on the rise
elon musk is sending things to
mars
i would say the ukraine situation has
settled into some kind of a stalemate
that at least doesn't risk nuclear war
i would say that we are
decoupling from china
um
we do not have
well the mortality is increasing but
we're not sure it is
is it
yeah the the excess mortality you write
but is probably also temporary
because what whatever caused this excess
mortality is unless it's the
vaccinations i suppose but even if it is
it's likely to be
done in a year
because if what you did is delay
something delayed treatment it's going
to get you in a year
right if the if the vaccinations were a
problem and i don't see that as being
true but if they were most of it's going
to happen soonish
most of it doesn't happen down the road
so whatever is causing the excess
mortality we've probably already chewed
through most of it probably
right
um
so what else is going on i mean even
even our ability to mitigate um
serious death and risk from
cataclysms is really good so we might
have worse hurricanes maybe not
but we'll survive them better
yeah fentanyl is getting worse
but i feel like i feel fentanyl is
is it approaching a tipping point
here's the tipping point
let me let me give you an example of how
close it is to the tipping point
i'm not going to do this
but imagine i did
imagine i ran for president
and i had only one policy
i'm going to stop fentanyl
and then the reporters would say and
what is your view on abortion and i
would say
you work on abortion i'm going to work
on stopping fentanyl
and then they say but scott
what do you feel about international
trade and the trade agreement and i'd
say well why don't you work that out i'm
going to go stop fentanyl
it's all i'm going to do
and let's say i had an idea that
actually looked like it could work
you know like stopping all trade from
china until they stop it for example or
or killing the guy in
in the country
here's what i mean by a tipping point
i could get elected on that
i could get elected on that i could get
elected on i'm not even going to talk
about the other stuff
i'm just going to solve one problem
and i won't even run for reelection if i
solve it i'll give you one term i'll
solve one problem
now the other stuff i'll do my best i'll
listen to the experts but i'm not even
going to debate it with you
what are you going to do about taxes i
don't know
i don't know we'll work that out later
i'm not even worrying about it
just one thing i'm going to make i'm
going to make china's war on our
children and
one way or another i'm going to ship all
their
uh students back home i'm going to stop
all trade i'm going to remove our
ambassadors i'm going to kill that
 uh dealer in country in china
and i'm not going to have any remorse
for it
that's all i promise
now here's here's what i want you to
think now none of this is real because
i'm not running for president but the
point is i could win
think about it
you don't think i could win
with what with just one point
because nobody could touch me
i would be the only one who was doing
anything for the country and you would
 know it
you would know it
because if i stopped the fentanyl trade
the odds of me getting killed would be
very high
by either the cartel or vagina or
somebody right
i would be risking my life
to save a hundred thousand americans and
i would let everything else work its way
through the system i'd let congress make
decisions you know if i ran as a
democrat i'd let the democrats give me
some proposals and i'd look at them if i
ran as a republican i'd let them give me
some proposals and i'd let either side
give me some proposals i would just look
at the experts i'd look at the
thing and i'm not even going to tell you
what i'm going to decide
i'll just tell you how i decide
i won't even tell you what the decision
will be
all right here's how i will decide
i will debate this in public
that's how i'll decide what are you
going to do about this
tax change
i'll debate it in public
i'll let the public see it the same time
i see it i'll ask tough questions and if
you can't answer these tough questions
in public you're going to be very
embarrassed because i'm going to make
you embarrassed
how will it turn out i don't know
but that's my process
so so here's the thing that should blow
your mind
if you don't think fentanyl
is is really close
to being the only topic that matters
you're not paying attention it's killing
100 000 people a year
and it's intentional
it's that close
and do you think that i have the skill
to make people stop caring about
everything else for a while
i do
enough people right i just have to be
enough to get elected i do i do have
that skill
and it's because the topic makes it easy
nobody can top the topic you can't
there's no high ground above that topic
you can't get there
if somebody says uh and i'm going to
worry about your pronouns and i'll say
that's great
i think everybody should be treated with
respect you're also not doing anything
useful
for the public i'm going to be stopping
fentanyl
and you're going to be talking about
pronouns there's your choice public take
your choice
it would be easy to become president
with just one topic
that's how weak politics is right now
even though trump is a monster
you know like he's very capable even if
you don't like what he's doing
there still isn't anybody good
because reagan was good reagan was good
we don't have anybody like that
trump trump is his own
his own thing i mean he's capable in a
way i've never seen anything like it
he's very persuasive but he's not reagan
uh you know in some ways
you know he's got some advantages over
reagan i would say but overall
there's nobody operating at a reagan
level
and
what i heard reagan do was diffuse his
criticism of the other side i forget
what the topic was but there was one of
those red meat situations
where a politician of today would have
used that to just crap on the other side
and reagan took the high ground i forget
what it was but but he treated the other
the other side with such respect i
thought wow you don't see that
and it was effective
because it made the people on the other
side say oh looks like he's listening to
us a little bit that's not so bad
isn't that how he got elected by such
landslides
because he treated the other team like
you know he did this sort of joshing
ha
you know i'm definitely right
and i'm confident that i'm right but i
love you guys too
right it felt like he was a fatherly i
love you even if you disagree
whereas trump is more like you're on my
team or i must destroy you
i mean he's not because he's team
america but
you you could easily feel that way
because of the style of his rhetoric
yeah trump is noisy and expensive that's
true
all right is there any other topic
yeah if all i did was stop uh fentanyl
and
and tick tock
i would be the greatest president ever
elected
and i would get out after one term
i would go all george washington
all right
um
we'll never know yeah i can't run do you
know why i can't run
does anybody know
why i could never run for president i
mean legally i could i suppose
yeah i think i can
too old now
i'm almost too old
yeah bad v's
[Laughter]
yeah bad knees
i can't walk up and down those ramps
um no my problem would be
my background
so the only way that i could uh run for
office is with the following promise
i guess i could do it and the promise
would be this
i'm not going to be your role model
and if you look into my personal life
you're not going to like it
but if it entertains you you should
believe all of it's true it won't be
you know a lot of you know half of what
you read about my personal life is not
going to be true but if it entertains
you
you should believe it
but my proposition would be the
following
if whatever you think about me
personally or what i i have said or done
assume it's all true
don't vote for me under the benefit of a
doubt
assume the worst things you hear about
me are true
and i'm only going to want to solve one
problem for you
fentanyl
if you think i can do
that then maybe look out for your own
best interest
your own best interest is to get that
problem solved it's not in your best
interest to make a moral point about
your moral superiority to me because i
stipulate that if you'd like me to
stipulate
that the voters are morally superior to
me as a candidate i give you that freely
and without reservations
you are my moral
bettors
i'm not running to be your god
i'm not running to be jesus
i'm just running to stop fentanyl from
getting into your kids that's it
if you want that
hire me like you would hire a plumber
you got a leak in your pipes i'm going
to fix your leak
you don't need to know what i'm doing at
home
right
just assume it's all true
somebody in local says i sound like a
boring trump
could boring get elected
do you think boring could get elected
it could if it's provocative
but i guess that wouldn't be boring
yeah i think you could be provocative
and honest at the same time
usually the way people are provocative
is by
saying something that's a little sketchy
that's how you get people's attention
desantis is kind of boring but you can
get elected
is he
i don't know
i think desantis is learning to be less
boring
because i think it's a learning skill
and i think he is learning it
yeah tom cotton would need some help
so tom cotton has
a real solid resume
but he doesn't light up the screen
but here's the question could he
do you think tom cotton could learn
to
you know be more of a charismatic
presence
i believe he could
do you know the definition of charisma
this is one of the i say this a lot but
it's one of the most useful things
you'll ever understand
especially if you want to have charisma
charisma is a combination of uh power
and empathy
you have to have both
and here's why that makes sense if
somebody has power
but they don't have empathy for you what
do you think of them
they're dangerous
the worst thing is to be around somebody
powerful who doesn't care about you you
don't want to be anywhere near that
so power without empathy is just danger
suppose you had lots of empathy but you
had no power
well that's somebody who's going to need
your help
because they have no power
you know so
empathy doesn't help you it's nice of
therapy they have empathy they're nice
people but if they have no power
they're just a cost to you probably
because you have something you're gonna
have to give it to him
in the form of money or something else
right
so if you have power and you have
empathy everybody wants to be around you
because they want to take advantage of
your power
and they want to take advantage of it
for their benefit which is what the
empathy gets them
so how could tom cotton
have more charisma
it would be easy
because that's the formula there's a
formula for a charisma just follow it
so does he have power
yes
because he's a sitting senator
he's highly educated
he's you know successful in his job he
gets on tv
people listen to him
and he and he'll probably run for
president or he's thinking about it
he has power now if he became president
he would have you know far more real
power
so the power part he has nailed
but what about the empathy part
i see that's that's the part he's
missing
now i'm not saying he doesn't have
empathy on the inside i'm saying it's
not projecting
could he learn to project it
yes
because it's acting
yeah the the empathy they have on the
inside
nobody can see
so the acting is making sure everybody
can see it and then you say to yourself
but that would be a big phony
no everybody's a phony
i'm a phony right now do you think the
way that i'm talking to you right now on
live stream
is the way that i talk to a six-year-old
no
is it the way i would talk to my mother
no is it the way i talk to a lover no
no i talk differently for every
situation just like you do
we're all acting all the time
you have to get over that if you don't
get over the fact that we're all acting
all the time
see some people say they're not acting
no you're acting sorry
and if you're not acting you're doing it
wrong
because acting is usually what gets you
a better outcome
so could i teach could i teach tom
cotton to have more charisma yes because
he has the power and he would have more
if he's president
and his charisma is really just about
adding more empathy
because when tom cotton tells you what
we should or should not do
he takes a hawkish approach
and he says here are the hard things we
should do and we should do these right
away
what's missing
is understanding how we're feeling about
it
and all he'd have to do is say it out
loud all right i understand that this
could be scary for all of you
but here are the things we're weighing
and i'm going to make sure that the
least scary thing is what happens
right
something like that so in other words
you just have to use your words and
first to say what the people are feeling
after you say i understand what
everybody's feeling that's the empathy
part
then you can be as tough as you want
so reagan did that right
reagan acted like he had genuine empathy
and then when he acted tough people were
like okay
all right
now trump does the opposite
trump is on the side of americans and he
says it you know intellectually and
consistently
but the democrats don't feel it
do they
they feel his power
they definitely feel his power
everybody can feel that
but do they feel his empathy
they do not
they do not and that's trump's biggest
flaw
his biggest advantage is he's a fighter
and i liked him for that
still do
i like the fact that you can depend on
him to fight and not give up
the trouble is
if it's something like losing an
election
he still fights that he doesn't give up
so
i i have not condemned him
as much as others have
because i knew what i was getting
right if you
if you uh
get a porcupine as a pet
and then you hurt your hand trying to
pet it it's not exactly the porcupine's
problem
is it
is it
because you padded a porcupine
if you voted for trump
did you think you were voting for the
person who would give up
no
no the thing you voted for is he doesn't
give up
and then when the election went the way
it did he didn't give up
i don't know
am i disappointed i wish things had gone
a different way
but i don't wish that he was a different
person
because that's what i bought
i bought that
right
if you buy a gun
and you leave it loaded and you know
shoots you in the foot or something is
it the guns problem
no
it's what you did and what you expected
of the gun
right if you buy trump
and then he acts like trump from the
beginning to the end
don't tell me that's trump's
problem you bought that
you bought exactly that you didn't buy
approximately that
something in that direction you bought
that
and if you didn't know you were buying
that
what did you think you were getting
i mean it's the most consistent thing
about him is he doesn't give up
it's the most consistent thing about his
personality he doesn't give up
all right
i think that's all for today
i think we've done it
youtube thanks for joining spotify too
um if you two would like to
have your life changed apparently
i've done that for a number of people
so go look for that video
791 it was they're all listed the live
streams i do so just google my name and
coffee with scott adams and
episode 791 and it should pop right up
maybe it'll change your life too
and that is all i have for today
bye for now
