I'm sorry I can't get the smile off my
face or the song out of my heart
come on come on get back in the game get
back in the game
good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and
everything is trending positive for the
first time ever ever
and if you'd like to take it to a new
level that nobody's ever seen before
what do you need well all you need is a
copper mug or a glass of tanker tell us
just like the canteen yoga flaska
Festival of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparalleled pleasure of
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes everything better it's called
the simultaneous Sip and it's happening
now
go
tastes like
freedom
tastes like freedom
I feel like I'm going to have another
anybody anybody
going in for number two this is very
unusual this is breaking precedent this
has never happened before
oh and I'm glad I did oh
well I hope your day is as good as mine
um we will get to of course Twitter and
Elon Musk but let's start with some fun
stories
I have some advice for you about when to
change your name when to change your
name
you know a lot of people who become
movie stars
they'll often change their names when
they get into the business
for example here's a good example uh the
actress and producer you know as Olivia
Wilde
is that an awesome name
it's pretty pretty awesome
wild with the E on the end that's a
great name what was her original name
our original name was
um
Olivia Coburn Coburn
yeah but she changed her name from
Coburn
to Wild and he thinks yourself Coburn
well that sounds like a pretty good name
too
how do you spell Coburn c-o-c-k b-u-r-n
well suddenly I feel sorry for her uh
her school days
because
I'm feeling ah
you got a feeling that was tough
um
her grandfather was a Claude cockburn
who wrote Beat the Devil oh under his
pseudonym so he didn't use his real name
Claude cockburn uh or Coburn some people
would pronounce it he changed it to
James helvik which is probably a good
good move
yes so if you're an attractive woman do
not continue with a name called cockburn
that's just my advice
um I was uh delighted and horrified
today to see that an AI could take my
Dilbert comic and create a human version
of the comic just by asking it to do it
so it took a uh this was a
Machiavelli's underbelly who uh the
Twitter account who does a lot of
fascinating AI stuff so you can see
what's coming
but he took my comic and just had the AI
recreate it with imaginary real people
I think they're I think they're just
created by the AI so two people who look
like real people
having a conversation that looked like
the Dilbert character is having the
conversation
and apparently this is something you can
do in like a minute
I'm telling you where my business is
going to go
here's where it's going to go
I'm going to be able to speak into the
AI and it will just draw Dilbert comic
and then I'll say well can you make that
fourth panel a little more interesting
you know change the angle
and then it'll automatically redraw it
as if you were looking at it from
another angle
it shouldn't be that easy in fact movies
should be that easy in just maybe a few
years
imagine being a scriptwriter
and writing the movie visually
ah
you start with you describe the
characters and then the AI shows you the
characters you described then you tweak
them a little bit I'll give that one a
mustache and they change as you're
talking
then you say all right there's this uh
car chase and it's in the city of Las
Vegas it's the middle of the day there's
a lot of traffic and uh in the first
scene he cuts across an intersection at
a red light
and then you watch it
he just watched the scene it would just
appear on the screen
and you say no no add more cars
now make make the collision at the
intersection a little bit closer
am I wrong I'm pretty sure that's what
writing a movie will look like if
anybody watches movies
as I saw uh Jeff Pilkington tweet this
morning he said that the Hollywood sign
is old and decrepit and no longer you
know represents
Hollywood well
to which I said I feel like an old
decrepit Hollywood sign is exactly right
because when was the last time you
watched a movie that wasn't made by Tom
Cruise that you also enjoyed
I can't think of what I actually can't
think of a movie that wasn't made by Tom
Cruise
that I've actually enjoyed
in years
I couldn't think of one not one
in years I mean a Star Trek hasn't come
out in a few years right
anyway
uh Paul Pelosi husband of Nancy Pelosi
was brutally attacked in his home in San
Francisco
now number one there's nothing funny
about that
can we do some
we're gonna have to do some
compartmentalization here
is everybody ready for
compartmentalization
because you're good people I can tell I
can tell by your comments you're good
people
because you're good people you know that
there's nothing funny about anybody no
matter what you think of them
there's nothing funny about anybody
being brutally attacked
put it in the compartment
put it in the compartment where we all
agree
all right now take that compartment
with all of your empathy which proves
you're a good human being and let's put
that aside for a moment
because there's something funny about it
it's just a different compartment
number one
will Nancy Pelosi uh announce that the
Pelosi's are moving out of the crime
riddle Democrat city of San Francisco
before or after the midterms what do you
think well will she announce her move
before or after the midterms because
I'll tell you one thing
if I lived in the middle of a
crime-infested hellhole and somebody got
past my security and beat the out
of me
I would never sleep there again
I mean assuming you could afford it I
would never sleep there again
not once I would not spend another night
in a bed in the house would you
I mean if you have the if you had the
resources like he does I mean he could
just stay in a luxury hotel until his
new house is purchased right he doesn't
have to do anything he's got enough
money to do anything he wants
I I this is not a joke I think they're
gonna move
no joke
I think they're gonna move
because of the crime
now she'll probably do it after she
retires or something but I don't think
they're going to spend a lot of nights
in that house
just a guess
I'm also wondering if the perpetrator
yelled this is Maga country
because we haven't heard much about the
perpetrator have we
in fact nothing
nothing about the motive nothing about
the person
but I'm just going to guess I guess it
probably was some Nigerian guy is
yelling this is maggot country
that's just a shot in the dark but I
think that's what it was Nigerians
yelling maggot country
well Kerry Lake continues to impress
with her communication skills
maybe the best I've ever seen actually
you know it's a little early to say that
but it's hard to say who's the best
Communicator of all time you know Reagan
was amazing
you know it's tough to be Reagan Trump I
think you know one of one of the greats
of all times
but also gets people mad right so he's
got a little there's a little price that
comes with Trump
but Kerry Lake seems to be so on point
on some of this stuff and uh as was uh
pointed out to me she used she used the
uh the really persuasion
so they asked her about Katie Hobbs her
opponent Katie hobb's office had been
broken into and the reporter tried to
ask a question that couched it like
somehow that was Carrie Lake's fault you
know for either rhetoric or something
else
and Carrie like instead of answering
that dumbass question
she looked at her and she goes really
now Shelly said it once I would have
liked to hurt it to hear it three times
really
really
is that third one that really drives the
home Crowley but she did something as
good made me better she said that she
looked at the journalist and said uh
you're the people who dragged the public
through so many BS stories Like Jesse
Smollett
that was perfect
just to throw in the Jesse Smollett
reference when they're asking her a
dumbass question now imagine how much
just think how much better that response
was
than if she'd actually answered the
question
that was a question you do not answer
do not answer that question you say
really
and then you move on anyway she handled
it perfectly
um Joe Biden uh was colluding with China
recently I did some
some campaigning I guess you'd call it
without really calling it that but he
did a photo shoot with eight Tick-Tock
influencers who collectively control 67
million followers
if you want to know how big that is
that's eight Tick Tock influencers
collectively 67 million followers
compare that to the viewership of
um you know the news and they're in the
like one to five million range right
Network news is nowhere near as big as
these eight influencers in terms of
reach
um
so there's that but does Joe Biden know
that once once that picture is taken
literally China gets to decide who sees
it
did you know that
literally not not in a hyperbolic way or
you know if something happened this
could happen it's not hypothetical
Tick Tock is a Chinese company
all Chinese companies must do what the
CCP tells them to do
if the CCP decided hey suppress that
picture or hey make sure everybody sees
this picture
they have that choice
if they choose not to use that power
well that's a choice too right because
then they'd let the algorithm do what
they imagine is going to do but if they
had any incentive to stop it
they could do it
they would just have to make one text or
one phone call and the entire algorithm
would be modified
on On Demand
and they would decide what you saw 67
million people
now do you think that's enough power to
change an election
well not with one photograph of the
president no
but this is just an example
they could do that anytime they want
they can take every political statement
and decide to do more of it or less of
it
now I don't know if they have a
preference for president
it's entirely possible that they don't
want Biden
but they might not know who who would
come in besides Biden that they might
not like more they might think
everybody's just as bad in which case
they would not be an influence
but does that matter
if you say to yourself well yes China
could totally change the results of our
election but they don't seem to have a
reason to do it so I'm not too worried
you okay with that
the only reason they don't make a change
is they don't have a reason
that's the only reason
what if they get a reason
you don't think there's anything else
they have a reason for do you think
there's any other persuasion category
that they ever isn't for let me ask you
this if you here's a test for you if you
checked Tick Tock see how much
anti-fental message messages there are
especially ones that mention China
and then compare that to Twitter
and see which one has more messages
suggesting or just saying that China is
responsible for fentanyl go ahead just
do that test let me guess what would
happen
do you have any doubt which of the
social media networks are blaming China
for Fentanyl
just guess
now if somebody did this test and proved
me wrong
I'd be impressed
all right I'd be willing to change my
opinion and say I was wrong
but I don't think I am do you
what do you think
do you think Tick Tock surfaces as many
complaints about about China
as Twitter or Facebook
now remember Twitter and Facebook might
have some pressure from China too
Facebook I guess not Twitter but
Facebook probably has something to try
to pressure
so maybe Twitter is the better all right
here's your I guess here's your test
Twitter in two months let's say after
the Elon Musk
influence you know becomes uh you know
more widespread
Twitter in two months are you gonna see
more about China being bad with fentanyl
or on Tick Tock that's all you need to
know
am I right
is that all you need to know
there's nothing else you need to know
and and just think about the fact that
Biden is not Banning tick tock
now
I want to this leads me to my next
humorous story
do you run into people
who seem to have slept through the last
five years
have you noticed that
it's like the the Japanese soldier who
was in a cave after World War II and you
know stayed there for 30 years after the
war was over
like I I want to read one
um
because I'm pretty sure I wrote it down
uh so this is somebody who has lived in
the real world
and somehow
managed to escape my
um
notes but no I have it here
anyway it was somebody who says uh
uh who
and somebody who's questioned me and
said this
let's say I can take your word for it
that's meeting me or the word of a dozen
reputable Publications
so there's there's somebody who's like I
think an adult
an actual living person in 2022
who with no sense of embarrassment can
state that there are at least a dozen
reputable Publications
what are those
what are your reputable Publications
can you name them
I mean seriously is 20 22. yeah let me
let me do this as you've suggested
really
really you can find a dozen a dozen a
dozen reputable Publications
yeah
well good for you
uh so I gave him the really tweet really
in 2022
really
really
yeah that was good use of really
all right
I hate to mention this
but would you be surprised
to find out that there's a new study a
randomized controlled trial with
placebos and everything
about ivory mechan
would you be surprised to know there's a
new study about that
just announced the results are just
announced how do you think it went
so as is my uh my custom now when I see
that there's an Ivermectin trial
I no longer say this looks good or this
doesn't look good
I just say Skeptics
do your thing
do you know how long it took Skeptics to
just rip that thing apart
a minute
I saw a reference to 80 problems with it
I think that's probably an exaggeration
but I'm not going to mention all of the
problems that were mentioned to me
because I can't I'm not really in a
position to validate either the
criticisms or the study itself I just
think that's a little bit over my my pay
grade and I I feel like I have more
experience in that sort of thing than 99
of the public but I'm also aware that
there are people who are much better and
I would defer to them you know if they
have more experience of this but people
who seem to know what they're talking
about tore it apart are they right I
don't know I don't know is the
Ivermectin study right that it showed no
benefit
I don't know let me give you an example
of one criticism
um they gave a three-day dose
to people who were in the first seven
days of their infection the three-day
dose
um
one medical expert on Twitter said well
I've never heard of anybody suggesting
less than five days
so does that mean they intentionally
picked a dose that was going to be too
small
or do you say what Scott says which is
if you couldn't see any effect with
three days
do you really think that extra two days
would have been the difference
I mean is that common is it common to
have a drug that shows nothing for three
days nothing statistical because
remember they've got a control group so
that they'd pick up you know a five
percent statistical difference maybe
more than five but you know anything
over five they pick it up you don't
think you get at least a five percent
bump
in the first three days
like all the goodness happens in the
last two days
right now I don't know the answer to
that
I think I I would agree with the the
criticism that I'd rather see five days
than three wouldn't you
but they'd also probably have a uh you
know
I don't know problem with compliance
it's probably more compliance problem
the longer you go so there's probably
other issues
yeah maybe it's a funding thing I don't
know
all right so
um here is my ironic
uh my ironic observation for today
I'm so proud of this I might say it
twice
so listen carefully the first time but
it doesn't matter because I'm going to
say it again
in 2022
this really happened
Ivermectin proved that science doesn't
work
Pat myself in the back I'm just so proud
of that one
now I'm going to say it again
in 2022
I've removed and proved that science
doesn't work
that really happened
I'm not making that up that really
 happened
am I wrong
it did prove that science doesn't work
now I'm not saying the Ivermectin works
all right so I want to be really clear
if I had to bet my life on it I would
bet it does not work
right if you have gone to head you've
got to pick one
I would think that one of those studies
would have picked up something
right by now
now but is it possible is it possible
and somebody said this was funded by
somebody who's sketchy you you know who
is associated with fauci I don't know
he's associated with a lot of stuff so I
don't I don't know how to how to rank
that
but I'm not saying that it doesn't work
if you want to tell me
that you believe there's a massive
conspiracy of the entire medical
community
that you know they use their financial
incentives and everything else to keep
all the doctors and Professionals in
line and that the result of that giant
big Pharma conspiracy is that every test
has been rigged or or you didn't hear
about it if if it wasn't rigged or
something like that
do you know what I won't say
do you let's see if you can get ahead of
me what what would I not say to that if
you told me it was a vast conspiracy and
all the doctors were involved what would
I not say
watch this
really
really you you think that a big
organization that's supposedly for our
benefit would do something sketchy and
lie to us really see it doesn't work
right it didn't work
the the really thing only works
in the situation for which it is
designed when the situation is you know
just crazy
but if you tell me that it would be
crazy that a major organization that
exists only to help us
has been doing the opposite for years
that is not even a little bit unusual is
it I wish it were I wish I lived in that
world but it's not Not Unusual at all
that said
I'd be really surprised if I preventing
works
if you say the opposite I say to you
okay
I respect your opinion
I respect your opinion because I'm
guessing too
because you know it would be great if
one of us you know if any of us have
access to this you know what would be
great
credible science wouldn't that be great
the kind of science you could kind of
trust a little bit wouldn't you like
some of that
I would
if you see any of it let me know
I'll take a big helping
all right um
today I saw a tweet by uh Jack Dorsey
who of course is getting a lot of
attention today as
uh founder of Twitter and we'll talk
about Twitter some more but I guess Jack
Dorsey is working on a
uh new Social Network
that um
you can control your own data
so I'm not I'm not fully informed yet so
I'll just give you a you know the the
highest level uh guesses of what's going
on here so there I think they're an
advanced sort of advanced beta stage so
you might see something pretty soon
um and it's web 5.0
whatever that means I think it means
some blockchain is involved
so I think what happens is and I even
saw some reference to anonymity
and easy sign-ons
so the real challenge as I tweeted is
getting people to understand this
or why they would want this as opposed
to any other social network
and one of the feature advantages as I
understand it is if you quit one social
network you could somehow take your data
with you to another one
now I don't know if that works with the
Legacy networks I don't see how it could
maybe it could I don't know but um
so I guess I'm still in the I'm confused
what it does yeah it's called Uh
isn't it called Zion
I saw it called Zion it was it called
blue sky or is that just maybe the
the technical name for the protocol or
something
all right so here's what here's what I
don't know about it
what I don't know about it is
what's the good and the bad and you know
what's the advantages and uh but
here's what you can know for sure
there are very few people in the world
who understand social media and what it
can and cannot do and what it should do
more than Jack Dorsey
would you agree
nobody has a better understanding of the
whole area and also a you know technical
background and and entrepreneurial
Success track record and all that so if
he thinks it's a big thing
I'm pretty persuaded to think it's a big
thing or it could be right it's all in
the execution
but the execution looks like it's coming
together
Zion was a city outside the Matrix oh
okay that makes sense
although I was I was thinking it as some
kind of like Israel
reference but that wouldn't make sense
for a product name
um at least not this product name all
right
so keep an eye on that
um Twitter
um Elon Musk tweeted the bird is free
which I believe means that the
transaction has been completed and Elon
Musk now owns Twitter let's see if
Twitter has stopped Trading
Twitter shows zero percent change stop
trading so I think that's official right
that's as official as it gets
um Elon Musk has already fired three
Executives including the CEO and
including uh the woman who apparently
was in charge of
you know who got kicked off of the
platform
so the woman who was in charge of
kicking people off the platform got
finished my sentence the woman who was
in charge kicking people off the
platform got
kicked off the platform
in a way
um
Rob Reiner who threatened to quit
Twitter if Elon Musk took over is uh
twitting tweeting more than ever
and uh would you like to have a preview
of something to come in the in the world
of Rob Reiner
Rob Reiner has something coming he
doesn't know about
there's a Dilbert comic that features
him
it's in the pipeline
so so he's going to see his name in the
Dilbert comic pretty soon
uh is not terribly
yeah I don't go at him hard but uh
you'll you'll enjoy the comic I think
mosque has claimed I don't remember when
he said this but recently that he
pledged to quote defeat the spam Bots or
die trying
now isn't that exactly what you wanted
to hear
right that
it's not an accident when Elon Musk says
something perfect
that's not an accident
he knows how to say perfect things like
he's really good at it this is perfect
it's exactly what I wanted to hear I
didn't want to hear any I
didn't want to hear about he was going
to form a project I didn't want to hear
there's going to be an independent
bipartisan commission working on it
I don't want any like corporate
bureaucratic
sound good jerk me off
 I want him to hear I'm going to
defeat the spam Bots or die trying
okay
okay I'm on board with that yep that's
as clear as you can get
um
here's here's my big question we all we
all have big questions about what's
going to happen don't we
now I would warn you
not to get your expectations ahead of
reality because we don't know exactly
what's going to happen do we
um Europe has already warned Elon that
uh at least one official has warned Elon
that Twitter is going to have to play by
their rules
meaning that even if Elon Musk wanted to
make free speech a little bit more open
in America
Europe has already warned or at least a
European official who's in the right job
has warned that uh don't get so cocky
because Europe gets to decide what
Europeans see
that's right so Europe is uh put the put
a little slap on musk saying yeah you're
not in charge we are
uh do you know I almost tweeted but
didn't
I almost but didn't
Tweet back to that European official
good luck with your land War
because if you don't have starlink
it's coming to your house next
you know
as nobody figured out that pissing off
Elon Musk is just not a good play
anymore
this is not a good play I mean I get I
get that everybody should be you know
have their free speech and you should be
able to criticize anybody you want
you know as long as you're you know
within the terms of service I guess but
uh I don't know I think if I'm if I'm
actually in the land War
you know and you could argue that Europe
is as involved as you could possibly be
if I'm in a land War and the Elon Musk
is one of the keys to keeping the
Russian bear from my door
I feel like I'd be nice to that guy
I mean Europe can still do all the
censorship they want it's it's Europe
right it's not up to me I don't care but
instead I just tweeted that uh I'm glad
that America will be more competitive
than Europe
right
yeah imagine Europe with uh the kind of
censorship that I imagine this European
fellow has in mind and then imagine
America
with a more open system let's say that
Elon Musk is successful and gets a
little bit more freedom into our
platforms
who who competes better
I think we out compete them I think
that's just a competitive advantage
I think
but
I don't know we'll find out I mean I
would think that it puts a huge risk on
Europe
because they could get manipulated by
whoever owns the uh the algorithm and
maybe we'll be less manipulated in the
future we'll see
um
and Moscow is also very cleverly said
he's not doing it for the money
which completely eliminates all of the
economic criticism he would get
right because all the people who have
like business backgrounds and I'm one of
them like I want to weigh in and say all
the reasons that you know he's going to
have trouble
yeah it's going to be hard to make money
on this thing if if Jack Dorsey couldn't
figure it out and the new CEO couldn't
figure it out why does it must think he
could figure it out
you know so it'd be easy to criticize
them on the economics but he just takes
that off the table well I wouldn't do
this to make money
and then I look at it I go oh yeah
that's true
you wouldn't do this to me buddy but
here's the fun part
it's possible this will make more money
than all the other things he's doing
it's possible
do you know why
because he might do it well
that's all it would take it just might
do it well
imagine if he will
that he um he adds a rumble to it
for example I mean even just showing
their videos doesn't have to buy a stake
in or anything I'm a I'm a shareholder
in Rumble so just a small change and
here's what I commend to
an edit button
a little flag on any tweet that has been
edited
and hit the tag then you see the
original then you see the new one
because you can always you know you can
find the original if somebody deletes it
and whatever but I always want to see
the original
don't you
um
or maybe for for blue members or
something else but I
um I think editing has some problems
because you can make your you know your
Badness disappear too easily I'd rather
that just somebody shows the work
yeah I'd be happy with that so imagine a
world in which Elon Musk simply builds a
better product it makes it sort of like
WeChat where you can do payments on
Twitter you can see all the news on
Twitter and you can see the other
argument how about this how would you
like to see
um be able people people be able to tag
any any tweet with the counter argument
because right now if you want to see the
counter argument where do you have to go
into the comments and the comments are a
a sewer pit of Badness you don't want to
spend any time there
but wouldn't it be nice
if people who are tweeting let's say a
counter argument from sub stack or
counter argument from some uh one of
those 12 credible Publications
wouldn't you like to see oh there's a
little Banner on it where I can see the
opposite argument from a actual
journalist or professional writer on
subsec right how much would you like
that now would would that be censorship
would it be censorship that you could
see maybe not one source I think you'd
have to see a collection because
everybody should be able to show their
counter source so you should have a
counter source button
where you could go see a counter source
and then
um that might be abused somehow too but
you know everything's testable you can
test everything small
so imagine a world in which uh Elon Musk
brings to Twitter the product
sensibilities that he's brought to other
things and just makes it work better for
everybody
that is huge
that the the size of that benefit to the
United States as a competitive Free
Nation I just don't think it can be
underestimated
and I do think that you could make
Twitter
essential
right now Twitter is like a crack
right unless you're unless you're in the
business I'm in which is talking about
the news it's not essential it's just
crack
but he could make it essential too
if you just did your daily business
there and you did all your stuff there
like WeChat
so could be big bigger than bigger than
you imagined
let's talk about uh yay
so I noticed the CNN just calls him
Kanye but then they put the obligatory
whose name is legally changed to yay and
I I think I have to disagree with yay
when he says it's disrespectful that
people don't use his new legal name
I think it's disrespectful to have a
legal name that is confusing to people
when they talk about you
because yay sounds like a word it
doesn't sound like a name
and if I start if I start a sentence
with the a
don't they sound like a Bible verse
yea though I walk through the Twitter
comments
though verily through the mountain of
death comments
right just sounds like a religious thing
so I disagree with the utility of his
name I certainly agree with his ability
to change it to anything he wants and it
does work to give them attention and
it's kind of a cool name and everything
so there's lots of good about it but uh
don't impose don't impose on us
that we call you a certain thing if
you've made it intentionally confusing
all right well he went into uh the
Skechers company the shoe company
and he uh
he insisted that he talked to the you
know the head of it and I guess he
didn't have an appointment and they
some Executives you know took a bet of
the building
now I heard a separate story that I
think is not true right
something about New Balance and I don't
want to say it because I'm pretty sure
that was a fake news right I saw it on
social media he did not visit New
Balance right
that that was just a joke okay I think
that was just a joke
but uh this is not looking good for yay
I think he believed that even with his
current problems he could just Waltz
into another deal but all of the big
companies have the same brand reputation
problem
it would be hard to imagine anybody at
this point
wanting to take on that brand risk do
you think his brand risk will get worse
well here's what happens when you go
after the Jewish community
here here's a story in CNN after yay
went after the Jewish community and
here's the question to you
why have you never heard the story that
I'm going to tell you now
all right I'm going to tell you a story
as CNN reported it and you asked me why
you never heard this before okay
allegedly with with like capital A on
allegedly this is the biggest allegedly
I'll ever say in my life
allegedly
Kanye West has long been fascinated by
Adolf Hitler
of course
but wait then what else do they say
about people who have long been
fascinated by Adolf Hitler what's the
next thing they say
oh here it comes
here's the next thing they say
um he read Mein Kampf he was very
impressed with the Nazis
oh my God
now
the news and apparently there's somebody
on TMZ who he talked with who confirms
who confirms that he's had you know
sketchy things about the Jewish
Community not not these things not about
Heller but other people are now
confirming
that that allegedly
he was a Hitler admirer and it gets
worse wait a minute hold on his album
that was titled yay so that in the end
they titled it yay
the story says that his first suggestion
for the title of his album was
Hitler
thank you
all right
I just saw a comment on locals I give up
is today the best day ever I mean not
for yay it's a terrible day for him but
for the the watching all the things
all the things that you knew were wrong
are now coming into this Sharp contrast
where you can really really see
everything clearly all of a sudden like
didn't you wake up thinking that that
the clouds were clearing like there's
something happening right
now
um you know that if I were to defend EA
at this point I would become a Hitler
admirer right
you know that right so so now they've
made him so toxic
that you can't give any defense of him
without being a Mein Kampf Nazi person
so
I'd like to give my defense of Kanye
because I'm not supposed to
that's the only reason I'm going to do
it all right you ready for that
uh it is it is suicide
career suicide to defend him
you all agree with that right so that's
why I'm going to do it
all right you ready
I have never read mind conf
but I'm going to
do you know why
it's probably really important
because I've heard a number of people
very smart who said they read it and
they learned a lot
you don't want to know what your enemies
are doing
you you wouldn't read a book about how
your enemies are trying to destroy you
because that's why you would learn you
would learn what techniques the Nazis
used
in case somebody else uses it on you
you would also learn about persuasion
would that be useful
yes no matter where you got it it would
be useful does that mean you'll become a
Nazi
no it does not
doesn't mean you love the Nazis no it
does not it means that there was
something you'd like to know about the
Nazis that could protect you in the
future or make you stronger it has
nothing to do with either the Holocaust
so number one
if there's anybody you hear who ever
read Mein Kampf and learned something
about it about persuasion
your thought about them should be well
there is a free-thinking person
who went wherever he needed to go to
learn whatever he needed to learn
all right
number two
I don't think it's true that he decided
to or he ever noodled with the idea of
calling his album Hitler
but if he did
I'm gonna defend it
because
he is a creative person who in the end
did not use that title
he did not use that title In The End
he is a Creator who comes up with 10 bad
ideas for every good one
do you know what you call that
what do you call somebody who has 10
horrible ideas
for everyone that's a home run
you call them a genius that's
what you call them
you call them a genius
right so if you tell me that he floated
the most radical idea I've ever heard
but then rejected it
I say oh you just described a genius
that sounds like somebody who would who
would consider
consider absolutely anything
absolutely anything
you will consider absolutely anything
and he did it right in front of you
now the fact that he chose not to go
that way
is evidence that you know yes control of
his decisions
it's possible it would never would have
been published if he didn't change it so
there's always that right
all right so the Hitler thing to me is
just the
to me this is proving his point
basically
so yay yay's point was there something
let's say coordinated about the Jewish
community
that is organized against yea
I would say that if this Hitler thing
gets legs
that that's a strong argument in his
favor
again I'm not saying there's anything
special about any group of people so I'm
not I'm not echoing his complaint
I'm saying that if I were him
and I had made that complaint I'd be
very happy
to see that it had been proven true
that's what I would claim if I were him
I'd claim well there it is there's the
proof they just basically put the Hitler
brush on me and there's only one group
that can do that
that's what I'd say no that's not true
let me be clear there's not one group
that can do that but if he claims it
it's going to sound pretty convincing to
a lot of people
so I don't think he can recover from
this
I'm going to make a prediction that he
cannot recover from this what do you
think
can he recover and by the way it's not
my opinion that he should
well let me be clear about that I do
think that he crossed the line
that Society
can can draw that line I think that's a
line you can draw
somebody says Mel Gibson did but did he
did he really I mean Mel Gibson has
never been Mel Gibson since
he's a guy who still has a job sort of
but he's not Mel Gibson anymore
right mental illness let him off the
hook uh no no I think he's I think he's
actually done forever
honestly I don't think he can come back
and
if I if I could defend him if I had any
way to defend him from his comments
which you know painted Jews as one kind
of group of people who were causing you
in trouble if I could defend that in any
way I'd get I'd take a shot at it
because because I think Kanye did enough
for you know free speech and
for for goodness that if there were any
way I could defend that I'd do it I'd do
it for him
but I will see your way I see nothing
that he just has to own that right
would you agree
yea has to own that there's nothing we
can do
if I could help him like in an ethical
way if I could help him in any ethical
way I'd do it
I think he's earned it
I think he's earned that kind of help
but there's nothing I can do
there's no door open there you got to
leave a little crack in the window give
us something but we can't we can't
support that
well I can
I can't speak for you all right
Rasmussen latest poll on the midterm
says uh the GOP has a seven point
generic lead I think that's uh has it
been up to nine at some point but seven
is an increase so more of a gap
are you surprised by that
because I was expecting that as we get
closer and closer to the day of the
election the the polls would narrow to
no difference
but it could be that the Democrats are
doing so poorly
that even the polls won't operate the
way I'd expect them to
but now it's you know different
pollsters are going to have different
you know I think there's at least one
pollster who says it's dead even
weinkov was required reading in the
Atlantis school system in 2017 somebody
says
yeah
I don't know about that but it sounds
sounds like it could have been all right
and uh in a key indicator of midterm
possible results
um
when asked when voters were asked
what they think of having the Congress
be at least
split
so when voters were asked would you at
least would you like Congress to at
least be you know half Republican and
half Democrat
62 said yes
62 percent of the country prefers a
split this election this upcoming
election they prefer to get a split
so something like two-thirds of the
people wish that the Republicans would
win at least one of the houses
how does that not translate into into
Republican wins
how does that now become one but as uh
uh McConnell said quite wisely in the
Senate races it's more about the
individual candidates
I think that's true
do you know how
how what's his name Federman could win
I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you how
fetterman could win the election
uh can you give me a fact check are
there more Democrats than Republicans in
fetterman's race
do me a quick fact check while I'm
talking
but fact check me while I'm talking so
there are more Democrats than
Republicans right so if all the
Democrats voted for Federman and all the
Republicans voted for Oz Federman wins
right
so here's how fetterman can win
you know honestly I was a little too
optimistic about my recovery
and I apologize for that
however
my my recovery is on schedule it's just
taking longer than I hoped and I think
that this election is too important to
let the Republicans get control so I'll
tell you what I'll do
for the first year in office
I will vote the same way as these three
prominent Republicans or maybe
Republicans in this area or something
like that you say I'll just match their
vote for a year
after that year I'll I'll release my
doctor's opinion about whether I'm you
know suited to lead and in the normal
way that you would like me to lead and
if I'm not
you know maybe I'll step down or make it
make a change or something
but
but Democrats would accept
an apology
which they're not even asking for but
they would accept an apology and they
would accept his idea that voting for a
Democrat is more important than
the individuals and that you can have
that choice of you just voted for a
generic Democrat
so basically fetterman can say I am the
generic Democrat and I'll give you that
for one year I'll just vote with the
Democrats period you will never have to
wonder about my vote for one year it
will always be with the Democrat
majority
after one year I'll reassess
but I have to apologize I really did
think I was I thought I was doing better
than I was
that's the same sort of optimism I want
to bring to the state I think it was a
little misplaced in me
and I'd like to be a little bit more
Frank with you and tell you what we can
do that really makes a difference and
what we can do is make sure that the
Democrats win
and I'll I'll be a little more uh
transparent about my situation but in
the meantime you'll get all the Democrat
votes you want
and then it's over
right
yeah I feel like he could win with that
unfortunately
unfortunately I don't think he'll do it
but I think that persuasion wise that
would work
well here's zelinski being uh persuasion
perfect again
as you know the Russians are turning off
the lights in Ukraine as the winter is
coming
and of course the big the big issue is
all freeze to death in the winter and
zelenski's response to Russia's
threats are quote we are not afraid of
the dark
that's really good
that's really good this is so
good at persuasion like I'm I'm not like
on his side I want to be clear
I don't trust zielinsky at all
like I I don't know that our faintest
ideas I'm not a fan
but I'm just talking about his skill
you can't deny a skill
this is good we're not afraid of the
dark
that's really good really good
anyway the news is reporting I don't
know if it's accurate that Russia is not
using their cruise missiles and
ballistic missiles to Target Ukraine's
military anymore because they don't have
enough
reportedly so they don't have enough of
their Precision Munitions so the only
thing they can use it for is turning out
the lights because there are fewer power
plants than there are you know Ukrainian
military assets
allegedly yeah it could be they got a
big pile of them they're waiting to
shoot any moment if they need them as
possible
but I don't see much movement I don't
see the ukrainians gaining much and I
don't see uh Ukraine backing down
because the lights are being turned off
uh boy you know what Ukraine could
really use
Tesla power walls
just spitball
um
anyway do you believe that do you
believe that uh what's going on over in
Ukraine
is that it's all about the power plants
now
and here's my question
how hard would it be to turn off the
power in Moscow
how many power plants keep moscow's
lights on
because you know it would be of course
an amazing provocation to attack Moscow
but if they turned all the lights off in
Ukraine
I would certainly send a terrorist Force
after their after their power plants
it would cost World War III
give you a contrarian opinion
contrarian opinion
Putin can't use his nukes
and he knows it under any scenario
that that's my opinion my opinion is
that Putin see you have to put yourself
in his shoes if you put yourself in your
own shoes
you say oh I don't trust that guy he
could do anything
but you put yourself in his shoes
now physically he could launch a nuke of
course he could probably get it done
but there's no way it would work
like there's no scenario which he can
imagine where okay I use this tactical
new
and then and then the war turns in my
favor and then I roll up and I take over
Ukraine and then people trade with me
again and they'll be good with that
because they'll get over it you know for
a while they'll be real mad but they'll
get over it do you think that do you
think that Putin is so out of it
that he could even imagine a scenario
where nuclear weapons would be to his
advantage
can you
really
some of you can
but but now keep in mind I'm asking I'm
asking the question very specifically
if you believe he's crazy
then anything's possible
but I'm giving you the assumption that
he is not crazy
if he's not crazy there's no way he'll
ever use a nuke
now
I'm waiting for somebody to tell me how
wrong I was about Putin before that
would be the obvious thing to say now
but I'll criticize myself in case you
forgot to do it
um
all right like so that comment through
be off
uh yes I was so wrong about Putin before
so I said the Putin would not invade
Ukraine even when he'd masked his forces
for The Invasion because I said to
myself well Putin's not so stupid
that he thinks this could work out well
because I didn't think it would work out
well but then he invaded
so we do know that that Putin can be
fooled
by a risk reward situation in which he
read the risk and the reward incorrectly
right
we know that Putin we know Putin can
read the risk reward incorrectly because
he did once already recently
but
that was almost certainly because he was
getting bad information from his his own
military don't you think does anybody
have any doubt about that what whatever
Putin believed about his own military
came from the military
right now so that he can't trust his own
military but
does he need to ask the military what
would happen if he used a nuke
no he does not that that does not
require military advice
he knows exactly what would happen it
would be the end of him
and if he doesn't know let me spell it
out for you
if Putin uses a nuclear weapon
than a decapitation strike of Putin is
on
am I wrong
the response would be a decapitation
strike
wouldn't it we would kill Putin
tell me I'm wrong
tell me I'm wrong I don't think we would
even attack the Russian military
so what uh
what Biden says or the experts are
saying is that the U.S would do a
massive attack on the Russian military
possible it's possible
but if a guy uses a nuke you only have
one mission
you only have one job to get rid of that
one guy
right that's your only job
and I and I would I would tell all the
other generals I'd say
get the away from him
we're not after you I would tell all of
the other generals and all the other
leaders were not after you do not be
within a city block of Putin
get the out of there and you've got
one day you've got 24 hours just to get
out of the blast zone because we know
where he is and there's going to be a
big hole there in 24 hours we will do
nothing else to Russia
there will be no other impact if you're
not standing next to Putin you will be
completely safe
do not stand next to Putin because the
next week is going to be a big hole in
the ground where Putin used to be
that's how I did look
I would tell the Russian people they
don't have anything to worry about we're
going after one guy and we're going to
make sure nobody uses a nuke again
yeah
now imagine this turned around the other
way imagine American president used a
nuclear weapon when it didn't have to
happen
just imagine that and then imagine the
other side says look we're just going to
kill your president
Stand Down
I might let him do it
I might let him do it
right if my president launched a like a
dirty nuke when it didn't have to happen
and somebody says we're going to kill
him for it I'd get out of the way
I mean I'm not sure I would reveal his
location because I don't want to go full
Trader but I wouldn't care if he got
killed not at all
so I think nuclear is just different in
every way so everything you know about
everything else is completely different
as soon as you're talking nuclear now
nobody has a country when you're talking
nuclear
you know what I mean as soon as you say
nuclear I don't care about the name of
the country
you're just going to stop that stuff
whatever it takes
all right
um
anything else happening we're all trying
to guess what's going to happen with
Twitter
I saw a paid comment here on YouTube
that you're waiting to see how extreme
I'll go now that I can get away with it
one assumes
but I'm not sure it'll be that different
because I actually don't have any views
that I would want to say on Twitter that
I can't even in the old regime there was
nothing I could say that I couldn't say
I've always had that getting kicked off
of Twitter takes work like you'd have to
you'd have to do some work
and usually they just tell you you have
one problem tweet
and if you take it down you'll be fine I
would just take it down
it's not that hard
all right
uh two metal canisters
I would not believe any false Flags
about radiation injuries in the Ukraine
I wouldn't believe anything about
anything on that topic
could Oz capitalize on a prophetamine
apology well not if he said just make
sure you vote Democrat
uh
Jenny Jackson it was it was a bit of a
 says that uh Scott duped by
Kaiser Medical remember you bragging
about how great they were for years only
to realize they were trash once you need
them typical for Scott to get duped just
like Ukraine well Jenny you stupid piece
of trash
I'm gonna hide you
give you no more attention
um
I didn't monkey
there's a uh a video on uh on Twitter
of some I think it was a Ukrainian woman
who slapped a Russian guy in a bar
they were getting in a verbal
disagreement she looked like she was
drunk and she just walks up to him from
across the room walks up to him just
slaps him in the face
and then he just lays her out
and I just you know with a slab not a
punch but uh
but uh I have to admit I enjoyed
watching it several times
because every time somebody thinks that
they're invulnerable and they learn that
they're not
that is so entertaining
and why why did this white woman think
she could uh she could assault a man in
public
why did the white woman think she could
assault a man in public
because white women can get away with
everything
they can get away with anything
and and there was one Russian guy who
who taught her that he wasn't born in
America
hey guess what this guy's not born in
America bam
yeah
all right
um
let's guess who will be brought back
onto Twitter
I say Trump will be offered but will not
come back to Twitter what do you say
because because he needs people to join
truth I think Twitter will run for
president I'm sorry I think
Trump will run for president
and I think he can win two ways
either by forcing people to be on truth
to find out what the candidate says
which I I'm already on truth but I don't
use it
uh if if Trump tweeted every day running
for president then I would have to be
untruth and not have to check it right
and as a number of people would so I
think his best play
is to help his media entity by running
for president and he probably wants to
run for president anyway
so I'm going to say that Trump will be
invited but will not come so that's my
first one I think
some of them are are interesting because
you know Carpe Duncan
what did he get kicked off for
was it for a copyright violation
because I I think I might have been a
copyright violations
or was it about trans no The Babylon B
got kicked off for making fun of a trans
person
little kids hugging I don't know
whatever it was but I think it depends
why they got kicked off
I would be in favor of no permanent
suspensions
no permanent suspensions there should be
just a like a three-year penalty maybe
like if you did something like that was
Holocaust bad I still think you should
get three years
you know and be able to come back with
full privileges
May or maybe come back with some kind of
limited you know we're watching you kind
of thing
yeah Babylon got kicked off her satire
but the satire was targeting a
targeting a group
as all satire does
all right so we'll we'll see who comes
back on Twitter project Veritas seems
like that one would come back
what did they do that
violated any terms of service
Alex Jones I would expect him to be back
uh oh Jay is Jordan Peterson kicked off
on Twitter
Is that real
what
for saying that the Sports Illustrated
model didn't look healthy
then no
that can't be true
oh he deleted the Tweet he's back okay
wow
see now I would I would have done that
too
yeah on one hand you think well I'll
make a point of it and I won't delete
the Tweet because it's what I mean but I
don't think that's worth it
you know in the real world
if Twitter is part of your business
model as it is with with Jordan Peterson
and it is with me
uh
I think you just delete the tweet and
you know live to live to offend another
day
yeah live to fight another I would just
one die in the hill
it is not bad I guess it's a
disagreement whether he's back
uh he dead named the actress was that
what it was
was it Ellen Page or was it
uh
he dead named Elliot page and called
Elliott
um by the original name that's what
happened
uh he dead name someone and said how is
that bad oh okay
well
let me let me see if I can be as
open-minded about this as possible Right
uh
I generally
I generally agree with Jordan Peterson
so I'm generally on this side
uh not all the time that's probably true
of our ability
but let's say let's say his argument was
there should be nothing wrong with using
somebody's original name especially if
that's how people you know know to refer
to them if you're talking to other
people and let's say you're refer to
them like Kanye versus yay
um
but imagine all right I'm gonna I'm
gonna do devil's advocate here okay
here's a little Devil's Advocate imagine
if you
were that trans person
and a famous person when on Twitter and
use your original name
which has the effect to you
of
mocking you
uh or maybe not mocking but let's say
disrespecting your identity
how much would that bother you
you know would that is that a crime
okay here's where here's where I think
you have to
um be a little bit more human
you were you're all judging this from
the perspective of not being a trans
person
if you're not trans how can you possibly
imagine what it would be like
how could you possibly imagine that
I don't think you can
now
should our standard be
that what we're allowed to say is based
on how hurt another person is is that
the standard
because that's a pretty dangerous
standard isn't it it's a little reason
that we have free speech is so you don't
have a standard like that
let's say we imagined that she was hurt
by the comment
is that reason enough and let's say that
even Jordan Peterson might have known
that she would be at least offended or
feel disrespected maybe even get mocked
by Jordan Peterson's followers or
something like that
should does she have a reason to
complain
well she has a reason not to like it
for sure
and and if she said some horrible things
about Jordan Peterson because of it
I would certainly want her to be able to
say all those things in public and so
would he pretty sure I'm not a mind
reader but pretty sure he likes free
speech he says it a lot
oh my chance
that was funny all right
so I'm going to say uh it probably is
pretty tough to be trans
and maybe we should be a little bit more
open-minded about you know hurting an
individual who's just in a different
space than you are but on the other hand
you can't have free speech
you can't have free speech if you're
worried about hurting everybody so I I
guess I would defend his right to say it
and maybe encourage him to soften a
little bit
how's that
so and and of course he isn't under no
obligation to take my advice I wouldn't
even expect him to
but I think as a as a trying to be a
good human
I think you could say I respect your
free speech completely but just be
just be a little bit knowledgeable that
not every trans person is the same
you know let me ask you this
if a hundred trans trans people decided
to transition
what percentage of them do you believe
will end up happier
I don't know the answer to myself but
I'd love to see you just guess what
percentage of trans people do you think
end up happier
now I'm seeing very low numbers on the
locals like you know zero to five
percent ten percent I don't think that's
true
has anybody ever done a study on it
all right here's everything I know about
people
cognitive dissonance should make
everybody who does that think they made
the right decision
almost
let me say it again whether or not it's
the right decision that's separate
there's there's like a reality part you
know what is true is it actually right
or is it actually not right did they
actually get happier but cognitive
dissonance would almost guarantee that
you would believe you were happier
do you understand cognitive dissonance
enough to understand that statement
that almost every one of them
would say they're happier and and if I
understand anything about the world
without seeing any kind of research no
research whatsoever I haven't seen any
but I'm going to bet that the vast
majority of them will tell you they're
happier and believe they're happier
even if objectively you look at them
saying I'm not so sure
but I believe they'll think they're
happier and should they have that right
well they have the right
but
so let me ask you this for those the
people who said they think only five
percent were happier
if if you could be shown that 95 or
happier and I don't have a reason to
believe that's true uh but if you were
shown that would you change your opinion
would that change how you feel about the
whole situation because my opinion is
probably closer to ninety percent than
five percent
I don't know where it is but that's a
lot closer to 90 than five
yeah let's say after five years right
yeah after one or two years that's when
the cognitive dissonance would be the
strongest so as Erica suggests you wait
five years and then then maybe people
have
you know really settled into whether
this is a good or bad idea
Studies have been done but how come
nobody has quoted a result yet
usually when I say something like this
somebody says oh it's been studied and
the percentage was this or that but why
why are we getting all
well let let me bring this back to
something practical
how many of you are embarrassed
that you have a strong opinion and you
don't know if that five percent are
happy or 95 percent happy
isn't it embarrassing to have a strong
opinion on this
if you
no I'm not talking about kids
the the kid question is more contrite
yeah I think with kids you let them
decide when they're 18. yeah
or 21 maybe 18 you don't even have a
fully formed brain yet so maybe 25 I
don't know there's no right answer
because somebody's going to be
disadvantaged no matter which way you go
and and disadvantaged a great deal
yeah I think most of you probably only
care about the the kids doing it right
otherwise Live and Let Live
you know most Republicans are like I
don't care what you do just don't do
things to kids
yeah
so I think that's where we could agree
that's where we could break because if I
say I don't think kids should transition
I'm not really saying anything about
Trans Am I is that a comment plus or
minus about trans if you say people
should wait to a certain age to do
something it has nothing to do with
any opinion about transitioning it's
just when you make the decisions
all right
um
Greg speed says his philosophy is don't
touch me and don't take my stuff
nicely done that's as good as my old
boss's philosophy the the cleanest
political philosophy I've ever heard
because I asked them how he voted on all
the various propositions and the smaller
laws and candidates you've never heard
of and stuff and he said I just vote for
whatever will lower my taxes or I vote
against anything that would increase my
taxes
as soon as I heard that I was like
okay but I pushed back a little bit I
said but some of them are still good
ideas right
and he said and listen to this
they already have enough money
so it didn't matter whether it was a
good idea
if it's a good idea take the money from
one of your bad ideas
he shut me down so fast
I've never been that shut down with a
political argument yeah normally if I'm
in a political argument I'm like a pit
bull like like I'll make my point like
Way Beyond the point where it's useful
but the moment he said they already have
enough money I was like
ah and
I but let me
but have you could
on the other hand
I have nothing
that was the end of the conversation
let me give a little love to the person
who said that he was my boss Mike
Goodwin who passed away this year
tragically he passed away this year and
he was also famous as the person who
named Dilbert
his name is Mike Goodwin
and he named Dilbert true fact
uh he was my boss
and an excellent person one of my
favorite people
I'll tell you a joke he told that also
summarizes all of human behavior would
you would you like to hear
one statement he said so he did one
thing that summarized all the politics
but he also summarized all of human
behavior
so we're working a small room there was
a laboratory and the laboratory had
limited storage space so we had a little
debate among the the staff there were
just five of us or three of us or
whatever and we're trying to decide uh
if one drawer should be the one where we
keep the screwdrivers because we're
always looking for screwdrivers for
stuff or should it be where we kept our
snacks
so was it the snack drawer or was it
going to be the yeah the screwdriver
store and I thought I was pretty clever
you know pretty clever I was already a
professional humorist and I said well
snacks or screwdrivers I I guess it
depends if you if you want to eat or
screw
and I thought well end of the story I've
just closed down this conversation
pretty clever pretty clever do you want
to eat or screw
and then Mike Goodwin listen to me say
it depends if you want to eat or screw
and very calmly he looked at me and he
said
depends how hungry I am
we're done we're done he just described
all of human behavior
technical problem he just described all
of human behavior
and left nothing nothing unsettled
there's nothing else you need to know
about the entire world that you live in
except if you have to choose between
eating and screwing
it depends how hungry you are
now think about that it doesn't depend
how horny you are
and once you understand that like the
entire
world makes sense just
depends how hungry I am yeah total bike
drop
and that's why his name was Mike
because he was he was the mic drop guy
anyway I do that just to honor his uh
his uh Legacy which actually lasts to
this day
remember I've told you that um
I don't I'm not a believer in an
afterlife per se so I'm not a believer
in a you know Supreme Being unless it's
you know or some entity that created a
simulation
but
um I do believe
in eternal life
because the the ripple effect that Mike
Goodwin had on the world
not only ripples through his family
you know which which will Ripple forever
but uh he changed me
he changed me
and and that will that that's permanent
and then whatever I do to change other
people well there's a little bit of that
Ripple
that comes through me the name Dilbert
every time you use the name Dilbert that
was my Goodwin Mike Goodwin is the
reason you know the name Dilbert it
might also be the reason to succeed it
because names are really important
and Dilbert was sort of the perfect name
so it probably did make a difference
anyway
um as you can tell I am full of love and
hope and optimism and excellent Health
today
uh
this is the most optimistic day I've had
in the longest time maybe since 2016.
and it really does feel like things are
starting to change in a positive way
does it
does anybody else have that feeling
I I but I feel like this the Twitter
isn't the only thing
I I feel like there's a whole bunch of
things
that are starting to line up
to show us
we're heading in the right direction
and that
is the thought I'd like to leave you on
today
because I think we've done our job here
today
and thank you again to all the people on
locals who were so good to keep me alive
