good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human
civilization wow do we have a show today
I feel sorry for everybody who has a
show later today after I've covered all
the interesting things there'll be
nothing else to say but if you'd like
this experience to go up to levels that
we can't even understand with our tiny
human brain
all you need is a cup or mug or glass a
tanker chalis or Stein a canteen jug or
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for the unparallel pleasure
the dopamine here the day thing makes
everything better it's called the
simultanous Sip and it happens now
go oh so good so good well I'm going to
get start with some pallet cleansers but
of course I will be talking about
the Supreme Court case about Colorado
and Trump and of course the Putin
interview with Tucker and we'll talk
about Biden's brain and uh at the end
I'm going to talk about some
persuasion that Israel is
using quite successfully so wait for
that that'll be toward the end all right
well I saw a AI researcher James
Zhao I hope pronouncing that correctly
he thinks AI models are getting
substantially
worse over time and potentially it's
because of a result of interacting with
humans now I would like to remind you
that I'm I think I might be the only
person who is predicting that AI will
hit a a wall it's just it's going to hit
a top and that it probably already
did now that's not to say that AI won't
keep getting better at image
generation and playing chess and doing
math and writing code and translating
languages it's going to do a whole bunch
of things really
well um but I don't think it's going to
get smarter in the way that people think
of
smart you know like I said it it'll do
tasks that are you know automated kinds
of things like math uh it'll do a lot of
things faster but here's what I think I
think humans will find ways to
it and and keep it from getting smarter
than us because if if AI gets smarter
than us we will lose all our
power do you know what I mean all of the
rest of the news that I'm going to talk
to about today are things that we can't
agree on what if AI got smart enough
that it could tell us what was
true we wouldn't put up with that that
we would immediately say it's broken
we'd turn it off we'd reprogram it
because the people who are wrong are
often in charge so they're not going to
put up with AI telling them they're all
wrong and everything is stupid and it's
a bad idea imagine just taking
everything that Joe Biden has done this
year put it in front of AI that
everybody agreed with smarter than
people and then the AI says you know
these are a bunch of bad ideas and it's
pretty obvious you should get rid of him
under the 25th Amendment what are you
going to do with that are you going to
say well I'm glad we got a smart AI it
just told us what to do then we'll go do
that nope you're going to say the AI is
broken you're going to say the AI is
biased you're going to say the other
side programmed it and you're going to
do what you think is right and by the
way that AI must be getting
Dumber yeah so listen to this the US
Department of Commerce announced the
launch of the AI safety Institute
Consortium
uh it already has 200 stakeholders
including open AI Google anthropic and
meta and they're all there to come up
with
safe safe uh development procedures for
AI is there anything else I need to tell
you to convince you that AI will be
ruined by human
activity it's a committee it's a
committee to decide how to keep it safe
what do you think that's going to
include
I'm just going to take a guess let me
take a wild guess the committee to keep
AI
safe is going to build Dei into it
because there's nothing safer than
diversity it's going to build CRT and
ESG into it because we all like
Equity it's going to make sure that it
doesn't say anything that offends every
anybody so that gets rid of everything
useful
and it's going to make sure it doesn't
disagree with anybody who's got power in
the United States because that would be
very
unsettling so it can't do anything
useful
provocative or outside the outside the
domain that we think is
safe what's that sound like it sounds
exactly like a censorship on the
internet why would AI be different we
we've eliminated human free speech by
saying we're trying to keep ourselves
safe that happened right in front of you
we all watched it we're going to keep
you safe and to do that we better get
rid of your free speech about whatever
you think about these
vaccinations and whatever you think
about masks you better get rid of that
Free Speech it's going to happen to AI
you think AI is going to be the only
entity that can have free
speech because imagine this imagine
imagine I say you know there's some
things I would certainly never say but
here's my here's my AI to tell you its
opinion it's not my opinion it's the AI
talking there's no way that will be
allowed we don't have a system that that
would allow AI to get smarter than us
and that's not a very high bar except as
I say coding and math and playing chess
and stuff it'll be great at
that all right here's some fake science
dat J bakara you know him from being
right about everything about the
pandemic um he he tweets that the CDC
commissioned scientists to see if n95
masks work better than S surgical masks
for healthc care workers now we're not
talking about the pandemic we're talking
about ordinary medical procedures now I
I don't know why they needed to study
this am I right because every I'm just
spent the last three years being told
over and over and over again the n95s
work you know I'm not talking about Co
but they work in the medical context but
those regular little ones that we wore
you know they're not going to perform as
well what do you think the science
said science said no
difference let me say that again after
three years of listening to
every expert in the world tell us that
you know one the one thing we know for
sure like we might be guessing and
speculating a lot of things but there is
one thing we know for sure outside of
the context of Co you know with regular
medical stuff the n95s work and those
other ones well you know kind of not so
well turns out nothing like that was the
case and so what did the CDC do when it
commissioned a highquality study and it
came back saying there was no difference
the CDC decided to ignore the
evidence because they didn't like the
answer and so they told the scientists
that they were
wrong so how about
AI we just did a high quality study and
then the people who didn't like the
answer said the study must be wrong
because was opposite of what they
expected do you think AI is going to get
treated differently the moment AI tells
us something we don't want to hear we're
going to reprogram
it we're not going to say wow that AI
sure got smarter than us nope nope we
don't work that way that's just not a
human
activity all right uh Sam mman raising
money for super AI chips he thinks he
might need 7 trillion do
what what were you doing
today like I I think I'm all important
because I got a little podcast going on
here oh look at me I got a couple
thousand people looking at me I'm really
killing it today what's Sam mman doing
he's raising
uh7 trillion dollar for the most
transformative technology in the history
of humankind and that's okay too so I
mean I'm sure what you did today was
good
too oh it's all about the same Equity I
say well Peter
Navaro is not getting bail while he's
appealing his conviction
for uh not not submitting to Congress to
testify uh do you see something terribly
wrong with this as in maybe if he'd
beaten up some police officers he would
get out
faster like literally he should have
assaulted a police officer because I
hear if you do that you get out right
away but he refused to participate in a
corrupt process as he saw
it and he doesn't get bailed to appeal
it
really it's not like he doesn't have an
appeal I'm pretty sure he does I don't
know what the basis would be I'm sure he
has an
appeal oh how do you how do you
interpret this other than Republicans
being put in jail and being haunted it's
exactly what it looks like right the
justice system is completely
corrupt um do you know the host of The
View named Sunny
host yes she's a host named
hoston you you really
and the funny thing is that she's always
negative and her name is sunny
Hosten so she's literally hosting
negativity but her name is sunny hoston
but she's also very much F in favor of
reparations she really likes the slavery
reparations uh even now after doing a
DNA test to find out that she's
descended from Spanish slave
Traders
uh awkward
awkward uh but even though she's
descended from Spanish slave Traders
she's still in favor of reparations but
I
believe she feels she should be
exempt she didn't say that but I feel
like that's the essence of it it's
like I'm descended from Spanish slave
Traders that's completely different you
know who am I going to give reparations
to anyway the somebody over in
Spain
so anyway consistency is not real
big um I saw a Jennifer cabani tweet
there's a US UCLA Professor who was
suspended do you remember this story he
was suspended for refusing to grade
black students leniently after George
George
Floyd apparently there was a movement
that black students should get uh
inflated grades because of what happened
to George Floyd and maybe it caused some
distress he refused to do it and it
ruined his career including his uh uh
lucrative expert witness business on the
side and so he's suing UCLA for $19
million Will he
win I don't know it depends if the
courts are completely corrupt but I
think he might I think he might it's
2024 anything had
happened
um okay there's a a high school debate
James Fishback is writing about this on
on X uh the national speech and debate
Association they eliminated a high
school debate topic the topic was about
Civil
Disobedience and the reason that they
didn't want to have the high school
debate on civil disobedience was because
uh it would put some students in a
position of listening to arguments that
they didn't align
with that actually happened a high
school debate was cancelled because I
didn't want to put the students in a
position of hearing an opinion that was
opposite of their
own okay sure well apparently the
xplatform is going to have its own phone
for audio and video and texting and um
Elon mus says he's going to get rid of
his regular phone and use only the
xplatform for text in a month or so now
correct me if I'm
wrong how does that work does it work
through the regular phone network
because you'd have to have some
connections just to have all the
coverage I always wondered how other
phone companies get access to the
proprietary networks of exist
ing uh
people so I don't know how that work
waiting for details but what if what if
it worked for
everybody I mean is it possible that for
$20 a month I'll be able to make
Unlimited phone
calls is that going to
happen because I think it might what
would that do to the entire cell phone
business and do you think it's obvious
that elen mus is going to make a
phone
does it seem obvious like the most
obvious thing is you should make a phone
and it should be based on an AI model
where it's not a bunch of apps it's just
something you talk to I don't know I
think that's
coming um well so there's new new news
that uh the loneliness epidemic is worse
than we think and young people 15 to
24 reported a 70% drop in time spent
with friends after the pandemic
a 70% drop in spending time with friends
young people and with the elderly it's
even you know it's like critical but the
the new information is that uh
loneliness increases the risk of
premature death by nearly
30%
loneliness increases the risk of
premature
death that you call excess
mortality by nearly 30% now it's science
so I don't believe any science so I'm
not sure any of that's true
but do you believe that loneliness uh
does have an impact on life expectancy
yes or
no as someone who has experienced it I
would say it's
obvious you you can feel the impact on
your on your health it's just like being
under a weighted blanket I mean you
can't miss it I mean you can't miss it
yeah so let me propose
this excess mortality is fully explained
by the excess loneliness the the extreme
amount of extra
loneliness if it does have this
substantial impact on premature death is
the only thing I can think of that would
affect every person in the same way in
other words every demographic from young
to old every every race every gender
because that's what excess mortality is
doing the excess mortality is hitting
everybody or every group not everybody
but every group and I couldn't think of
I was actually speculating it might be
something with the food
supply because if if the excess
mortality were simply
vaccinations that would be the easiest
thing in the world to check you just say
did you get vaccinated yes or no and
then you sum up their excess mortality
of that group so has anybody seen a
study that says that the vaccinations
caused the excess
mortality where they where they actually
studied as a control group if you've
seen that Ascend it to me because I've
only seen the ones that say that the
entire population has excess mortality
I've never seen anybody look at
vaccinated versus
unvaccinated
so for excess Mor
so if you've seen that let me know but I
think this would explain all of
it you know unless it was unless this it
could be the study was funded by the
makers of the the
shots if that if that's true then I
don't believe any of
it but consider that that we have an
obvious an obvious candidate for excess
mortality that would be more to public
policy wouldn't it so I think that the
decision for the lockdowns may have be
the entire excess
mortality if we hadn't locked down we
wouldn't be
socially so you know push back all right
I have a uh challenge to the
anti-semites watching this show I know
there are always some and it goes like
this I need you to be more credible than
the people who believe that aliens are
visiting the Earth and that they're
crashing their ships on a regular basis
now the reason I don't believe aliens
have come to Earth is because nobody
seems to produce a piece of wreckage
nobody who's seen it directly seems
credible and the the whistleblowers tend
to be people who talk to people who say
they saw it and there's no good
photograph now I'd like you to do take
the same standard and apply it to your
belief that there's a worldwide Jewish
conspiracy and here are the questions
that you need to answer for me before I
want to hear from you again okay now if
you can answer these questions then your
your hypothesis would have some weight
but if you can't answer these questions
ask yourself why question number
one uh how can it be that the elites and
Davos and the wef are really the ones in
charge if it's also really the gigantic
Jewish worldwide
conspiracy or are you saying that one is
a subset of the other so just be clear
I'm not saying what is or isn't just be
clear what do you believe and then
explain to me how things would
uh explain to me why there are no
whistleblowers if there's a worldwide
Jewish
conspiracy and we know that Jews don't
seem to agree on anything like even even
the the Jews living in Israel right now
don't agree that there should be uh
ongoing war with over in Gaza that's a
pretty big thing to disagree on that's a
pretty big disagreement they've got what
12 political parties because they don't
agree on much they've got you in the
United States you've got the
conservative Jews you've got the liberal
Jews you've got the the ones who are
very pro Israel needs to be a country
the others who say why is it a country
so with all of those different kinds of
Jews if you believe there's a world
white conspiracy where they've really
they've really buttoned it up and for
hundreds of years we see seem to not be
able to get a whistleblower explain why
there's no
whistleblower cuz you know they're not
all in the same
team you know that so not one of them
not a not a single person is willing to
say yeah I was in a meeting and I got to
tell you worldwide conspiracy it's all
we talk about how about an internal
document we have internal documents for
every damn thing for everything show me
the the internal document where they
plan their worldwide
takeover how about
uh how about this if you want to
convince me there's a worldwide Jewish
conspiracy I want you to explain to me
uh which culture you're aware of
anywhere in the world in which the
people with the best
educations don't run
things if there's one of those then
that's a pretty good argument if you you
can find me a country where the most
educated
demographic doesn't have all the
power then I would say huh there's
something weird going on in America
because the most educated part of our
public seems to have all the good jobs
that would be very suspicious to me if
the other countries found out that
getting a good education really retards
your ability to get a good job so
explain to me how how America would look
different if you accept it that the
people with the best educations almost
always have the
power and you would want them
to you would want them to we we
literally go out of our way to elect
people and promote people who are better
educated so why would this be the
exception why would this be the one time
that the most educated people in America
are not in charge they should be if
everything is working in a perfectly
normal way that's exactly what you would
say so if you send me a big picture of
how many Jewish people are in charge of
Corporations especially the media I say
that's what I would expect it to look
like what would you expect it to look
like if the only explanation was
educated people get better jobs what how
would that look right
so that's my challenge to you let's talk
about Tucker and Putin How many of you
watched the Tucker interview Tucker
Carlson with Vladimir
Putin quite a few of you uh let me give
you my summary summary of it and a few
other
thoughts um number one the question was
is Putin like really really smart and
he's all there and that's mostly what
I'm seeing today I'm seeing a lot of
smart observers saying that Putin guy he
he really together and one of the
evidences that people are using is that
he gave a long history lesson
uh as an answer to you know one of
Tucker's first questions he gave an
extended history lesson with dates and
names and it was like a Thousand-Year
history of Ukraine and Russia and how
everything came to
be and many of you use that as an
example of how on the ball Putin is that
he could do
that to which I
say uh I didn't see that at all you know
obviously it's subjective but what I saw
is somebody who couldn't read a
room because wasn't the whole point of
Putin talking to Tucker to convince
non-russians he wasn't talking to
Russia because Russia seems to be on his
side he was talking to everybody not in
Russia and if he believed that that
Thousand-Year history lesson was
persuasive to
Americans that's just sort of
dumb that that seems a little clueless
to me it seems like not reading the room
at all it feels like an old man who
couldn't that nobody knows how to say no
to so he's just going to ramble because
he can it looked like he was showing off
that he had a that he had a grasp of
history and that showing off seemed to
be his dominant motivation it did not
seem like he was trying to convince
anybody of anything which was stupid and
absurd and it to me it looked like age
related now I'm completely aware that
you all disagree with
me I I think maybe 5% saw it the way I
saw it and here's my take and you will
also disagree with this but I'm going to
be uh I'm not going to back off it we've
been looking at our president for a long
time
Biden if you have in your mind that
Biden is what a president looks like and
then you saw Putin it is quite natural
that you would say my God Putin is well
put together but you know compared to
what we're seeing it's
terrible if RFK Jr had been president
for three
years and every time he talked whether
you agreed with him or not agreeing with
him is different but every time he
talked it was
smart do you think that Putin would look
so so clever
then no it's a comparison
thing now you're going to reject my
frame you're going to say no Scott I'm
not comparing him to Putin because I'm
mentally not doing that I'm telling
myself not to and I'm examining my own
thoughts and I know I'm not I'm
definitely not doing that well you're
wrong because you can't not do it you
can't turn it off you are only a
comparison pattern recognizing machine
machine you cannot make your brain be
something it's not you compare things to
other things period you don't know how
to turn that off and if you were
comparing Putin to anybody it was
definitely Biden and you can't turn that
feature off and so it will guarantee
that you see Putin is better than he is
because your comparison is so bad right
so I think that's why I I think that
reason I saw Putin looking old and
looking like a a rattling on like an old
man who didn't know that basically he
couldn't read the room he he didn't seem
to have a the facility to know what
would come across more effectively now
toward the end I'm going to talk about
uh Israel and some persuasion that
they're doing and you're going to see
the difference all right you're going to
see the difference between good
persuasion and bad
persuasion uh and that was bad
persuasion I think Putin failed I think
he looked nervous I thought I thought he
looked somebody said this so I'm
stealing this he looked like somebody
who's not used to answering hard
questions because he doesn't get them
so um I don't know that we learned
anything do do you think we learned
anything was there any new stuff we we
heard butin believes that the CIA blew
up the nordstream pipeline if you were
paying attention you already ble believe
that to be
true um he believes that there's some
historical president that gives Russia
some control over Ukraine he believes
that NATO was the aggressor and you know
they've been warned many times we kind
of knew that um so I don't know that we
learned anything new it wasn't news
making um Putin says he tried to
basically be on the same side as the
United States and Europe a few times
once with Bill Clinton in which he said
do you think Russia would ever be able
to join NATO which is funny um and Bill
Clinton actually thought maybe so but
his people told him no who do you think
his people are who do you think told
Bill Clinton no you cannot make peace
with Russia so productively that they're
actually part of our own military
protection well I
assume I assume it was the military
industrial complex and I assume it's CU
there are too many people who went to
school to learn how to be uh spies
against
Russia I think it was just the Deep
State said he can't do
that so I think that Putin is telling us
that even Clinton was not in charge and
I think he's telling us that that uh
Biden is not in charge and there seems
to be a suggestion that maybe the CIA or
some shadowy group is really running the
country and uh but then the weirdest
part is Putin kept claiming
that he was acting sort of
petulant that his offers to negotiate
and things like that were were not taken
seriously and at one point there was a
Minsk agreement so he thought there was
an agreement but then uh Boris Johnson
shot it
down now if only I had some way to do a
Boris Johnson
impression Boris Johnson shot it down
and
see um so why do you think Boris Johnson
shot down something that looked like a
reasonable agreement probably because
whoever got to Bill Clinton also got to
Boris Johnson you know not the exact
same people but something like
it so now we've seen several instances
where the leaders or the people we
thought were the leaders were all about
the peace but they couldn't have the
power to do it well why don't the
leaders have power to make peace
probably because it's exactly what you
think it is they're not in charge at
least of the war decisions all right uh
let's see what else um and Putin you
know pointed out that uh the CIA did a
coup in Ukraine you know right in the
right in the basically the front steps
of Russia
and uh what else let's
see
um how many how many people thought
Tucker was scared he was going to be
murdered at any
minute so to his credit let let me say
this
unambiguously Tucker sat across from
Putin and probably asked him the hardest
questions he's ever been asked
and was making Putin prettyy
uncomfortable and I gotta say I saw a
cartoon meme of uh of Tucker leaving the
interview with a wheelbarrow to to carry
his own
balls because they were so
big so I thought uh I thought Tucker did
a good job
however well let's talk more about that
and then I'll give you the other side of
the coin um
so one of the things that tiger asked
them is you know why don't you give us
back that captive is it Wall Street
Journal there's a there's a reporter
over there that Russia says was a spy
and uh Wall Street Journal reporter yeah
young guy so they're holding in but
they're but Putin was saying that that
needs to be negotiated by the spies so
he says his spies and America's spies
need to work it out and it's probably
going to be some kind of a deal where
they get something we get something to
get him
back now his claim Putin's claim is that
the guy is actually a spy and that
whether he worked for anybody or not he
was involved with getting secrets and
passing them on do you think that's
true do you think it's true that he got
some secrets to pass him on or do you
think that Putin just made up something
so they could capture another American
so they'd have more to
negotiate who knows yeah you should not
make any assumption about whether that's
true my take on the entire thing is that
Putin seemed to be
lying at least half of the
time that was my take it looked like he
was lying at least half of the time now
by lying I mean that he's leaving out
context and not telling you the full
story and spinning it you know that sort
of thing so um let me let me give you
this
warning I've told you about what I call
the documentary effect
if you walk if you watch an hourong
documentary and it's just taking
one-sided point of view you will think
you've been convinced you will always be
convinced by a documentary because it
doesn't show The Other Side well
likewise if you saw Putin talking for
two hours and you thought you learned
something consider that it's the
opposite consider that it made you
dumber you got that because what Putin
said was things you already knew but
then there were a bunch of you know
spinny things where there were things
that it was the the Russian view if you
believe you got smarter because you
heard Putin talk it's the
opposite yeah very the opposite he made
you dumber because you might have
believed some of the things he said and
there they should not be believed
because it's a documentary effect
problem where there's nobody there to
say yeah but what about this context and
aren't you leaving this out and and
those things
so every one of you who thought wow
after seeing that I have a different
view of Putin that's a
mistake that's a mistake you should have
exactly the same view of Putin before
the interview is after you know may
maybe give or take whether you thought
he was showing signs of age but that's
different all right um I love the fact
that Tucker put him on the spot on
camera to ask him why you wouldn't free
the journalist that was both
ballsy and exactly the right thing to do
because that guy can't be
forgotten but you also have to take into
account our own government lies to us
routinely and we wouldn't know if he was
a spy or not you wouldn't know do you do
you think that guy's not a spy because
your government told
you
really yeah our government said he's not
a spy so oh he's not a spy now by the
way I'm not saying he is that that would
be messed up I don't know I'm saying
there's no way to know and if you
believe
Putin you're stupid and if you believe
the US version you're stupid one of
those is right or more right than the
other but you have no way of knowing no
way of knowing absolutely no way of
knowing so I just look at that as like
okay somebody said this somebody said
that it's bad for this guy I wish get I
wish he'd be released but I think he's
going to be part of some negotiations it
looks
like
um so I would say that uh Tucker did a
great job
um of news but if you're treating it
like news you probably shouldn't you
should treat it more like
entertainment entertainment wise I liked
it um but my take is that whole uh
history lesson was a little unhinged and
he didn't read the room and it showed
he's a little out of touch and his his
his thought that somebody needs to talk
to him you know he he's offered too many
peace plans already so somebody's going
to have to come to him that just seems
small you know so I don't think I don't
think Putin came off
well uh I thought Tucker
did and he's going to get a ton of push
back on this
all
right so was there anything else to say
about that it was entertaining I don't
think made much news uh oh let me one
other thing I saw some numbers about how
many people watched
it and so all right here's some numbers
uh F so just for comparison so you see
how well tuer is doing Fox News Prime
Time viewers average uh about two
million viewers
when Tucker was on Fox his show brought
in over three million so even soer was
you know the big the big traffic Guy on
Fox at the moment MSNBC averages 1.2
million CNN averages uh under 600,000
for any any moment they're watching and
then uh this tweet I was looking at said
that uh Tucker already 993 million
views now is that a good comparison 93
million
views versus you know two or three
million for the did did we do the math
right
no no everything's wrong with that math
everything's wrong with it number one uh
I turned that on and then turned it off
five times yesterday because I would I
would watch a little little bit I get
interrupted I go back to it how many how
many views do I have is that one view or
am I five
views do you know I don't know so if you
don't know that you could be off by you
know a factor of three or five number
two when you say that CNN has 600,000
viewers that means for one moment but
that 600,000 isn't the same 600,000
watching it all day the next hour will
be a new 600,000 mostly Etc so you
should look at a full day or two of CNN
to compare to a full day or two of
people watching this live stream am I
right next the business model of fox and
MSNBC and CNN is not about the time that
you spend online my view of these
networks is that the show the live show
on on the news is really just a clip
show all they're doing is creating
content that then gets pushed around
social media and gets pushed to their
websites and it makes them credible
enough that cable cables need to include
them in their Network so they get paid
by the cable companies they don't really
get paid by the advertising did you ever
wonder why the advertising on Fox News
was so
lame it's like hey I'm selling a pocket
knife you're like really that's like a
major Advertiser how about my
pillow it's because the advertising is
not where they make their money they
make their money by saying uh to the
cable operators you can't have our show
unless you pay us a bunch of
money so the money comes from the cable
operators and the the carriers the the
dishes and stuff like that
so um if you were to include CNN 's full
reach which includes their entire show
all day all the clips that go on social
media and get passed around and then who
goes to their
website and then you take maybe the 93
million is really oneth of that because
people just signing in and signing out
those numbers are a lot closer than you
think now I I I still think it's true
that um Tucker's numbers are much bigger
but it's not that much bigger it's not
100 times bigger it's more like it might
be double could be double could be
triple but don't trust these numbers so
the only thing here is a less none
numbers
basically all right here's the uh
best
um let's let's talk about the
uh um the report from the special
prosecutor her is his name I think it's
funny that uh
that Biden Biden was being investigated
by a
pronoun the guy's last name is herror H
but you got investigated by a pronoun
and uh here's the
uh here's here's the uh I guess the
summary of
it so the summary is he absolutely uh
did uh with willfulness he willingly and
knowingly took confidential materials
that he wasn't supposed to take so now
that's what you get prosecuted for right
he knew he was doing
it and he knew that it was confidential
and he wasn't supposed to do
it
so why aren't they Prosecuting him well
it appears that uh he did not remember a
lot of things such as when his son Bo
died and he was an elderly man with a
poor memory he has significant
limitations and uh jury would be
sympathetic uh and that he didn't
possess the mental state of willfulness
necessary to
prosecute wait if he didn't he didn't
have the he didn't have the mental state
of
willfulness that means he's just not
capable he's not
competent now
what did MSNBC say about this news
that's the worst news that they could
ever
have well you have to watch MSNBC today
you're missing a good show because
they're they're trying to find a way to
downplay the fact that the special
prosecutor said he's not going to
prosecute not entirely because of but
largely because of the person he wants
to prosecute isn't mentally capable of
standing end in trial and looking like
somebody who would know he met he
committed a
crime so here's what MSNBC is saying
well there's a little editorializing in
that isn't there
editorializing so they want you to think
that her should have only been talking
about the the
law and it was inappropriate for him to
speculate on the mental state of Joe
Biden what he's no medical
doctor and and how weird is it that you
would even consider what the defense
would be when putting together your
decision to prosecute to which I say how
dumb do you think the MSNBC viewers
are the only decision you make when
you're going to prosecute is what the
defense would look like that's not the
thing you forget it's the main thing the
main thing is what's the defense oh he
has an Al bu on video with
100
people oh he's mentally incapable oh
well he wouldn't get
convicted it's the main thing you think
about is what the defense would look
like and they're selling it to their
viewers as an irrelevant part of the
decision and their viewers are so dumb
they're buying
that I assume some of them
um let's see uh and then uh one of them
is saying that it's standard legal
advice to tell your client to say you
don't remember something when you're
being questioned now is that true is it
standard advice yes it is standard
advice if you're not totally sure or
it's not going to help you in some way
see I don't know I don't remember and
you see that all the people who do have
all their faculties do that right now
given that that's normal and and anybody
who's been in that business knows it's
sort of normal for the person you're
you're talking to to say well I don't
remember that I don't remember that but
don't you think her and his team are
completely aware of that don't you think
they know the difference between
somebody saying you know I don't
remember and somebody saying they don't
remember when their son died or when
they were Vice
President yeah you don't think he could
tell the difference between just
somebody using legal advice and somebody
who doesn't know what room he's
in yeah I think you can tell the
difference uh Lawrence O'Donnell said
that the prosecutor doesn't understand
the human
mind and and that's why he failed to
understand that under a pressure
situation such as the president being
you know grilled that the pressure makes
you forget
stuff so Lawrence O'Donnell says yeah
it's for some reason the prosecutor
doesn't understand even though it's his
very business as expertise and it's what
he's done for years uh that he doesn't
understand the human mind and how it's
harder to answer questions in that
situation but it didn't seem to bother
everybody else seems like everybody else
who ask gets answered asked questions
does a pretty good
job uh and they're and they they're of
course focusing on the fact that he's
cleared of all charges without
mentioning why he's cleared of all
charges totally different than the Trump
situation yeah now the one difference is
that Trump allegedly obstructed and Joe
Biden allegedly did not who
knows
um all right so Biden wanted to defend
his brain so he had to go in public and
act like he's not crazy and Bill maluan
posted this he said that Biden expressed
visible anger with the reporters while
defending his memory and mental
acuity he then said the president of
Mexico refused to open up humanitarian
corridors into the Gaza
Strip that's a high quality post right
there this is such a good post I'm going
to read it again from Bill malan at Fox
uh Biden expressed visible anger with
reporters while defending his memory and
mental acuity he then said the president
of Mexico refused to open up
humanitarian corridors into the Gaza
Strip uh as ran all humorously pointed
out about that same exchange going to
build a wall with Gaza and make Mexico
pay for it and boy are they going to be
confused now that's a good post
too now I've never had so much fun with
the news watching the Democrats try to
protect Biden as he's as he's
disintegrating it's kind of fun and I
don't want it to end right
away I I want want him to go all the way
yeah we'll talk about the Alternatives
but I really at this point I do want him
to go all the way because now it's just
funny and I'm not going to stop laughing
no matter how how long this goes now
should I feel more
empathy because he's degraded normally
yes but he's made himself literally my
enemy and if my enemy is is mentally
degraded I'm going to laugh at that I'm
going to Mo him because he's my enemy
you you why don't you let Peter Navaro
out in jail and then we'll we'll talk
about me not mocking your brain
dead president how about that
but I'm G to mock the out of him
certainly as long as Peter Navaro was in
jail you know I think that's fair
game uh let's see what else uh and then
Joe Biden said uh he defended his uh his
ability to bring every everybody
together he said I said I'm going to be
president for everybody whether you live
in a red state or a green
State a red state or a green
State he's doing great this all happened
yesterday this one day of gaffs all
right but luckily the media is being
totally objective and covering it uh the
way they should for example the LA times
has a article headline says age matters
and I'm thinking there we go the LA
Times age matters this is about Biden
I'm thinking finally a little bit of
Sanity age
matters which is why Biden's age is his
superpower that's the rest of the title
age matters that's why that's why
Biden's age is the
superpower they really did that
the LA Times now I will remind you that
they cancelled me but I was happy to be
cancelled by the LA times because they
have the least credible news on this
Coast all right you need to talk about
Melle
Obama because V ramaswami thinks
Michelle Obama is GNA swoop in and take
the job of candidate and apparently
Glenn Beck has as a addicted it as well
now you might say to me Scott you're a
big VI ramas Swami
supporter and uh if he is so darn sure
that Michelle Obama's coming in uh
doesn't that persuade you that she's
coming
in
no not even a little bit not even the
slightest
amount I'm I'm with Carl Rove all the
way and I don't don't always agree with
Carl Rove but but Carl Ro says she hates
politics there's just no way it's going
to
happen and I say you would have seen a
lot of foreshadowing If This Were even a
possibility a lot of
foreshadowing you would have seen
something like a listening
tour right you know it would be Michelle
Obama saying you know uh our country is
very
divided uh I'm going to go on a
listening
just to see what people think you know
maybe that'll help and then I would say
yeah maybe she's
preparing or you would hear somebody say
uh yeah we saw a meeting of all these
advisers and they met with her then I
would say well we don't know what she
will say but they're they're pushing for
it there is no evidence whatsoever that
Michelle Obama is going to be a
candidate so I'm going to go hard now
hard now uh let's see your opinions give
me your opinions how many of you are yes
or no on um Michelle Obama running for
president on this election
cycle yeah she has no reason to
right yep yep all right so we can
disagree on that but um you know I guess
I I really do have the Carl Ro opinion
that it seems so
Preposterous that I can't even talk
about it like I feel it's like a waste
of energy to even like talk about it
because it's so
imaginary however now that I've put
myself all in the line and if if I'm
wrong about
this I'd be amazed I would say my level
of certainty about her not running is
it's the highest for any prediction I've
ever
made it's the highest level of
certainty for what that's worth yeah
this is not a coin flip for me for me
this is
99.9% likely she's not
running all right uh meanwhile after the
Border bill got shot down because it was
a complete garbage and our government
seems to not be working at all uh
there's a new Senate bill that got voted
67 to 32 in favor of advancing it so
it's not pass they're just advancing it
a 95 billion doll foreign a package for
Ukraine Israel Gaza and
Taiwan
seriously we're going to give money to
four countries that are not the United
States in the middle of a
Invasion how does that make
sense how does that make sense and
apparently Republicans uh also voted for
it not big numbers but quite a
few uh I don't trust any I don't trust
any Republican who voted for this I I I
would have to assume something else is
going on with
them so I looked at the list a as a
citizen I feel like I needed to know the
names on the list that voted for it I
don't do that I do not do that usually
you'll hear like you know one dissident
or something oh Romney didn't vote for
it but this time I actually spent time
trying to memorize all the names on the
list the
Republicans because I feel like I need
to know that whoever voted for this is
not on my team I don't know what team
they're on but you need to know their
names so learn their
names for good
reason um and Taiwan what the hell are
we doing for Taiwan are you telling me
Taiwan doesn't have enough
money
I thought Taiwan was doing okay they're
run out of money they need our money
that makes no
sense all right um how many of you
listened to the audio it was fascinating
of the Supreme Court slapping around the
state of Colorado who wants to take
Trump off the ballot because they say he
was involved in an Insurrection which
would disqualify him according to the
14th Amendment they
say but the Supreme Court seemed to have
the opinion
that
um he not participating in the
Insurrection which didn't actually
happen in
reality um you know might not be enough
to to get to get up in trouble here uh
so I feel
like uh let's see
oh if you listen to the judges asking
the questions of the Colorado people
uh I finally got some of my faith back
in the United States and especially when
I was hearing the liberal
justices uh just hammering on these
Colorado
lawyers
and they were just purely on the
Constitution so here's what I thought I
might hear because I I haven't listened
to a lot of Supreme Court conversations
but we know that the rulings often come
down pretty close to party lines you
know the Liberals go one way and the the
others go another
way so I thought I was going to hear a
bunch of
bias I thought that when the liberal
justices were talking they would ask
questions that would suggest you know
they they wanted to go one way if they
could make it happen nothing like that
happened so judge uh you're going to
have to help me with the name katania
Jackson or I'll just say justice Jackson
um I tuned in when she was talking and I
didn't know much about her but boy do I
have more respect for after listening to
her um talking to the lawyers I thought
she was really sharp on target
completely compatible with the
Constitution seemed to be right where I
wanted it to be so I'll tell you again
I've said this a number of times the
only thing protecting the United States
from collapse is that the Supreme Court
still has some
credibility and I thought that it was
improved yesterday I thought the Supreme
Court looked a little bit better
yesterday and uh that made me feel good
now we we don't have the ruling yet
right when is the ruling
coming ruling will
come um
soon so we we think it'll allow uh Trump
to stay on the the
ballot all right
um and then Trump says in his statement
about it he says uh every one of these
cases you see comes out of the White
House it comes out of Biden it's
election interference and it's really
sad you
know normally I would
say you know don't call everything
election
interference you know because you could
spread that to everything but I think
he's
right it does seem to me that there is a
White House
coordinated uh lawfare approach which
doesn't seem related to actual laws it
does seem like the intention is purely
to keep Trump off the ballot which I
would consider election
interference at this level so if it was
a little bit let let's say it was one
lawsuit or let's say it was one court
case and let's say it was pretty solid I
wouldn't call that election interference
but if you have this you know full core
press every possible legal thing you can
do and you're you can be pretty
confident that it's coordinated by the
White
House to me that looks full
Rico I mean it's not just election
interference is organized election
interference so this is the very crime
that they're accusing Trump of
insurrection to me this looks like an
Insurrection looks like election
interference yeah and I would suggest
that
um that no matter what happens just
claim that you don't remember that seems
to
work now the big the big question about
the uh court case is who decides when an
Insurrection has
occurred who gets to decide an
Insurrection occurred because there's no
ruling that an Insurrection occurred
which is why it's smart that uh the
Republican members are like G is leading
some members of the house to do a
resolution saying it wasn't a
Insurrection and I think that's good
because if you have no Court ruling that
says it is one but you have members of
Congress doing a resolution that says
it's not
one that's a pretty strong frame all
right ladies and
gentlemen I told you I was going to talk
about
Israel's uh persuasion apparently they
have a new Logan over there total
Victory so total Victory is and they're
putting it on hats and apparently the
hats are just being really popular and
president Netanyahu um no president what
is Netanyahu prime minister Nan yahu um
is using
it and uses a lot so he's repeating it
every time he goes now what do you think
of that as a
persuasive SL Logan or branding of their
efforts in Gaza do you think that's
strong or weak total
Victory sound sounds sort of ordinary
right when you first hear it it's like
well everybody says that right doesn't
everybody want to win total Victory but
it's more than that it's more than
that and here's why the the biggest
challenge that nanan yahu has is
everybody who's not Israel saying hey
hey why don't you negotiate a little bit
what why why don't you do a little
ceasefire you know maybe trade some
prisoners stuff like that and there's a
lot to say no
to if you're Netanyahu and you want to
really really completely defeat Hamas
which is what he wants to do you don't
want to be arguing every little
point you want to just say no total
Victory CU you know what we all know
what that looks like let me give you a
test um do you think that it will end
with Hamas back in power in some limited
way no that would not be total Victory
do you think it'll end with some armed
Hamas people still in the tunnels who
could then emerge and maybe reform their
movement no as long as there's even one
of them left in a tunnel they don't have
total
Victory so so the beauty of the frame is
that it's so clarifying you know what
does it look like does it look like um
you know Hamas wins anything do do they
get anything after this no no the answer
is nothing total Victory total Victory
what about um would Hamas control the
education system or let's say people who
changed their name from Hamas and said
oh I'm not Hamas anymore now I'm just
something else uh but I'll be in charge
of your school system and we'll train
the kids to have the same attitude we
had nope that would not be total victory
that would look like losing to me so I
think total victory has not only some
call backs to Winston Church Hill so it
might remind you of that that would be a
good you know a good uh comparison but I
think it clarifies that they're not
going to talk about the
details Israel is going to have total
Victory as they Define it and if you
have any questions
whatsoever if it's a gray area no they
want that
too there's no gray area if it's not
total Victory you know exactly what that
looks like and you know what total
Victory looks like so you could argue
you know should they go for it or not
but in terms of persuasion the uh I
think the framing is perfect so that's
exactly what I would have done in that
situation now suppose you say but Scott
is it really a negotiating
position it could end up that way but it
would be the best negotiating position
you could ever have no total Victory
that's my position nope nope nope total
Victory so I think it's pretty strong
and I think you're going to see more of
it um and that ladies and gentlemen
concludes my show for the
day I think you're all smarter and
happier um I and I
I literally recommend watching MSNBC
today for the humor is absolutely
hilarious watching them spin around with
all the latest news about Biden uh I
actually want Biden to last now I think
I said that
earlier it makes sense to replace him if
I were a Democrat I'd replace him as
soon as possible if they can um
but I really hope they don't I I would
like him to actually be the person that
Trump faces and then if they try to rig
the election
hypothetically it's going to be really
obvious it's gonna be really
obvious all right uh that's all I got
for today thanks for joining on the
xplatform and Rumble and
YouTube uh go forth and have a great day
today and a great weekend and I will see
the locals people on the man
tonight the rest of you I'll see
tomorrow morning thanks for
joining
