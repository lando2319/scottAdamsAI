one of them it's it's laundry day
but if you'd like to take your
experience up to the maximum and you're
gonna need it for today oh boy do i have
content for you today oh oh boy
and
all you need is a copper mug or a glass
of tanker chalice or stein a canteen

with your favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
it's the dopamine of the day
you might need some serotonin too no
that's been debunked sorry
and uh join me now for the
simultaneous go
oh
i i just saw a uh
i just saw a meme on the locals platform
i've seen it before but
it always makes me laugh
do you know what the advantage of
right-wing
women is
if you're looking to date
what's the advantage of dating a right
woman a right wing woman this is this is
for youtube
people on locals already saw the
punchline
the advantage of a right wing woman
no penis
all right uh
apparently the uh what we thought was
what i thought i got fooled by fake news
but it's such good fake news i don't
even feel bad about it
if you're going to be fooled by fake
news
you want to be fooled by a really good
example of it and there was a good one
yesterday
did you see the alleged statement from
uh trump
and
he was calling himself herculean and
you said
there was a kevin sorbo uh and lou
ferrigno mentioned
apparently those were fake
did you know that those weren't real
but whoever did the fake wrote them so
well
that i actually thought it was trump and
i thought he was while he's really on a
roll
the
anyway the the fake one was every bit as
good as a real one
yeah like kevin sorbo
that was hilarious
i laughed for 10 minutes
i i don't even mind that i got fooled by
that
did anybody else get fooled by that and
then when you found out you were fooled
you're like oh that was a good one
so i i could be fooled by more of those
that was fine
did i mention uh brett stevens
uh
last time i can't remember if i did so
he wrote a piece i think it's the new
york times and
um he was saying that the
the anti-trumpers haven't really dealt
with the fact that the russia collusion
hoax was a hoax
and it started out by essentially
sort of an apology for his own role and
and now he can see that the
the russia collusion thing was purely a
hoax from the end and he thinks that we
have to deal with that more honestly
and deal with that as a hoax and i
thought my goodness
my goodness
here we really have some advantage
right because things are going well here
because here the new york times is
calling out
a hoax the russia collusion hoax and you
know it's an opinion piece but still
and then he closed his uh thing by
talking about trump destroying the
republic
on january 6.
and i thought to myself
apparently he's learned nothing
nothing at all
all he did was go from
the debunked hoax to the replacement
hoax
january 6 is literally the replacement
hoax for the russia collusion hoax that
fell apart
all he did was say yeah that old hoax
was a hoax
but i'm glad we have this new thing
and he actually embraced
the new hoax
like it was real
he was so close to being self-aware
and then it all went to hell
he couldn't tell the difference between
a hoax while he's in it
he could definitely tell the difference
between a hoax and reality
after the fact
after the fact
but when he's in it not so good not so
good
well there's a big study out saying that
depression is not caused by a chemical
imbalance of serotonin specifically
this news is half fake news and
maybe some of israel
here's the fake part
the headline said
depression is not caused by a chemical
imbalance
the detail of the study said
not that
right so the first thing you have to
know is that the headline
depression is not caused by a chemical
imbalance it has nothing to do with the
story
that's not
the story doesn't even involve that
the story is completely unrelated to the
actual study the study found one
chemical
serotonin which
experts believed was
somewhat critical in this process wasn't
uh wasn't important
so knowing that one chemical that we
thought was the main one is not the main
thing
does not mean
that it's not a chemical
chemical situation
am i right
so it's fake news about fake news
like the fake news is that serotonin was
part of it but then they fake news that
by turning it into all chemical i don't
think they've
that what they've certainly not done
what they've certainly not done is shown
that depression is not a chemical re
some kind of a chemical state
is serotonin something that can be
supplemented yes well
supplemented or
stimulated i don't know the right word
for that but yes that's what the
that's what some drugs do specifically
i believe yeah we are we are nothing but
a chemistry experience experiment so to
say that depression is not related to
our chemical state
feels like it couldn't possibly be true
granted there's one chemical we've ruled
out
but it's still just chemicals
you know what it'd be like it'd be like
you go to the beach
and you scoop up some sand
you say
well i've proven that there's no sand in
the beach because i've got this little
handful here
what about that other sand you might say
all right so
um this brings us to the question of as
as everything does
everything comes back to tom cruise and
top gun
if it doesn't come back to joe rogan
and it doesn't come back to
tom cruise and top gun we don't care
about it it's not important
but do you remember many of you remember
the famous
tom cruise thing where he was saying
that psychiatry is and
you know they're just
drugging us up with these unnecessary
drugs and everybody laughed at him
poor tom cruise
well
well not so funny now huh
not so funny now
because his claim that the the people
who were being drugged
um incorrectly
wasn't helping
appears to be
more correct than not correct
now here's the part that somebody said
but wait scott he's part of scientology
scientology doesn't have the answer
scientology isn't going to help your
depression is it
[Music]
are you sure about that
do you want would you debate me
on the
uh the value to the individual
of scientology
you better not
because i'm gonna win that debate
um scientology is a lot of things
and the criticisms about it you know the
lear remedy stuff i'm not talking about
that
so i'm not talking anything anything
about the organization and what it does
or does not require its
its people to do and what it does or
does not do for revenge you know that's
all been well addressed
so i'm not defending it or attacking on
those things
separate topic
but have you heard of this thing they do
called auditing
they hook you up to this little
you know galvanic
response thing and they ask you a bunch
of questions and allegedly you're gonna
find your
some kind of traumas that you had when
you were little and then you resolve
them
and then you're better
do you believe there's any science to
that
what do you think
do you think there's science to the
auditing process
yes and no
yes or no
it's basically hypnosis with a with a
device and the device
is what is convincing you with science
so the the point of the device
is to convince you that it's a
legitimate process
suppose it does
suppose you are convinced that it's
legitimate because people pay for it so
they must think it's legitimate they pay
for it
what would happen if you think it's
legitimate
and you pay for it
thus convincing yourself that it's you
know confirmation bias and everything
else so now you've talked yourself into
it working
and then the process says we found this
trauma and now we've removed it and
you're clear
and then this process which you believe
is true
but let's say it's not
just for discussion
what happens if you believe it's true
what if you believe it made you happier
you're happier
right there's no such thing as believing
you're happy and being wrong
if you believe you're happy yeah you're
happier
so can hypnosis convince convince you to
have a different level of happiness
yes
do you know how it does that
do you know how a hypnotist could make
you less sad more happy now not if you
have brain damage or is you have some
real organic problem i'm not talking
about the hard cases but edge cases
you know the people who are too tense
too anxious that sort of thing you know
they they're they're in the gray area
there they could be saved but
you know they just need a little help
believing it's going to work is about
half of the process
so if you walk into a scientology
auditing session believing it's going to
work
probably work
as far as you can tell and that's the
only thing that matters subjectively if
you walk out feeling better it worked
it's only trying to work on your brain
if it worked in your brain it works
so everything i know about hypnosis
strongly suggests
yeah it might be a placebo effect you're
right it strongly suggests that the
auditing
probably works
for some percentage of users i wouldn't
say 100
maybe 30
wouldn't that be amazing i don't know if
it's 30 that'd be my guess
my guess is that auditing works really
well
30 of people
just a guess
would you call that useful
well that would be better than a lot of
drugs thirty percent that'd be amazing
if you could make thirty percent happy
when they weren't on when they were
unhappy before
oh
that'd be amazing so it could be the
placebo effect but that's just hypnosis
right
it's just you know you just you
strengthen the placebo effect by
you know here's my machine here's my
science here's all the people who say it
works you know
social social uh endorsement
so
if you think that scientology doesn't
work
in terms of making the people who are
doing it happier
i think all the all the evidence is
against you
if you say that it's not based on actual
science i'd say oh well that's true
[Laughter]
doesn't mean it doesn't work
because actual science also includes
psychology right
if i can change your psychology
i fixed you so if you think you're happy
you're happy
all right so tom cruise continues to be
uh
national treasure times two or something
um
how about this
so uh i keep telling you to follow
a twitter account called machiavelli's
underbelly
just search for it on twitter you'll
find it
and
um this individual
uh behind that account
is uh
deeply into the ai space and tech space
and so he does a lot of a lot of tweets
of things that are basically your future
if you want to know what the future
looks like follow this account
because he's
he's maybe three years ahead of where
you are
in the actual technology
and three years out of where i am as
well you know i pay attention to it
so because he's deeply into it so one of
the things he's been doing is asking the
ai
uh i think it's gpt something right the
aai is using i think
um and one of the things that found was
that the ai knows the adam's 25 theory
a.i knows what the adam's 25 theory is
the idea that 25 percent of the public
gets every question wrong
different 25 percent i think
but roughly 25 percent of the public
will just get everything wrong no matter
how easy the question is
and it turns out that the ai knows that
when asked
what is the adams 25 theory
it actually explained it in detail
correctly
it didn't use my words
it explained it in detail in its own
words
with examples it added examples
it added its own examples
now
let me ask you this
does the ai now believe the 25
is something it should incorporate in
its thinking if you can call it thinking
did i program the ai accidentally
because can the ai tell that
i'm only a little bit serious about this
right
the 25 is just for fun
it might actually be true but that's not
really the point of it the point of it
is for fun
and
if i did this for fun how could the ai
know it's just for fun
will the ai start thinking that it
should take seriously
the 25
what if it does
how does the ai know what i'm kidding
more importantly
how credible does the ai think i am
and
i'm going to ask it i'm going to ask it
how credible am i
as a public figure
i don't know what it's going to say
and how would it know
could it just say i don't know i can't
do that
that's subjective
maybe or would it look at all the data
and say well you've got this stuff wrong
uh you got this stuff right
so
that's the problem
now suppose you asked it is uh you went
to the ai and said is it important to
have passion
for success
would it with the ai look at all the
billionaires who said yes you need
passion for success warren warren
buffett said zuckerberg uh
you know virgin ceo branson they all say
that
passion is necessary for success
but in my book
i had to fail at almost everything and
still went big i have a chapter in which
i say passion is
and that passion is something you get
after you're successful you can be
passionate about anything that works
right so which would the ai say if you
ask the ai
is passion necessary would it just give
you the two different opinions
or would it pick one
because with that 25 percent thing it
didn't really show the alternative
argument did it it just showed my
argument
there was no alternative argument
because you know it's just something i
made up it's not really an argument
so
what does the ai decide does the ai
decide that passion helps or doesn't
and would it believe me over those other
people given that i gave my reason why
the other people are not to be trusted
i said you can't trust billionaires
because they they're really protecting
their brand
they don't want you to think that they
think they're special
right it's just self-defense would the
ai know that the billionaires are lying
because they have a reason to lie it's
obvious why they're lying
because they want you to think that you
could be a billionaire too you just have
to get some passion
right they don't want to say well we are
smarter than you and we started with
some advantages
if they say that you're going to tax
their money away because they didn't
earn it
if they say they're amazing
then you let you get they get to keep
their money
no i did it because i'm amazing
i got passion you should do it too
you could be a billionaire get some
passion what does the ai make of that
argument well i asked uh
panda express
to well actually i asked publicly
to find out if uh
the
ai could determine
what things are already hoaxes
in politics
and panda express weighed in here and
asked the ai
to list the main hoaxes recently
and here are the things that ai thinks
are hoaxes
the 2016 presidential election
ai believes as a hoax
because there might have been some
russian interference
it thinks the election was a hoax
it also thinks pizzagate is a hoax okay
you think seth rich um conspiracy
theories are a hoax
you might not agree but ai thinks it's a
hoax so do i
uh russia collusion got that one it got
the russia collusion hoax correct
why did it get the russia collusion hoax
correct
could it be that brett stephens
called it a hoax in the new york times
and the ai thought that the new york
times
is sort of the you know the stamp of
reality
and so i said well if the new york times
calls the russia collusion thing a hoax
i guess we can call it a hoax
is that what it did i'm not saying it
did i'm asking how does it come to this
opinion who did it trust it also said
the ukraine phone call
was a hoax
so it's got
two things that are pro-trump
agreeing that russia collusion and the
ukraine phone call
was a hoax and three things that would
be you know more supportive of the
democrat view of what is oaks but it
only listed one two three five things
if if i gave the ai
my
my list of 10 hoaxes
which includes some of these but not all
of them
would the ai say oh there's a good list
of hoaxes
i will adopt that in my thinking
it might
but it also might be getting specific
about what it what it means by hoax
because people like me we use it sort of
generically as something that is not
true and you knew it
i don't know if that's always a hoax
so here's a question that i want to oh
and then i asked
i asked
panda express
it's a twitter account you should be
following panda express too
uh i asked it if the ai thinks that the
fine people hoax is a hoax
and the ai
called
of the fine people hoax in other words
they'd agreed it's a hoax
they i the ai explained very carefully
that trump was specifically
denouncing the neo-nazis and did not
call them fine people
the a.i debunked the fine people hoax
now let's see what it can do with the
drinking bleach oaks
do you think you can get the drinking
bleach oaks because the ai will should
be able to find the news story about the
light therapy
that trump was talking about you should
be able to look at his exact words from
the transcript
and it should be able to match his words
of light as a disinfectant
to an actual technology that was
happening and being tested at the time
it should be able to call that out as a
hoax
now do you think that um do you think
that the ai would know the fine people
hoax was a hoax
if i did not exist
true question
i want a serious answer this if i did
not exist
would the ai know that the um
the fine people thing was a hoax
i'm seeing no's and yeses now you do
know that there are other people who
fought very hard to overcome that hoax
right steve cortez
just did amazing amount of work created
videos debunking that thing
joel pollock
also a lot of work debunking it you know
tirelessly so we all did things
but i might have been first
and i might have made it
a little easier for the others
i don't know the answer this but
i think i might have done that
maybe
don't know
and
what if it was an ai creation
give you some credit okay you can all
have some credit too
so then i want to ask you this
are systems better than goals
what will ai say will ai say the systems
are better than goals
and if it does
where did it get that
for me
for me
if you ask the ai is it good to have a
talent stack
versus you know just being good at one
thing
what's it gonna say
i think it will agree with me
right
if you ask ai what's a good way to sort
of
you know get
to
um
to solve couch lock you know where you
just can't get moving
and it says well just do something small
and see if you can build momentum
where would that come from
well lots of people but partly me
so
here's a problem
what happens if ai is getting this
information from
people like me
is it really a.i
and how does it know i'm credible
because what if the ai says well let's
say you asked the question
all right ai
is scott adams a credible public figure
doesn't mean i'm right about everything
nobody's right about everything that's
for sure
but am i credible like am i saying
things that i believe to be true and
often have some backing
what would it say well the first thing
you do is check its own knowledge
wouldn't it
it would ask how many things do i
believe are true
because i heard them from this
cartoonist guy
and it's going to be some major stuff
right
if it knows the systems are better than
goals and and talent stacks are good and
passion is
and you know half a dozen other things
that i've been teaching you
uh
i think the ai is just me
and i'm
i'm kind of serious about this
the ai is going to take his cue from
some people more than others
how do you stop that from happening
let me let me say this
will ai favor clear writing
i think it will
i don't know that
but i think it will
i'm an unusually clear communicator
i'll make that a statement for
argument's sake will you do you buy that
that just in terms of communication
skill i'm professional grade right i do
it professionally
so if i do it professionally
would the ai recognize that my writing
is clear
and have any kind of a preference for it
because it's clear
i know
maybe
but that's a problem isn't it
because then you're then i'm programming
your ai
how many things do you think i've
influenced in the real world
forget about ai for a moment
see if you can list this you're going to
get a different
different answers on the locals platform
they know me a little bit better
but
how many major
topics in the news do you think i had a
substantial impact on
do you think i had an impact on trump's
original election
do you think i had an impact on
the way we see persuasion
versus facts
two movies on one screen
do you think i had an impact on let's
say nuclear energy
or climate change
or
all right what are what are some things
you suspect i influenced but you're not
sure oh this will be fun
what are some things in the headlines
that you suspect i influence because
there are things you don't know about
and they're pretty big
and you probably never know about them
uh
immigration no
no telemedicine yes the reason that you
can do telemedicine across state lines
is me
i made that happen
i mean trump did the executive order but
it was on my suggestion
yeah my favorite topic is me right
fentanyl i don't know that i had an
impact on fentanyl except maybe raising
raising some
uh awareness
the usage of the word hoax
maybe so i think i think cernovich was
more influential on using the word hoax
mia's old movie called hoax
rogue doctors china decoupling do you
think i had an influence on decoupling
of china
or was it just going to happen
do you think i had an influence on
closing travel to china initially
does anybody think i had an impact on
closing travel to china originally when
trump closed trump travel
it's hard to know
um
let me tell you what i know
you literally wouldn't believe
you literally wouldn't believe it
someday you might know
but a lot of people are gonna have to
die first and i think i would die before
you find out
all right
well i would worry about ai getting us
uh getting its knowledge from me
um
so look out for that
um
did you see the lee lee zelda lee zeldin
attacked on stage
so zeldan is a candidate for
governor republican candidate for
governor in new york right
and he was i'll say attacked but some
disturbed looking person got on stage
and got his hands on him
allegedly he had a knife
but it must have been the tiniest little
knife because it was like internal to
his fist
it wasn't a knife was it
somebody's had a knife but
it just looked like he had a closed fist
that did oh somebody says a razor
it was a
uh brass no i don't know who knows he
may or may not have had something in his
hand
but i would just like to call out uh
so lee zeldin
um
lee zeldan did not look even a little
bit bothered by being attacked on stage
did you see that
you know he he continued talking
giving his speech as the guy comes right
up to him the guy puts his his hands on
him and starts like you and lee just
grabs the guy's arm you know to protect
himself from whatever he had in his hand
and next next thing you know everybody's
climbing on and pulling pulling zeldan
off
but did you see how completely unfazed
he was
talk about somebody you want to have
when uh in a pressure situation
my god
oh is the ex-military is that you
somebody said ex-military is that true
um somebody says so yeah
well that would make sense i mean
yeah okay ex-military there you go
combat veteran
because you know what it looked like um
uh
army reserve okay
you know what it looked like
it looked like he thought he could take
that guy any moment
it looked like he thought he could just
kill him if he needed to like he looked
just not worried
it was a damn this thing
yeah
oh well
we'll see
um
you do that you freeze up no bravery
i it didn't look like he froze up
didn't look like he froze up at all
not all military could pull that off i
noticed on some ex-military yeah not all
military could pull that off that's true
but it's certainly got to help
is that a picture of the actual knife
now
it grabbed his wrist
all right well
anyway good for him but it's more
more republicans being hunted
is anybody doubting my uh
what would the ai say
if you ask the ai are republicans being
hunted what would you say
let's ask it
are republicans being
you might say targeted or something so
that because haunted is hyperbolic
but i'd be interested
i'd be interested
um
did you see the video of josh hawley a
quote fleeing the capitol
have you seen those
they're really hilarious
because
there's no real there's no useful
context to it
we just know that being in the capitol
was a bad idea so if he was walking
really fast to get out of it but but
he's sort of scurrying
and so they call it fleeing
i just love how they
say he's fleeing
so he got people riled up and then he
fleed
or fled
anyway i don't know israeli's story that
youtube is asking if i'm high
unfortunately no
i'm not
this is my actual personality
i know shocking
yeah scurry is a fun word
skedaddle
he's skedaddled
there's no story to it it's just that
it's funny that he he walked fast
leaving so it looks like he was fleeing
he was fleeing but it's just funny
um here's something i didn't know did
you know that uh pence staged a
coup
on january 6
according to washington
now i i heard somebody i saw on twitter
the accuracy of the reporting which is
fair
but according to the washington post uh
pence overthrew the country and he was
giving orders to the military and the
military was following him on january 6.
now i don't think that happened
right
[Laughter]
anyway so yeah maybe maybe pence over
through the country
one of the things we're hearing is that
uh trump didn't didn't care about the
safety of pence
under the situation that pence wasn't
doing what trump wanted apparently
what do you think of that do you think
that's a fair characterization
that trump wasn't worried about
the safety of pence
because he didn't do anything about it
now is there anybody else's safety
that trump uh we have on record
in which he wasn't worried about that
person's safety who would that be
and there was one other person that
trump named that he wasn't worried about
now we don't have to read his mind
because he said it out loud
himself
can i add a in the middle that
him self
how about a little context please
trump wasn't worried about his own
physical safety why
why
well he said they weren't there to hurt
him that's one thing but why is the
other reason
probably because he thought it was
important
and that his physical safety wasn't the
main criteria to worry about at that
moment
maybe don't know
we don't know what he was thinking right
this would be mind reading but maybe
trump was thinking that putting
pence at risk was the right play
given that he believed the election was
stolen was he wrong
well his assumption might have been
wrong about the election
but if you believe he was right about
the election and he thought he was right
and it was obvious and you know soon
everybody would know he's right under
those assumptions which have not been
validated
under those assumptions putting a little
bit of risk physical risk on pence
to get him to maybe do the right thing
wasn't the wrong play
it might be the wrong assumption
that the election was rigged might be
but it wasn't the wrong play to say that
both the president and the vice
president should take on some physical
risk
just like the protesters were
we do live in a country
where around and find out is our
operating system
am i wrong
that that's basically the entire
constant constitution in one sentence
is one one sentence
 around and find out that's the
whole constitution we just you know
formalized it basically
so
in a situation in which and dinesh this
is asked this question perfectly today
you said
he said the only relevant question
regarding january 6
is how are
how are people supposed to behave
when they're convinced the election was
stolen
what is the reasonable contact under
those circumstances
that's a good question
how should you act if you're sure the
election was stolen you might be wrong
but how should you act
calm
i don't know
but i had to criticize dinesh over this
even though i i love the question
it is definitely a relevant question
how are you supposed to act if you
genuinely believe the election was
rigged
how are you supposed to act what would
be the ideal way for a patriot to act
under those situations
the january sex event that's how
yeah again not condoning violence
not condoning violence
but a protest yeah
yeah
surround the capitol and shut it down
stop the process yup yeah that's exactly
how you should act
if you believe
the republic is in danger
if you're wrong
i think you have to fess up to it you
know you gotta you gotta face the music
unfortunately you have to
but yeah that's how you should act but
here's my problem with dinesh's
opening sentence he says the only
relevant question is how are people
supposed to act
that's really close
the relevant question is what did they
believe at the time
and we're not we're not really dealing
with that in the way we should
the january 6 thing has not shown any
evidence that trump believed he lost
none
no evidence that the closest they came
is if they can convince you that the
word find
means something different than it has
always mean in the english language
until trump used it that day
that's it
that's it
that we have to define a word to mean
what it doesn't work
mean in any other context
that's it
so
if we if we walk past the real question
to the sale
you know dinesh's question how are we
supposed to act is already thinking past
the sale
the sale is what did they believe
you got to go back to the first question
what did they believe
and every bit of evidence every bit of
evidence suggests that everybody
involved
believes that the election was sketchy
we now know that democrats are coming to
that opinion in large numbers the number
of democrats who believe elections are
now credible and
reliable
is way down
from a year ago
and the january 6 thing is probably part
of that that's my guess
it's it's lowering everybody's
understanding of the safety of the
election
all right um adam kingsinger who you
know is i guess you would call him a
rhino
he's a republican but you don't think
he's republican enough and he's on this
january 6 committee because uh he's so
not republican the democrats were happy
to have him
but he tells the story of being a hunker
down in his office during the january 6
protest afraid that the protesters would
get to him and apparently they had
threatened to kill him you know on
twitter and other places so he he had a
real reason to be worried
so apparently he had a a weapon
now he's ex-military
so when ex-military has a legal firearm
the first thing i say is oh that's
exactly who i want to have a legal
firearm ex-military
but
there is a thing called a red flag law i
don't know if it applies
does dc have a red flag law
for
guns
can somebody give me a quote fact check
on that
if the red flag law meaning that if
somebody owns a gun or tries to get one
and they have obvious some mental issues
that you uh
there's no guns
all right so here's the question
do you think that adam kinsenger should
be allowed to own a firearm
if you're a second amendment absolutist
then yes
so the question is i guess i should
change the question
let me alter the question because the
pro-gun people are just going to say yes
and that's the end of the conversation
which is fine by the way
if your if your opinion is yes absolute
i respect that i mean there's some
problems
that's not a clean solution
clearly
but i can respect it i might not agree
with it
completely
but i respect that a bit
um
i just want to point out that if there's
somebody who has a mental disability
it's adam kinziger
meaning that if the red flag laws are
designed for a citizen to say
i'm just a citizen i'm no doctor
but you know my friend or my relative is
acting in a way that you need to take a
look at this
that's what i'm going to call out for
adam kinziger
i'm just a friend or a relative
he doesn't look stable
am i wrong
again we're not experts we can't we
can't diagnose his mental health we're
not doing that so this is not a
diagnosis i'm telling you my impression
if i saw that somebody like him owned a
firearm
i would start to think red flag
seriously that's not a joke
he when he talks he looks mentally
disturbed to me
to me he looks mentally disturbed
now that could be a result of his
service
right i can't imagine you could go
through
did he go through combat i think he did
i can't imagine that you could go
through combat and come out okay i mean
i'm sure i wouldn't you know i feel i'm
pretty mentally strong you know compared
to say the average but i don't think i
could go through combat
like i know myself well enough that i
wouldn't i wouldn't be the same person
on the other side of that
so why do we assume other people do
add the small man complex you mean
kinzinger or me who are you talking
about
all right um are you sure you're not
looking in the mirror
no i'm not i'm not sure that that that's
always the
you know the the larger context for
everything i do
is when you ask me if i'm sure i'm not
the one who's suffering confirmation
bias my answer should always be no
i'm not sure that and when people say to
you to me scott
you're accusing somebody of cognitive
dissonance
how do you know you're not the one with
cognitive dissonance and my answer
should be if i'm being honest i don't
i don't
the the only thing i know for sure
sometimes
is that one person has a trigger and the
other one doesn't
you know a trigger might tell you who
has the cognitive dissonance but it's
hard to tell otherwise
eugene sledge said anyone that's over
100 yards away from the front can't
understand combat
that sounds right
combat messes you up unless you're a
psychopath
yeah i guess that would be a plus
wouldn't it
all right
um
let's see what else is happening oh
apparently nothing
so we've uh
gotten to the end here and uh so joe
biden has coveted
i don't know that there's much to say
about that
um
yeah
that
i i think we should quit the uh
pete bootaj
uh is gay jokes
i'm not sure that's worth a meme
know we're free speech over on on the uh
on the locals platform so you're not
you're not gonna get booted off for
uh like a distasteful joke but
can't we find something else to make fun
of
i mean do we do we really have to make
fun of pete buddha judge for being
rear-ended
and you know ha ha
he's gay he got rear-ended
i mean if it were funny maybe i'd i'd be
a little more in favor of it just
because it's funny but it isn't really
funny
i mean it's not really
i mean it's sort of an interesting
simulation thing that his last name can
be you know turned into something funny
but
it's not really funny that he's gay
you're trying to make his gayness a
punchline that's not a punchline
i did chuckle yeah i did chuckle at it
but really
i think we could do better than that
all right
um
uh used a spiked handheld metal weapon
not exactly a knife more like a small
spiked
knuckle weapon
okay
yeah it looked like the guy on the stage
was just mentally
incompetent right
i think that's what was going on
uh so who do we what happens if uh
joe leaves office early
let's let's play this through
let's say bye to leave's office and
kamala takes the top spot
who is vice president then does she get
to appoint one how does that work
do you get to a point of vice president
because that feels like the very least a
democratic thing you could possibly do
and who would she appoint
so i don't think it's so it's a problem
if she appointed newsom
the trouble is that newsome um
wants to be president and i'll bet she
does too
imagine if she served for two years you
don't think she'd run
so she can't really have a vice
president
who is stronger than she is for
president
right
so kamal harris would have to find
somebody who's weaker than her
in case two years of her being president
works out and she wants to run she
probably does
i don't think she can bring in somebody
stronger than her i don't think she can
bring in
you know pelosi or clinton they're just
they'll just draw too much fire
i think you want your vice president to
be not the story the last thing that
kamala harris would do is bring in the
vice president who becomes the main
story
that's not going to happen
no way that's going to happen
so it's got to be somebody like somebody
like swalwell
who who
you know he's not going to run for
president and get very far yeah somebody
like that pence
somebody says pence
pence would be a good vice president
so
if she has to pick somebody weak
that gives us the very real possibility
that we end up with that weak president
because kamal harris you know the reason
we have vice presidents is you need a
spare and although caballeros seems
young and healthy
anything could happen
and we'd end up with yeah yeah jesse
smalley as
vice president
um
i think newsome is way more of a risk to
be trump than you do what do you think
newsom versus trump straight up for
president who wins
who wins
yeah i think it's a toss-up newsome
could beat him
he could
newsen could beat him
i hate to say it
yeah it doesn't matter what the
it doesn't matter at all what the polls
say today once it becomes a democrat
versus a republican
it once again it becomes
anybody but trump
newsom just has to be anybody but trump
that's all it takes it just has to be
anybody but trump it worked the last
time it'll work again
and imagine somebody who's anybody but
trump but not mentally incompetent
right no matter what you say of him he
is capable he's capable
he can't take that away from him he's
capable
i think he could win
i think he could
does anybody agree with me do i have
anybody who agrees with me okay i do
have some agreements because all you
have to do is get the democrats on the
same side
newsome has one job
one job
to get democrats all voting on the same
side
i think that's easy governor of
california
you know more progressive
but also you know reasonably
you know not crazy
i don't know i think he gets all the
democrats
and then that's all you need there are
more democrats than republicans that's
all you need
and there'll still be people who say you
know
at least he looks sane you know i don't
like this trump guy so i'm going to go
for a democrat at least he's not crazy
because there are a lot of people who
didn't maybe love trump
but there was no way they were going to
vote for hillary clinton
you know newsome has his own you know
critics
but correct me if i'm wrong
let's do this on a scale of one to ten
a scale of one to ten republicans would
dislike hillary clinton
ten
so far are you with me
that that nobody would be hated more
than her probably she's probably a ten
what would newsome be on the same scale
of one to ten
it's more like you don't prefer him
isn't it
it's different
newsome is just somebody you don't
prefer
hillary is somebody you want to have a
terrible accident
i take that back you don't want that
you don't want anybody to be hurt but
the point is that people have a much
worse opinion of hillary
than they do of newsome
i think newsom is
unfortunately likeable enough
that he would just get all the anything
but trump vote i think
uh speculating on an election that's 30
months away gee have i ever done that
successfully
have i ever speculated on an election
that was two years away and
did okay
i wonder
all right
ask the ai
s the ai who has the best predictions it
knows it knows
it knows
all right
s the ai who's the most influential
person in the country who's not
elected i dare you
i dare you
esther ask the ai who's the most
influential person in the country who's
not elected it won't be me
yeah it'll be somebody like musk or joe
rogan or something maybe tucker yeah
but ask it that question see what
happens
all right
that is all for today i'm going to turn
off the youtube feed and spotify
thanks for
joining you're always awesome
bye for now
