[Applause]
well well well welcome to the day after
halloween
and i hope you're just as happy as i am
because i'm pretty happy
and
good news good news
you made it to the simultaneous sip
anybody listening to this live
you're on time
and that means you're going to get to
participate in one of the best things
humans have ever done
in the history of humans
and it goes back a little bit further
than that because there were the
ape-like predecessors to the humans and
according to every science i looked at
they also enjoyed the simultaneous sip
it's true it's science and if you'd like
to enjoy it now all you need is a cup or
a margarita glass of tanker chelsea's
tiny canteen jugger flask a vessel of
any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
have i mentioned i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine of the day
the thing that makes everything better
especially
what that's right antibodies here they
come antibodies they need caffeine too
ah
yeah antibodies
all right well um i'd like to see a
report from each of you in the comments
on how your halloween went in terms of
number of trick-or-treaters
uh i've heard that some places were much
higher than normal or at least higher
than recent years
mine was down maybe 80 percent how about
yours
a lot of people saying zero and none wow
uh ran out of candy
yeah it looks like it was all over the
place in some places it was tripled i'm
saying
some places it was tripled some places
you could barely move the street was so
full of people
and in other places a dud yeah i get a
dug
so i was all ready
all prepared
and we got a bunch of kids now here
here's a little mystery for you
i don't know what it means and
this is not a
a negative racial comment
so if you think it is
don't think that
so i'm gonna make a
uh an observation that is not negative
it's just an observation i don't know
what to make of it
that my
the number of people who came to my
house for trick-or-treat was down
probably 80
from normal but the composition of the
kids
was overwhelmingly indian-american and
asian-american
now i live you know near silicon valley
it's a high-tech place we've got a
pretty big population of both indian
american and
um asian americans
but
it was crazy like the the ratio of that
or those two demographic groups
um and i don't know what it means i mean
i don't have a i don't have a theory
about
why that should be
but it happened i don't know
um
in other news
uh raspberry is reporting that 57 of
likely u.s voters think
that biden is a weaker
commander-in-chief than trump
57
think biden is a weaker
commander-in-chief than trump
now let me ask you this
how many of you are surprised by that
is that the least surprising thing
you've ever heard
pretty unsurprising
i i don't think that
people quite appreciate
the having a commander-in-chief who
looks like a wounded
elk
you know basically
if you're if your top person of your
military
looks like you can't find the car keys
it doesn't make you afraid of the
military i mean it should because the
military is still gonna be lethal
but
57
are already in favor of trump as a
strong group commander in chief and
apparently that's that's changed from 43
in may
that's a lot
so um can we say with some certainty
that the biden administration um is a
failed administration is it too soon
now i think a lot will depend on whether
biden can get any big legislation
through you know any trillion dollar
spending bills
but i'm gonna bet against that
i'm gonna still bet against it
um
i don't think anything's gonna get
passed in the over a trillion range but
yeah i could be wrong
but we'll see so i think that biden will
have no domestic success he will look
like a weak commander-in-chief
he will look barely functional
the border's a mess
ah
it's gonna look bad
all right so i see all of your prompting
and i know you want me to talk about a
rumor
that president biden had a uh let's say
a
bowel related accident on his european
trip
now
here's my take
maybe it happened maybe it didn't
it's not going to be my topic
okay i want to say it as clearly as
possible so you stop asking i'm not
going to talk about that
i i i just don't like that topic
yeah it's it's not entertaining it's not
a way to start the day
and uh it's it's probably untrue and if
it is true it's his business
you know i i'm happy to
criticize biden for his his cognitive
problems because that matters and i'm
happy to criticize him for his policies
and blah blah blah
but that's really just a
private health issue
that's a little too far
right
i just don't think that's our business i
don't think it's cool
and if it happened to happen if it
didn't it didn't i mean it's a certain
age
you know if you're going to accept that
you have a president that age
you got to accept the whole package
right
if if we've said we'll take a president
who's
this age
don't don't act like it's a news story
if he has health issues that are exactly
what people have at that age
let's not make that a thing
anyway i know it's fun and you enjoy it
but it's not my thing so i'm not going
to do it
christina my wife had an interesting
experience in one of the local starbucks
she got her product and sat down with
her sister
and
was asked for her asked for her papers
in
america she was asked to show her
vaccine card she didn't have it with her
i think she's misplaced it
and by the way if you misplace your
vaccine card
i don't know what you do about that
do you can anybody tell me what happens
if you lose your vaccine card
because i don't think there's a process
for getting it back is it if you lose it
are you not shut out from
society
uh oh it was a at starbucks it was the
server-esque
cvs has a record
if you've got it there
you can get a digital one
yeah she's got pictures of it but i
don't know if they suffice
i don't i'm not sure a digital one even
even works does it
yeah
i don't know
but uh i i've heard that other starbucks
are not requiring this so it might be a
local thing i can easily imagine that
they have an employee who's unvaccinated
or something so
you know maybe there's something special
about that one
now they don't require a vaccination to
buy things
just to be clear
apparently you can go stand in line and
buy things without proving you're
vaccinated i think you have to be
vaccinated
and wear a mask
but i don't think you have to prove it
just to buy stuff
all right
well that's pretty shocking and terrible
um i saw something in a comment on
locals just before i got on
that i'm gonna steal the joke and extend
it okay so there's a meme i saw and i
liked it so much
that i wanted to borrow it and modify it
a little bit
it goes like this i didn't tweet it
but if you want to tweet it
you'll have to race to see who could be
first
i said you could use scrabble tiles and
 something more coherent than a
biden press conference
i i just like that
you could use scrabble tiles and
something more coherent than a biden
press conference
it's not bad not bad
and thank you for the meme that inspired
it
um
you all want me to talk about the story
about the southwest pilot who on his
announcement said let's go brandon a
joke obviously
uh but it was since there was a
political joke there was some blow back
on the pilot i don't forget what it was
the exact blowback whatever it was was
wrong
uh and but here's the story the story
after the story is
is just it's jaw-dropping
all right this is jaw-dropping
a a current analyst for cnn one you've
probably seen
named asha rangapa i hope i'm saying
that right
she tweeted that uh as an experiment
uh and apparently the pilot kept his job
but as an experiment i'd love for a
southwest air pilot to say
long live isis before taking off
my guess is that number one the plane
the plane would be immediately grounded
number two the pilot fired
and three a statement issued by the
airline with a mat within a matter of
hours
as ted cruz who seems to be much smarter
than
asha
tweeted in reply
you just compared a pilot making a joke
to isis
really
a pilot making a joke
pretty much the same as an international
terror group
what the hell is wrong with her
what the hell
is wrong with her
now it's one one thing just to say the
analogy is crap but
to even have a thought like that
how do you have a thought like that
exactly somebody this there's a a cnn
analyst
who literally thought that other people
would think that sounded reasonable you
know at least reasonable as social media
you know social media is never
reasonable per se but within the social
media media reasonableness
to compare a trump supporter
to a member of isis
or a supporter of isis
a cnn reporter tweeted this just like
this is something we'd all agree with
well that's true
yeah yeah i see your point i see your
point trump supporters isis very similar
situation there
i don't even know what to say about this
this is like
shocking
because i don't even recognize what this
is
it's not
is it cognitive dissonance
confirmation bias
i mean this seems so extreme that
it looks like a prank more than a
mental condition i don't know what to
think of this honestly i can't i can't
even figure out how to interpret it
is it a is it an intentional lie
or does she really think
that
a political joke about a president on an
airplane
is pretty similar to supporting isis
really right uh here's an observation
that nobody had made yet and
i i feel it was my responsibility to be
the first
and it's just one of these you know dog
not barking situations
you know um
oh you're welcome
um for pushing into a bit shoot
um
and i'll just say it
as far as i know uh
actor robert de niro
has never accidentally shot anyone
but don't you feel it's overdue
is it just me
now i don't know if it's just because uh
robert de niro is uh basically the poor
man's alec baldwin
so that joke could be reversed too
i like a joke that could be reversed and
it still works
yeah yeah robert de niro is the poor
man's alec baldwin
but i could have just as easily said
that alec baldwin alec baldwin is the
poor man's robert de niro
it works both ways
very rare
very rare that your joke can work in
both directions
i i don't have another comment on that
i will just tell you that when i first
heard the news about alec baldwin i
imagined robert de niro because i just
thought that was more likely
like i confused the two in my head and i
realized that maybe i've been confusing
in my head for a long time
they both seem like
you know
angry older actors with tds
who are
somehow similar
all right that's about it on that
um in permanent news
i like to give you the news that never
changes
in addition to the news that has changed
now you might say if it never changes is
it really news
well it's in the news if it's in the
news it must be news and you're not
going to believe this all right
i've told you a lot of shocking things
but
you know put on your seatbelt
this one's just going to blow you away
if you have any kind of a hat that has a
strap that you can put around your chin
put it on now because your head's gonna
come clean off when i tell you this hold
on hold on here it comes
there's a hollywood actor who uh
came out as gay
i i didn't see a comment
um it's a kai pen
um
yeah he came in as gay
wow
wow
and thank god
thank god our news industry is on it
because
i woke up this morning not knowing what
kind of genitalia he preferred
and
and
having that curiosity all day long and
then i pick up the news i'm like wow
this is a coincidence this is exactly
what i was wondering
uh kaipen
is his name
k-i-k-a-i kai pen
uh who's a delightful actor i like him a
lot
now the fact that he came out is gay uh
my point is
why is that still news
i realize he's famous
you know he's an actor
so you know we know who he is but
like why are we still treating that as
news really
you know maybe if like the president or
a senator came out as gay
that would have some meaning because
then you would look at their records on
voting and stuff
but if a hollywood actor comes out as
gay
why do we need to even know
like am i gonna like his movies more
it's like you know
i i didn't like his movies a lot but now
i know about the butt stuff i'm all in i
mean how is it even related to anything
you know i guess
i i guess the way this is uh hitting me
is very much the same way as when the
news reports the the first black
anything
right
doesn't that just feel offensive at this
point
like that is news that there's a
first black whatever whatever job
success
you know accomplishment
i mean i'm proud you know happy for the
person
but why is it a story that's the first
black person to do it
i mean really it's 2021.
i'm willing to stipulate that black
people can do stuff
oh it's cal pen not kai
oh yeah thank you for the
the correction kalpan
k-a-l
uh yeah if a black person was the first
uh black grand wizard it might be
newsworthy well there was a
wasn't there a uh rachel dolans was a
she was white and she was a leader in
the yes was it the spca or no the n and
double
not the spca
yeah
uh naacp
i know i'm going to get canceled for
that
i've been waiting to figure out what it
would what it would be that would take
me down
yeah because though you figure uh are
you surprised i haven't been canceled
yet
is anybody surprised i haven't been
cancelled yet
because i feel like the obvious one to
be canceled right
i don't know how it could be more
obvious that i should be on the list and
i know i'm on the list i mean they've
it's not like a bunch of journalists
haven't done hit pieces on me
and i feel like every now and then
somebody will take a run at me but it
hasn't been serious yet
like i feel like there have been warning
shots
and i feel like maybe i you know
i've had some brushes with it
but
i'm not exactly sure why i'm still here
i'm actually genuinely confused i can
come up with some speculation
i mean maybe because i try to play fair
but i don't think people notice that
the people who would cancel you wouldn't
care if you ever tried to play fair
i don't know
it's kind of a mystery
biden's spokesperson jen saki tested
positive for covent
as did uh and by the way
you know we could try to make a story
about how she maybe infected biden and
maybe he infected the pope
um
i like i like the movie idea
where somebody intentionally infects the
president
because the last booster shot was a fake
booster shot
and the last one was actually full of
virus
right before he did an international
trip
and there and the real play was to kill
the other world leaders
so you know they said in biden over
there and he's he's
you know full uh
spittle man
you know he's like getting up close to
people just spitting in their faces with
his covet
i mean this would be a good movie anyway
and then he shits his pants and dies
and that would just be a perfect ending
so
anyway jensaki tested positive and uh
also tim ferriss
tim ferriss just tested positive now tim
ferriss is you know young and super
healthy
and fully vaccinated at least two
vaccinations i guess
but i guess he's still having a little
trouble it sounded like just from an
instagram post that's all i know but it
looks like he said he was uh
uh
i don't i forget his exact words he said
he wasn't flattened by it but it's
it's not easy
that's what two vaccinations
and he still
still got some heavy symptoms
so here's uh here's my take on this
think of how many celebrities there are
in the world
how many celebrities are there in the
world
a lot right because sort of our pastime
and famous people as well politicians
are we about to enter a phase where
every single day there's a story about a
famous person who got covered
we are all right
the news is just going to be non-stop
famous person get scoved
famous person gets scoped again and
another famous person
got coveted
so you're going to see a lot of those
question
do you believe it is proven that natural
immunity is superior than vaccinated
immunity
go
in the comments
your understanding of the science
is natural immunity better than
vaccinations
including boosters
um
oh not sure for the individual now there
was a good answer
so there's somebody on locals who's
making this distinction and i think it's
a smart one
to ask yourself first
is it a question about an individual and
would you get a different answer than
the question about what to do about
policy
because those could be different
yes almost always yes now my
understanding is that natural immunity
uh
protects in more ways whereas the
vaccination does something with the
spike protein
so it protects in one way but a
natural immunity could protect in the
whole constellation of ways
and
and we think it would last longer
right
so it lasts longer and protects more
okay
um but are those the only variables
is the only variable
that lasts longer
and
protects more while it doesn't
no there are other variables
and one of the variables is uh
are you intentionally getting infected
or it just happened to you if it just
happened to you then that's the end of
that story
but if you intentionally
avoided the vaccinations so that you
could get infected instead then i'd say
the cost benefit changes doesn't it
if you did it intentionally meaning
intentionally avoided the vaccination
it's the same thing
then then you have to add in the extra
risk
of the comorbidities or not the
government's the extra risk of
dying
because
correct me if i'm wrong
a unvaccinated person getting natural
immunity
it also has the risk of dying from the
disease itself small depending on your
comorbidities it might be a little bit
bigger
so you'd have to throw that in there
but you'd also have to you know throw in
the risk of the vaccination itself so
there you've got two big unknowns
so you've got some stuff you do know
which is
natural is wider than vaccination and
probably lasts longer
but
and when i say that's known there are
some randomized controlled trials and
and observational ones that support it
i don't know that we're 100 sure
but it looks pretty strong at this point
um but you have to factor in the other
stuff the risk of getting the disease
itself the
uh the long-haul covered symptoms et
cetera so i don't think it's uh cut and
dried but
i'm on the side that says if you have
natural immunity you don't need a
vaccination
are you all happy
i say if you have natural immunity
you don't need a vaccination
that's my non-medical opinion
now it's non-medical opinion but it's
based on what the medical experts tell
us
if there's something they haven't told
us
i would factor that in or i would say oh
i don't understand the topic
there's stuff you didn't tell me but i
wouldn't understand it anyway so you
decide
but if the only thing that we need we're
deciding on is the stuff they've already
told us
i wouldn't get a vaccination
if you have a choice
i wouldn't get vaccinated if i had
natural immunity
because that would be adding a risk on
top of
on top of your immunity i don't know why
you do that
all right
here's a fun story the director of some
un food
organization
um
made a provocative statement that said
that uh if elon musk
donated two percent of his wealth
i could solve world hunger
two percent of his wealth now that would
come out to six billion dollars how many
of you think world hunger could be
solved for six billion dollars
now keep in mind
you have to solve it every year i guess
i don't i don't know
how long the six billion is supposed to
last but i would think you have to keep
spending 6 billion every now and then
well elon musk rose to the
challenge if you will in a sense
he said if wfp and i don't know who that
is but that must be somebody associated
with this claim
can describe on this twitter thread
exactly how six billion will solve world
hunger i will sell tesla stock right now
and do it
how much do you love that
i mean
seriously i love that
so you have the most capable person in
the world i would argue elon musk who's
the richest in the world which largely
makes him more capable than he already
was
saying if you can tell me how to do it
i'll do it
just tell me how to do it
tell me how to do it i'll do it right
now i love that
because that's exactly the way you
should approach it so instead of saying
you know it's not it's not my problem or
almost anything else
he just says show me how to do it and
i'll do it tomorrow
that's an excellent excellent answer
and so
i too rose to the challenge
and i decided to figure out how elon
musk could solve world hunger
with six billion dollars
and i'll brainstorm a few ideas and
maybe i'll see a few more coming through
on here
but the first thing is don't limit your
approach to buying food
if that's your approach i'll buy a bunch
of food
or i'll fund some farms
or i'll you know help the distribution
of the existing food
because we do produce enough we just
don't get it at the right places
um
so adam dopamine on
twitter
said quite reasonably that uh musk could
offer an x prize
you know that that's my paraphrasing of
it uh offer a billion dollars to whoever
can solve the problem
then if they solve it he's out one
billion keeps five billion for change
and if they don't solve it well then it
wasn't solvable
because nobody could solve it at least
it wasn't solvable with the brains and
resources we have
so
uh there it is thank you
thank you howard uh howard gets the
award on youtube
uh because i really was wanting to talk
about a different topic altogether but
until
till howard's comment i didn't want to
do it
there are such things as i'm going to
get back to the elon musk thing in a bit
but i set a trap
i set a trap and i want to see who'd
fall into it and howard did
um the trap is this i believe that
the world is filled with npcs
people who are programmed to only think
in uh
movie
terms
and if you bring up feeding the poor
those people will reveal themselves
because they can't
they can't
avoid saying soylent green
if the topic is food and how to feed
people
the npcs will go into the comments and
start just screaming soylent green
soylent green soylent green did you see
my comment yet soylent green soylent
green
soylent green now there's another kind
of movie thinker
that uh whenever you mention the idea of
the simulation or reality not being what
it what it is
the npcs become immediately activated
and what do they start typing if you
talk about the simulation what do the
npcs start typing
the matrix
the matrix that's just like the matrix
and you know what
it's never like the matrix
whatever it is that is the topic is
never
ever
like the matrix you're just reminded of
it
and
so if you want to if you want to figure
out who the npcs and the crowd are
just bring up the simulation theory
or feeding the poor
and just wait to see who says soylent
green and the matrix
and then
just never talk to them again
because they don't have anything to say
they're just npcs
sorry howard
i think most of you know i'm kidding but
let me say not kidding
for everybody who mentions the matrix or
soylent green
everybody else is bored with you
we're all bored with you like seriously
bored
just say you know
your friends can't tell you when you say
it in person but i can say it because i
haven't met you in person
all seriously bored by those two
references all right let's get back to
how elon musk could produce
could somehow feed the poor with six
billion dollars
one would be an x prize so maybe
somebody else can figure it out and
collect the prize
but i put my own idea here because
although i'm not somebody who could
build a
multi-trillion dollar company
which i'm sure
elon will do eventually i think it's
worth a trillion or so whatever it's
worth it's a lot
and
or his combined companies anyway
um
so here's my idea because i'm more of an
idea man more of an idea man
oh wfp is world food program thank you
and i suggested on this same thread with
elon's question
that
he could spend a billion dollars
developing
algae farms
algae farms
now the idea is that you just make one
prototype that is economically
successful
and you could either form a business
around it but that's optional
or you could just release the plans and
say look i made a economically feasible
the best ever
algae farm
and i'll talk about what the benefits of
an lg farm are in a minute
but now i'll just release the plans and
anybody wants to make them in any
country go make your own algae farms
now i also said robot tended
now i don't think you need necessarily
the robot part
but it might lower the prices and make
it more interesting for somebody like
elon musk
um
so here's the thing about algae number
one there are all kinds of different
algaes
some would be edible some wouldn't been
here you go
and deleting this guy again
persistent you're very persistent
so there are lots of different algaes
and they can be used for different
things some can be turned into various
products and fuels
so some kinds of algaes can be turned
into fuel
and you can sell for a variety of
commercial products things you can make
out of it
so you can make food out of it that's
one thing and it would be high protein
and high yield
but there are other ways to make food
so why does
why is algae a good idea here's why
it grows 10 times more rapidly
than you know regular plants on land
so it's 10 times faster
i mean if you're looking at economics 10
times
that should catch your attention
less than a tenth of the land is needed
so it grows ten times as fast
on a tenth of the land
am i doing the math right that it's a
hundred times more economical
if you're only looking at those two
variables you know there are other
variables but if you only look at those
two two things it's a hundred times
better am i doing that right
if it's ten times more productive and
you only need one am i doing that right
that feels too easy
all right it feels like there's
something wrong with that
i think i'm not doing that right
somebody do that right for me and tell
me what the real number is all right
so that's um
it grows on non-productive and
non-arable lands so you could put your
algae farm and by the way they're not in
the ocean
either they're sort of on land in some
kind of container or in some kind of a
recess that you built into the land so
you can build them anywhere
and even if you don't have a lot of
water where you are it doesn't matter
because it turns out they reuse the same
water they don't have to filter it
so you can just put the algae in the
whatever water it's in and just keep
that water there and you know replace
whatever evaporates and that's it so
it's not a big water problem
um
yeah and it could be fertilized more
efficiently than land crops that's
another advantage because it's in water
uh and
there's no wasteful fertilizer runoff so
you have environmental advantages and
remember the it's not in the ocean so
you're not polluting the ocean it's
self-contained
and
and it could be a source of biofuel and
blah blah and co-products
and the the thinking is at least a few
years ago that you could build a
prototype that would give you food
but also
commercial products that could be sold
for a profit
and that it's it's already looks
profitable on paper
now the only thing i would ask
somebody like elon musk to do is figure
out the smart way to do it
there's probably a smart way to do it
that isn't exactly the way it's being
done don't you think you know just like
there's a smarter way to build a rocket
and a smarter way to build a car
so if elon musk could put a billion
dollars into algae farms
primarily for the the research and then
the engineering of it
um to build a prototype that's
economical
and reproducible
there you go
5 billion keep to change
so he's got 6 billion to spend
i feel he could get there with a billion
now why couldn't somebody else do this
why couldn't somebody else figure out
the best way
to build an algae farm that they could
solve world hunger
because they're not elon musk right
it's not an accident
that he continuously does things that
other people can't figure out i mean not
just personally with his engineers
it's because his his main
skill stack
is engineering
and guess he's really good at it and he
hires people who are also really good at
it
so
i don't think that letting farmers build
algae farms is the way to produce them
the problem with farming is i don't
think it attracts engineers
right high tech does because that's
where the money is but how many like top
engineers are going into agriculture
i don't know the answer that but i'm
guessing you're not getting the the best
and the most of them
so you take somebody who's you know
clearly capable and can finance it
and just say okay build a team and go
see if you can make some
algae farms first figure out if it makes
sense but if it does
go see if you can build the best one
it might require robots
might require robots
but if you're putting them in
poor places the labor is cheap so maybe
the robots are too expensive there
i don't think hydroponics is anywhere
near
as efficient as
algae
now what does the algae taste like
i don't know i think you can grind it up
and turn it into a protein product that
could be added to anything
my guess is that you could flavor it and
put it into protein powders and all
kinds of stuff so you're not going to be
eating it the way seaweed tastes right
it's not going to taste like algae when
you're done if you do it right
right yeah you can make oil out of it
you can make all kinds of stuff
terry mcauliffe who's running for
governor has gone full racist
and he said he's calling for the old
dominion state
well let's call it virginia that is such
goofy writing i don't know where i saw
this on one of the websites
don't write like that
don't ever be the person who says the
old dominion state is virginia
um
is asking he wants more diversity in the
teacher space
lamenting
that the commonwealth there again a
douchebag way to write the old dominion
the commonwealth
is virginia
has uh um proportionally more white
teachers
than you know the population would
suggest
and he's promising a program aimed at
attracting non-white teachers
let me ask you something
isn't that a racist dog whistle
that's
right actually it's not even whistles
right in front of us
because
what would be the process
for changing the mix
there's only
a few ways that i know
you either are going to have programs
that are excluding white people that are
promoting other people so you're
excluding white people from whatever
programs would promote
teachers
you're
probably not going to hire as many white
people so white people are discriminated
against that way
and maybe you wouldn't promote them
because you probably have you know an
administration problem that's the same
as the teacher problem in terms of
diversity now i'm in favor of diversity
even when it's sometimes painful
and bad for people like me
to get there because i think it's a big
enough problem to have you know that
that you need to take an axe to it not a
not a scalpel
but
if somebody's running for government
and they're saying right out loud that
they're going to discriminate against an
ethnicity that's disqualifying
isn't it
isn't it
isn't it disqualifying to
say you're going to treat the races
differently
how is that not disqualifying
i mean the difference between woke and
racist has just disappeared
you
if you get woken up i guess you're just
a racist
right
if you're overwoke
he's so over woke he's just a racist and
i'm not even i'm not even talking about
this as some like
hypothetical philosophical way that
by analogy and in some way that you can
imagine in a literary sense you could
call him sort of racist no
no this is direct
explicit
public
racism
he's saying it right to you i'm not
interpreting anything
am i
am i over interpreting this i don't
think so it looks like direct racism
now um the other problem
there's so many problems here
is
when did we stop making children a
priority or their education at least
uh don't we need
as a civilization to do a good job
with the children
it's not really optional is it is it
optional to do a good job raising
children if you want to be a strong
civilization it's not really optional
and
while i am fully on board with
having more diversity
it does
give you
two objectives
and you can't have two top priorities
so if your top priority is
is educating the kids
and you've got let's say your available
pool of teachers has more white
available people just maybe just from
demographic reasons whatever
um
are you gonna not hire the qualified
teachers so you can accomplish this
other goal hire somebody who's maybe
less experienced or you know has lower i
don't know recommendations or something
now of course i'm not saying that that's
some kind of
racial difference
of course
uh i'm saying that you could have many
situations in which if you restrict the
number of people you can look at
to hire just as a concept as soon as you
narrow the number of qualified people
you're willing to consider
you should get fewer qualified hires
because you've got a big pool
and you're excluding a whole bunch of
people without looking at whether
they're qualified or not
that should give you a lower quality
teaching pool not because they're ethnic
ethnically different than the other
people has nothing to do with race
has to do with limiting the pool
right
uh oh yes i have seen when wokes and
racists agree yeah yeah i'm not the only
one to make that point that's for sure
anyway um
i think this racist dog whistle should
be disqualifying we'll see if terry
mcauliffe wins i guess
i guess this race is being treated as uh
the canary in the coal mine yes the
early warning for what's going to happen
in the midterms
and beyond
yes ryan long made that observation
about being woke and being racist ends
up looking the same
so that
is what i wanted to say today
now i should point out
that terry mcauliffe sent his own
children to private school
um and i should also point out just
because i like to cause trouble that one
of the main reasons that anybody
in america
her a kid to private school is
to get away from
certain ethnic groups
now that's not me saying it and i've not
sent anybody to private school and i've
not been to private school
so i'm speaking of it from the outside
but you know there are lots of reasons
for private school one of them is a
religious education
one of them is a better education
one of them might be more involvement
with the parents for example so lots of
good reasons to do it and as someone
responded to me on twitter
in my town
people are not using private school for
any racial reason
because we don't have enough racial
diversity here in the first place
so you would be escaping from anything
and are
but as i also pointed out in the
comments
my town has the highest rated schools in
california i think
they're among the top
highest rated public schools
and people still put their kids in
private schools so there's still good
reason that has nothing to do with
uh you know the quality of the school
per se or the or the mix of the school
there's lots of reasons to do it
control et cetera
but
i think terry mcauliffe's got a big
problem because he's prescribing more
racism for schools that he wouldn't send
his own kid to
and i think that's a problem if you're
running for office
uh and the teachers unions
uh do you predict if mcauliffe will win
or lose well
uh
you know i made a prediction about
trump famously in 2016
because i could see something that i
didn't think other people could see
which is his persuasive skills that it
wasn't obvious to anybody who didn't
you know have that specific talent stack
but in this race
this is really just basic politics so
it's going to come down to enthusiasm
which apparently is lacking on the
mcauliffe side
maybe that's the only variable that
matters it could be just enthusiasm
but i don't think that's predictable
every time i
hide this user comes back with a new
name
somebody's saying on locals we're going
to get another black mayor in new york
city
presumably and will be noted as the the
second black mayor
you're right
yeah we'll act as like that's something
we need to say in 2021 it's the second
black mayor
like
we got to just stop saying that it just
can't help right am i wrong about that
is there anybody
who wants to weigh in on this who is
watching who is black and american
do you find it offensive
every time that the news calls out the
first black
ice skater
gold medal winner or whatever
um
yeah
by the way tell me
i'll need to know
yeah i see lots of white people saying
it's condescending but
i'd rather hear from black americans is
that insulting to you yes or no
i see no but i don't know
well i can't tell from the comments i
can't tell exactly who's responding
um
yes i i identify as black that's correct
yeah but i don't think you want my
opinion on this
stop putting color on something yeah
when you don't need it at some point and
i've said this before at some point all
the things that worked
to
to handle the big racism you know the
big clubs you know everything from civil
wars to
civil rights legislation and the legal
system and all that you need that for
the big problems
but as the gap narrows
the discrimination gap narrows
it may never be you know may never close
the gap just because that's how the
world works
but as it narrows i think you got to
change your tools
and i think you have to be smarter about
how people
let's say process any kind of a change
and sometimes
the helpful people are just making it
worse i think
um
it's not a lie if you identify that way
that's right
how will we know who wins well yeah you
got that problem are those virginia
election
systems are they fully auditable and
instantly
uh i would love to hear your take on the
450 000
i i think there's some fake news about
uh
illegal immigrants would get a bunch of
money
if they're illegal or something
that's fake news isn't it
the 450 000 thing
i saw it i think i saw it only on social
media as soon as i saw it i just that's
fake
i didn't i didn't even look into it it
just looked so obviously fake
so i'm seeing people say it's not fake
um
it's being considered oh you're talking
about settlement settlement okay that's
different as a settlement for
people separated at the border during
the trump administration oh okay okay so
it's not really even about the
immigrants is it so it's really just an
anti-trump thing isn't it
that i i think to make trump look worse
they have to
do some reparations to people he
had an impact on
so i don't think it's about the dollar
amount it's just
must be just some way to make trump look
bad right
uh it's based on lawsuit
so there's a lawsuit out right now
that's asking for that much
yeah i don't know what they get that
number
um
the 450 well if it's if it's based on a
lawsuit
that's just somebody guessing what they
can ask for and then finding out
so you don't you don't really
i'm not sure it matters how they
calculated it
um
so it's real okay is it uh i didn't
realize the context of it was that it
was a
it was a reparations
i thought it was something else so if it
was something else it would have been
fake
but as reparations yeah maybe i mean
maybe maybe it's real
um but i'm gonna
i'm gonna say i don't think it's gonna
happen so it doesn't matter
you don't think it's going to happen do
you
lisa says i can't
about me
she says i can't be canceled because i'm
the poor man's bill maher
i'm the poor man's bill maher
i think i'm the poor the poor man's bill
burr
i'd rather be the poor man's bill burr
um
one million per family
were you challenged to be more diverse
in dilbert yes i was and and continually
so i've often been challenged to be more
diverse in dilbert and let me tell you
why i'm not
and this will explain a lot if you
haven't heard this explanation
so dilbert has mostly a white
characters except for a shook the
indian american intern now why don't i
have uh black characters in my comic
strip does anybody know
can you guess
why i don't
see if you
first the first reason hard to draw
are they hard to draw in general
no
are they hard to draw if you're white
yes
not because i don't know how to draw
although i'm not good at drawing but if
a white person draws a black person what
is anybody going to say about that
drawing
how is anybody going to take it
how do you make it look black
now the way charles schultz did it he
introduced a black character is he drew
him to look
almost identical to the white characters
and then put cross hatches in it so
you'd see that his skin color was
different
do you think that's right do you think
you should draw your black characters
to be facially
exactly like the white characters and
just change the skin color
does that feel like you've done your job
you know putting diversity into the
strip it doesn't to me
to me it just looks like you
then it's almost like blackface to me
it's almost offensive
you know but
i can't judge for other people but to me
it was feel offensive to not
to do nothing but just like change the
color
so it's really hard to draw a black and
white drawing and show color
uh although it could be added later but
it doesn't run in in color everywhere so
that's a problem
all right that's the first problem
what's another problem
what's the second reason that i don't
have black characters in dilbert
because i would be called racist
by black people
how do i know
because
the ashook character who's
indian american in the strip
is often seen as a black character
and
people complain to newspapers that i was
making the black character look
bad in one way or another
so without even testing it i already
know the blowback
mistakenly thinking i had a black
character it was enough to get me almost
cancelled
just think about it
mistakenly
thinking i had a black character almost
got me canceled
imagine having an actual one
you know where i can't say oh you just
got that wrong that's not meant to be a
black character
of course it would be worse now imagine
all the jokes i do
do i do jokes that make the character
look good
which of my characters do i make look
good
the boss
nope
nope
so i can't make the black character the
boss or a boss or senior management
because i mock senior management the
most
right so i can't i can't introduce a
black character there would just look
racist because i'd be mocking that
character just like the other characters
uh how about
how about i just add a black engineer to
the staff
do i treat the main character dilbert
as if he has all good qualities
nope
all of the dilbert cast have major flaws
personality flaws
or they're dumb or they're something
right
now if you take that away there's
nothing interesting it's their flaws
that makes the comic right it's all
about the flaws
but if i were to add a flawed black
character to dilbert do you think i
could get away with that
not a chance
because people would only see that one
comic
people who had never read dilbert before
would be sent that one comic and they'd
say oh
i can tell from this one comic who i'm
dealing with here
he is clearly making this black
character look stupid and that's all you
need to know racist cancel them
because you can't you can't broadcast
context
when people can slowly easily take one
comic and forward it so i can't keep the
context
if they understood that the context is
all the characters are mocked for their
flaws
well then i might get away with it but i
can't that's not doable
that it would be taken out of context
immediately
let me give you an idea how dangerous
this is the nancy comic a very ancient
comic called nancy
i once talked to the creator who took it
over from the original and he talked
about how he did a joke
that was uh based on how photographs if
you if you take the negative of a
photograph it reverses the colors
and so one day he reversed the colors of
his comic and made all the things that
would be filled in with black white
and made all the things that would be
normally left blank with no color you
filled them in with blank
and that included
the main character
so the main character was you know black
as was you know the background and
everything around her so you could tell
that it was like a photographic negative
and this was the punch line
the punch line was she was feeling a
little negative today
because the joke was she was drawn as a
photographic negative she was feeling a
little negative
and he got cancelled from a major
newspaper
because
black readers wrote in and said really
really the black character is the
negative one
oh really all the white characters are
positive
but just one black character the only
one you've ever had in the comic one
time and that's the negative one
i see what you're doing
with your racist whistle
canceled
that's how sensitive it is
right
so i do have a plan
for introducing a black character
but i haven't figured out how to execute
it without being more cringy
than that i can handle and here's the
non-cringy part
i would get some black activists
especially if they have any artistic
background
to design the character for me including
the flaws
that's the important part
so the flaws would have to be designed
by somebody who's you know clearly not a
racist
and then i could maybe execute
on those flaws i would still get almost
cancelled
but i could always you know pull out the
card that i didn't design the character
it might protect me
it might protect me and it might
actually make things interesting right
people would watch just to see if i'd
get canceled
but
uh
oh good you like the micro lessons
uh yes i might lose creative control of
my comic that's true
now there are a number of uh black
artists who have black characters now
they of course don't have any problems
you know that would solve the problem
it's just be black
um
yeah todd nahisi coates
i was actually thinking about him yeah
it would have to be somebody who has
maybe some artistic background right i
wouldn't want you know an engineer to
design it for me
chappelle
yeah interesting although
yeah
i know but chapelle's not an activist
i'd rather have somebody like
you know uh candy or somebody you know
somebody who's really got serious
activist credibility
darren bell
darren belly a black cartoonist very
successful
i could have a i could have another
cartoonist design it
yeah aaron magruder
very successful cartoonist
yes terry crews
all right um don lemon bill cosby
not all of your suggestions are winners
uh all right uh didn't candy do a
superman comic there's something like
that going on that sounds vaguely
familiar
somebody says coach already ruined
marvel comics he's a great great choice
to destroy yours
well
you don't think you'd watch
if i partnered with somebody who is you
know a prominent
black activist you don't think you'd
watch what came out of that
i think you'd watch and remember it's
art
you know cartoons are art
so if i can make you watch and make you
interested it doesn't matter why
you know it's still art
um
interview chappelle
i don't know
chappelle is amazing but i don't know
that me interviewing him adds anything
to the world i mean i'd love to meet him
but beyond that
i don't think it would work for you
i would rather
i would rather talk to somebody who's
like
just really on the other side of things
that would be the most fun
all right that's all for now i'm gonna
run i hope you had as much fun as i did
today
because if i haven't said this before
and i don't know why this should matter
to you but i'll tell you anyway
i really enjoy
i really enjoy this
you know it's
often it's one of the best parts of my
day and i don't know why exactly as
something it's it's very human and it's
flawed and i don't have to work too hard
or i don't even shave before i come on
here
i'm literally in my pajamas
and
you know if you could have this
experience
in your pajamas
i think you'd like it too
it's pretty awesome
all right that's all for now and i will
talk to you
tomorrow
