hello everybody on the xplatform as well
good to see
you let's see if our comments are lining
up yep can see that all turn me off come
on there we go now we got a show we got
comments we got everything I had I had
to turn off the uh pre-show for those of
you watching it because it wasn't uh
performing so every morning I'm just
gonna uh contact locals and tell them
that the comments are not working and
I'm going to do it every single day
until they
work if you don't mind I'm just going to
do it every
day until they have until they're just
SI hearing from me because I don't know
what else they're doing over there
but I think a year of no comments
working is a little bit too long all
right I believe you're here to uh
experience
the greatness which is coffee with Scott
Adams and if you'd like to take this
experience up the levels that I don't
even think you can understand it'll be
so high well to do that all you need is
a copper Mugo glass a tanker chelin a
canteen juger flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee en join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
head of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous zp and it happens
now oh that's
good that's
good well as you know most of my
technology is broken at any moment I've
got a broken automatic shade I've got a
bad computer in my elevators down coffee
machine is a nightmare but everything is
else is going to work great today
because we got some fun
news well it turns out that the In-N-Out
burger place has closed its first Outlet
they've never had to close any store
that's pretty good uh but they closed
one in Oakland because uh too dangerous
too dangerous it's the first ever
permanent closure for the
chain
now I think they finally earned their
name they're out they're out they were
in but now they're out why would anybody
live in Oakland I don't know
but if they keep closing uh places to
buy food in Oakland I'm a little worried
that the people in Oakland are going to
drive to my town for
food and then I'm GNA have to move
again because oh no anyway I watched a
show last night has anybody heard of a
show called The Three body problem I
guess it was a book now it's a show on
Netflix well I watch this so you don't
need to here's my review you number one
it's it's a interesting show but the the
best part about it is to play um is to
laugh at the
wokeness because it has a very strict
hierarchy of who's good and who's bad
and at the top of their
hierarchy uh you've got the you've got
minority women who are physicists and
Geniuses and then just just below them
would be black men also phys pH ists and
Geniuses and then at the bottom would be
white men who are scumbags and bars
sometimes bartenders but just generally
kind of worthless so if you watch it uh
do what uh I was doing last night with a
friend we were watching it and we're
trying to guess what we would see next
so for example a guess would be all
right then the first time you see a
white guy he's going to be a scumbag
then just see if you're
right you you'll be surprised how often
you can guess exactly what's going to
happen but that said so so the W the
wokeness of course is off the chart but
uh as all movies but it's actually well
made so beyond that it's actually pretty
uh pretty interesting I just watched the
first two
anyway bill marah is making news again
talking about the pandering Democrats
and he is advising his own team the
Democrats to get off the race politics
because it's sort of the
past
and I I do think this is one of the
things that bill Mah is sort of a
national treasure for is say he he is
capable of telling his own team when
they're making a
mistake I'm not sure they
listen but it's pretty awesome that they
at least have somebody who can talk to
them and say you know maybe this thing
you're doing is ruining the country and
maybe not so good
so let's see uh I guess the financial
times as he quoted I said Democrats are
going backwards faster with voters of
color than any other
demographic so the more the Dem
Democrats try to make it about
race the more diversity they're
losing so do you think they' figured out
that it's not
working well don't worry because they
have a better
plan so if racial division isn't getting
the Democrats what they want don't worry
because that's not like it's not like
the only thing they have because that
would be pathetic imagine if you had a
hold a hold National party and the only
thing you had to offer was you're all
racists that's it but don't worry about
that because they have a lot more so the
news says that the Biden campaign has
decided to use uh personal
insults as a big part of their campaign
so they don't just have racial division
they also have personal insults but not
like the clever ones I'm not talking
about a a trump kind of insult where
it's really sticky and fun and welld
designed and it says something really
funny and you you want to say it
yourself and I mean it just really gets
into the gets into the minds of the
other people it's not like that
no Biden has decided that they're going
to call uh Trump broke
Don
now I'm going to make a recommendation
for the Democrats they don't take my
advice they don't even listen to me but
if they did I'd say you might want to
call a meeting with Bill Mara before
trying this now I don't know what Bill
Mar would say about that idea of Biden
trying to out insult the best insulter
in the history of
humankind but it does seem like they're
not taking strength against weakness
which would be the normal way you do
these things you normally you'd find
something that the other team doesn't do
well and then you do it well and you'd
form that contrast that'd be good what
you don't
do is try to get into an insult contest
with the best insulter of all
time and you don't open the bid with
broke dawn let me give you a little
persuasion
advice if he's broke because you broke
him you
lose if he's broke da because you took
his
money we're going to notice that he
didn't get broke on his own he got broke
because you're stealing his money and by
the way he's not broke you stole so much
money that he formed a new social media
entity and he'll probably make $4
billion this week so jokes on you but
every time I hear broke Don I hear Frank
lunce in my head Frank Lun on CNN was
looking at the camera and saying if they
take Trump's property if they if they
try to take his house or one of his
houses he he's going to win the
election well what do you think broke da
reminds you of it remind you of they're
trying to take his stuff there's nobody
in the country who's okay with that
nobody you know at at a real basic human
level you don't want to see your
government taking people's stuff because
they're on the other
side literally nobody's in favor of that
except bat crazy pieces of all
right now if this were
reversed I'd be saying the same thing
you know it has nothing to do with party
if your government is is just taking
somebody's stuff because they're angry
and they want to win an election just
call him broke da just remind us every
time you use that that you're robbing
his stuff and it can happen to us
too so I don't think that the um I
really don't think that the
Democrats have anybody working for them
at the moment who knows how to do
anything they appear completely lost and
I think uh Bill Mah is pointing that out
correctly and I liked I liked Bill
marah's take on this uh about the race
relations because it's is exactly mine
but he words it differently you've heard
my reframe for race which is that
dividing people by race is literally
just stupid doesn't buy you anything you
don't get anything from it but it it
misses the fact that we're infinitely
different you know Dave Chappelle makes
a better point he makes the point that
it's about
class and that if you're rich enough
you're not really having the same
problems as poor black people you're
having the problems of rich people and
then that becomes the group that you
have the most identity with because you
have most in common with it that at
least in terms of the the real stuff
that matters to your your
life so I would so the way uh Bill M
puts it is is you know we have lots of
interracial everything um Andy gave some
great examples very entertaining but the
fact that we're complicated and we're
we're diverse Way Beyond race now we're
just diverse in every way and to imagine
that you can put a bunch of us in one
big
category is really old thinking you know
there was a time it made sense but this
is not that
time well the department the uh
Department of Justice
uh reportedly dismissed a $3.3 billion
fraud suit they were going to do against
the dish company you know the Satellite
Dish
company uh but they dropped that uh
fraud suit after the chairman of dish
donated
$133,000 to
Biden now I I don't mean to suggest
they're
connected it's just so one happened soon
after the
other
oh my what if everything is exactly the
way it
looks did you ever think about that what
if it's what if everything is just
exactly what it looks like that would be
the worst case
scenario well what this looks like is
that somebody bought their way out of a
lawsuit I don't know that that's
true but it looks exactly like it you
know doesn't mean it's
true
well did you know that everything on Tik
Tok has a similar
theme um so Ashley stclair was pointing
out that uh Tik Tock is removing and
banning
videos uh which speak about the
increased risk of mental health issues
with hormonal birth control now uh
Ashley is
a advocate for that point of view I'm no
doctor so I cannot confirm or deny and I
certainly don't trust any studies Pro or
anti so I don't know I could say that
observationally I think it's
obvious I don't know if anybody's had
that experience but to me it seems
obvious that personalities change at the
very least a personality changes with
hormonal birth control I think that's
observably
true and and apparently Tik tok's going
to remove or suppress your your voice if
you say that
so so so Tik tok's in favor of hormonal
birth control if you you know look at
the impact of their suppression so what
else let's see if there's any kind of
pattern here let's see what does Tik Tok
say about climate
change too many
people too many people yeah they say uh
the people are the problem what do what
does Tik Tock say about dual income no
kids
couples I believe that there's a trend
showing uh people with no children
celebrating how happy and free they are
and all the money they have and the
things they can
do um how
about uh what does what does Tik Tok
think about being
heterosexual not as cool as it used to
be huh you know it's really cool being
anything except
heterosexual much cooler how about the
traditional family H not so much not on
Tik Tok how about uh free
markets kind of not so
much um what do all these things and
more have in common every one of them
has the same impact it suppresses
American
reproductive
urges so is it a
coincidence that the reproductive
impulse of Americans is being turned off
by Tik Tok
do you think that spending all day on
your phone increases your testosterone
it makes you want to get busy with a
real human or does it do the opposite
we're pretty sure it does the
opposite so you've got a tool that China
can use to turn off the human
reproduction in
America
and we're not worried about
that and and our Congress
wasn't concerned until probably has said
too many things pro
Palestinian but whatever it takes if
it's the Palestinian situation I don't
care why uh and Ashley also responded to
my comments on that post saying wait
until you find out about quote the list
videos thousands of videos with reasons
to not have kids so apparently there's
something called the list on Tik Tok
where you can add all the all the
awesome reasons do not have
kids is that a little too on the
nose but what would it take for you to
be able to see
it what what does it take for pattern
recognition to kick in are We There Yet
anybody anybody seeing the
pattern yeah it's it's it's could not be
more obvious now you might say to me but
Scott is it
intentional well I'll tell you what they
could turn it off if they wanted because
they can make anything viral they want
so whether it happened on its own or
didn't happen on its own it's certainly
the message that they're comfortable
with and that ends up being the same
thing and of course any food imports are
probably killing us and making us unable
to
reproduce so I think our our food source
is poison in my
opinion um I talked about this that 50%
of young liberal women have been
diagnosed with a mental health condition
what do you think the number is when you
add the
undiagnosed the ones who didn't go to
seek
help because if you live where I live
it's really expensive and hard to find
anybody to give you mental health
support is that the same everywhere I
think it is probably right it's not
really easy or cheap to get any kind of
therapy right not very few people could
afford it so if 50% of women have been
diagnosed it means they had the
wherewithal to you know get a medical
professional to do that I would bet that
the real number is closer to 75 or
80% young liberal women I think are 75
to 80% mentally ill that's that's my
guess now why would that
be well Elon Musk had a theory he uh
responded to that post about the young
women having a young liberal women
having uh that much mental illness and
he said that hormonal birth control and
no kids to care for would make any
mammal
sad okay that's just like the best
sentence that you're going to read
today you know um I've often said that
the difference between humor and a good
summary is almost nothing
there's almost no difference between
summarizing a real situation and a
joke because the only the only reason
that things don't sound like a joke you
know in by their
nature is because we make them
complicated if you take anything in the
news and you just summarize it it's
hilarious that's all it takes so here
he's done it he's just summarized it
hormonal birth control and no kids to
care for would make any mammal
sad okay there's really nothing else to
say that's pretty much it if you do all
the things that make would make any
mammal sad and then you look around and
go hey what is making all these mammals
sad could it be that every single thing
we do is clearly something that we know
would make you sad maybe it's that
maybe all right
um the financial times is reporting that
uh China is telling the uh the
government that they can't use computers
they have Intel and AMD chips so now
China is worried that americanmade
chips could be spying on them now do you
think that's just a response to the US
saying you can't have ticktock on your
machine or do you think they're actually
worried and do you think they have a
reason to be do you think they have a
reason to be worried about American
chips on their
computers I'm going to say
yes I'm GNA say yes I don't know that
those chips have any you know issues on
them but I can tell you if we were
getting our chips from China I would be
very suspicious about what's on there
that I don't know about because I don't
know how hard it is to hide something on
a chip you know a little unexpected code
or something
but I'd be worried if I were if I were
China all right um I don't think I said
it on this uh this live stream yesterday
but that Kate Middleton video that looks
sort of obviously AI to me the one where
she talked about her cancer diagnosis
now if it is I'm totally okay with it
ethically
morally publicity wise royal royal
family wise every part of that I'm okay
with because here's what I assume if
she's been taking chemo for 2 months
after stomach
surgery she's not looking that great
right she's probably lost a lot of
weight her face is probably a little
sunken and there's probably not enough
makeup and wigs that can compensate for
that my guess it's just speculation is
that their best case scenario was to
record her voice
which is probably fine and then just add
a AI because the the background look
very Ai and everything else is pretty
easy to do the Deep fake stuff the only
thing that would be hard would be
getting the voice exactly right because
even though the computers are good at
faking voices you can still sort of tell
when it's a fake but if you use the real
voice and just added the AI it'd be fine
now remember she's got young kids and
the young kids don't need to see her
looking bad you know that'd be a little
scary so you know we live in a world
where makeup is accepted and you know
wigs are accepted and dressing good is
accepted and getting the lighting just
right and then photo shopping the
picture it's all accepted so if they use
new technology
to to just put on a little better face
than normal totally acceptable I don't
even think they should hide it you know
if if it if it came out that it was AI
they should just say yes this was AI
it's it's the real person's voice and uh
we did it so that people didn't see her
looking bad I'm totally okay with that
there's nothing wrong with that at all
in fact this is good use of the
technology well James Carville in his
outspoken way yeah he is quoted as
saying that uh um part of the parties's
uh po in problems in other words why the
party is not doing well is quote too
many preachy females in the Democrat
Party what does that sound like well
would be another phrase for too many
preachy
females batshit crazy
women yeah yeah the Democrats have a
problem of mentally ill women who they
can't say no to they have problem saying
no to them so it turns out that the
mentally ill women end up running the
whole
show because nobody can say no to
them it's just too
dangerous we've all been trained to say
all right okay yeah whatever that's fine
just let me go do something else and try
to ignore this so at least the Democrats
are now aware and I would say that uh
Bill Mah's pretty close to this same
realization that if you're party is run
by mentally ill young women you're going
to get this result which is a president
Trump so just keep saying broke da keep
making it about race and keep being
preachy female L party and you can
pretty much guarantee unless there
unless there's an amazing amount of
rigging you can pretty much guarantee a
president
Trump all right uh what about all these
squatter
stories this is probably one of the most
alarming things I've ever
seen uh I I've canceled my holiday plans
because I don't want to come home and
find somebody living in my house if I'm
gone for a
week has anybody had that has anybody
literally thought they were going to
cancel their vacation plans because they
don't want to squatter moving in the
minute they walk out the
door and why don't we hear more stories
of
violence I'm not recommending it I never
but I'm kind of it's kind of weird that
with all of our
guns and if somebody steals your
house and nobody's gotten violent how in
the world did they not get violent in
that situation yeah now I don't
recommend it because you end up in jail
and losing your house so it's way worse
to be violent I'm just I'm kind of
amazed at the level of
constraint the level of
self-restraint what happened to
America
let me just say it directly you you
could end the squatter problem
tomorrow with violence I don't recommend
it I'm just saying if this were any any
prior time in America it would already
be solved your neighbors would come over
and they would help you kick the
out of the squatters and then the police
would come and the police would not
arrest you they would arrest the
squatters because that was what America
was we didn't let the criminal
take our but now we do so I don't
recommend violence but I'm rooting for
it can I say
that I don't know is that too far
because I definitely don't recommend it
I do not recommend it I mean I strongly
strongly don't recommend it because
you're going to go to jail if you do
that but probably there's some number of
people
who are just angry enough that it's
going to go too far and they're going to
get in real trouble I don't recommend it
but there was there used to be a way
that these problems got solved and I
don't think we have that mechanism
anymore and um everybody who's saying is
just saying it's crazy and here's my
take as long as this squatter situation
is
real there's no way that Trump can
lose because the squatter situation and
the uh the the das's take
Trump
stuff in my mind that's the same story
does anybody have that same feeling that
the the global Squad the squatter
problem in America is the same
story as the Democrats and their their
Lackey stealing Trump stuff it's
somebody who had a property right and
then the government through
its behavior is taking it away away not
for themselves necessarily but letting
somebody take it away you have the
Looting as well the massive looting is
the government basically it's the
government stealing from you let me say
it
directly wherever looting is allowed by
by the law that's the government
stealing from you that's the government
because they're the ones who control
that they can make a
stop you know El they can make it stop
make it legal to kill a squatter
make it legal you didn't it used to be
sort of okay to kill a horse
thief right so I don't I don't recommend
anybody do anything illegal let me say
that as clearly as don't do anything
illegal but let's make it legal that'll
never happen but it would be a
solution so what we have now is what I
call a reverse government a normal
government would be trying to protect
and take care of the people in my right
even a total even a totalitarian
government do you know what
Putin really is interested in
doing Putin actually wants Russia to do
well I'm positive he does I think he
really wants the Russian people to have
a good life now I'm not pro Putin he's
got plenty of problems plenty of
problems I've talked about him in the
past don't need to mention him every
time I'm just saying that the normal
function of a government be it a
republic be it you know any any
Democratic or even
totalitarian they do want their people
to do well because you know they do well
if the people do well so but we have the
opposite what is it what kind of
government do you have when they're
encouraging squatters to take your home
that's a reverse government instead of a
government protecting your rights
they're actively taking away what do you
call it when the government is actively
suppressing speech by using its entities
to talk to social media and lean on
networks and stuff like that well that's
the opposite of what your government is
supposed to do your government is
supposed to um protect your free speech
they're actually actively taking it
away that's a reverse
government how about uh making sure that
the the economy is solid that would be
the job of a government wouldn't you say
make sure that the government is you
know make sure the economy is
functioning well basic government
function what's ours doing well we just
passed a unlimited um ridiculous budget
which guarantees that we'll go out of
business as a country because we'll be
ruined by
debt is that what a government is
supposed to be doing or is that closer
to the opposite that's the opposite
that's the opposite they're actively
making the economy crash they're not
just doing nothing they're very actively
crashing it through you know unlimited
debt that's a reverse
government how about that department of
justice that's supposed to uh protect us
from crime is that what's happening No
No in fact at least in the political
realm of January 6 and everything with
Trump the government is the
crime the
government is the
crime they're not the ones preventing it
they are the
crime right in front of
us what about the news the news is
supposed to tell you what's real do they
do that no they very directly do the
opposite not even close and the
government of course is silent on that
because it works for their
benefit there's a uh so long post from
um RFK Jr which I just realized fits
perfectly with this point in which he
points out that all of our uh industry
or all of our regulatory bodies that are
supposed to be protecting us are all
captured and they're doing the opposite
so the people who should make sure our
food supply is better are probably
actively making it worse the people who
are supposed to make sure that our
medicines are safe are probably actively
doing the opposite actively not just
doing nothing not just being
worthless actively working against our
interest interest how about the National
Defense the National Defense is supposed
to keep us safe is that what Ukraine is
doing is that keeping us
safe or are we are we witnessing or
military doing things that keep America
safe it doesn't look like it to me it
looks like we're risking a nuclear
confrontation and using up all our
weapons and degrading the respect of our
military and God knows what else putting
our putting our soldiers in
dresses literally putting putting our
soldiers in dresses
now does that sound like the
government's on your
side not so much
uh let me stop for there's somebody here
who still believes the uh forchan hoax
about my pandemic
opinions if you fell for the forchan
hoax that said I was Pro vaccine and pro
mask and pro lockdowns none of that ever
happened in the real
world and if your concern is that what I
personally did with my own health
decisions I'd like to gently
suggest
that you don't have any role in my
health
decisions be they
correct be they
incorrect because you don't know
anything about my health situation you
don't know anything about my risk reward
you are a stupid piece of whose
only value was to come on and say some
completely wrong that you heard
on forchan or Reddit or some terrible
place and you're just making the World a
worse place you're worse than the
government right now to come in and just
yell at somebody who's trying to help
you try to help you trying to make a
world better place and your job is to
come in here like a little
dingleberry and tell me that something
that happened two years ago that
you misunderstood is the important thing
we should be thinking about right
now anyway all right so we have a
reverse
government but uh the good news is it
can't get any worse am I right I mean
what could the government do they could
be more on the nose to prove that
they're against the people there's
nothing else they could do there's
nothing I tell you there's nothing that
our government could do that would make
you think even more than you already do
that they're anti- people
so next story is the Biden
Administration accelerates their plan to
unleash grizzly bears near rural
communities wait
what the Biden Administration is
releasing grizzly bears near rural
communities
intentionally okay I take back
everything I said it can get way worse
people it can get way worse they're
they're Ian grizzly
bears I didn't make that up does anybody
think I made that up that's an actual
story they're releasing the grizzly
bears near your
homes just in case you hadn't gotten the
hint from the squatters and the Fentanyl
and the
MS13 if none of that was giving you the
hint how about a grizzly bear do
you see it
yet all right um and then again uh see
Senator Bill Hagerty points out that
every single every single Senate
Democrat uh voted against this amendment
that would have stopped the Biden
Administration from using taxpayer
dollars to charter flights for hundreds
of thousands of illegal aliens from
their countries directly to American
towns huh you know you would
think that the normal role of a
government would be to
prevent non-citizens from entering you
know especially under this current
situation but not only are they not
preventing
it but they're charging
us the taxpayers to fly them in comfort
and as quickly and as efficiently as
possible into the country now does that
sound like a government or does that
sound like a a reverse
government well with any luck that
grizzly bears will eat the the criminals
coming in they're not all
criminals most of the immigrants are
fine
people um I didn't mean fine people that
way but you know what I
mean well but don't worry in many other
ways the government is just fine let's
see this next story uh apparently
there's a report that
Google is willing or has been asked we
don't know if they're willing but
they've been asked to reveal the
identities of some YouTube
viewers the
viewers so the government
reportedly uh has asked Google to reveal
who was watching certain
videos not who created the
video the
government is trying to find out
who was watching certain
videos does that bother you at
all and apparently they can even find
out who you were what you were watching
even if you were doing it anonymously
and not signed in because they can
figure out your IP
address so they want to find out what
you watched now I think there's a
specific case involved that they were
looking into but just think about that
they want to know what you
watched if that doesn't scare you I
don't know I
will all right so th this is actually
rfk's take on I'm going to read his
words because I think they were well
chosen he said the CIA works for
military contractors providing a steady
pipeline of forever Wars the health
agencies are controlled by the
pharmaceutical industry which profits
from chronic diseases the Fed held
captive by big Banks flood the Canyons
of Wall Street with money the agencies
that are supposed to be stewards of
American Security and prosperity and
health are no longer working on behalf
of you and me they become sock puppets
for the industries are supposed to
regulate corporate capture is the
biggest threat to American
democracy
correct that is
correct 100% correct now when I say the
government is working against you it's
usually
because of some entity that's corrupt or
some you know billionaire who's corrupt
or something so the the government
doesn't wake up in the morning and say
what what can we do that's bad for
America there's always some entity
that's benefiting right there's somebody
making money and that's why the
government acts the way it does so
somebody can keep making
money
apparently well only the mole can save
us how many of you remember the mole
the the mole is a let's say a imaginary
person who works for the Democrat
campaign originally for the Hillary
Clinton campaign W which we imagined was
giving terrible advice but doing it
intentionally like a mole you know
really they're playing for the other
team but they've
infiltrated and you know I said earlier
that the Biden campaign is going to
start insulting and calling Trump broke
down that feels like the mole
doesn't
it again it's an imaginary person but it
feel it feels like somebody is
literally giving them what they think is
the worst
advice hey have you thought of publicly
flogging Trump in the you know in front
of the public you it's just like all
terrible terrible advice you'll see more
of
that well of course the big news still
is that Moscow attack on the theater and
the mall um I thought by now we'd have a
more clarity on who did it Isis claimed
responsibility and at some point people
thought it was uh I reminded you that
it's too early to believe Isis even when
they claim
responsibility because we do know that
in the Vegas shooter situation they
claimed responsibility and it wasn't
them so we do know that Isis claiming
responsibility is a thing even if it's
not true that doesn't mean it wasn't
Isis because there's evidence that
they're from a you know sort of an Isis
area and it's about that but um then
other people are saying it's really a
Ukraine operation in secret and you know
Putin Putin seems to be taking the
approach that it was
Ukraine now what we don't know is if
Putin knows the real
answer what we don't know is if he does
know the real answer if he is pretending
he doesn't know
and think because it would be a good
good excuse to get more Savage on
Ukraine because the current situation
was you sort of a
stalemate
um but it seems to me that Putin now has
an October 7th free pass for
Ukraine this is the problem when
precedents gets set they Prime you so
you only think of that precedent have
you ever been in a conversation about
about politics and Hitler came up I'm
joking because Hitler comes up in every
conversation about politics once you get
a a Hitler model in your mind then it's
just always there as your go-to to
understand everything that has nothing
to do with the
Holocaust right um likewise the October
7th attacks because they're in your
head when you see this attack how many
of you connected it to October 7th at in
sort of a like a like attack how many of
you just automatically thought oh this
is very October 7ish did anybody think
that you know the news has mentioned it
but I think people probably
automatically compare them and here we
have a country which is already
primed um for thinking that Israel had
IM moral cover for going hard against
Gaza you know you could argue how hard
and the specifics of it but they had
some moral cover to go hard
militarily does it seem a coincidence
that when we'd been so primed by October
7th giving you a free pass to be
brutal
that that suddenly Putin gets a free
pass to be brutal with Ukraine because
all he has to do is say I think it's
Ukraine and even now as I'm talking
talking probably Ukraine is getting
pounded pretty hard has anybody seen an
update I I heard there were cruise
missiles and bombers heading
toward you know heading toward Kev or
whatever I've got a feeling he might
just take out a take out the
capital he might just turn the capital
into
Gaza I don't know how hard this is going
to be but it seems to me that for uh
domestic reasons Putin has to get as
brutal as he possibly can because he
can't look
weak right the what last thing you can
do is look weak especially when some
people think it might have been Ukraine
whether it was or not who knows
but I I think that's going to get brutal
because you got a free pass now did
Ukraine do it let let's go through the
the
possibilities is it a
coincidence that Isis did it now and the
way they did it how how would Isis
benefit from this particular
crime here's the thing an ISIS attack I
would expect usually to be more like a
something blowing
up right these guys were trying to get
away with it that's very unisis to try
to run away and and live isn't it you
know there it seems like the terrorists
have this whole I've got to die doing
the thing it has to be an explosion I
don't know why but they seem locked into
that pattern so when I see people doing
something that's a little bit off
pattern I say to myself hm that's a
little off pattern for terrorist
attacks and that doesn't mean it's not I
mean they may have been inspired by the
October 7th thing so there's a perfect
reason that they did it the way they did
it they may have noticed that October
7th got more attention
but if you were
Isis would you want to get Putin really
really mad at you right
now is that something that Isis wants
more of does Isis wants want more of
Russia coming after them I don't think
so it seems like that wouldn't be a good
strategy would it I mean is it likely
that that attack will make Putin say oh
I guess you know wherever Isis is mad at
me anywhere in the world I guess I
better back off probably not so I'm not
sure that Isis would see that as a good
strategy for
Isis by the way the Taliban uh just
issued a statement uh opposing the
October 7th attack the
Taliban that's right the
Taliban
um so it could be
Isis um I'm I'm still saying that the
the indication is
not then the second question is was it
Ukraine why would Ukraine benefit from
that do you think there was somebody in
Ukraine who said to themselves if we do
this horrible attack in the heart of
Moscow we'll have more chance of winning
the war does that sound
likely does that sound like a good
approach
see if I can make the comments work here
comments stopped
again
um all right there should be a fix
coming this week for the mobile app I'm
being
told but let me just close this and
reopen it because I can't read the
comments right now and I want to all
right locals coming back to
you trying to see if I can see the
comments refreshed there we are we got
refreshed comments
now all right so Isis might have been
Isis but it's hard to see how that's
good for them might have been
Ukraine but again it's hard to see how
that would be good for
them because it sounds crazy like what
why would you give um Putin a free pass
to bomb the capital because that's what
he has Putin now has a free pass to
destroy the capital of Ukraine
which he didn't really have before
because before he was like well I'm
fighting for these areas on the The
Border but if he can sell it to his own
public in the world as a Ukraine op he
can take out the whole
Capital why would Ukraine do that they
would have to know that's going to
happen all right now let's talk about
the
CIA again I have no evidence that the
CIA was behind it but would it make
sense would the
CIA care so much if the capital of
Ukraine gets bombed to
Rubble they don't care about the rest of
Ukraine
apparently so it could be that anything
that makes Putin look bad is good for
the CIA I don't know but it's it's hard
to see how anybody has a clean play
here because it's not obvious to me how
anybody benefit from this somebody
saying NATO how do how would NATO
benefit from
this I don't see it how would Ukraine
benefit from it I don't see it how would
the military industrial complex benefit
from it oh now we're talking now we're
talking there is one entity that would
make a ton of
money it's our own military-industrial
complex who does the bidding of our
industrial military complex well
depending who you're listening to many
people would say the CIA is basically
partners with our military industrial
complex so if you see something that
looks like would make a lot of money for
American military industrial complex
people and you can't find anybody else
who seems to have an obvious way to
benefit from
it I'm going to go with a working
assumption that we did it I don't have
evidence for that no evidence
whatsoever but a working assumption is
that we're
guilty yeah it looks like you know it
may it may have been you know Isis
related people or something but that
doesn't mean that's you know not who's
behind it
and um yeah it looks like we did it by
proxy exactly now that doesn't mean I'm
right
remember we're we're still in deep fog
of War so anything could anything could
be true all right I have very low
confidence in anything that anybody says
including me about this
situation but if you're trying to figure
it out
logically I would rule out the people
who don't benefit I don't see Ukraine
benefit I don't see Isis
benefit I don't see NATO benefit
I only see the military industrial
manufacturers
benefit so follow the
money all right and how the world how in
the world did Russia not figure out
exactly who the problem is because you
know they're torturing these guys right
the guys they
caught
uh russan benefits
oh so some of you are thinking that
Russia did it to himself you think Putin
did it to
himself I think that's the least likely
explanation of all the explanations I'd
put that that sort of Michelle Obama is
going to run for a president kind of
thinking it it's just too
cartoonish it's
cartoonish yeah thinking that he'll that
Michelle Obama is going to run for
president is a cartoon opinion but
thinking that Putin did a terrorist act
in his own heart of his own
country that's a little bit
cartoonish yeah he he's not going to do
something that makes him look weak and
vulnerable I don't see
that all right
um I'm not sure the terrorists know who
recruited him which if they don't know
who recruited him that kind of rules out
Isis doesn't
it if that's true if it let me let me
test this I'm just thinking of it right
now if it's
true that they don't know who recruited
them does that suggest
Isis cuz doesn't Isis doesn't Isis
recruit people who are already on their
side if feels like these guys had to get
talked into it with money Isis didn't
have any believers who were willing to
do for
free I
know this this has our CIA written all
over it but it doesn't mean it's
true it's impossible to know at this
point all right
um did anyone let me ask you a question
if you're using other social media
especially have any of you who are let's
say prot Trump seeing a sudden huge
decrease in Trump related um social
media so does anybody feel like they got
siloed and they're just not seeing any
Trump
stuff I'm just going to put that out
there because I I heard some reports
very
anecdotal that maybe uh there was some
new round of suppression coming so I'm
looking at your comments oh I see a
whole round of yeses now you're not are
you seeing it on on the
xplatform cuz I I only use x so I
haven't really
noticed you think that Trump material is
being
throttled I'm just seeing a wall of yes
so on Facebook Facebook and
Instagram well
wow PE people are confirming it like
crazy it's just a wall of gas so a lot
of people are just not seeing Trump
stuff now interesting do you know what
could really get Trump
elected suppressing his stuff that could
really help him I feel like everything
they're doing is somehow related to be
uh oh here's here's an
opinion uh some chin
connection bombings to be
terrorist oh so some are you saying that
you think
Putin um um jined up reasons to go
against the chin so it wouldn't be that
unusual if he did a false flag is that
what you're
suggesting all right I I will I will put
that suggestion in the
hopper that uh that there's some
suggestion that Putin has done a false
flag in the past in on a big issue the
chin situation but I don't think it's
confirmed that he was a false flag in
either case uh I'm still still going to
put that at the bottom of the list I
think that Putin doing doing it
himself has got to be the least likely
out
possibility all right
um again Elon Musk making news as he
always does um he he tweeted or posted
that uh please forward links to expost
to your friends so they know what's
actually happening some people still
believe the Legacy
Media
now what's the key word
there what's the key persuasion word in
this sentence some people still believe
the Legacy Media what's the key word the
persuasion
word this one's
easy which word is the persu I think
there's just a delay in the comments the
persuasion word I'll just tell
you oh I guess it wasn't as obvious as I
thought it would be some people are
saying Legacy the the correct answer is
still if you took the word still it
completely loses its power watch this
here's without the word
still some people believe the Legacy
Media and then what what do you say if
you hear that I'll tell you what I say I
say Oh you mean you know the accurate
media I listen to of course I believe it
why wouldn't I there's Elon must being a
troll and right-winger or
something now the the Legacy part isn't
the insult you think it is because
people don't know what that
means go go on the street and ask people
to Define legacy good luck they don't
even know what the word means they
literally don't know what the word means
it's just something that you know those
of us who like to talk about stuff in
public we know what it means and if you
if you're a technologist who's got
Legacy Computing systems you know what
it means in that context but people
don't really know what it means to have
Legacy Media what percentage of the of
the general population even knows what
Legacy Media
means 20% tops it's not a lot yeah so
the legacy is not the keyword keyword is
still because still makes you think past
the
sale still is the active word because it
tells you
that you're going to be there and other
people have already gotten there
first what's that
called The High Ground maneuver thank
you very much it's The High Ground by
suggesting that some people have gotten
to where you're going to get to
eventually but they got there first put
you in the position of still being in
the weeds and we know where you're going
to end up oh you can end up with us
eventually but at the moment you're
still in the
weeds that's
persuasion really good
persuasion yeah I use the word still uh
in my version of this when I mock people
who come at me online I often can make
them go away Forever by saying you still
you still you think the news is real or
you still believe the news in
2024 if you say you think the news is
real in
2024 it's suggesting that they haven't
caught up even without the word still
you put it in the form of a question and
it suggests you haven't caught up to me
yet that's The High Ground maneuver
people can't resist The High Ground
because they don't want to feel that
they're a lower level of awareness than
somebody they're talking with they they
can disagree about
facts but when you say I'm at a level
higher level of awareness and you'll get
there it really guess the people I like
that really guesss you on the insides
but you disagreeing about a fact is just
you get to yell at each other it doesn't
really have that
impact yeah still drinking in the
morning that's another
one all right I'm trying to understand
this Mike Gallagher
story who's uh who's resigning from
Congress but he chose a resignation date
that makes makes it impossible to
replace them in time which means they're
going to be operating at a deficit and
the margin will gets smaller and so
maybe the Republicans will lose control
and if the Republicans lose
control here's what Roger Stone
warns he says a billionaire Paul singer
now this is Roger Stone
so I I can't confirm the facts I'm
giving you his opinion
so Roger Stone says billionaire Paul
singer who paid for the original steel
dossier is that an is that an
Evidence did blyer Paul singer pay for
the steel dossier I don't remember that
can you confirm that in the
comments
huh well okay but anyway um Roger Stone
is certainly plugged in so he's saying
that this billionaire Paul singer paid
for the original steel dossier and the
uh Roger predicts that he will be
exposed as a man financing the Rhino
effort to turn over control of the house
to the Democrats and here's the key part
who will then pass a law borrowing Trump
from running for
president
whoa could that be
true could it be true that a billionaire
could buy off just a few politicians
because you only have to get a
few and if they leave Democrats get
control of everything before the
election and if they control everything
they pass a law that says somebody
accused of insurrection can't run for
president and then they take him
out now if you were a billionaire who
cared most about Trump not being the
president because if Trump as president
it might take down your whole
operation do you think that you would be
willing to spend oh I don't
know several million
dollars to make sure that Trump can't
win you might now you might say to me
Scott that's crazy because um he's a
republican so why would a republican
want the Democrats to have control of
everything
well he's smart nobody says he's not
smart so I would say it's because he
knows the Republicans are going to be in
charge if Trump wins and so this is his
one chance to keep Trump out of office
and probably Republicans will do fine
you know in the election they might take
back power at least in one house
so I don't
know I'm going to stop short of saying
that this is a confirmed
plan but um you know as I often say
design design is
Destiny if the design of what we see is
going to give us that outcome it's hard
to imagine that's not
intentional you know what I mean because
I don't believe that U Mike
Gallagher has given his reasons for his
spefic suspicious timing of
leaving doesn't it sound like he owes a
description of why and I haven't heard
it but I don't I don't want to blame him
of you know taking money if that's not
the case but I think we're all going to
be watching the next year to see where
Mike Gallagher ends up and does he end
up in some entity that has some
connection to a billionaire pole singer
I don't know I I guess I don't embrace
this Theory fully but there's certainly
enough questions that this is in the mix
you can't rule it out so let's say there
there's nothing about Roger Stone's
opinion that you could roll rule out as
being obviously
wrong
right could be true could be not be true
but it's not obviously wrong
so you know that's
something all right I heard from uh one
of my followers on X maybe on here as
well uh
George
pers he said to me that ever since I
posted this and it's something I wrote
uh on Facebook my liberal friends have
gotten completely quiet on the political
front nicely
done so I'm going to read you you've
heard you've heard this before but I'm
going to read it to you because now it
seems to be a little bit tested
and maybe you'd want to try it too so
one of my posts was levels of awareness
in politics and by the way this was
written as a high ground
maneuver this is The High Ground so
listen
for um the persuasion which tells you if
you're not thinking in the way I'm going
to describe well you might be a little
bit behind the rest of us it's going to
be just like Elon musk's still believe
the Legacy Media it should if I wrote it
correctly it should make you feel oh I
guess I need to catch up with everybody
all
right I said levels of awareness in
politics level one uh at level one you
believe they're the preferred news
source so you believe your news is true
and you don't sample any other sources
you're you're not even aware of any
other arguments you just watch MSNBC and
that's what you believe is true that's
level one level two a little bit
higher um you sample news from multiple
sources but you still believe that your
source is the real one and you think oh
yeah I hear the other story but that's
from the fake news so that's level two
at level three you're become aware that
all news is fake
everywhere at least in The Limited way
of leaving out context the facts might
be true but they might be out of context
and you realize that wait a minute it's
both sides es both sides do this and
then you're up that's when you're at
level three when you realize that the
news from everywhere is motivated um
more than you thought all right level
four is where you understand that none
of our experts are reliable no you can't
pick the good expert you do not have
that
power and they're not
reliable we used to think they were but
they're absolutely not uh some of the
experts might be right but none can be
trusted without verification it's
because of the Distortion of money all
of the
experts pretty much have some kind of
monetary um
stake so you can't really believe people
have a monetary stake but at level five
you start to see the gears of the
machine uh I call it Mike Ben style so
if you don't know Mike Benz you should
follow him on X and you will learn about
the Machinery the NOS the funding the
Atlantic Council the Carlile group and
all all these other entities that make
everything happen so once you see the
gears of the machine you know how the
the wrapup smear works you know how the
fake news works you know that the watch
dogs are just essentially uh they're
basically watch they're basically pit
bulls for the Democrats so once you
learn all
that you can see the gears of the
machine that's level
five
um and then and then you also realize
that we're probably under the control of
our intelligence professionals and that
that's the nature of the the country if
you still think we're a democratic
federal
republic then you're not at level
five so I think I'm at at least at level
five because I don't believe any of the
news I don't think our our experts are
credible
and it seems to me that the country is
not a republic in any
way and then in level six um this is the
level where you're dead because you know
too much also known as the Epstein level
now do you think that this would shut up
somebody who was arguing with you
because they watched MSNBC and they got
the right
answer it might it might because when
people realize that they're arguing from
a lower level of awareness where they
believe the things that their own side
tells them it's actually
embarrassing Ju Ju Just think about this
imagine me coming into your conversation
and
saying you still believe the
news and then what what do people always
say when you say do you still believe
the
news they always say but what about Fox
News they're sometimes wrong too
and then you say I didn't say there was
a good
one I'm I'm just mocking you for
believing any news but what about Fox
News no I'm not saying there's a good
one you have to get to my level where
you where everything is spun everything
is spun all the time want to hear an
example you know that quote from
um oh what's his name
uh who's the Wet Works guy Carville so
James Carville was talking to uh
Anderson Cooper and he said that the uh
Democrats needed to go harder you know
with the dirty tricks and advertising
and marketing and um they need to do
more of what he called
wetwork and what he described the
wetwork as is the basically the really
dirty campaign
ads now Anderson Cooper laughed um let's
say awkwardly because he knew he was
talking to somebody on his own team
Democrats and here's this Democrat
saying Wet Works when we're in the
context of people talking about trying
to assassinate RFK Jr and and Trump as
well so immediately the people on the
right leap to the conclusion that what
Carville was really saying is
assassinate
Trump that didn't
happen how many of you think that
Carville was secretly trying to send the
message to assassinate Trump did you
believe your own
news if you believed your own news that
story no he defined his terms
immediately there was no delay if you
hear it in a context like the fine
people hoax the fine people hoax is
exactly the same where you say the thing
that would be real easy to take out of
context but you but you know immediately
that it could be taken out of context so
you fix it immediately he said no what
works means yeah yes it's taken from the
colorful language of the CIA whacking
people but this context it means just
the
advertising he said it
directly he said it immediately and
there's no ambiguity to that at all but
if you if your news told you that he was
suggesting killing
Trump that didn't happen all right so
don't believe your own news don't
believe the other news don't believe any
of the news it's a spin
situation all right and that ladies and
gentlemen brings me to the incredible
conclusion of the best live stream
you're going to see today thanks for
joining everybody on the uh X and Rumble
and YouTube platforms I'm going to say a
few words to the local subscribers after
after I log off I'll start another
stream immediately just to uh do a
little closing show and the rest of you
thanks for joining I'll see you
tomorrow don't live in those lower
levels of awareness
