[Music]
good morning everybody
what an amazing day
yeah not everything's going right
that's for sure
but
this moment
this moment right now where we're
together
it's almost perfect
it's everything you want
awesome people
all together for a good reason
that's just like the meaning of life
right there but there is a way to make
it slightly better and all you need is a
copper mug or glass a tanker chalice or
steiner canteen jug or flask a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine of the day
the thing that makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous sympathetic
now go
is it just me or do i look kind of
military when i'm wearing this green
khaki t-shirt
well that doesn't matter
big news today uh the second single from
akira the don's new album featuring me
the the awesome lyrics
of me talking on this podcast which have
been
massaged and turned into a musical
event
now if you think that sounds like a bad
idea
you haven't heard it
let me just tell you
that that you ever see a movie where the
preview doesn't give you any idea what
the movie is about
well that's this
if i tell you that there's a musical
product that involves my voice talking
on these uh live streams
you'd probably say to yourself
i think i'd like a little less of that
but you have to see the artistry of
akira the dawn who took uh these two
concepts the livestream
uh content and music and put them
together and you'd be amazed how well it
works so take a look at that
it's the new one is called low
self-esteem is like a virus
just uh google me and akira the dawn
a-k-i-r-a
if you if you google akira
and my name it should all pop up
it's on all platforms
so
here's something we all know to be true
inflation
is going to be a big problem
why is
um why is
i'm just seeing some cutting comments
about me there on youtube
uh why is inflation going to be a big
problem in the wrong long run well we're
all good economists and we know it's
because the government has borrowed so
much money
which essentially creates money in the
marketplace which means that for the
same amount of goods and services
there's more money chasing it which
drives up prices
and that's inflation
right
well apparently not apparently not so i
learned something today
i read that
inflation indicators are way up today
we've got some kind of
30-year
record
inflation indicator
and here are the reasons in this article
given for why inflation seems to be up
number one
supply chain disruptions from the
pandemic
so you can't get enough stuff that means
there's fewer there's less stuff for the
same amount of money
uh increased labor costs makes sense
and material shortages probably also
from the pandemic
and
that's caused the number of companies to
increase prices and therefore there you
go you got your inflation
uh do you know what's missing from this
the
this is this is what's missing
that we borrowed a lot of money
so the three reasons given for why
inflation just spiked
are temporary
right
because supply chain disruptions are
based on the pandemic and it's easy to
assume that those will take care of
themselves
carpe i think you're right i think
you're right it is not your imagination
so here's my curiosity all right i as i
say too often in public i have a degree
in economics which is important to know
if you're new to this content
but having a degree of analytics doesn't
help you nearly as much as you think
because i look at this and say
why is the story about inflation going
up
not including the one thing we all seem
to think we know is the thing that makes
inflation go up instead it's three
somewhat temporary things
because we'll get our supply chain back
cost of materials will probably go down
once the pandemic's over and the cost of
labor
probably is going to go down too because
there are a lot of people who are out of
the workplace because they're getting
the free money what happens when people
don't give free money and they have to
go back to work
well then you have more employees
competing for jobs
and that should lower the or at least
put a lid on
increases
like that so
weirdly it looks like inflation is maybe
not a big problem or at least it's not
showing itself to be a problem yet
you know we we still assume in the long
run it will be
one of the things that kamala harris
brings to the white house and i don't
think she gets enough credit for this
there's a lot of
well you see a lot of criticism of the
vice president kamala harris but i don't
think that one of her values is being
appreciated enough
and that is that as long as kamala
harris is the vice president
it's nearly impossible to impeach joe
biden
because if you impeach joe biden
all you got was kamala harris
and if you're a republican
do you want more kamala harris
compared to joe biden
and as big a disaster as joe biden is
being
kamalaris might be worse
so believe it or not kamala harris's
greatest
contribution and i have to admit i
didn't see this coming
is to be so incompetent and terrible
as a leader
that you'd rather keep
a brain dead pile of organic matter
who has just up the most
important thing we were doing
and you'd still rather keep that guy
that's
how good the vice president is
by being bad
so if you want to be a good vice
president be a really bad one because
that's what your boss needs keeps you in
office
that's one of the mistakes that i think
trump made
he had a capable vice president
so if you you could you could actually
talk reasonably about impeaching
somebody like trump
because your backup
is a solid
solid performer with a solid record
right you might not like his politics
but he's a totally solid guy
weirdly i've been probably one of the
biggest supporters of mike pence and i'm
not even the fan
you know i i'm not a fan at all
but you can't deny
that well you could deny it we can deny
everything but in my opinion
mike pence is one of the most underrated
vice presidents of all time he could
have walked into the top job
i think we all agree on that he could he
could have walked into the job easily
and he never caused trouble i mean you
know the stuff at the end was an anomaly
but
i think he was a great vice president in
terms of doing doing what a vice
president is supposed to do
i thought al gore was good too but don't
hate me for that
here are my two favorite political words
disgraced and botched and we can use
them both
these days
because disgraced president biden
botched
the afghan withdrawal
yes disgraced and botched and i'm going
to use them uh
whenever i refer to biden from now on
i'm going to refer to him as disgraced
president biden
who botched the afghanistan withdrawal
um as someone pointed out on twitter
this morning when i said that
uh
that we don't use the word
uh disgraced for all politicians
um sometimes if it's a democrat
such as governor cuomo
he's not called disgraced he's called
embattled
he's embattled he's not disgraced
he's embattled
and that would be a you know a cnn msnbc
kind of a framing i don't know if that
which of those used that word
um and how about uh somebody who's doing
a lot of crazy stupid incompetent things
uh sometimes it's just controversial
yeah it's not botched
it's controversial
so there you go
i'm going to report on this but i feel
like i don't know all the details but
sam harris
seemed to be tweeting that he was eating
his own tweet in other words eating his
own words
from january of 20
in which he was expressing some
satisfaction
that we finally had a good president in
president biden
now you might know some of you that
early on in the
the trump cycle of the presidency i
think he was still running for president
i had a on-air discussion
debate
but more of a discussion
with sam harris in which i was saying
that
he was maybe missing some of the
finer benefits of a potential trump
presidency
and he was very anti-trump and we had a
long conversation of that and you know
people had strong views about how that
went
people who liked
sam harris and disliked trump thought he
made a monkey of me
people who liked me and
liked trump thought i made a great
presentation to make my point
but today it appears that sam harris is
eating his own words about biden
and i would love to know
i don't know if he'll talk about this
directly probably i would love to know
if he thinks
trump could have done better
because he doesn't say that
right you know he's showing some remorse
about biden which is a little different
from saying that you know he wanted
trump to be president but let me ask you
this
is there anybody in the world
who doesn't believe trump would have
done the afghan withdrawal better
now of course he had an earlier deadline
he had a may deadline and and biden got
that extended which was good work
i would say that was good work i think
we did need to extend the deadline
um and i think probably trump would have
done the same so i'm not sure that
that's any any point of comparison
but
don't you believe trump would have done
this better even if you thought he was
bad in every other way you know even if
you're a democrat a big anti-trumper
don't you believe he would have done
this better
because i feel like i feel like
there's no way to know right it's pure
speculation
but it feels like it
i guess we'll never know
so yeah the press conference in which
biden talked about it was a plain
embarrassment
compare this to the types of
embarrassment we had when trump was
president and at press conferences
were there any embarrassments when trump
did a press conference
yes yes there were
so this you know biden is not the first
president who was embarrassing
trump was embarrassing but what's the
difference hmm
what is the difference
oh here's the difference
the thing that was embarrassing about
trump never happened
it was just reported that it happened
for example do you remember the
embarrassing time that president trump
suggested you should maybe drink bleach
to cure your coronavirus
very embarrassing
and it also didn't happen
it was fake news at least 75 percent of
the country believes they saw it with
their own eyes and heard it with their
own ears and it literally never happened
it's a long story about why you believe
that but it didn't happen
same with the fine people hoax
an embarrassing moment for the president
right president trump embarrassing the
country by saying
that some of those neo-nazis were fine
people
except
it literally never happened
you think you saw it you think you heard
it with your own ears you even think you
went back and watched it again
but it didn't happen
it literally didn't happen
it's just a fake edits and stuff making
it look like it happened
so
i would rather be embarrassed
by fake news about a president
then i would rather be embarrassed about
the actual freaking thing that happened
that's a pretty big difference
so
here is my advice for republicans in
this delicate period
instead of saying things like i don't
know who's in charge
which doesn't really land you know it's
just sort of a talking point well i
don't even know who's in charge of the
white house blah blah blah let's change
that to
demand to know who is making the actual
decisions in the white house
see the difference
demand to know
who's making the decisions
because the decision was so bad
you need to know
right so instead of asking the question
or instead of just speculating in sort
of a critical way that you know biden's
not in charge that doesn't really stick
does it
i mean we all feel that so it's true
like it has a element of truth to it or
at least it feels true
but it's way stronger if you demand
information
so instead of just making this general
claim and let it lay there
doing nothing
just demand
a full accounting of how the decision
was made so you know who's in charge
because i don't think we know who's in
charge legitimately
legitimately we don't know who's in
charge
normally that would be the sort of thing
that i would regard as political talking
point
but i feel this is a special case
i feel that we actually don't know who's
in charge
am i wrong
like i don't i don't feel that that is a
biased
political statement anymore at one point
at one point you could have recently
said although you're just being a team
player you know biden's not that bad
you know he's getting by
um
but i'd like to ask
mark cuban
so
i don't know mark if you ever watch
these live streams these days
but you know early on in the in the uh
campaign biden versus trump
um
mark cuban was a solid supporter of
biden and thought that his mental
faculties were sufficient to the job
and that was actually one of the biggest
the biggest points of support for biden
is that yeah he looks when he speaks in
public he looks a little uh
a little uncertain
but privately he's fine
i don't know if he still believes that
or if maybe there was a rapid decline
whatever so i'd love to see
mark cuban's current updated opinion
and keep in mind
i'll say this again mark cuban is one of
the people i consider a smart
analyst of public events right
so
i'd like to see if he's changed his
opinion because that would be meaningful
to me because i respect his opinion in
general on a lot of stuff
um biden said that he will be hunting
down the isis k folks who
were behind the uh attack at the
kabul airport which killed
a lot of people including american
service
people but when you hear joe biden say
that he will hunt down isis k
do you say to yourself
will you do it as effectively as you did
the withdrawal
if the context of this is a botched
withdrawal how do you feel about his
capability of hunting down isis k
in a country
that we just got beaten by a bunch of
goat herders with
well you know
do you believe it
it feels like an empty threat doesn't it
but
here's uh here's the other way to take
this
i'm pretty sure
there's a secret agreement going on here
somewhere or more than one
do you have that feeling
do you feel there's some kind of secret
agreement going on
i don't know what it is but i'll
speculate
i feel like one of the secret agreements
is that we're going to work with the
taliban to
kill al qaeda and isis
or maybe at least isis
maybe not al qaeda you know could be
split split difference
but i feel like both
and i feel like
what would who would have a better
chance of killing isis in afghanistan
who would have the better chance would
it be
america staying there with what assets
we would likely put there or would it be
the taliban on the ground
torturing people to get that information
about who is left
i feel like the taliban could take care
of this better than we could
because they're not going to cut any
corners right they're going to do
whatever is the most brutal way
to get rid of isis because isis is their
enemy as well
so
is it possible
now
can somebody do a fact check on me
i need a fact check on this because this
is an important point and i'm not
confident about it
fact-check me please
true or false
the taliban does not have international
ambitions
meaning the taliban doesn't want to
conquer other countries it just wants to
be left alone now it did make a problem
um protecting al-qaeda at one point
but at the moment
i imagine they would see that as a
mistake and one that they would not want
to reproduce
and so i'm asking this question have
trump and biden collectively because
they you know in a sense it was a joint
decision
over time
have have trump and biden both made the
right move
by putting the taliban back in charge
for american interests
a huge disaster for the afghan people i
i think most of us would agree
but well or is it or is it
if the taliban can take over so easily
doesn't that suggest that they have more
support in the public than we think
i don't know
not sure about that but
anyway we may have reached a situation
where america is better off because the
international terrorists the al-qaedas
may be suppressed by the taliban better
than we could have done it
and i'm just putting that out there as a
maybe i'm not saying that's true
but you can't really speculate
accurately
on how any of this is going to go it
could turn out fine
you know the
of course
the tragedies that are happening right
now are
major tragedies
but in the long run for american
interests
taliban in charge might be the best
possible outcome
because if the afghan army were in
charge do you think they could take care
of isis k
do you think the afghan army could have
taken care of al qaeda
apparently not
so the only the only possible law
enforcement we could have over there
against these terrorist groups
is the freaking taliban
right
now i again i'm way over my you know uh
way over my
let's say competence level talking about
any of this stuff but it's what it looks
like and i one of the things i like to
talk about news is what it looks like
even if we don't know what's true
all right apparently there are only a
thousand or so of these isis k people
in the whole country and it's pretty
hard to find a thousand people if you're
america but i don't know if it's hard to
find a thousand people if you're the
taliban and you're on the ground
we'll find out
all right
um
david sacks who you should follow on
twitter
uh very successful uh famous investor in
tech stocks and stuff but anyway he said
this this is one of those things where
you see somebody say something or you
hear it and you say to yourself
okay that's so obvious why did i think
of that
here's the most obvious
point
that for some reason i didn't think of
it until i read it and here it is from
david sacks i reject the idea that we
had to choose between bagram and the
um
the kia airport
the kabul airport you keep both assets
until the withdrawal is over
what here we're having this big
conversation about whether we should
have kept bagram or kabul
and then david sacks says you idiots you
keep both of them until you're done
you know why
because you need two of them
you need two
two is better than one
and apparently the bag the background
airport had also a wide perimeter it's
easier to defend
so we went from the one that's easy to
defend and already had
facilities for processing people
to one that's impossible to defend
because it's in the city center
and doesn't have the facilities to
process people
that was a huge mistake
huge mistake there's some of these
mistakes
that i'm allowing we might find out some
information later that would make it not
look so bad
but i don't know what you would find out
about this
to me i can't imagine any scenario in
which david sacks is wrong
we should have kept both bases
until we were done
does that am i wrong that that seems so
completely obvious after the fact right
we're all geniuses after the fact but
obviously i didn't think of it
i actually got caught in the you have
you heard greg guffeld
he talks about the prison of two ideas
we we like to think like there are two
options for everything because there are
two sides one side likes this option the
other side likes this option two options
for everything
and it makes it blinds you to the fact
that there almost always is other
options and the other option was
so insanely obvious
but not until david sacks tweeted it
this is the most obvious thing
that i didn't think of maybe in my
entire life it's like yeah keep both of
them
all right
now i'm going to do the impossible
the country is finally united around our
dislike of how biden has handled this
whole situation
do you think there is any argument any
argument at all
that could be made
that would put biden in a better light
given what's happened now you know i'm
not a biden supporter
everybody knows that
but you know what i am
i'm a president and supporter
yeah i can't turn that off
when trump is president i'm a president
supporter
not just a trump supporter about some
topics other topics maybe not so much
but i'm always a president supporter it
doesn't matter who it is obama yeah bush
you know once they're in
it's one thing to fight about it before
they get in but once they're in
then i'm just an american right and i
just want them to do a good job and such
so i'm going to do what nobody is doing
for our president
i am going to give him a defense
because nobody is doing it
and i think that
just as an american
who respects the office of the
presidency forget about the person
i respect the office of the presidency i
am going to give him
the first defense
you've ever heard it goes like this and
this defense
will only make sense to people who have
experience in big organizations
all right
big organizations
if you've ever been in a big
organization and you're the head of the
organization and you ordered something
to happen
that was unpopular
with the people who had to execute it
what happened
did the people who needed to execute
this unpopular order
give you all the options accurately
because the people at the lower levels
are going to try to manage the boss
have you ever heard of that managing up
it's a thing
it's where the people at the lower level
are so sure that the boss is an idiot or
they need to make a different
decision than the boss is telling them
that they will
hide information that would help them
they will manage the facts they will
reduce the options and give you only
options that look bad for what you don't
want to do they don't want to do
right
now before i go on i want everybody in
the comments to look at other people who
have experience in big organizations
and watch them confirming that this is a
normal phenomenon it's a normal
phenomenon that if people think the boss
is making the wrong decision
they will resist in a passive way that
you can't quite determine
if
if they're really
cooperating or are they intentionally
killing something
by doing it poorly
now look at the comments
right because if you don't have
experience in big organizations you
don't necessarily believe this is true
or common what i'm going to add to the
conversation is it's common
that's the important part if you don't
get that as common
everything else i say won't have an
impact all right i want you to know that
it's ordinary
that the boss can't get his way
or her way all right
now let's put yourself into the afghan
situation
do you think that the uh the people on
the ground the military
do you think the military
wanted to remove everybody from
afghanistan on the timeline that either
trump
or biden wanted either trump or button
doesn't matter which timeline you pick
do you think the generals
who are looking for jobs in the
manufacturing
industry who makes military stuff after
they leave afghanistan and they've got
they've got other bosses to please don't
they they have their current boss which
is the president but then they also have
their five years from now boss
or sooner
that is making weapons
and if you've got a war you can sell
more weapons
and you can make an argument that it's
in the interest of the united states to
stay to keep fighting those isis guys
and in al-qaeda all right so here's my
defensive biden
goes like this
biden and by the way you could replace
trump
you could actually replace biden and
trump and you get the same outcome
that this is my speculation here
by nor trump but it was biden
biden says we're going to get out of
there by this date
and then the generals give him shitty
options
well
if you do that this is gonna blow up
if you do it this way this will go to
hell
uh the taliban will take over we'll be
embarrassed we're gonna lose all our
weaponry uh everything's gonna fall to
hell but hey hey if that's your order mr
president you know we'll we'll start
doing it if that's if that's what you
tell us we advise against it
but if that's what you're telling us
we'll start doing it and then what do
they do
they start botching it
they slow roll it have you ever heard
that term
slow roll
that's what people do in a corporation
when they don't like what the boss told
them to do
oh they do it but they slow roll it
okay now let's say you're the boss and
you realize that a slow roll is being
played on you
what do you do
in the comments
those with experience
inform the rest of the people what you
do you're the leader you're the ceo
you're the president
and the people below you won't won't
follow your order
they're slow rolling
what do you do
fire everybody that's one way to go
fire everybody
okay but what do the next people do
probably slow roll it again
i'm not even sure that would work it
would take a while and it would be
disruptive and all that stuff what's the
other thing you can do
what is the other thing you can do
do it anyway
have you ever seen a leader do this
all the generals come in and say if you
do this everybody's going to die it'll
be the worst thing in the world and you
know your generals are with you
what do you do
you tell them to do it anyway
they tell you the whole world will fall
apart if you order us to do this but you
know they're with you
they're slow rolling you here's what you
do
you tell them to do it anyway by that
date and you tell them that if their
heads on the ground it's their
fault
and then you'll fire them
do it anyway
and if you up then i'll fire you
but
i'll tell you what i'm not going to do
is i'm not going to let you
tell me what's going to happen you can
tell me you'll do it incompetently
but you're going to do it
because what's more important is getting
out and if you can't give me a good way
to get out of afghanistan
if you incompetent who are
trying to make this happen if you won't
even give me a good option
to get out of afghanistan you're going
to take the bad option
and you're going to get out of
afghanistan because let me tell you the
thing that's not going to change
the decision
we're getting out of afghanistan
you can do it right or you can do it
 wrong
but we're getting out of afghanistan
that's leadership
did that happen
maybe
maybe
we don't know right because we don't
even know who's in charge
but if you said to me what would
leadership look like
it would look like this
it would look like a botched
disgraced
move
and we might find out someday that his
generals were the problem
and we might find out that he overrode
the generals and said look this is a
leadership decision
 ton of people are going to die
no matter what
no matter what
every path
 ton of people die
so the leader says we're going to take
care of the united states and the
on people are going to die let's let's
take it as a given
that every path has a ton of people
dying
you can't avoid that part so you might
as well do what's good for the united
states and you know what that is
get the out of afghanistan
messy
if it's the only option you're going to
give me
 generals
if the if you generals will only give me
bad options i'm going to take the bad
 option but i'll tell you the
option i'm not going to take is you're
in charge because you didn't get elected
you did not get elected if the only way
i can get out is messy
we're getting that messy
deal with it
that's leadership
i don't know if that happened
but you can't rule it out based on what
we've seen
so the the big question i would have is
was the military slow rolling him
right if i were an investigative
journalist
this is the question i would be digging
into
was anybody slow rolling him
maybe not it could be everybody was just
doing their job as best they could and
the president botched it and nobody told
them he was watching it because here's
the part that doesn't make sense
is why the military wouldn't have
stopped him from making such a big
obvious mistake
because they could have
they could have right
if the president says to the generals
hey generals i've got an idea why don't
you
send the troops out into certain harm
for no particular benefit
is the general going to follow that
order
no
because it's too obviously stupid
the general is going to say uh other
generals what are we going to do about
this
better talk to somebody
that's not a good idea
but here was this exa this situation
where it looks so obvious to all of us
keep both of the bases open or at least
bagram and you know get the people out
before you do blah blah it's so obvious
to us
but there were no generals who was
obvious to
it feels like slightly more likely based
on the little bit of we can know about
the fog of war that was going on it
feels to be a little bit more likely
that they were slow rolling him
and he did the only thing a leader can
do
you've got two bad choices and he took
the better of the bad choices just tell
him to do it anyway and we'll will eat
the consequences which are in fact
tragic
all right that was my defense
now remember i'm acting as a patriot
all right so i'm not taking sides right
now
this is just
just pure american patriot
uh giving a legitimate defense
to my sitting president
no matter who he is
so i think he deserves a defense and i
don't know that he could make that
defense himself
because he'd be you know he'd be calling
out his generals etc he probably
couldn't make that argument
now again i don't know if it's true
i can't assert that it's likely even but
it feels like it
all right
we all know that we should follow the
data
uh and follow the science right
um here are the three
worst pieces of advice you'll ever get
number one follow the data
number two worst piece of advice
be yourself
always be yourself
bad advice and number two three trust
the experts
worst advice
of all time those three things and you
know what's interesting about all three
of these it's the most common advice we
give in the world
the most common advice is be yourself
do you know if i were myself
i'd never would have taken a shower in
my life
i i would insult people i saw i'd i'd be
i'd be having every disgusting habit
i wouldn't work hard
don't be yourself
that's crazy
try to be better than that try to try to
improve
because being yourself would still be a
baby
didn't you improve
did you grow up
did you get a job
how about being better than yourself and
making that your standard all the time
like is there anybody here who got good
enough and you're like well
i've achieved my full standard of life
i guess i'd i can be myself now because
i'm as good as you can get
keep growing yeah as i see in the
comments keep growing that's better
advice
but follow the data here's why that's
stupid advice as i've said before
because you can't
you don't have that skill
that would be like me telling you make
sure before every decision that you use
your psychic powers
that's good advice right use your
psychic powers to see the future
before making any decision that sounds
like sound advice
uh except we don't have psychic powers
follow the data
follow the facts the sound advice
real good advice follow the data except
we don't have those skills
we don't know how
here's here's what happens when you
follow the data
you don't agree on
ivermectin hydroxychloroquine masks
lockdowns vaccinations or climate change
in other words every important decision
following the data
and also believing the experts
got us to a point where we don't agree
on anything important
so can you follow the data is that good
advice when we can see plainly it
doesn't work for any topic there's not a
single freaking topic
in which following the data
helps
and once you realize that
well maybe that's a little freeing
but let's uh let's compare that
so what would you
well what would you do about a world in
which you can't follow the data i would
suggest that we should have some kind of
informal
data
following experts people who are not
experts in the fields
that you know these studies are at but
they're experts are looking at data they
could be economists or statisticians or
whatever some scientists but i would
love to see some independent not fact
checkers
not fact checkers because fact checkers
aren't smart enough they're just
journalists you know researching stuff
but i like to see
data checkers
a small group of people let's say a
dozen people who have the kinds of jobs
where you could trust that they know how
to look at data at least
and i want all of them to look at all of
our data and say all right you 12 data
specialists
and i'll say nate silver all right so
i'm gonna i'm gonna throw nate silver in
there
uh just as one example now i know you
could say hey he got something wrong or
you don't like him for one reason or
another but that's the type of person
you want you want somebody with that
that kind of background and i would
argue that naysilver is pretty objective
you know as as objective as people can
be these days
so that would be my first uh
first thing is that instead of fact
checkers we need data analysis experts
to just tell us if the data is reliable
or not just reliable or not reliable
that's it
not a fact check just reliable or not
reliable
and
let me give you an alternative which i
don't understand
so this is one of those weird things
that i think is maybe a
confirmation bias on my part possibly
but i'll throw it out here and let you
follow it just for fun
you know you know that all the smart
people always say
follow the money
right if you're going to predict who
murdered somebody well find out who had
a financial advantage if you're going to
find out who did any bad thing
find out who had a financial advantage
right so following the money
tends to be very predictive
but it's way more predictive
than it should be
because it even seems indirectly
predictive let me give you an example if
somebody murders somebody to get the
insurance
that's a that's a direct
correlation between the money and the
action
but they're all these situations where
it's a little less direct
and they still predict which is the fun
part let me give you an example
um
if if vaccinations uh have booster shots
will the pharmaceutical companies that
control the data we see about
vaccinations will they make more money
or less
if booster shots are a good idea
more money
and indeed
it looks like the data is telling us
that booster shots are going to really
help
so could money have predicted that we
would need booster shots and we'll need
more than just the next one
yes
money would predict that even though
i'll bet if you dug into it it would be
really hard to find anybody who said
yeah we're going to do this for more
money
i think you'd find lots of people making
independent decisions that in their
minds they think actually make sense
but why is it that follow the money is
so predictive
if all of those other variables are in
there
why is that one variable
so darn predictive let's give you
another one
uh what would could you have predicted
that we would leave so much equipment
behind in afghanistan
well the people who are leaving it
behind and therefore wasting money are
the government the government doesn't
work for money it just taxes you
so the government doesn't mind too much
how much money it spends you know
relative to you and i spending money
but
the people who make this military
equipment would really like us to leave
it behind
so we'll have to buy new ones if we need
it
so there would be a gigantic financial
advantage for the makers of military
equipment if we left it behind
and there wouldn't be anybody who would
have a financial disadvantage if we left
it behind
so the money predicts
that we would have left it behind
even though every bit of your common
sense says we wouldn't
right
all of your common sense
says we would not leave all of that
behind
but if you followed the money
it suggests we would
and that's what happened is that a
coincidence
why is it that even when you can't tell
what the mechanism is that connects the
money
to the decision
it's still consistent let me give you
another one
could you uh
could you predict that black lives
matter would stop their protests when
biden became leader
probably because probably they would
stop getting as much funding because
whoever was funding them
needed them to do their thing for
political reasons
and so
were all of the things that black lives
matter protested fixed
no
if you looked at all the reasons that we
think black lives matter did what they
did
that's all still there
and yet the protest stopped
but if you use money to predict and you
said to yourself wait they'll get money
during the political process because
they're helpful
but after the political process of the
election's over and biden wins they're
not helpful anymore
in fact they'd be unhelpful so the money
would stop and then they would stop
protesting and that's what happened
um
did you see the only fans the fan site
where you can go on and do little videos
and people will pay you for them
um they they started and made their
fortune with porn
or adult stuff
and that they said they were going to
ban it
and then they reversed their ban and now
they say they're going to do it again
and they're going to let the porn back
on there was that predictable
yeah
follow the money
as soon as they said they weren't going
to do it didn't you and everybody else
in the world say
what
they're getting rid of their
primary business model and they're just
going to give it to somebody else
because somebody else would just do it
right if they stop doing it somebody's
going to say well that's the best part
of your business i'll just make a
business and just do that
and so they reversed it now one of the
stories about that is a former icu nurse
who makes
thousand dollars a month
on only fans doing
adult entertainment
and what would that predict
what does it predict
if an icu nurse can make two hundred
thousand dollars a month on only fans
well one of the things it predicts is
that there will no longer be any hot
nurses
still be a lot of nurses
but you should expect there will be
fewer of them
and none of the hot ones
all the hot ones gonna go to only fans
and make two hundred thousand dollars a
month now i know here's what you're
gonna say to yourself scott
people are not gonna
 themselves out
just for money because nurses are people
who care about people and they you know
they want to help they're by nature
they're people who want to help people
in need
well you just wait a couple of months to
see how many hot nurses you see
i predict
zero all right we'll see
um the
officer who shot and killed ashley
babbitt on the january 6th
uh
bad stuff that happened at the
capitol
he is now uh made himself known michael
byrd lieutenant michael byrd very
experienced says he thinks he did the
right thing thinks he stopped he thinks
he saved a lot of people
uh one element to the story that's
important is he's black
he's a black man
who a lot of people think shot a white
woman
without good cause people think this i'm
not saying that in my opinion but people
think that
now if these races were reversed
do i even need to finish the sentence
you you can just stop after you say if
the races were reversed and then you
just fill in all the rest of the things
i was going to say because you're going
to hear everybody say that
but i would like to uh tell you about uh
you should always follow people's
predictions and see how well they do so
you know if you should follow them in
the future
i believe i'm the only person i heard
who said i didn't believe he would be
charged with a crime
let's fact check that did any of you
hear anybody else say in public you know
a public person did you hear anybody
else say that you didn't think that guy
would be charged with a crime because it
wasn't one because it didn't look like
one did anybody else say that
because to me i didn't see any crime
there at all
so i saw the individuals may have said
it i see in the comments but did anybody
in public say that
besides me
uh somebody says michael tracy maybe
we don't have car information on that so
that's a open question
right
uh
i see people asking questions whether
robert barnes questioned that or not
well
um this is how you test your bubble
if you were in the bubble or you were
you know on a side you saw that and you
just immediately took aside
um i try not to be in the bubble as much
as possible i don't think anybody can
completely avoid it but i just didn't
see a crime
i i saw somebody who avoided
potentially more danger and protected
the capital and had no idea how much
extra
you know violence there might be
and it was tragic and i don't you know
of course i don't want anybody to have
died
but
um i didn't see a crime
so i'll just say that if you did you did
but i didn't
um
china is
i guess they vaccinated two billion
people so far and they're using coercion
part of their coercion is the social
credit now it's not
this the type of coercion being used in
china to get people vaccinated doesn't
seem to be the same everywhere but in
one region
uh they're using it to damage your
social credit score
i feel like more of that's going to come
on right
um i feel like more of that's coming
so and i wonder if china has a
competitive advantage over the west
because they can force people to do
stuff
how much of a competitive advantage will
that be
um
all right
so
um
and apparently they also will in china
they'll deny you access to government
services and corporations are putting
pressure on people etc
and
things are going to get ugly there
what i wonder about
is if the chinese public will resist
now if i were doing a persuasion war
against china what would it look like
what would you do if you were let's say
an intelligence agency
in another country
and you wanted china to do as poorly as
possible
including the coronavirus even if you
thought it would come back to bite you
in the ass later but you wanted them to
do poorly what would you do what rumors
would you start
well you'd start rumors that the
vaccination they use in china is
dangerous
right
because i would be
surprised if china is not promoting that
rumor here
don't you think don't you think china
might be behind a little bit of the
ivermectin hydroxychloroquine
you know vaccinations over your kind of
stuff maybe
they might be and if they're not why not
because it would be the obvious play
um and so the question is are we doing
the same thing to them if not why not
um
let's see just looking at some of your
uh lots of propaganda
did you hurt your middle finger yes
if you're
there's my uh unfortunately if you uh
smash your finger on the the nail side
it you get the bruise under the nail and
it takes a year
for that to grow out they've had other
nail injuries
it hurt when it happened
oh a micro lesson on how to know if
you're in a bubble
not bad the micro lesson that i have
queued up that i haven't recorded yet is
how to brag
without looking like a jerk
because we live in a world in which
telling people that you have some skills
is really good for you
but if you tell them directly you look
like a jerk
so how can you brag without being a jerk
because bragging has utility right it
makes people
respect you more if if they hear it in
the right context not if you brag
so
i will be teaching only the subscribers
on the locals platform
one more micro lesson
and
they will have hundreds of micro lessons
by the end of this year
i think hundreds at least many dozens
and they will have superpowers and if
you listen to the people on locals
talk about it you'll see that they are
gaining superpowers uh with each of
these two to four minutes each and it
gives you a brand new skill that you
didn't have in just two minutes
all right
and that
is my show for today so
goodbye for now youtube
