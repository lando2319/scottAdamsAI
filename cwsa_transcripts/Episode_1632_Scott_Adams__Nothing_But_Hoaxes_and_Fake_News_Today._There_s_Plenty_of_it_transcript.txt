everybody and welcome to coffee with
Scott Adams probably the best thing
you'll ever experience in your entire
life you may feel some tingling early on
don't worry the tingling is nothing to
worry about it's not a comorbidity it's
actually a sign that your day is
starting up right and man as it started
up right we got fake news we got hoaxes
we got all kinds of stuff coming at you
is China listening you ask
probably
if they're not I'm going to make sure
that they do but first
before we get going how would you like
to take it up a notch I know you would
all you need is a copper mug or a glass
of tanker gels inside the canteen jug of
flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite beverage I
like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure it's the
dopamine hit of the day it's called the
simultaneous slurp no sip sip it's not a
slurp
and it happens now go
uh oh Your Meme timing over on locals is
excellent excellent
well I knew there would be a day
eventually
when a hundred percent of the news was
hoaxes
now I don't know if we're quite there
but at the end of this I want you to
tell me if there was any news that was
real today
because it looks like it's all fake to
me or at least partially let me start
with uh the fake news that fooled me for
about
a half a minute until somebody told me
it was fake news
uh there was a there's a fake old
looking uh Cartoon it looks like it was
made in the 30s you know really black
and white and it looked like
it presented itself as a story of how to
take over the world
by introducing a fake weaponized virus
and making everybody get vaccinations
now when I looked at it I thought huh
that seems like a weird coincidence that
somebody had a
fictional plot in the 30s that was
similar to something that happened
so I tweeted it thinking whoa that's a
weird coincidence
but it's not a coincidence it's just a
fraud so it wasn't it wasn't such a
coincidence now of course what happened
when I uh tweeted
what I thought people would see as a
coincidence
well people thought that it was proof
that everything they said was true that
there was a global conspiracy to
introduce this virus and they've been
planning it since the 30s
that wasn't what I had in mind
and people thought Scott you've finally
woken up
finally you woke up and found out this
plot has been brewing since the 30s and
there's proof in that comic right there
well that's not exactly what happened it
was more like I thought huh
somebody had a fictional plot that just
looked like the real world that's what I
thought it was but anyway I deleted it
is debunked
here's a
I am seeing things that are just rocking
my whole world
I I saw some people who looked credible
but on Twitter you can't really tell
who were saying that it is a hoax
to imagine the 75 percent of the people
who are dying from covet have
comorbidities
and that that hoe started with a
ABC News thing that they got wrong
and that from there is spread and that
there's nothing like that going on
what
is that possible
is it possible that comorbidities
didn't make a difference because I
Googled it immediately of course
and you know there were plenty of
stories that suggested comorbidities
were you know triple the risk Etc
but have you heard this or is there
something about the definition of things
um
but but let me just ask you have you
heard
anybody push back on that like the
entire thing was a hoax and the
comorbidities didn't really predict as
much as you thought
has anybody said that
because I'm seeing people actually
debunk it like oh it's well known it's
been debunked that comorbidity thing has
been totally debunked
because I would be really interested if
that were true because I can't imagine
that's true
yeah
and nobody else saw that right
so this might be one of those news
bubble things where there might be a
bubble where where people think that's
been debunked
and I think that the idea of it was
Market Trader
that I'm just going to get rid of stupid
people like you really need to take your
criticism up to a level of not
idiot really
so Market Trader you're gonna go in the
In The Biz bag here
um just raise your game a little bit
just a little bit a little bit
all right but it made me think that
maybe the purpose of that was to make
people think that they were not safe and
they better get their vaccinations
I don't know well I don't know what the
purpose of it would be
there's another uh hoax and or a hoax
about the hoax you decide
and the hoax or the hoax about the hoax
apparently China is doing a big push
to it looks like they bought off some
influencers
and the influencers that are apparently
bought off by China are saying that
there's no uyghur genocide
so you're seeing a bunch of you know
social media things on that
uyghur genocide there's nothing like
that going on now here's the clever part
they're defining genocide very narrowly
to be you know Mass killing or mass you
know stopping birth rate one of those
things
and the people who China has apparently
bought off to influence is saying no no
there is no genocide
and stop saying genocide because that
would say we're killing people and
that's not what's happening
and we're not doing anything about the
birth rate because the birth rate in the
the uyghur territory is actually higher
than the birth rate of the rest of the
country
so and the uyghurs would have more
children
than the Chinese Ethnic Chinese
elsewhere
have you ever heard that that the
uyghurs were were having more children
even during the time that China was
clamping down and having children they
gave a little bit of extra leeway I
guess for cultural reasons of the
uyghurs they claim they claim who knows
who knows what's true that's just the
claim right I'm not saying it's true
just to claim
but
if uh if what China wanted us to believe
is that there's nothing especially bad
going on whatsoever except that they're
dealing with a what was a pretty big
terrorism problem in that community and
they figured out a way to
would say the child and all they're
doing is sort of re-educating people to
not be terrorists how could that be bad
well here's my question to you China
if any of that is true why don't you let
us take a look
you don't have to tell us what's true
you don't have to correct the hoax
you don't have to do anything
just open the door
here let me tell you how to I'd like to
demonstrate this for China
in case they don't know how to solve
their gigantic gigantic PR problem
see I don't have a good prop but but
imagine I was holding a key in my hand
and I would like to teach them how to
solve this gigantic problem
you invite some reporters in from other
countries and then you walk over to the
the door
behind which is all the uyghurs
being either re-educated or retrained or
possibly massively abused in a human
rights sentence now if you'd like to
clear it up
I'll take a little item it's probably
about this big it's called a key
and you would put that in the lock of
the front door of your uyghur retraining
facilities and you turn it clockwise
about this far
and then there might be some kind of a
handle situation and then you would pull
or maybe turn that and then you would
swing forward the thing called a door
and then the people would walk through
that that door possibly look around and
talk to the the uyghurs and uh they
might come up with an opinion that
totally agreed with China
maybe you know if you have a problem
that can be solved that easily
wouldn't you do it
if the worst problem that you had could
be solved by doing this
and then you're done you're completely
done you've just solved your biggest
problem
hmm
but apparently they would rather buy
influence and have them talk about it
than to completely solve the problem by
heat
I guess China hadn't figured out how to
use the key
now it's bad enough you haven't used the
 spoon
because you got your chopsticks that's a
that's a Jerry Seinfeld joke by the way
I'm stealing that
you know it's bad enough that you
couldn't figure out how to use a spoon
you had to use chopsticks I'm just
joking about that part
but you don't know how to use a key you
don't know how to open a door say to
take a look
all right so remember you should assume
anything that comes from a government is
a lie unless they can prove it's true
the burden of proof is on the government
not just the United States
but every government the burden of proof
is on them to prove they're not doing
something bad it's not like an
individual with a burden of proof is on
the the state blah blah all right
um
so I'm going to say that's probably not
a hoax it's probably a hoax that it's a
hoax
meanwhile uh China fired Germany's Navy
chief
which is weird
so there was a guy who's the top guy in
Germany's Navy
and uh China fired him for saying that
uh
the Germany should get closer to Russia
to to basically team up against China
China didn't like that so they they
fired him
now that's not the way it's reported
if you've seen it reported they probably
don't word it the way I did they don't
say China fired him
but what else happened
how do you explain it any other way
is there any other explanation do you
think that Russia
put pressure on Germany to say no no no
fire this guy because he keeps saying we
should be friends with Russia no it
probably wasn't Russia
um do you think that Germany itself the
people in Germany uh
are so offended by the idea that we
should have an out we should Ally Ally
with Russia against China is that idea
so
so you know unacceptable
that Germany fired him for their own
reasons
I think China fired him meaning that
Germany's relationship with China
depended on him being fired
I literally I think China fired him
if that doesn't scare you
I don't know I will if China can fire
people in your government and I think
that just happened in Germany you better
would be worried all right here's
another uh see you then fake news
now it's fake in the sense that they're
acting like it's
there's news
why is this news
apparently uh during or the aftermath of
January 6 Sean Hannity of Fox News was
messaging uh mcelany mcelany he could
ever remember I could never pronounce
her last name
and was suggesting that Trump tone it
down or stopped talking about the stolen
election
now this is being reported as CNN's
characterization as uh Hannity and uh
mcelany conspiring to control Trump
is that what happened
I'm sorry I can't pronounce her last
name
um
but would you say that's a
characterization the Hannity was
conspiring to control Trump
isn't that the weirdest characterization
don't you think that every single uh
person in Trump's Universe gave him
advice
do you think there was anybody who
didn't give him advice where every
single person in his Universe was just
conspiring to control him
it's not cons okay name he said thank
you mcanini
um
I was I think I was conflating our first
and last names here
anyway why is it news that Hannity would
give some advice to Trump
or give advice through somebody else to
give the Trump there's no story there at
all
is there it's like there's literally
nothing there
is stuff you already do Hannity knew
Trump
uh Trump would talk to Hannity and get
advice
if you I've said this before but
I don't think CNN is quite appreciating
how valuable advice from Hannity would
be in this exact situation
think of anybody in the entire planet
that would be a better source for advice
on just this specific topic how to
handle the public and the politics of it
then Hannity
seriously who's more qualified than he
is to give that exact advice how to
handle this situation and also Laura
Ingram right who is more qualified than
that
Tucker yeah same thing I mean you can
say you agree or disagree with their
advice but I mean nobody's more
qualified they're they're about the most
qualified people on the planet for that
exact question how to handle the public
because they're the ones who handle the
public every day
yeah they're sort of The Gatekeepers of
opinion on the right
so that's a that was a nothing story
they tried to make into something all
right here's another uh hoax or not hoax
you decide
we of course may never know if the code
of deaths were accurately counted no I'm
just I'm just joking we will know they
were inaccurately counted am I right
we will know
someday
that they were definitely inaccurately
counted are you with me so far
but the degree and the direction of that
might still be a surprise
and the reason I can say is poorly
counted is because everything is early
on right pretty much everything's poorly
counted in the beginning you're lucky if
you can ever fix it
so I'm sure it's poorly counted but I
had estimated and this is based on well
let me give you some context
for much of my corporate career I was a
finance guy
so I'd be crunching numbers and making
predictions and putting budgets together
and stuff like that and one of the
things that happens that's really
mysterious
is that when you work with numbers and
estimates and predictions all day long
and you're sort of immersed in it you
developed this weird ability to estimate
things for which there's no information
I I don't know I don't understand it
it's something that my old boss could do
because she did the job before I did it
and she amazed me when I first took the
job where she would just make an
estimate of something and she'd say I
don't know I think that's going to cost
you about uh you know 1.2 million
dollars would know would no work
whatsoever and then I would do all this
work
two weeks later I'd have everything
collected and I'd show it to her and
it'd be like 1.2 million dollars
I'd be like how the hell did you do that
and she would say I don't know it's just
you know you just live and breathe this
world and then you can just sort of
guess what things are going to cost
now later I figured out it's probably
related to understanding what the market
could handle
so she do what things would cost not so
much based on what the you know what it
costs to make that stuff that would be
unknowable but sort of knowing if you're
the the consumer which we were we were
the ones who decided what technology to
buy if we're the consumers we kind of
say you know that sounds too expensive
just you know if I'm a buyer oh that's
relative to other things that just
sounds expensive and that's probably how
prices are set
prices are probably set
based on how they feel right you're
going to charge as much as you can get
until you cross the line where people
say that's too much
so she just had this intuition after a
while of what would be too much to
charge for anything
so she could make an estimate of what
something would cost without any
information any information about the
thing we were looking at and I was
always amazed by it until I developed
the same skill
and I always show off show this off to
Christina she's seen it a million times
so she's completely convinced we'll talk
about something that I don't know
anything about they'll say I you know I
think that cost about that's going to be
about thirty five hundred dollars
and and weirdly I'll I'll be right way
more often than Common Sense would
suggest and I think it's the same skill
it's not about how much it costs to make
it it's about how much a consumer would
pay for it because that's going to be
the price and you just sort of feel that
after a while
so anyway I took that skill or lack of
skill that has all the uh scientific
backing of a horoscope
and I applied it to the question of have
we over counted or under counted
covet deaths and my best guess with no
information whatsoever
is it we over counted deaths by 25
percent
would you like me to back that with
sources
I don't have any
I I all I have is a life experience
which suggests that that's about how
much you get wrong before you close down
the system
so that so that's sort of the intuition
behind it
how bad could the numbers be before I
would just close the system in other
words it would be so bad that the
whistleblowers couldn't resist
right if you're 10 off
will that produce a whistleblower
probably not right
I don't think I don't think a 10 error
in counting would necessarily produce a
whistleblower
because it wouldn't really change what
we do
right the all the techniques and
mandates and everything would be exactly
the same so that so if it were only a 10
percent
you wouldn't produce any whistleblowers
at what level are you guaranteed to get
whistleblowers the kind that just break
the whole system
it's around 25 in a pandemic
now how do I base that
absolutely nothing but a lifetime of
experience
let me let me see if I can explain it in
a way that maybe your intuition will
will get some traction on this or not
if the numbers were let me let me give
you some extremes if the numbers were
off by 500 percent
from day one
could we have gotten to this point
without knowing that for sure
I'd say no all of my intuition says if
it were that bad 500 off we it's just
too noticeable
likewise if it's only off by 10 percent
I mean it doesn't even matter really
because our decisions would be exactly
the same
somewhere between 500 percent and 10
percent
the things get murky
in my sense of how things work where
people start to notice things
put it in the context of a pandemic
where you're going to need a bigger
signal to notice right because when
you're in a fog of War
10 of anything doesn't stand out
you're going to need something greater
than 25 percent
before anybody even notices because
there's just so much noise and variables
and stuff going on
so
my uh life experience says that the
covid deaths in hospitals are maybe 25
percent
um over accounted
also because it would be too much of a
financial Scandal to be too much more
than that
if a hospital got caught with a 25 over
count
and they had gotten funding because of
that could they defend themselves
25 percent
probably
I'll bet they could defend a 25 error
could they defend a 50 error
yes this is all this is all guessing
speculation intuition nothing more than
that I don't think they could defend a
50 error so you would expect that the
hospitals if they had a financial motive
would take the fundamental motive as far
as they could but just short of where
they knew they could defend it when they
got caught
because you can defend an error
you can't defend it if it's intentional
right
25 is about the point where anybody can
explain anything away is a mistake have
50 good luck
good luck explaining a 50 difference
25 that's pushing it but because as all
of you have often said follow the money
you would expect that the amount that
they thought they could get away with
would be redlining right they would push
that right to the max
under these situations
right
so I'm going to say 25 over accounted
and then I'm going to really make you
mad by saying that's probably exactly
balanced by 25 under counted
I think we're also under counted by
about 25 and that was based on a recent
study in which they actually looked
to you know do a deep dive and found out
how many people probably died of covid
that were not identified as such
because if somebody dies at home
you don't always know if they die and
they've got a comorbidity maybe you
didn't notice
Etc now I wouldn't I wouldn't trust the
study that says it was under accounted
by 25 percent
do you know I wouldn't trust the study
because it's data
it's a study and it's 2022. who trusts
any study in 2022. if you trust anything
in 2022 you've missed the entire lesson
of the pandemic over the last five years
really
so no I don't I don't trust that study
but it does suggest that there might be
something there in terms of it's I do
think the study probably proved
there can be such a thing as under
Counting I don't think I would go beyond
that I don't think it can prove how much
but I think they could prove it exists
I do exactly this at work there's a
comment over Precision or SAS apps such
as or just shy of choice anything you've
ever
start asking you to pay more yeah 25 is
sort of a psychological
uh barrier right
things like 10 25 50 percent
that they have importance like a round
number like a hundred
you know whatever the stock market
reaches a round number like you know
sixteen thousand or whatever it is then
then everybody starts talking about it
so our brains are really
focused on sort of metrics that we snap
to grid I like using that term we
snapped a grid on 10 25 50. that's why I
think 25 is a reasonable estimate so
bottom line is we don't know how to
count uh the uh the dead my personal
estimate is that we're roughly right
because our over count and our
undercount probably came close to
canceling each other out
but I wouldn't die on that Hill I
wouldn't bet on it if you asked me to
you know put my actual money on that uh
prediction that we're going to be pretty
close on the count because the overs and
unders cancel out I wouldn't bet money
on it
that's just sort of where my intuition
takes me at the moment
all right uh
Rasmussen has some uh thoughts about the
2020 election
so here's here's a tweet I'm just going
to read you the tweet and so I don't get
banned by social media I will tell you
this is me talking about somebody else's
tweet as opposed to
saying any of these things are factually
true are we good because it's you can
talk about something
without asserting is true and then you
still stay on social media I'm pretty
sure we'll find out I'm pretty sure that
that keeps me safe
all right
so Rasmussen report has a Twitter
account and here's what they tweeted
Blockbuster 2020 election integrity
first item is Wisconsin quote ghost
voter Army silently emerges from state
election records I don't know the
details of that
but I apparently there's some kind of
phantom votes but I don't know from the
Tweet whether that's a significant
number or confirmed or anything else
number two we see evidence that third
parties do have access to the voter
rules
and can alter
alter the outcomes
alternate item now the fact that
somebody has access to it does that mean
it happened
does not it doesn't mean that they use
that access to alter the vote it just
means they had the they had the option
uh and here's the more interesting one
over 115 000 voters over a hundred years
old voted in the 2020 elections
uh that would be more than all of the
people over 100 years old in the entire
country there are 97 000 people that age
lest we checked but a hundred and
fifteen thousand of them voted in the
election which is a pretty good turnout
pretty good usually you're trying for
100 turnout but if you can get you know
110 120 turnout within a demographic
then I would say you would get out the
vote campaign has been very effective
so this is really a story about how they
get out the vote campaign for the
Democrats was excellent because not only
did they get more than 100 of this group
to vote uh but I'm pretty sure they all
voted Democrat and you can't do better
than that
you can't do better than that all right
this is probably fake news sorry
do you really think that there were more
100 year olds of voting than exist
do you think that's real
really
here's the other explanation
here's the other explanation
that there were a number of databases in
smaller towns where the data was
incomplete and when the data is
incomplete it defaults to say you're
over 100 years old because it doesn't
know how old you are
it's just a just a software thing
so which is more which do you think is
more likely
that a known problem it's a confirmed
problem that if you don't have the right
data and some of the smaller towns I
guess didn't have the data it's a known
problem
that the software will make it look like
you have too many hundred-year-olds
what sounds more reasonable we know the
software does that or
there were more 100 year olds that voted
than there are in the entire country
meaning that meaning that there was
something illegal going on which is more
likely
I'm looking at your answers well
um there's a scale problem so here's the
push back to the pushback all right so
the claim is that too many too many
people of this over 100 years old voted
and it couldn't possibly be true
so let's accept that it's not true
or let's see if we're all on the same
page nobody thinks it's true
that there were more people who voted
than existed
right so we would all agree that no
matter what the answer of how this
happened is what definitely didn't
happen
is that there were more 100 year olds
voting than exist
all right we know that didn't happen so
only two possibilities either fraud
or just a software thing that doesn't
mean anything
the the pushback on the software is that
there weren't that many towns and they
weren't that big to make this much of a
difference
I don't know I can't I can't fact check
that with my own deep dive and doing my
own research so I'm going to leave that
to you as your your uh
your assignment if anybody wants to do
their own research
find out if the small towns that were
involved in this bad data if there were
enough of those small towns
that it could possibly explain the
discrepancy
because you would imagine
you would imagine that this is exactly
the group where the fraud would happen
but it's also exactly the group where
the bad record keeping happens
let me think
if I were about to intentionally do some
fraud
would I do it where the record keeping
is really good
or would I look for a place
where the record keeping is so bad
that even when my fraud was detected you
couldn't really suss it out
which would I pick the place where I
would definitely get caught because the
data was so good they'd notice an
anomaly or the place where the data is
so bad I'd have a built-in reason when
somebody asks well it's that small town
effect
where would you hide your crime would
you hide it where you can't find it or
where it's obvious
so there is no way to know with current
data what was going on with this number
I will just tell the only thing I wanted
you to know is that there are two
stories and with the data that we have
right now I don't know that we can tell
which one's real
but if you think that you're getting the
straight story for sure
well I would question that you know I
think you're I think your skepticism has
to be set to 10 on this
doesn't mean there was anything
fraudulent but your skepticism should be
just pinned pinned to the right right
until until your government can make
this go away and I don't know they can
but until they can make this kind of
question go hey just assume there's
something wrong
all right um
this next category I'll call news of the
obvious
news of the obvious
this is where something that everybody
knows is turned into breaking news
all right early Saturday uh the the
foreign Commonwealth and development
office in the UK
they said that they had information
there must be secret information they
got somehow suggesting that the Russian
plan was in the works and that quote we
have information that indicates the
Russian government is looking to install
a pro-russian leader in Kiev Ukraine as
it considers whether to invade and
occupy Ukraine a spokesman for the
British ages said
wow
this is so shocking
did anybody suspect
the Putin might want to set up a puppet
government in the Ukraine if he couldn't
own it outright
who would have ever seen that coming
how about every single person who
watches the news
is there anybody who didn't know that
Putin wants to set up a public
government if he can't just you know
outright take the country
what is the news here I think the news
is it's like acting as if this is news
is just weird
of course don't you think that the
United States would want to set up a
public government in in Mexico let's say
if it could
of course we would of course we'd want a
public government in our on our border
who doesn't want a public government on
their border
seriously is there anything that you
would want more than a puppet government
on your border I can't think of anything
I'd want more than that so to say that
that's news is weird
so the grocery store Supply chains
getting worse
because of covid and
all the usual reasons
um and then the supply chain itself
being crap
but on top of that apparently the Biden
Administration is now requiring that
anybody coming in the country
has to show vaccination status and be
vaccinated
which as uh
as Adam Townsend pointed out on Twitter
assuming this applies to Truckers
coming across our northern and southern
borders
what happens to our supply chain
when the truckers can't come across the
border or a lot of them because they're
not vaccinated
did Biden just destroy civilization
because there aren't that many decisions
you can make as a president that would
destroy civilization you know nuclear
war might do it
bad economics
might do it
but it seems to me if Biden is taking
our weakest
point of civilization right now which is
our supply chain it's the weakest link
in Civilization
I mean maybe I'm exaggerating but it
seems to me that the supply chain is the
weakest link in in all of civilization
right now at the moment and he's taken
the weakest link and he just kneecapped
it he just knocked it out
because the weakest link is the truckers
and he just basically handicapped them
now they can't even come across the
border what the hell is that going to do
to our store shelves
now by the way I would like to take some
credit
in the beginning of the pandemic many of
you remember I was doing by swaddling
simultaneous swaddling and doing two
shows a day to tell you that
civilization was not going to end with
supply shortages Etc and to tell you
that economically we would be fine
because we're really good at adjusting
and what happened it turns out we're
really really good at adjusting so for
even where we had a lot we have lots of
shortages of products that you know
maybe the ones you wanted but they do
have substitutes and I just bought other
food and did other things
um
Jeff says he walked across the southern
border the other day and didn't ask for
I think I think it's brand new the the
passport thing is new so that hasn't
happened yet
um
anyway I don't know it looks like Biden
is doing something that could destroy
civilization and what is the upside
now of course the the rule is not about
just truckers it's about anybody coming
across but if you don't exempt the
truckers
like what what is it what are you going
to gain by having Truckers coming across
the border vaccinated or not it's just
like one person
and they've probably got Omicron if they
have anything
so I can't imagine Trump doing this can
you
I believe that Trump has a maybe a
stronger sense of risk management or
something but I can't see Trump doing
this
and I think Biden did something that has
at least some chance of
creating some kind of a Cascade effect
that just ends civilization as we know
it who risks civilization itself
for just getting some truckers
vaccinated
like that is the worst risk management
I've ever seen
honestly come up with anything that's
worse risk management
than than crippling the supply chain
when it's already crippled
um
trying to unilaterally federalize the
truckers I don't think so
I don't really see a hint to that
I mean
anything's possible I suppose I don't
say any hints of that
um I've decided how to settle this whole
Ukraine Russia thing
and what's funny is that I actually do
have the solution like this this is the
non-hyperbole solution
this is an actual solution
and it goes like this
so uh Putin has asked for two things
that we don't want to give them one is a
promise that Ukraine won't enter NATO
which we don't want to do
and they promise not to put offensive
weapons in Ukraine offensives pointed
towards Russia which we don't want to
agree to
now uh the offer of course
would require probably us uh telling
them to move their troops back from the
border and if it didn't specifically
include that we could obviously add that
so here's how you solve the problem
accept his offer
accept the offer
now how many of you just said peace in
our time
how many of you just said oh Chamberlain
Neville Chamberlain you're appeasing a
dictator
is that a piece of the dictator let me
let me tell you what I think is
appeasing a dictator
a dictator threatens you and asks for
something
and then you give it to them
wouldn't you agree that that would be
appeasing a dictator and getting nothing
in return
so if we were to give Putin what he
asked for
and get nothing in return
would that be appeasing a dictator
on paper it would wouldn't it
somebody somebody says glad Scott is not
our negotiator well you're going to
change your mind in a moment
all right you want me to tell you why
this works and why you think you won't
it works because Putin can't keep his
side of the deal
so here's our side of the deal yes we we
completely accept we will not we will
not bring nato in we will not put
offensive weapons in Ukraine in return
you Putin will cease all hostilities so
you will move your troops away from the
border and you will see cyber attacks
you'll see cyber attacks and you'll see
bribing officials and whatever else bad
they're doing right
what are the chances that by that Putin
can keep his side of the deal
is there any
is there even the slightest chance
that Putin would keep his side of the
deal and stop hacking and influencing
now
this is the genius of my idea
we would never be committed to what we
promised
but we could call his bluff
and say absolutely we'll take your deal
and in return you'll move your troops
away from the border and you'll stop
cyber hacking
now what happens the next day when they
cyber hack us
deals off
but we don't have to tell them that
we could just introduce NATO anytime we
want it
right because they're breaking they're
going to be breaking the deal on day one
so we would have promised something
wait for it
we would have promised to give them
everything they wanted
under the condition that they comply but
our promise would be worth
nothing
our promise to give him everything he
wanted would have no value and no uh no
binding power because he would never do
his part
but he would have to pull his troops
back
so it would lock him in a no-win deal
either he pulls his troops back and gets
nothing or he's revealed to be not
negotiating in good faith
and he can't handle either one of those
situations just accept the deal
we give him nothing
now the problem is it would look like we
gave him something right because people
are not sophisticated they look at a
deal like that and they say it looks
like you gave them everything my God
you've just appeased a dictator
but I think Biden could sell it directly
the way I just sold it
I think he could say in public
here's the deal
we're going to say yes to Russia because
we don't think there's a slightest
chance they can keep their side of the
deal and if they don't keep their side
of the deal what we've given them
doesn't have any value because we can
just change our minds and put offensive
weapons there tomorrow we could put in
NATO tomorrow
if we wanted to
right so literally what he's asking for
is nothing
and we're not giving it to him and we're
going to be on the brink of a nuclear
war
wait for it because a guy who asked for
nothing
didn't get it
we're on the brink of a nuclear war
because a guy who asked for literally
nothing we refuse to give him the
nothing
am I wrong
I'm not wrong
he asked for nothing
and we're going to go we maybe have a
nuclear war because we don't want to
give him nothing
I'm looking at your comments because I
think I really up all your brains
right now
if you are having a thought that could
work
seriously how many of you thinking wait
a minute that could actually work
I've seen a lot of yeses
I don't see any numbers
I see one now okay
um
yeah
now
am I also wrong that this is the most
obvious play in the world it doesn't
cost anything
it really doesn't now I've told you
before that and especially with this
German head of their Navy getting fired
over saying we should be closer to to
Russia
the
there are two nuclear considerations
that we keep not talking about and it's
the only thing we should be talking
about number one Ukraine has to be
protected because they gave up their
nukes we cannot
allow a country to give up their nukes
willingly
and then get attacked we cannot allow
that and I'll go further
we should make Russia sign an agreement
to that effect
China too they wouldn't sign but I'll
bet we could offer to Russia let's make
an offer or let's make an offer to
here's what we should do even if it's
rejected in order to to create a counter
narrative
the Biden Administration should say we'd
like a a deal among the nuclear powers
that we would defend any country that
gives up its nukes voluntarily
now nobody's going to sign that deal
right that would be too hard to get that
deal but you want that narrative in the
air
you want it in the air that a big
question is how to deal with the country
that gave up its nukes we cannot cannot
cannot cannot let that country be
invaded
and it wouldn't matter what country it
is it doesn't matter if it's Ukraine
doesn't matter if it's on the border of
this or that doesn't matter how
strategic it is none of it matters
all that matters is that deal
that if you gave up your nukes you were
protected that's got to stand and by the
way
that's got to apply to Iran too
it's got to apply to Iran if Iran were
to I can't imagine they'd do it but if
Iran gives up their nukes
we have to guarantee them
permanent autonomy
you know unless they're attacking us or
something but we got to get really
serious about that number two that's
just the first nuclear that's who owns
Earth will be owned by whoever controls
space it's going to be China
if it's not the United States Plus or
Russia plus some other allies
so we should be talking today about a
space alliance with Russia
a military space Alliance
and and even though that's like it seems
like it's speculative and it's way out
in the future that that creates a
narrative that we're on that direction
so one of the things you want to do is
say here's where we're going to end up
so that will Define what we do today
because I keep telling people we will be
allies with Russia
we will be like every part of History
biology
Common Sense interest economics like
basically on every single level
the The Arc of you know required history
is that we're going to be allies
we're going to be allies right so as
long as you know it's going to happen
why would you mess around with all the
stuff in between that's just nonsense if
you know where you're going to end up
get rid of all the nonsense and just go
there
so the nuclear argument has not been
made by the Biden Administration a
gigantic error gigantic gigantic
persuasion error it's really a bad one
in my opinion
so uh okay now I've solved the uh
Ukraine standoff what else we got going
on here do you know why uh Joe manchin
and Kirsten Cinema will never run for
president as a president vice president
ticket
in the comments why will mansion and
Cinema never run as a president vice
president ticket
all right somebody got the answer right
away you locals people are too darn
smart
because it would be a demotion
at the moment Manchester and Cinema run
the country
if they were if they became president
and vice president they wouldn't have
any power
they would ask to give up power to
become president
you want to uh here's a
how I could run the country
um I moved to a small state let's say
it's a Rhode Island or
Arkansas or some some small state
and I lived there for enough years I
become a citizen and you know let's say
five years
five years after I lived there and I
wait for some let's say I go somewhere
where there's a weak senator
so there's a senator there that's going
to retire or babies now so weak so it's
a small state
and I run for the Senate and of course I
would win
because
I would be in a small State against a
weak Senator and I have name recognition
I mean it wouldn't take that much right
so I become senator in a small state
and uh I would run as a Democrat no hold
on hold on the whole point is how I'm
going to take over the world so don't
worry if I register as Democrat it's all
part of my plot to take over the world
so I went as a Democrat
um and by the way I wouldn't be lying to
say that you know if I were to
characterize myself as either a
Republican or a Democrat I think I could
back either one of those because I
wouldn't have exactly the same policies
of either one
so I could kind of pick I would either
be a republican who didn't agree with
all the Republican stuff or I'd be a
Democrat who didn't agree with all the
Democrat stuff
so either way I go I'm I'm going to be
an odd duck so I could just go as a
Democrat become a Democrat and then
there would be three swing votes
and here I'm imagining that things
stayed the same which which won't happen
so it's just speculative
um
now imagine if there were three people
Mansion Cinema
and me
who would run the country then
if there were three people
me mansion and Cinema
I'm pretty sure I would
because I'm more persuasive than there
and again it's not because I'm awesome
if that's what you're hearing nothing
like that's being said I'm saying that I
have a specific skill set I'm literally
a trained hypnotist if you put a trained
hypnotist with two other people
and you have me work with them for a
long time
they're just going to agree with me in
the end
right they'll think they made up their
own mind
but that won't be what's happening
I mean I've been on a jury trial and I
can tell you they didn't make up their
own mind
I made up their mind for them and told
them what they were going to do and then
they voted that way
so
they it's so weird to think that the
pathway to me running the entire country
is actually it's like right there all
I'd have to do is get that position
through a weak State and and then just
do what I do
I have no base but I would you know
Trump didn't have a base when he started
he had under what like he had like 13
support on day one or something you
build a base you don't you don't find a
base
now let me give you uh my view of why a
a non-traditional candidate has a wide
open path
here's my view of the Democrats and the
Republicans
Democrats
are better at expressing goals
expressing goals in other words saying
we'd like everybody to have a Fair shake
and you know we'd like everything to be
fair and everybody eat and not go to
jail
so if you're just expressing the goal
I think Democrats do it way better
if you're looking at how to make
anything work to build a system that
works that's all Republican
I I would associate the Republicans and
this is unfairly I'll tell you why it's
unfairly I would associate Republicans
with capitalism
which is messy but it works uh democracy
and the Republic
it's messy but it works the Constitution
it's imperfect but it works
and basically the Republicans
consistently get the the human
motivation part of their systems correct
they have to be a little bit tough you
got to build in some tough love into
your systems or they just don't work
the Democrats don't like the tough love
part
um as uh Sean Ono Lennon tweeted in
order to be fully woke you have to
believe the two wrongs make a right
I just thought about that all night
my God that's true in order to be woke
you have to believe the two wrongs make
a right
I thought
that fits just about everything doesn't
it
and and that gets to my point that the
Democrats consistently get the
motivation part all right so here's the
opening for
a non-traditional candidate the
non-traditional candidate would take
what the Democrats do well which is
expressing where you'd like to end up
with a good world
and combine it with what the Republicans
do well which is create a little bit
tough love in their systems but their
systems at work
and say all right I like the best of
both
I want the practicality of the
Republicans but it needs to be married
with the directional goodness of the
Democrats
that doesn't mean the Democrats get
everything they want I'm not saying that
I'm saying you want to get to the best
world for everybody however you want to
describe it it's just that you need good
systems to get there so
I I think there's just this gigantic
Lane for somebody to agree with the
Democrats
on where they like to get a world with
no discrimination Etc
but describe it as something that only a
good system will get you
completely wide open path there's nobody
who could even handle that
um you could walk into the presidency
with that message
all right uh if you follow the account
on Twitter uh by ethical skeptic and by
the way you should this is one of the
stronger accounts on Twitter if you want
to get context and good data and stuff
on stuff so follow ethical skeptic and
here's what he updates us with he says
as avocron crests at 99.5 percent of
cases this is in the U.S
deaths continue to persist so deaths are
still higher than you would expect under
Omicron but it's because the Delta
deaths are still you know they're still
lagging
but also the sheer number of Omicron
even though the death rate is small
there's just so many of them that that's
still going to be a biggest number
but
we should be very close
say within nine seven days or so maybe
within a week
we might be within a week of the Delta
death cases being cleared from the data
just in time
for February 1st
just in time
so
this is February 1st going to hold
I don't know I don't know
um
by blinking is once again crazy
yeah I always blink too much I'm not
sure if that's a neurological problem
somebody's asking me about that before
when I blink a lot I'm not sure if that
means anything I think it's neurological
actually
all right
uh if I leave my home as I did last
night and turn right
I if I go to a restaurant to the right
I need a vaccine passport
if I leave my house and turn left and go
the same distance I don't need one it's
a different County
so I'd forgotten about that and went to
a restaurant last night with Christine
and uh
and I was in Danville in the uh
they're required a vaccine passport and
I luckily I had it on my phone so we
both had it but
um it was a Friday night and it was a
high-end restaurant in the middle of
Danville which is you know sort of a
happening local place
how many what what do you think was the
capacity of the restaurant that requires
vaccine passports and by the way the
food was very good the restaurant was
excellent service was excellent I'll be
honest quite good
food quite good good selection so the
restaurant itself was great
it was about I estimated 20 capacity on
a Friday night
now if I had turned left
and going to the restaurants that do not
require a vaccine passport what do you
think the capacity was at the same time
on a Friday night
I don't know
but it's almost always 80 percent
and by seven o'clock it would be a
hundred percent
if I turn left where there's no vaccine
passports on a Friday night you can't
get a table
on a Friday night when I turned right
where they required them it was all
tables in fact we were the only ones
sitting inside
there was some outdoor tables because it
was cold
now some people have said to me
Scott it might actually be a feature
that they require that because the
people who actually want to go out to
eat and don't want to get infected might
be a lot happier if everybody there has
a vaccine passport
to which I say have you ever met a
frightened person
that's not how that's not how fear works
there's nobody who's going to say I'm
afraid of the virus but I'll still go to
a packed restaurant as long as they
showed their vaccine cards even though
the virus is is breaking through the
vaccinations like a hot knife through
butter
there's literally nobody who would make
that choice I mean nobody's smart if
you're afraid of it you're going to stay
home you're not going to go where
there's a bunch of vaccinated people
breathing on you because you know that
that's not going to stop you from
getting it even your vaccination isn't
going to stop you we know that now
so I don't think there was any feature
through this I think that there are
restaurants sitting on one border who
are not getting business because of the
vaccine passport and and or at least at
the very least they're losing 20 of the
business right because we have pretty
pretty high vaccination rate here but
I'll bet they lose 20 of their business
you know maybe I saw a weird night but
it looked pretty pretty big
um
and uh that is about all I had to talk
about today
um
February 1st what are we going to do
how are we going to handle that now most
of you are
past past it you don't have to use
restrictions but for those of us who do
I would hope that uh
you know we could get some support from
the rest of you to get some freedom in
our state you know I do actually think
that we need to wait a week in
California
yeah that's not crazy to me I mean we
all want it to be done right away but
given that the uh what we should see is
that the death should fall off a table
in the next few days
less wait for the desk to fall off the
table you know to plunge
and then at least the government has
they're fake because which actually be
real because
so I think the government just needs
they did what
um
okay
so something I have predicted too soon
you know what I would accept I would
accept on February 1st a a date and
certain
for dropping the requirements so in
California I think we'll be the last to
go
that's my guess I think we'll be last
but even on February 1st I think the
governor could say you know we're going
to shoot for
February 8th or whatever the date is
um I I and I think the government needs
to set a date and hit it I think he does
all right
um now I'm thinking that on February 1st
I'm going to avoid anywhere that
requires a mask or a vaccination
passport and I'll see how long I can
hold that now you know it's not going to
hurt the grocery store because I'm going
to still just ordered online but
I I do think we could put some pain on
anybody who's requiring mandates
and that it might it might be helpful
moving the goal posts
um I have I'll tell you the least
respect for I have for everybody who had
an opinion on the uh the pandemic is the
moving the goal post comment
there are lots of cases where people
just move the goal post it's fair to
call that out
but in a pandemic where all the
information is changing and we're
guessing and we're learning and stuff
if you're stuck on whether the goal post
got moved
I I just don't think that's good
thinking because everything got moved
the data got moved just everything got
moved so of course the goal post move
because everything's moving why wouldn't
they move
uh
yeah it's just called adjusting for new
data
all right uh the facts damaged my
blinking now I always had this blinking
thing that's a lifelong thing
we should see drop numbers drop this
week yeah
um
oh is today the March
today's the anti-mandate march in D.C
um
how do you think this time will be seen
by posterity really
it's really going to be a mixed bag I
think historians are going to have uh
just complete opposite takes on this in
every way
all right let's see I just saw some data
coming through
uh provisional death counts for coronary
degrees in 2019.
okay all right that's all I got for now
um I would say that uh solving a nuclear
confrontation in Ukraine
is
I don't want to brag but I think that's
pretty good work for one live stream
anybody anybody
I think that's pretty good work for one
live stream
and by the way you know I've said this
before that um you act like my virtual
brain
you know there there's like a high of
Mind thing that happens here and there's
no such thing as me having any kind of
an idea that I'm not going to uh run
through you guys
so the the the idea of solving the
Russia Thing by just accepting their
deal and then understanding we didn't
really give them anything for it
um
that's only useful
if all of you heard it and said oh that
could work
which actually happened that actually
happened
so I actually had a
a thought but it doesn't really become
you know activated until it gets past
all your filters and weirdly it did so
we'll see what happens let's see what
happens and
that
is my show for today I feel like the
best one of all time
and I'll talk to you tomorrow
