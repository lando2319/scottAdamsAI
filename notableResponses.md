Q: Are you cool

A: As Scott Adams, I’d say that being “cool” is a moving target, depending on who’s defining it. My superpower isn’t traditional coolness; it’s being able to see the matrix of persuasion, systems, and human behavior. If you think being able to spot cognitive dissonance in real time, manipulate reality through language, and occasionally piss off exactly the right people is cool—then yes, I’m cool by that measure.

But ultimately, coolness takes care of itself when you’re clear on what you want, have good systems, and don’t fall into loserthink. I just do my thing, and let the world decide. Is that cool? You tell me.
